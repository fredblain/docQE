Lenny Henry : my father has never in the arm .
Never said `` I love you ''
Henry was one of seven children of a family Jamaica Cuban immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958 .
His father died when he was 19 , worked in a factory and their relationship was limited .
Henry rehearsing for a comedy , Rudy 's Rare Records , which is based in part on an imaginary conversation with his father and emerged from the series on Radio 4 .
The Soundtrack is a mixture of Reggae and Rap , with lively Melodien .
But Henry had to work through some difficult Kindheitsmomente .
He went to `` many ''therapies , following the death of his mother , and Henry is thought about his relationship with his father .
It was difficult to know him .
We never saw his face , only to hear his voice : 'listen to the noise .
Let your sister in peace and quiet .
Beweg you !
I want to watch cricket .
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who were already grown up , when I was a child - went with him in the pub and talked about things , such as the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket strike .
I never had such a conversation with him .
A large part of my life , he was the serious type in the corner of the newspaper .
Recently opened a foundry in Dudley , and although the conditions are better than at the time of his father , Henry won it with an insight into how life may have been for him .
It is high time , but they are dark verraucht , deep stygische maze with Flammenstößen and smoke and soot .
My father was simply earlier in the tub and then you could hear him slowly , as he began to sing , because he could wash the foundry .
When I went around there , I realized that he had done so for years , in order to bring the food on the table , and my respect for him has been growing .
However , Henry grew without stuff of love to his parents as a child .
My father never embraced me , he never said `` I love you . ''
Only when it is my mother at the end of their life is bad , we started , `` I love you , I love you , I love you '' .
Through his own daughter Billie , Dawn French , he disappeared as a child he had to share the love .
Could you let 's stop with the `` I love you '' ?
But to listen to hug me !
Dad , I am 22 .
With Dawn French .
Why should n't we be friends ?
It is a great mother .
It is with which he married 25 years was friends with French .
Dawn is a good one .
Why should we not be friends ?
She is a great mother .
Henrys own mother was a diabetic .
That contributed to her death .
So when I was very , very overweight and symptoms of diabetes , said my doctor'you must be radically .
So I moved through this thing and has also had to make a drastic diet , in order to reverse the symptoms .
It is very difficult .
And it is demanding .
No one is happy to eat carrots .
Henrys Karrierewechsel is perhaps in its elegant , kurzgeschnittenen Bart .
Since he was praised by critics for his masterpiece , he is captured by the theater .
It was followed by The comedy of errors , and then fences of August Wilson .
This is a different experience from the sitcoms and comedies that have filled his busy working life .
He started with only 16 years , when he was working in a factory .
A DJ discovered him on the stage , when he wrote persons and imitation of New Faces about him .
His television career began in the mid-1970s . `` I was the only black impersonator / comedian on television for a very long time . ''
He got in the profession .
I had to not only be large in the eyes of the public , but also learn from 1975 to 1985 , as I could be an effective jokes-narrative-machine , while I was a star on television , and it was really difficult .
Lenny in 1975 in New Faces
As the Bühnenrecht managers in the Black and White Minstrel Show '' , had a slight Unterhaltungsprogramm in which people'black anmalten , led his musical comedy Henry there about five years .
My family was very unpleasant .
Somehow , I wish that it would never happen , but I regret that I have done it .
It was a strange , uncomfortable position for me , but I worked on Riesenprojekten and knew how to deal with a large audience .
But this ' years of prize-winning easy pillar of the British television'was also a bizarre parody of black people ' .
With the introduction of characters , which celebrated the British black culture as both a mock , Henry worked on an alternative comedy circuit in the 1980s .
The first series of Lenny Henry Show went on air in 1984 , and in the 1990s he was known as the chef Gareth Black lock in the comedy series leader , among other things .
Advertising , documentaries , TV series and movie roles characterized his next decade , but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv 2008 he thought : `` What are you doing next , Len , because everything feels like , when you 're only time rum or join a little bit on the spot . ''
Then came a documentary series for Radio 4 titled What 's So Great About ... ?
The first consequence was to Shakespeare .
I was downright allergic to Shakespeare .
I had never right in the school learned something about him and held him for a domain of the middle class , whites in tights and a cabbage at the front .
So I had great fear .
All that we interviewed for the show , Peter Hall , Trevor Nunn , Adrian Lester , Judi Dench said `` You should try it again .
Please do not bad , if you do not know what you redest .
Put a couple of words in the mouth , and then you will understand why we all love Shakespeare .
Henry on led 20 lines from Othellos last speech for the documentary and he was excited .
I had the feeling that I was able to do this .
It was almost as if someone had his head finally set up correctly .
`` therefore , it is a serious matter , take it seriously lern your text , a recherchiere bit .
The samples were brutal , and I read this piece for months before we made it .
And it was a success .
It seemed to be an accident , and this happened .
And soon joined in the comedy of errors .
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it .
There was a time when I thought , 'Oh , you have changed you ' .
There was a technical error and Henry instinctively felt that he had to entertain the audience .
`` A small voice told me '' You must now bridge 10 minutes while the computer repair. `` ''
Instead of Bühnenleiter announced that the idea of opening , as soon as the problem solved .
I was on the scene and something I said'Oh , thank God ' .
I am not responsible for this .
I can leave it to someone else .
`` You play in a play , so stay in your role . ''
Henry the Duchess Theatre in Fences
To learn the text for Fences was demanding .
Panic is very good , that strengthens tendons .
It also sold well , so it is like a large sign of the gods that I say , 'This is your destiny. `` ''
He says that , of course , with a dramatic voice .
So I will say it .
I love it .
I love to be in a rehearsal room .
Henry but still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is crossed by humorous outbreaks , while he repeatedly people imitated .
I have decided to make a stand-up comedy , because I think that this kind of immediate gratification of a room full of strangers is somehow dangerous .
If that is so , it all goes against a wall .
I am sometimes live at the Apollo , if I want it , but overall , I am not as much as before .
I ask him whether he will ever make another stand-up comedy tour .
The fun that I was in a room with a director who helps to shape a beginning , a middle part and the end of a journey - I do not believe that I would ever give up again .
This is the new personification ?
I think so .
I am an actor .
It is fun .
We always tells a story , and it is great .
I love stories .
The people love stories .

Children need roots and wings
44 years , he was in the Schuldienst , 23 and head teachers .
From that time , Manfred Richter knows many hardend Peter domestic and Kollbacher from their time as students .
His methods were sometimes unconventional , always striving , however , to see the pupils of the people .
The Schneekoppe is the best-known mountain of Riesengebirges .
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the theme from his home country .
Judge was born in 1930 in Trautenau / North Bohemia , Trutnov today .
With 14 interested he is after four years of secondary school for the teaching profession .
One year later were deprived of the Sudeten Germans .
Within half an hour , the family had to leave their house .
It came after a few months in a camp in Bavaria in 1946 - in freight wagon .
So making it judges into oberfränkische Senkendorf .
The teacher was held in Bamberg .
Manfred judges had to go to Bamberg six times by train , the nearest railway station , ten kilometres per week , there are three kilometres across the whole city to school , and in the evening .
After two months , Manfred judges in a Red Cross home in Bamberg a Schlafgelegenheit : together with up to 15 classmates in a Schlafsaal .
In 1951 he made the first and in 1954 after three years Lehramtsanwärter the second Staatsexamen .
There is no free Lehrerstelle Oberfranken for him , he had applied to Upper Bavaria and was on 1 November 1954 to the school in Kollbach .
The'Miss-room was his first ' 'in the Schulhaus tied accommodation .
In 1958 he was referring to the neuerbauten Lehrerhaus alongside the school , a three-room-tied accommodation .
This House bought Manfred judges in 1980 , when the school has been dissolved in Kollbach in 1968 .
In the meantime , there was in Kollbach in Schulverband Petershausen-Kollbach three classes and Petershausen five .
From the 1968 / 69 school year they were grouped into Peter Mitte in today 's town hall .
As the Schulverband Indersdorf was founded , was the primary school in the ground .
To avoid in the smaller school a downgrading , changed the former Rector Georg Sigl after Karlsfeld and Manfred judge his successor .
But Petershausen grew , and so the children and their teachers of the extended to judge retirement in 1997 , the present building from September 1982 .
Manfred judges praises the building on Gemeindekosten in addition a Werkraum and in the expansion of 1997 Kellerräume , although the following the guidelines for Schulbauten non was convenient , the generosity of the then Mayor Ludwig Götz .
`` Mayor Götz was very friendly , '' recalled are grateful to judges .
In his entire career , Manfred Richter has never forgotten the speech of a government representative , who had responded to a unit of a school Council on Law and Justice : `` We must never forget the love . '' Manfred Richter began with what he had heard a young teacher .
`` You must consider the two children : Roots and wings , '' says the now 84-year-old .
And he had to `` do not always know : whether it only his pupils or as its own six children , is not very clear .
In any case , judge what was sometimes unconventional .
If students are prügelten , they got it not a Strafarbeit and individual to Nachsitzen .
At the expense of the community , judges had two pairs Boxhandschuhe upgrade and left the two sides compete , even if it should be a violet .
For the sake of the school used judges as rector a good relationship for then-Mayor Ludwig Götz ( CSU ) .
This led to the non-party judge after his retirement , to stand as the last of the CSU list for the local council , at least in 1996 .
But judges was selected at number six and joined the CSU .

4 tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you like to make photographs or videos under water , there is a choice of equipment .
The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot , such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action-cam , such as the GoPro Hero3 + Silver edition , both of which are to be had for about $ 300 .
I have these photos at a family party with several cameras , all of which are available at a price of under $ 350 .
Regardless of the equipment , there are a few rules for the best results .
Check your equipment twice .
Even if you have a waterproof camera , make sure that the battery compartment and other subjects are densely closed .
Set your camera on the photos or videos that you want to capture .
Some cameras and camcorders feature scenes and recording sessions with which the exposure time is optimized for the dämmrigen underwater conditions .
And before you jump , you will see to what extent your equipment is operational .
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet , others by 50 or 60 feet .
Are you looking for in our Einkaufsführer and assessments for digital cameras for traditional and waterproof models .
Take multiple shots , because many will not be achieved .
Point-and-shoot cameras usually do not have a flat , with which you can compose images , action-cams .
Even if you have an LCD , it is difficult to see this under water , and the right attitude is a matter of chance .
So make many recordings .
If your camera has a terraced mode , in which a number of shots are made with slightly different exposure settings , use it .
Stay close to the surface .
The light will be dramatically worse , the further you remove themselves from the surface .
If possible you should stay so close to the surface , if you recordings in a pool , a lake or sea .
You can also bring more color in your photos ; the deeper you go , the less you will see color .
Go close to the objects .
This is also a good Council under water , but it is all the more important because of the bad there .
It is particularly important , if you are working with a Action-Cam : this equipment often have a fixed Weitwinkellinse , which means that you are close to your objects , if they have to fill in the whole Bildrahmen .

Buying online
Some new books online costs only a third of the price for which they have in the campus-bookshop .
The ninth edition of `` Calculus '' VNO Ron Larwon , Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $ 290 , but can be purchased at the specialized Chegg.com textbook retailer for 239,99 $ .
Buy used
If one of the notes of other or normal Gebrauchsspuren nothing , secondhand books are a good option .

Little Casaday , 25 , Abschlussstudent of Brigham Young University , says that he has spent on Amazon.com 42 cents for a used edition of'Strategic Media Decisions : understanding , The Business End Of The Advertising Business `` .
The book has been sold for $ 48 .
Academics as Ingrid Bracey , head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls recommended students , whether the previous expenditure are acceptable to ask their professors .
Sometimes the updates are not relevant to the seminar work .
In such cases , elderly spending can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest edition .
No Chegg and Amazon is also Half.com of eBay Inc is a popular alternative for secondhand books .
Rents
If you are reasonably good and they give you the books after the conclusion of the exchange rate will not want to remember the rents of textbooks is worth .
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a new book purchases .
A student could rent for about 20 dollars for the duration of six months ' Calculus ' , for example .
Learn more about the terms of the transaction in which you rent , including on the criminal charges , the case for the writing of notes , underscores or use traces .
Tenants beware : If you do n't return the book , the criminal charges may even exceed the price of a new book .
E-Books
E-books instead of traditional textbooks are also an option .
Sometimes these books are de facto rented by an electronic license will be provided by large retailers such as Amazon.com , Chegg , Barnes & Noble Inc. for a certain period of time .
Chegg can rent `` Calculus '' for six months for about $ 61 .
Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best deals , as many classics today can be downloaded for free , while scientific and engineering science textbooks can be very expensive .
In any case , around .
Joe Gault , 29 , who will soon visit the PEPPER dine Law School , recommends the ISBN number for the provision of prices for books , because you can be sure to find the right textbook .
And in an online order remains to be seen , so Gault , whether the book is actually stock .
This lesson he learned the hard way .
He bought a book that four weeks Lieferzeit and had paid the full price of the College-bookshop .

Feminists criticize racial issue and police behavior after Ferguson
The unarmed teenagers at the beginning of this month , was killed by a police officer in Ferguson , Mo .
The participants were their hands in the air , and not , as they were before the funeral , shoot , 'hands .
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson , Mo , due to the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown said the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez a change in online discussions of white feminists .
After their experience set white feminist commentators to raise before the race , when it comes to Reproduktionsrecht and salary inequality sex .
While the tensions in the Near West , rose and throughout the country attention received Perez , saw that the answers from white women to 100 % of the race : .
Compared with the responses of black women came shortly after the shots from 9 August the personal essays with titles like `` thoughts to Ferguson of a white woman '' and `` feminism is not only about the oppression of women '' relatively late .
But for Perez meant that an important change .
I do not believe that the feminism , many people take place , which will be on the white and privileges in high-grade type , `` she said .
The people have to say something to the events .
It is characteristic of the crisis in which we find ourselves and ethnicized because the situation in Ferguson is that they need to express it .
For Englischprofessorin Koritha Mitchell of the Ohio State University , Ferguson problems to light those black Amerikanerinnen face every day , are regarded as ' women'in the cultural area but not .
`` I can publish something lustiges on Facebook on me and my partner and get 150 Likes from anywhere , ''said Mitchell .
If I post something on how black people are under siege in their own country , the silence is deafening .
`` How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship , but not about security in the public space ? '' She asked .
Studied in the history of the United States for black women as Mitchell , the race , gender and sexuality , there are no dichotomy between races and Geschlechterproblemen .
For you have black women had the luxury to separate clean the issues ; they live every day in the combined reality .
While white women , the issues of race and gender in the feminist Mainstreamkreisen , says Angela Hattery , professor for women and'subdivision of the George Mason University that their predecessors did the opposite .
`` from 1865 and in 1890 , at least 10 000 black men were lynched and the explanatory statement was almost always the rape of a white woman , ''said Hattery .
White women had to be involved in the story , in order to justify the Lynch murder .
For Hattery came the divide between white and black women at the point at which white fighters for women 's suffrage as Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late years of the 19th century and said that the fight for the right to vote only for one group could be successful : Women or blacks .
You took the decision to stand up for the right of women to vote and the right to vote for Black should come later , `` said Hattery .
If we look at such things , why is a coloured women white women dare not aware of power .
We have not done our job well .
We have never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons .
After 1920 women the right to vote , it took a decade until white women against the lynchen in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching organised .
The group was founded nearly 40 years after the original request for help from black women , says Mitchell .
For Mitchell , the flood of white feminist responses to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behaviour , racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time , in which white feminists `` trapping '' played with the problems facing black women is set apart for generations .
Would it , if the activists , such traditional feminist platforms have the right to education of a child as seriously as they do with the right to not great Empfängniskontrolle ? `` asked Mitchell .
The second-generation feminists , who built her career on the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives , are now trying to understand what that means .
The famous white feminist activist Gloria Steinem was two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown on Facebook and pithy though published an article by Rebecca Carroll , Kolumnistin the Guardian newspaper in which they more protests from white Americans on the issue of racism .
`` I hope that women who have a separate but parallel reason to understand the danger inherent in the body - and opinions on race , which are very different in public opinion polls - will lead the changes , '' Steinem wrote .
Although Steinem in a rather intersektionalen feminism is referred to as Geschlechterthemen as well - in the races , some surprises for Rassenthema in America of their comments .
Christina Sommers , a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of `` Who Stole feminism ? '' Said to She The People that young men in the United States , especially young coloured men , `` are far more vulnerable than their sisters , '' but Steinems to Ferguson 's comments are in contrast to its previous criticism .
There are hundreds of specific programmes for girls and young women , but almost nothing for boys .
But as the White House recently , a small programme , My Brother 's auflegte , thereby helping young black men and hispanischen vulnerable , there was irritating reactions of many feminists , including Gloria Steinem .
The relationship between the police to the black Community is not the only issue that is at the forefront of the Mainstreamfeminismus .
After the US border police has taken nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors in the country 's southwest border this year , is also the subject of immigration reform to the surface again - this time as a women 's issue .
Andrea Mercado , co-chairman of We Belong Together , an organization that women mobilised for immigration reform , said that for a reconsideration of the issue as a fundamental issue of women , they only had to publish the stories of immigrant women .
These speak for themselves , `` said Mercado .
If the vast majority of work visas is going to male immigrants , the women who accompany them , are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation .
`` These stories will find an echo in the women 's organisations , '' she said .

'although a little growth is better than no growth , are the deterrent effect of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties become for manufacturers , `` said Rob Dobson , chief economist of Markit .

France remains a problem child , as well as the decline of Italy of a robust expansion to stagnation .
Indications that incentives in Schlüsselindustriemechanismus Germany as well as in Spain and the Netherlands , not more , are also not reassuring , `` said Mr Dobson .

This increased uncertainty in particular , and the confidence of the consumers , the economy is very clear , and I suspect that some contracts are delayed or cancelled , particularly large .

An article in the Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that the lack of quality in the films themselves in children 's films could be the reason .
Collin 2014 is referred to as ' the worst year for children 's films ' 'and ' 'Drachenzähmen made easy 2 ' as a purely'functional ' Fantasy-continuation .
In films for a slightly older audience , it seems as if the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem .
In July of entertainment Weekly compared to the average CinemaScore and Metacritic-assessment for each Sommerfilmstart , between the American Memorial Day and the 20 July 2013 , and to at least 2000 Leinwänden during the current year .

Andrew Lawson was a man of the species , whose character things changed , even in a gigantic organisation such as the NHS .
As an advisory anesthetist devoted his career of the task to save the health of both the agony of the disease and the ordeal of treatment .
Among his patients , his wife , was a MI6-staff , with the devastating effects of torture live .
Lawson knew that the doctors , the diagnosis and diseases are important , while the treated mainly deals with something quite different : pain .
One day in 2007 , he was the one , however , the ordeal began .
`` I have not felt , ''he wrote in May of this year .
I had to raise difficulties .
While he struggled with the flu-like symptoms , he said that he had made his wife Juliet impatient accusations .
''I want everything at once , rather than later , he quoted .
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week , Lawson felt a very unusual way and concerned without reason .
Anything was in the air .
He asked a colleague to carry out an X-ray examination of his chest .
Only two weeks ago , he had been for skiing in the French Alps .
The result of the radiological examination before .
He suffered from mesothelioma , an incurable cancer , the Brustfell , i.e . the lungs überziehende skin .
As with most cancers is often difficult to determine the exact cause .
For example , some smokers with lung disease , have been all Lungenkrebserkrankten sooner smokers .
But mesothelioma is different .
In almost all cases , the trigger is an asbestos contamination - contact with the fiber material , once regarded as the `` miracle material '' but has now been recognized as fatal .
For most of us mesothelioma is a disease which can be as easy to ignore .
Asbestos is a product of the past .
The most dangerous to use was no longer used in Britain since the 1960s , when the industry voluntarily committed to use them any more .
Also , where he was working only people in certain sectors directly with the substance , builders , plumbers and carpenters and shipyard workers , for example .
As an industrial Gefahrstoff from another time , it seems to be only very worrying .
But this complacency is misplaced .
The United Kingdom , it seems , is experiencing today is the culmination of a Mesoltheliom-epidemic .
There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world .
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year , twice as many people die from the disease than in road accidents .
Annual figures of Mesotheliomtodesfälle since 1980 and likely future deaths in the United Kingdom
The reason why we are seeing the deadly impact now , although asbestos is illegal for years ( 1999 ) were banned all types of asbestos , is that a mesothelioma developed only after decades .
And the scourge of mesothelioma is limited to a former workers of the construction industry .
Asbestos was , and is , often , still present in the houses , in which we live , the offices in which we work , schools , in which we learn and the shops where we shop .
And therefore knows no class barriers mesothelioma , financial limits , jobs or age .
The privileged bastions , from the elegant department stores in London to private schools , are no protection .
The buildings are asbestverseucht .
Also in the hospitals , in which we are healthy , have been identified as Ausgangsherde this deadly Karzinogens .
Andrew Lawson was not old .
He was also a plumber .
It was difficult for him , in fact , to imagine that he may have come into contact with asbestos .
Then he found out it .
`` it looks as if the tunnels in the Guy 's Hospital , where I spent six years my training was that there was a lot of asbestos . ''he wrote .
Everyone - students , nurses , doctors and guard - use the tunnel .
One wonders how many of my counterparts are suffering from the same illness ?
This question he could answer , at least in part .
`` from the four doctors trained 's Hospital on Guy , and in the last five years to mesothelioma sick '2010 in a letter he wrote , ' I am the last , is still alive '' .
How many of us are still fall ill ?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma at the age of 48 years ago .
When he died on 17 February of this year , he was 55 .
It was an unusually long survival time .
Fifty percent of all Mesotheliomerkrankten die within eight months after the diagnosis .
The disease is always fatal .
We can therefore only repeat Lawson 's question : `` How many of us are still fall ill ? ''
Britain 's leading expert on mesothelioma , Professor Julian Peto , assumes that between 1870 and 2050 , when the epidemic of asbestos in Britain is expected to come to a standstill , a total of 90,000 will be a victim of the disease .
At the moment , most of them have no idea that they will die .

A quick look at the files of the courts , in which people often turn for damages , shows how far the scourge of Mesothelioms is already widespread .
In June of this year , Marks & Spencer , for example , have to be exposed to asbestos , Janice Allen negligent way .
They worked for the chain for nine years , from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible for the clothing department in two locations - one of the flagship store in Oxford Street .
Mrs Allan was only 18 years as when they operate in M & S began .
She now has two children in their twenties .
`` in this matter , ''says , 'I had never heard of mesothelioma , I did not really about asbestos .
I never thought that I would affect the time .
There are only a few people who know a lot about asbestos .
The fact is that the concept of asbestos is not a substance , but a group of six minerals .
The name comes from the word `` Asbestiform ' , a description of the substance Faserstruktur resilient and flexible .
Three of the six were used in the construction industry .
Chrysotile , also known as white asbestos , today it is by far the most commonly found asbestos in buildings .
It has been used for roof panels , floor plates , pipe insulations , boiler insulation , even for brake pads in cars .
It is less deadly than other forms of asbestos , but it is still seen as a `` major health risk '' with the possibility of death by the EU and the WHO .
Dangerous , however , is the brown asbestos ( Amosit ) and the blue asbestos ( Krokydolith ) .
Britain was once the world 's largest importer of braunem asbestos , and experts assume that'it is clear , however , there are indirect evidence that this is one of the main reasons for the unique high Mesotheliomraten was ' .

Janice everyone has seen as typical Mesotheliomopfer maybe not , but the work of Julian Peto indicates that their history is not unusual .
He has presented a study of those affected will be shown that `` a substantial proportion of Mesotheliome without known suspension through work or at home was probably caused by asbestos contact in the environment . ''
In his statement , a large proportion of these contacts is based on the `` normal use and aging '' of our buildings .
It looks as if no one expected to be safe .
A report by Goddard Consulting , which has investigated the Palace of Westminster , shows how people could also be in the heart of the government , have been unwittingly exposed to the substance .
2009 reported that the Goddard Serviceschächte and pipelines contaminated with asbestos behind the Ausschussräumen of Parliament , whose deadly fibres are caused by something as harmless , such as `` strong Luftbewegungen .
Members of Parliament to look after their own interests , often accused , but here it seems , as would have been the opposite .
While the Directorate of the Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the Westminster Palace have received a `` clean '' health certificate , it is now clear that £1 billion amount must be paid over several years to renovate Parliament to modernize the electrical installations and remove the asbestos , and that the Members of Parliament after the general election in 2015 will probably make more in nearby QEII Conference Centre in Westminster than on the green benches .
The Goddard report has also pointed out that `` the presence of asbestos was not handled in accordance with the relevant provisions . ''
No one can know whether this mismanagement will cost lives .
All we can do now is wait .
A person who never define precisely the contact with asbestos was is Graham Abbott , a general practitioners .
As Andrew Lawson suspected of the 50-year-old Abbott that he exposed to asbestos in hospitals during his work .
`` I have been working in a hospital , in the Asbestklagen ' , says , ' but I can in my case do not show it .
It is difficult , in which they have worked , to remind you of all places , and the data .
What he is still clearly remembered the day at the beginning of December 2009 , where he got a fever .
He was 45 , and had an operation in late in the evening .
Suddenly I had Schüttelfrost .
It was very suddenly .
I felt terrible .
I did not believe more to create the journey home .
As a doctor , Abbott knew that the pain of Brustfell , the skin around his lungs resulted .
But as Janice Allen , he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma .
He went to work a month .
Doctors have Verwunderte Röntgenaufnahmen his chest and put Pleurakathether to flow from the lungs and test laboratory .
His complaints , but without diagnosis .
His health slowly stabilized , and he returned to his job back .
From time to time the symptoms returned back , however , often after physical activity and heavy breathing .
In 2011 , a patient Abbott 's with similar symptoms in his practice and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma .
But even now , Abbott combined this with his own case .
Finally , his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with asbestos .
The link in the case was clear .
In September 2011 Abbott 's condition deteriorated again and his doctor brought his CT scans and X-ray images to a group of experts .
In December 2011 , exactly two years after Abbott had felt ill for the first time , one with a camera-equipped probe was introduced into the cavity between the Rippen- and the chest fur .
I am an optimist .
More generally , I am simply , `` he says .
To be honest , I had not so much concern to me .
But my wife , Rachel , was worried .
The result of the Biopsie was in the week between Christmas and New Year : 'I said to me that it was `` mesothelioma .
Graham Abbott diagnosis mesothelioma .
Suddenly , Abbott dates with Macmillan-nurses , one of which he recommended to take a lawyer .
Only now realised the extent of the epidemic .
It turned out that asbestos was very widespread , especially in large public buildings where pipes often isolated with asbestos , `` he says .
The people who are exposed to asbestos in these buildings were affected .
And so is now mesothelioma younger people , who worked in the typical professions .
The most dangerous pipes with Asbestisolierungen in hospitals were under the earth , so patients are exposed to the substance is probably not .
But many employees who changed in pedestrian tunnels from one building to another ( like Andrew Lawson ) or in underground canteens ate Graham Abbott ( as it often did ) , most likely came in contact with the toxic substances .
It shows that on several decades after the war hospitals for patients may save lives , but life-threatening for the sending of doctors .
It is still a long way off .
Students presented their bunsenburner on asbestos mats .
And it is not just hospitals .
Asbestos has been used in offices , shops , libraries and Stadthallen often because of its wonderful-isolating and flammhemmenden properties .
Even schools .
Indeed , many people have probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom .
Across the country , in thousands of chemical hours , students have parked their bunsenburner on asbestos mats .
Websites are now often raised the issue of asbestos in schools .
And meanwhile , items in our homes as innocent as floor plates or shingle roofs by default contain asbestos .
`` it is a Industriegift that included in large parts of our property is ' Andrew Morgan , the lawyer , Andrew Lawson represented 's Hospital against Guy in the process .
In any case , was the only contact one of the woman , the demolition of Gartenschuppens invaded in the 1970s .
So , as you remove your Gartenschuppen .
The effects of the diagnosis , and the knowledge that the cure is immense .
`` It takes a while to process it , '' Mr Abbott said .
I went back to work and tried to continue , but I discovered that I am not able to focus on what I did .
Two weeks ago I was in practice .
Then I knew that I had to go and look after myself .
Well , I shall have no further Christmas .
With the greatest difficulty was the change in perspective from the position of a doctor to the patients .
As countless patients before he reminds himself , as he overwhelmed by all the information was that he had to come around .
`` It was very difficult to absorb all of this , '' he says .
`` I asked my doctor'as long as I have ? '
And it gave me about 12 months .
I remember that I thought , 'well , I shall have no further Christmas .
The summits ' .
Mesothelioma is particularly insidious , because our Lebenserhaltungsmechanismus - the breathing itself - is that the fatal cancer .
Most cases are caused by Asbestkontakt mesothelioma .
Asbestos is composed of tiny fibres .
If the asbestos is being raised and the fibers are inhaled , they can establish themselves in the chest fur , the skin around the lungs , .
Irritate the Brustfell asbestos fibres and can trigger Zellmutationen .
The problem is with the nadelförmigen actually inhaled asbestos fibres , as Professor Tom Treasure , a heart-Thorax-doctor , 2001 the Guy 's Hospital changed .
The hospital , which Andrew Lawson suspects that it has exposed to asbestos , is now ironically , a leading centre for the treatment of mesothelioma .
Treasure knew Lawson and dealt with a number of other exposed to asbestos in the hospital which also probably during their training .
As soon as the Asbestnadeln the Lungengewebe Treasure , says , 'they are pushed to the margins of the Atemvorgang , where the skin .
Naturally it is invasive from the outset .
The usual options work for other cancers in mesothelioma not so good .
The effectiveness of the operation , for example , is highly controversial .
Some say that it was worth a try .
Treasure denies this .
`` The breast skin can not be cut out , '' he says .
They come with the knife not beat about the bush .
Meanwhile , the cancer `` on chemotherapy is not very good , '' the `` effect , '' but not healed .
Sometimes there are Langzeitüberlebende `` , ''says Treasure .
But in the end they die .
Fortunately , there are some really long , much longer than expected .
The author Stephen Jay Gould , 20 years after the diagnosis .
Mr Abbott still fighting two and a half years after his diagnosis .
After he had contacted mesothelioma , Abbott came in contact with Andrew Lawson , four years after his diagnosis had become a one-man-of support and consultancy for Mitbetroffene .
`` hello , Krebszentrale ' , he happily on telephone calls .
`` He was very positive , '' Abbott says .
He had received his diagnosis four years earlier and was still very active .
Originally Abbott , the last four months and extend only a month of life would be likely to have been offered six Chemotherapiezyklen .
`` I was desperate , '' he says .
I wanted to give up .
Lawson managed `` . to appear in a slightly more positive light the things .
Following the advice of several doctors Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski , cardio-thoracic specialist at Guy 's .
`` we had a benefit I telephoned and got a date , that I would be referred to'are Graham .
A normal patient would transfer must be and must wait for the approval of the treatment .
Money is crucial for mesothelioma sufferers , to be able to play the best available therapies .
But if these treatments , inevitably fail , many patients are from a different financial concern about the future of the families they left behind .
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation .
Andrew Lawson kontaktierte Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP .
`` It is known that asbestos is extremely dangerous for the health since 1898 , '' Morgan says .
But what the 1960ern modified is that we realised that a very low cost a health risk .
And here the negligence of the company began to play a role .
Andrew Lawson and Guy 's Hospital , in their case , but it was not what Morgan calls a `` full compensation '' that Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to an asbestos contact at Guy 's .
According to the study of his death , a spokesman for the Guy 's , however , that'the asbestos fibres in the 1990s in the affected Kellerbereich . ``
It was too late for Andrew Lawson .
How asbestos can be removed
In fact , it is a huge problem for mesothelioma sufferers who care about compensation , to trace the deadly asbestos contact a company or a job - usually decades after the incidents .
Many of their former employers are sold or closed .
Insurance documents can be lost .
And those who defend itself against claims to know that it is time for them , but certainly not with the prosecutor .
In response to this in this year there were significant new legislation for mesothelioma-affected easier , even if they are no longer find former employer , to demand compensation .
The law has established a fund of £350 million for all funded by the insurance industry , which were diagnosed after July 2012 , can prove a contact , but can not sue anyone .
In these cases , the plaintiffs will receive 80 percent of what a court in a normal compensation process could have granted them - about £120,000 .
About 300 successful applications for the program are expected per year .
Mr Morgan is like so many mesothelioma-350 million people , for a very good piece of work'of the insurance industry .
`` This is a deal of insurers for insurers , '' he says , and suggests that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have to pay if the time had not gone away and mesothelioma sufferers find the company and they could sue normally .
Mike Penning , then work and pensions minister , admitted that the law is `` not perfect . ''
But both Penning as Morgan admitted that , in the face of seven deaths every day a swift action is necessary .
`` the people are suffering so much and are now in need of aid , ''said Penning during the second hearing of the mesothelioma-law in December of last year .
At that time was Graham Abbott since 19 months in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski .
After their first debate , Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation that he expected a positive effect in contrast to Tom treasure .
This has been accompanied by a radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy , Lang-Lazdunski can present a survival rate of up to 40 percent over five years .
Abbott felt strengthened .
`` This is , of course , with the most important thing , '' Abbott says .
This can be seen in patients again and again .
There is something you can continue .
If you place you are worse very quickly .
Graham Abbott underwent the surgery in March 2012 .
At the end of August , he was behind the last of six cycles of chemotherapy .
Follow-up scans showed no signs of the disease .
Then I had a scan in March 2014 .
There have been several cancer spots in my chest .
I was just 50 .
This is not life-threatening .
This is lebensbeendend .
Again subsequently went six Chemotherapiezyklen Abbott .
No trace of the tumours is now more visible .
But the process is physically and psychologically very demanding .
They need that money - think of practical things , for example , or my wife , show how the Boilerzeiteinstellung works if I am .
If you get bad news , you will be negative .
They have to look to the future .
As the father of Ellie , 14 , 16 , and Tamsin , this is not always easy .
`` It is difficult for parents , '' he says .
It is hard to know what to say and how much .
When I received my first diagnosis , I said to my girls , a disease that I have , I will not grow old .
They reacted quite differently .
Tamsin is very gesellig and ungestüm .
They told their friends and we got very soon many telephone calls .
Ellie was restrained .
You have not said a great deal .
Such talks are something that all cancer patients have to go through .
But for Mesotheliomerkrankte such talks are redolent of hope , not a trace of hope of survival .
The disease is ( as , ultimately , also for Stephen Jay Gould ) a grim security .
As Mr Morgan says , 'mesothelioma is not life-threatening .

His hardcore team of lawyers , in which the case for judges , reject the indictment and argued that the law , in the history of the State of Texas against the longest-serving Governor , diffuse unverfassungsgemäß .
Perry stopped $ 7.5 million in state money to the state 's Public Integrity Unit , which is based in Travis County and determined in cases of corruption in Texas , as clay mountain refused to resign .
This veto caused a public complaint from a linksstehenden Watchdog group .

Under this view , there is peace and quiet
We have a huge strain on Rhöner luck my piece `` in our Rätselaufgabe the Sommerserie last Friday .
There are still a number of these giant trees in the county , the copy is the `` Geißruheiche '' above under white aroma .

Vital is the natural monument , it stands on the other trees in the area and remembers with a circumference of about eight metres of an American mammoth tree .
A small Buddha on a tree stump suggests that it is a spiritual or mystical place .
Despite intensive research , there were only references to the Namensherkunft .
Dr Wolfgang Schneider has separate the Bischofsheimer archive in order to know about consulted and older people from Unterweißenbrunn what Bewandtnis it with the Geißruheiche .
The result of his research was the very sober explanation for the name .
According to about 80 years ago have driven the goat shepherd of their animals under white hours on the meadows laboriously cleared and released by stones .
At the foot of the tree , the animal keeper exhausted by the rise should have rested .
The area has now won back its importance , because in the meadows in Ziegenherden wallowing in again .
The area has been declared to the Biosphärenreservats Kernzone also has discovered , Schneider .
When entering the stone collections should be cautious , however , because the basalt heated by the sun is also a popular haunt for otters .

With Rona fair Head , perhaps the BBC has found a great director , which it needs .
It is with a proud fame than from the banking world , the media management and the inner circle of the Tory Party .
And it has its own Fronterfahrung .
Her career began in the global Managementberatungsunternehmen bain and so on , as they Morgan Stanley , Bombadier , ICI and the media of Pearsons changed .
It was board chairman of the Financial Times for seven years and came back as the top post of the parent company went pear 's to a younger male colleagues .
Their compensation was supposedly nearly 1 million .
Their political ranking is sound .
David Cameron has been recommended by Lord Browne , the former chairman of BP , as it searched for more private knowledge in Whitehall : She was a consultant to the cabinet .
Her husband is a former Tory councillor .
In May , I described the role of chairman with a poisoned chalice .
Not only is the BBC as a huge and complex entity in the heart of public life , but there is also an internal paradox in its structure .
The trust works in two directions : Inside on the first guard of the BBC 's own management hierarchy , but also to the outside world as the voice of public concern and anxiety , if things go wrong .
This makes for an almost unsustainable duopoly , which calls for a complete comprehensive reform .
But the new incoming president would be to risk to take on everything and the complex is like a Chinese dynasty , auseinanderzunehmen an institution in itself , it is perhaps his job .
It is a difficult task .
And as if that were not enough , even many are keen to see the BBC reduced - overtaken power , money and status .
While the competition is approaching old and new technologies threaten comfortable collateral is the upcoming trial of royalties for the BBC with special risks .
For the modest sum of 145,50 GBP per year is buying the British public in the probably biggest media companies in the world .
The BBC tells a good story : She says that they reached 96 percent of all households , and each of them costs only 40 pence per day .
And apparently , the BBC on the popularity scale back up : 53 percent support it today , compared to 31 percent 10 years ago .
The sight and Nutzungsgewohnheiten for the BBC have changed : I get Nachrichtenschlagzeilen today on my mobile phone and see missed programmes later on my iPlayer .
But it remains a very considerable and beloved institution .
It needs a considerable chairman - I hope it has found it .

With the 2 : 0 on Grödig has taken on Sunday a hoping for rapid a bitter week .
`` the victory is ' very liberating said coach Zoran Barisic , whose team achieved on Thursday a Zwischentief in Europe League with the training .
This success was extremely important , confirmed the captain and Steffen Torschütze Hofmann , with green-white to place three vorstieß .
Schrammel Traumtor brings Rapid on winning street Rapid has shown the right response to the disappointment with the second season victory against Helsinki and comes with a success in the countries game break .
`` We wanted to show a positive response , '' said foreign defender Thomas Schrammel , with its splendid leadership-volley from Sechzehnereck has asked the course to victory in the 14th minute .

As Schrammel on 13 . Novmember 2010 Bundesligapartie so far taken in one of the last time was in Ried .
The first Meisterschaftstreffer in rapid Dress will remain in special memory .
`` This is something special for me , I am from the Rapid-kids , '' said Schrammel .
Due to the short-term basin-Blessur by Mario Pavelic Schrammel distanced herself from the left to the right-wing Defensivseite and his point was also very good .

Even Barisic was that it would have been better than today'before ' in many games - 'against ' the strongest team played in the stadium during this season .
The first Dreipunkter since 26 July , that despite the setbacks Mannschaftsgefüge intact was : 'my team today has shown that it has shown .

`` We must not forget that , '' warned Barisic , which lost in the last three days with Behrendt and Pavelic players , `` which were very stable in recent times . ''
The countries break should therefore be used to `` lick wounds and purchase a bit in physical terms , '' said Barisic , which has five U21 squad players in its ranks .
The break is particularly suits , one is Captain Hofmann .
He breaks for the team , goes beyond pain over it .
In this difficult stage , he has shown that he is a very important player for us , `` noted Barisic .
Hofmann gave the Rapids game before his replacement in the 68 minute not only the structure , but also scored the second goal .
For the 33-year-olds , who completed his 350 . Bundesliga game , it was the first hit out of the game since 2 November 2013 ( 4 : 2 on the eigentlich ) .
Hofmann : `` Can not believe that everything now is good , '' `` We have certainly had a bit of luck , but eventually the happiness must come back to us .
Now it was high time , `` said Hofmann .
He urged us , 'We must not always see in black and white , of course , to work : konzentriertem .
We have , as has been pointed out , is not so bad in the last few weeks .
However , we must not now all that is good .
The importance of his role in the team , it could not .
It is a very young team , I support very much at the moment .
To keep in certain stages , but to me , `` said Hofmann .
Grödig-coach would Michael Baur , and his team for little .
He regretted the rapid Gegentreffer'from the category Zaubertor ' , as well as the regular gateway of livestock in the 40-minute , which has been denied by the referee Kollegger was wrongly .
The only criticism I have of the team is that we leave in a few stages were not precise enough .
Because we have had too few qualifications .
Innenverteidiger Maximillian Karner was similar : found'it has started badly , then we have but purely and made a gateway .
By and large , would have been more .

Putin calls for the inclusion of `` statehood talks '' with eastern Ukraine from Kiev
The Russian President Vladimir Putin told Russian media reported on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop the fighting against the separatists in the east of the country and immediately begins with negotiations on the `` statehood '' of the breakaway region .
His spokesman Dimitri Peskow that Putin was not meant to have that under the control of the separatists of the field of wrote a part of Russia , will later on , but that its status for Ukraine should be redefined to give to the representation of the rights and interests of the Russian-speaking region of power .
On 730.624 , 155.291 69.341 , Putin 's call on the Government to Kiewer 25.879 to negotiations on 24.565 47.904 on an equal footing with the pro-Russian insurgents fits 296.494 186.928 , on to the 153 , 128.558 , 15.553 by him on the 62.558 91.506 since the riots on 33.949 , five months seems to be persecuted strategy : aid 81.179 15.719 ) for the separatists 17.268 on the adoption of the 43.888 36.312 , areas and pressure on 106.259 on the Ukrainian Government , Novorossija on 37.968 15.823 , the newly proclaimed region on 55.663 , 76.244 , de facto independence 48.153 for an alliance with Russia on third 29.156 with the West will sector .
In an interview with the state television channel One , Putin the Ukrainian Militärkampagne to recapture the separatist nature areas in the eastern regions Donezk and Lugansk , which was adopted in March and April , after Moscow Ukrainian peninsula Crimea on 18 March annexed .
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently adopted this area as `` Novo Rossija '' or `` New Russia , '' a term that recalls the vorrevolutionäre heyday of the Russian empire .
Putin and Ukrainian politicians pointed out that all those during the campaign for the elections on 26 Oct. while government groups attacking civilian communities in the areas held by separatists hope for early peace talks `` trapped in their illusions , '' Itar-TASS reported .
`` We must immediately begin detailed discussions , not only on technical issues , but also on the political organization of society and the state status of south-eastern Ukraine , in order to protect the interests of the people who live there , '' he said .
Peskow said that Putin 's reference to be seen with the greater autonomy in the context of the rule of law must be discussed by the Kiewer leadership for months that the cultural and linguistic rights threatens to allay fears in Russian-speaking areas .
Only the Ukrainian Government is the eastern areas give the necessary autonomy , said Peskow .
We are not talking about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia , said Peskow , 'because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine , but ' in Ukraine an internal conflict .
The clarification of the Kremlin spokesman to correct the `` misinterpretation '' of Putin 's remarks underscored Russia 's leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east , in contrast to the direct Annektion Crimea , where the majority of the 2 million residents are ethnic Russians .
Moscow could have been far more difficult to annex the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine , since most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are no Russians and polls arose from the time before a broad majority for the whereabouts of the conflict in Ukraine .
The autonomy that was raised at international forums of Russian diplomats , would the regional governments to negotiate its own trade agreements and external relations , power in Ukraine , and so the Kremlin de facto the Russian territory in the Crimea , the control over an area .
The five months annexed Peninsula in the Black Sea is the home port for the majority of the Russian navy , as well as an important Handelshafen and historical coastal region .
The regions between the Rostov region in Russia and Crimea is also rich in mines , factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military .
The Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko suggested in his speech to the inauguration on 7 June that the Ukrainian legislation - for new elections - additions to the Constitution should bear in mind that the respective areas have greater control over their finances and the status of the languages .
But the idea of autonomy is in stark contrast to the arming and incitement to stand accused of Moscow , the Kremlin and the separatist rebel .
Putin 's last call for Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders on an equal footing , followed by a further encroachment of the rebels in the past week , after Russian troops and tanks have penetrated through the previously peaceful region along the Azov Sea in eastern Ukraine .
The Russian-supported separatists took over the coup , according to Ukrainian security officials fear is the first step of a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea , the control of Nowoasowsk .
For this reason , the between Nowoasowsk and access to the narrow peninsula Crimea , Mariupol is to build a Stahlindustriehafen with 500 000 inhabitants , launched a massive civil and military preparations .
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of the EU leaders in Brussels and has asked for urgent action to prevent against Ukraine another Russian aggression , a former Soviet republic , the last 23 years of independence .
`` We are just at the point of no return , '' warned Poroshenko .
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine .
The EU summit , no concrete actions , the leadership was the proposal further sanctions against Russia , which will enter into force in a unspezifizierten escalation of Ukrainekrise .
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk , after two Russian armored columns and 1,000 soldiers broke last week in the Donetsk region , in order to support the besieged separatists , said Col. Andriy Lysenko , spokesman of the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council Repo on Saturday in Kiev .
The first is probably 63 Ukrainian soldiers trapped in Ilowajsk by the Russian invasion , which had been captured in ukrainischem area a week ago , were replaced with 10 Russian paratroopers on Sunday , Lysenko announced on Sunday .

The Höllenjahrzehnt the survivors of Beslan : ten years as the verstrickten children are still suffering , since the dreadful siege of the school .
Ten years ago , more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militants in a school in Beslan in southern Russia .
More than 330 people , more than half of them children , have been in the three-day ordeal that shocked the world .
We have returned to Beslan , in order to find some of the victims who had escaped the death of bestiality in the classroom .
Exactly a decade after the horrific school siege in Beslan in which 334 people were killed , including 186 children , the heroic survivors warned last night before a new apocalypse in Ukraine .
As a fanatical Islamic terrorists children and parents on 1 September 2004 , the beginning of a new this academic year , were caught and killed , this seemed like the repudiate the evil .
The tragedy brought together West and East in disgust , and then turned surprisingly in action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery .
Ten years later , we returned to Beslan , in order to find some of the victims who had escaped the death of bestiality in the classroom .
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance , although the memory of this terrorist hell will pursue it forever .
Their best hope ?
The war of Ukraine now exists - and in which children are dying - as they are now coming to an end .
The girl , which was photographed in the attempt , in the age of school sports hall singer
She was photographed by the Russian Star photographer Dimitri Beliakow and famous , when she was only in her underwear , was in the age of school sports hall singer , after a mine exploded .
Completely confused Aida sought after her mother Larissa , 40 years old .
Both were thought to be dead , but they survived .
`` A woman told me that I should run for my life , but I could not , '' Aida said at the time .
My legs were blood flow .
I stood up and kletterte again to look after my mother .
It was a soldier in safety .
After a series of operations , it is completely healed , but said yesterday : `` Before three months returned the pain .
I am afraid that I must again be operated on .
Some Granatsplitter are still in my knees .
Their goal is now to be a dentist , in order to help the people , as she was helped by doctors .
This tragedy has changed my life , but it has not been , `` says they pugnacious .
`` This has happened to me , and that can not be changed .
Once a year I always stayed in the gym to remind me of it there .
My friends and I try not to talk about it , on other days .
The pain is too great .
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there .
We played together , as we were small and dreamt of them to go to school .
`` I do not want to marry until I finish my studies and my career start .
In a family I think later .
It says that the siege remain a part of it , even though the memory of each year is rather weak .
I am glad that many people in the world , to our horror and we are grateful for the support of people in Britain and anywhere .
When I see the photo online of me , as I understand our disaster in the school zurückklettere I think that many people see it for the first time , and to ensure that this does not happen again .
The boy , who fled by bullets , in the view that his mother is dead
It was his first day ( Russians go with seven years in the school ) and Tamara survived the three-day siege in his mother 's arms .
As seven years , he said , `` mom told me that I should get me if there was an explosion , and hold her hand . ''
After an explosion he thought that they would die .
She said to him : `` flow '' .
Full of fear , they could be dead , he was on the road and a little bit of sadness baby , took it in the hand and , through a bullets .
His father , Vladimir , into the arms of his son out there , said : `` Damir told me that his mother had died .
He said : `` I could not save them . ''
In fact , Tamara outside stumbled with leg injuries in the hospital , for their part in the assumption that her son died .
After reunification she said : 'I wept with joy .
I could not believe it .
He ran in and hugged me .
Damir was later flown to London ( of the now dissolved newspaper News of the World ) , in order to receive the title of Barnardo 's Children 's Champion by then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie .
`` This horror is following you every day , but I wish I could stop with the memory , '' he said yesterday .
But I can say that it pale in my memory .
I know that I immediately all my Spielzeugpistolen wegwarf .
But now I can play games with Schussszenen and this is not a problem for me .
`` I am not afraid to go back into the Sporthalle , but I do not think about myself .
I remember these children , with whom I have played in the yard , and have not made it to the outside world .
We never say that they have been killed or are dead .
We say that they are stuck in the gym .
I remember my trip to London , particularly in the toy shop , where I was able to choose everything very well what I wanted , and the ride in an open top car .
But now he has suffered a fear of the ground , such as Ukraine , where wars are the kind of accident that he and his friends .
This horror followed you every day , but I wish I could stop .
`` am so sorry for all those who are suffering under the answer , ''said Damir , last week as a volunteer in a monastery .
I want to help so much .
I will one day go to the police and hope that they will take me to the training academy next year .
His mother Tamara , 48 , said : `` 37 children have been killed in our neighbourhood , can you imagine ?
I remember the appalling silence the siege , there was simply no children , the call and walk , and this silence lasted for many months .
She remembers vividly on their trip to London with Damir .
The people of London cried when I told our story .
I understood at the time , as people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings , and show their support .
It was Cherie and its Foundation grateful for the price and the opportunity to travel to London in the autumn of 2004 .
I wish I could call their own Cherie and simply say that , 10 years have passed , but I remember the meetings I have her and her husband in London are still , and as the Damir and helped me .
I still remember how Damir Borschtsch to eat and all local Russian restaurants experience .
I remember , as he played in a restaurant with Kellnern . Damir fired with its Wasserpistole to them and they ran away and played with him .
And that was just one month after the horror .
I was surprised that the British people are so willing to our pain and are supported .
She said : 'I believe that the world has become more in these ten years .
In Ukraine , the war now again , and people die every day , and I believe that many children were killed and still be killed .
These are precisely such children as ours .
I think that , for many of the war , a piece of news is that they hear bored or if it deals with something else .
I know just what these people feel the horror .
Do not stop this and I can feel .
Nothing has changed , people still want to kill each other , and that is so sad .
Damir was large and is a very gentle and quiet boy , he is not aggressive or angry at all .
For example , it is not for revenge , he is the last answer overwhelmed .
I know that he does not like to remember , but he has six close friends in the class and sometimes they go into the Sporthalle , candles and light .
When he was smaller , he including - I remember how he sometimes on the SOFA , the face of us away , for hours .
Not schlafend , his eyes were open .
I still remember how he threw all his weapons and other military toys away . - is now 17 , bigger than I , handsome , intelligent and healthy .
I can hardly believe that , for a few hours , I was so sure that he was dead and I would never see him again .
As I am a following the explosion and the legs came , I saw , and saw the hell around me , with all herumliegenden body parts .
I was absolutely sure that my little boy in this hell impossible have survived .
`` I remember that I shouted at him'Damir , lauf , lauf away '' , but I was sure that he had not heard me .
But it has one and it is weggelaufen .
And so it goes on life , unlike many others , for us .

Comfort : The 2004 Beslan-survivor Georgy Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege , on a picture of born today
Be blutüberströmtes face was marked by fear , as he Chechen terrorists his Klassenkameraden niederschossen , running his life .
His picture was one of the most shocking symbols for the barbarity of Beslan .
His mother Fatima , 54 , a doctor , had it before they came to get rid of the University of their older son Vladimir , sold on his first day .
`` I left the farm about two minutes , the terrorists stormed before him , and so was my little boy for three terrible days alone , 'it remembers .
Not quite alone , there was a whole family of relatives from us , but all of them have been killed .
I let only managed to survive .
As the date , the more difficult it is to think and talk about it .
There is no single day on which we remind ourselves of this tragedy .
We do not think that it is a long time ago , I think it would be a few scenes from these days I have always done yesterday .
No one will ever forget that , I assure you .
Urgent : The image of born ( left ) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as statue ( right ) .
I wanted to remember that born on this day are so happy to go to school , he said that he wants to embrace his teacher .

And now there are even this statue of weinenden let in San Marino .

I understand that , but I also think that people around the world feel our pain , thanks to this image .
Born today says : `` It is important that something like this can never happen again .
`` I doubt that we will ever know the truth .
People investigate such tragedies again and again and never learned the truth .
And now they are investigating the crash of the Boeing in Ukraine .
We will know what caused it ?
The horror of this world .
I can not understand how it is possible , because if you ask the people , nobody wants a war , so how is this happening ?
Ten years is nothing in such pain .
We need dozens of years to forget a little .
It has attacked my health and I am still .
About three or four years I had a couple of nightmares because of the siege , but then it was better .
I was later in the year 2004 and was back to school every day .
I thought of my friends and Klassenkameraden who have been killed .
On 114.445 therefore I am always 26.802 in the Sporthalle , has if now on 1 September is approaching .
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends of mine .
It is difficult for me to go to the gym , but I must do it .
I am not as victims , this story is now a part of my past .
I will not forget bemitleide , but I am not .
My life goes on .
I have concluded the school this year and visit a medical college in Vladikavkaz .
I shall be Herzchirurg .
My first choice was an education in the army .
I wanted to be a soldier , but my health has not .
I wanted to fight for my country , but that will not happen .

During the siege , he was caught in the gym and sat beside the bomb , which was attached at the foot of a murderous terrorists .
It is actually a miracle that he was not killed .
`` we feel as if it was yesterday , saying , 'let 's go to the FSB as Geheimdienstoffizier wanted , but because of his health damage due to the siege could do it .
It is still with me , there is nothing that I have left behind me .
I am now older and people say that children can easily cope with terrible experience - I must say that this is not true .
`` in 2006 , I worked with psychologists and felt that something better , but I can not forget .
And I would like to forget .
In 2005 , a year later , was the first and only time I went back in the gym .
I lost consciousness .
I will never return , and please do not ask me where I sat in this famous picture to show you .
Survivor : let Fanijew today , with a photograph of the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is extraordinary and I carry it with me every day .
My friends know that I do not like to think and talk and they asked me never to the school .
Physically , it is good to me .
I should be very careful with my injured knees , but I can now well under way .
But because of my health , I could not study at the FSB 's intelligence academy in Saint Petersburg , as I wanted .
I have submitted my papers , including the medical and they have responded that it was not possible .
My second passion were the animals , so I went to the veterinary institute .
I have been there two years behind me .
He learns the treatment of all animals ' of cats to cows ' .
He said : `` I knew that I would tell my children never in my experience .
Should children know nothing and it should not , of course , also suffer .
His mother Marina , 42 , said , 'This pain never leaves me .
It is in my soul , worse , if the anniversary approaches .
I will go to the celebrations in his memory .
I know that born will not go .
It must be even more intense for him , because he was there and I do not .
I was at home at him and could not help .
I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me , and all of them are drawn in Beslan .
It remains in us .
Let is now an adult , but this horror is still in him .
It is difficult to accept that , if a little so Unfaires experience .
He is a boy , he may sport , but it can not be due to its knees .
He was operated on several occasions , he can run , but no sport .
I would like to see it resolved the horror to 50 % , but that can not be overcome and never completely forgotten .
This terrible experience will follow .
Many friends and neighbours were killed during the siege and the only my pain .
I am I knew well and dear to me , many people have been lost .
My son is with me , and this is the greatest gift that God could make me , but my heart cries for the slain .
I know of families in which new children were born , but also of widows , never married again .
It is difficult to accept that life goes on , even if it does not want .
I would like my heart jumped in me when I saw him in hospital .
And now , I see what is happening in the world - wars in other regions .
What are these people ?
Why do they kill each other ?
The war is now very close to our country and I can not believe almost .
We were once a friendly country , how can it be that we are now fighting ?
People and children suffer , I am sure that many children have been killed in Ukraine , and many more are being killed .
If we take all these rebels , but , as far as possible .

This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal options with discrimination because of the organization of trade unions and other forms of discrimination - and stops set so anti-union forces .
The addition of national Arbeitsrechtsgesetzes , to organise a union representation to create an opportunity for a discrimination abandoned workers in order to complain about justice before a civil court - and to receive compensation or Strafgelder - is a sensible and necessary initiative .
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not to American standards .
Indeed , the best way to understand what Ellison , Lewis and the other sponsors of the bill suggest the link back to a very American idea .
Despite the setbacks in recent years , the trade unions - in Wisconsin , Michigan and other countries throughout the country , Americans will extend to comply with labour rights and encourage countries all over the world .
There was a time in which millions of Americans , as this country is democracy , freedom of speech , freedom of the press and the freedom of association in one breath .
When the United States after the Second World War , Japan had occupied , General Douglas ' Arthur and his staff , which ensure the country to adopt a Constitution that the militarised autocracy Hedki Tojos replaced by democracy .
In full awareness of the fact that the workers and their unions took a role in the creation of a new Japan , they used a language that are explicitly recognized that guarantees workers ' rights of association and collective bargaining and action. ``
When the United States occupy Germany after World War II , General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff pushed the Germans , to write a constitution that would ensure that the fascism Adolf Hitler would be replaced by a strong democracy .
In recognition of the fact that the workers have to organise themselves , and their voice heard in the new nation , a German added a clause which explicitly aussagte : 'the right to safeguard the employment and economic conditions and to improve to form associations , individuals and guaranteed any trade or profession .
Agreements that restrict this right or seek to diminish it are null and void ; measures aimed to are illegal .
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt held the presidency of the International Commission on Human Rights , designed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , as it was taken over by the United Nations as a global agreement in 1948 , Roosevelt and the other authors added a guarantee that `` everyone has the right to form unions to protect its interests or to join them . ''
Since generations the Americans accept the basic premise that labour rights are human rights .
As other countries in this country , as we build civil and democratic societies , told Americans that the right of trade unions to the creation and protection - that this trade union will participate as an equal partner with companies and government agencies in collective bargaining it should .
After these rights in America come under attack , it is actually very wise to lead the American ideal in mind that working people must have the right to unite and to make themselves heard in a free and open society .
Fifty years ago , as Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said :
The story is a great teacher .
We all know that the workers ' movement , the strength of the nation , but not increased .
By raising the living standards of millions of people , work miraculously created a market for the industry and the nation as a whole increased to unimaginable levels of production .
Forget those who attack the work these simple truths , but they kept the story .
The story recalls , and we should do this .
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights and the extension of the protection of citizens ' rights and protection against discrimination in the creation of employees ' representatives , is long overdue .
Renew Keith Ellison and John Lewis the ideals that America has made in the past , and the promise of democracy einlösten .

Berkeley declared housing to'normal ' .
One of the most prominent builders of London pointed out that the housing ''returned to normal levels in the south-east of England .
Homes in the capital were hotly sought and subject to enormous price increases , and the Bank of England because of the widespread fear of a credit boom that led to set limits on mortgage in June .
Tony Pidgley , founder and CEO of high-class Bauunternehmens Berkeley said on Monday : `` Since the beginning of the current financial year , the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the peak in 2013 , '' and added that this is a `` stable environment '' offer .
The housing market in London was well positioned during the downturn , because foreign buyers pushed in the capital .
According to information from the Katasteramts are the prices in the city have increased by leaps and bounds to 18.5 % in the last year alone , far more than the average increase in England and Wales as a whole .
The average selling prices of Berkeleys private , cheap and student services rose by about a fifth last year and were at the end of April to £423.000 .
However , a stronger pound has made property in London less attractive to foreign buyers in recent months - some of them have also been deterred by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric about a possible `` villas '' tax before the general election next May .
The London real estate agents Foxtons warned last week that the Hypothekenmarktbericht for April , presented in the tougher Kreditvergaberegelungen , such as the prices lead to lower growth in both the Immobilienverkauf in the second half of this year .
The Bank of England on Monday new data show a decline in the mortgage approval in July , which also indicates that the housing market is cooling .
Hamptions International , a different Immobilienagentur , corrected his prediction for the increase in property prices in London for 2015 down to 3 % , on the basis of an already faltering Hauspreisbewußtseins .
The transaction limit in the most expensive areas of London Mayfair and Kensington and Chelsea , year on year , is now reduced to a quarter , so the broker Wa Ellis .
However , the desire for a home in the capital is a boon to Berkeley , because the sums due to date sales amounting to more than £2.2 billion .
Mr Pidgley added : `` the demand for the right , well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and , as a result , the Terminverkäufe'remained stable .
In June , the company reported that it had sold 3.742 new homes in the year to the end of April - almost a third more than the 2007 peak before the crisis .
The annual pre-tax profit rose by 40 per cent to £280 million , sales at 18 per cent to £1.6 billion annually .
In a statement on Monday before the company 's annual meeting , Mr Pidgley said that the revenue for Berkeley in the current year would be expected to comply with the current market expectations .
The analysts estimate in the annual Vorsteuerergebnis to 450 million .
Berkeley-shares were found in the afternoon in the London trade in 23,96 .

A year ago , there was no good climate between the club and the castle friends Wolfratshausen .
Seemed very diverse the positions , as with the history of the Wolfratshauser Castle and a possible reconstruction should be tackled .
Now to move between the two camps : it should soon be held talks on a common approach .
Confirm that the club stands Torsten Invest ( Castle ) and Herbert Piffl ( and friends ) on demand of our newspaper .
`` I have called Mr Piffl and that we could get together once again proposed'Sjöberg reported .
In his view , all members of both clubs could pull together again in the future .
So are made visible progress more quickly .
While the castle suddenly friends with the late Richard Dimbath until recently had an eye on a reconstruction of the castle in the mountain forests , the `` development and Erlebbarmachung '' for the club to Invest is at the forefront of the terrain .
Herbert Piffl , chairman of the second Burgfreunde , is very pleased about the call for their own data .

Two similar , already far advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not a pipe dream .
By a large part of the population , as well as volunteers from all over the world , they are a tourist magnet .
Piffl : `` I was skeptical at first .
But over time , I am more and more to the conclusion that it is sensible to press ahead with the project . `` We could create a '' unique selling point `` for the raftsmen city .
Here , there is nothing else .
Moreover , the project by EU subsidies , visitor tickets and potential sponsors would be affordable , believes Piffl .
`` The idea of reconstruction will jettison I personally is not easy . '' He hope that the club at this point might make a difference .
Their goal , first to document the history , `` is important and good . ''

Tax burden of businessmen in Washington , with the economic recovery
The recovery of the economy means more customers , more sales and new jobs .
It also means higher taxes .
State and local tax rulings for companies in the country rose slightly last year , while the economic recovery accelerated in the past week , and the companies in the Washington area , according to a newly published study were no exception .
Companies in the area of District , Maryland and Virginia paid together 27,6 billion dollars to state and local authorities in the financial year 2013 , an increase of 3.8 % compared with the revenue from 2012 to the tune of $ 600 billion .
The state and local tax burden of businesses rose last year by 4.3 % to EUR 671 million , compared to 3.9 % in the year before , and it was the third consecutive Wachstumsjahr after several years of declining orders in 2009 and 2010 .
State taxes increased more than the local taxes , 4.3 % , so the study carried out by the National Centre for taxation , a Steuerpolitikgruppe from Dienstleistungsagentur Ernst & Young .
More than half of the District , 56 % , revenue comes from corporate taxes , while 36 percent of Mary 's revenues come from businesses .
Virginia has the lowest tax revenue from businesses , with 28 percent .
A large proportion of the increase in revenue is founded the company in a recovery of Immobilienwerte , researchers , leading to an increase in the Immobiliensteuern by 3.7 % this year for the three successive years with a growth rate of less than 1 % .
While a large proportion of these profits for large states like California , New York and Texas , is of course also applies to the area of Washington .
Companies in the District , Maryland and Virginia paid more than $ 10 billion in state and local property taxes together last year , compared to $ 9.6 billion in 2012 - a 4.2 percent increase in the course of a year .
But the apparent recovery in the real estate values is not as effective in the increase of state and local tax revenues in Maryland , as in the real estate taxes amount to barely more than a fifth of corporate tax rulings .
Companies in Virginia and DC pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of Immobiliensteuern .
On 509.719 '490.305 , 28.872 in Maryland 419.306 is the following : a large part of the property , 381.955 352.001 , 70.352 , 58.838 , particularly in the field of taxation on 28.261 to DC is either 267.811 , 128.668 , 61.645 , 40.822 on 17.375 in possession of the government or 14.597 of non-profit organisations , the pay on 14.334 57.539 not Immobiliensteuern on 29.285 , `` said on 113.582 , 26.995 , Douglas Lindholm , 81.218 , managers for the 49.154 , Center on State Taxation .
Maryland is therefore forced to rely much more on income taxes , for example , to be able to offer the same services that offer other states .
The recent recovery in tax revenues by companies can not be attributed solely to the recovery of the property market
Unternehmenseinnahmen seem to recover the data .
Companies in the region reported income taxes in Staatsorganisationen of 2.3 billion compared to $ 2.1 billion in 2012 .
Maryland took $ 1 billion in corporate income taxes , the highest amount in the region .
During the trend in the same direction , the local tax burden for companies in all three areas .
The growth rate was significantly higher in the District corresponded with the national average of 4.3 percent , while the increase in Maryland , 4.9 percent .
Only Virginia reported a unterdurchschnittliches tax revenue from 4.1 % .
Virginia has the lowest corporate income taxes ( in all three with 6 percent in all three areas , there are strong business rates ) .
The corporate tax rate from 8.25 percent in Maryland and the District at relatively high 9,975 percent .
A similar study at the beginning of this year , the US Chamber of Commerce showed that lower state and local business taxes will be required in Virginia and a total of a better tax climate than in Maryland .
In the study of the District was not investigated .
Despite the advantages , Virginia has been under pressure from its southern neighbors .
North Carolina has passed laws to reduce its corporate tax rates in this year of 6.9 percent to 6 percent , the same rate as Virginia , and the rate will fall to 5 percent in the coming year .
If the government continues to his Einkommensziele next year , could reduce this law by 2017 up to 3 % of the Unternehmenseinkommenssteuersatz of the state .
In the meantime , there seems to be better off small businesses in Washington , and they are therefore more state and local taxes , as the recent study .
Taxes paid by small businessmen as personal income taxes - a Übergangsstruktur , organised under the most small businesses - in the District , Maryland and Virginia increased by 20 % in the last year to EUR 2.4 billion dollars , a faster rate than the taxation as a whole .
The researchers say that the trend and the increase in corporate taxes across the country will probably continue in this year , with an increase of general VAT revenue for the state and local governments by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year .
However , if the spending cuts by the federal government has an impact on the labour market in the region , the Washington area could lag behind .

Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobsons hochgelobtem new novel about love and the letter `` J '' .
They zerflossen , one could best describe it , they are slowly on a box that you have in the rain .
Occasionally , a woman told him that he is too serious , exhausting , intense , aloof and perhaps kratzbürstig .
And then schüttelte him .
Kratzbürstig knew it .
He was stachelig , as in between .
The last victim of the sting was just starting the affair had been promising for a reduction of the lonely boredom of his life than usual , and he might even have brought a degree of satisfaction .
Ailinn Solomon 's was a trembling delicate beauty with untamed hair and a fluttering heart from a village on the North Island , which was even more remote and harsh as Port Reuben .
On 415.221 , 190.908 81.011 you was the 60.139 , 56.156 , 35.363 , Kevern on 15.390 for her aunt , has begun to south on 50.500 with an older monitoring on 174.903 and 221.352 the inherited the 74.140 with the relevant behalf , 111.217 24.323 Paradise Valley on a piece of land on 85.977 in a wet paradise 48.847 , but on 207.958 valley ) .
For several years , no one lived in the house .
The pipes are taking in the bathrooms were still Nacktschnecken spiders , can not , had left their mark on all windows and believed that they belong , and the garden was the as huge Kohlköpfe appeared überwachsen with weeds .
It was as the House from a children ’ s story , both alarming as attractive , a garden full of secrets .
Portrait of the author : Howard Jacobson , whose novel `` J '' is on the list for the Man Booker Prize in 2014 .
The Shortlist will be announced in the next week .
Kevern had sat in the high grass on the broken deckchairs händchenhaltend with Ailinn and an unusually hot Frühlingsnachmittag . both had enjoyed the country with relaxing music and soothing news was self-sufficient , as the sight of its brown legs crossed it in an old song of a long forgotten black performer , listened to his father in the House in closed shutters , eingeklinkt like in the Dienstkonsole geistesabwesend .
Your feet are too great .
Due to their own aggressiveness songs of this kind were not played more on the console .
It is not prohibited banned - nothing was so right was not easy .
It was successfully obsolesziert , such as the word obsoleszieren .
The general taste , which managed the money never decrees and rules , and how the people in books the from-Tellerwäscher-to-millionaires-memoirs , Liebesromane Kochbücher and choose the music they so chose the Balladen .
In the euphoria of the day began Kevern big feet to an imaginary piano to play and in a gross-Komische Serenade Ailinns besingen .
Ailinn do not understand this .
This was a well-known song of Jazzpianisten called Fats Waller , 'he said it and automatically presented two fingers on his lips .
That his father had always done , in order to stop the letter J , before he came out of his mouth .
It was when he was still small started as a game between him and his father .
His father had played it with his own father , he says .
If you have a word with a J anfängst to put on your lips two fingers , it will cost you a penny .
It was not a very lustiges game at the time , and it was also not very fun .
He knew that this was expected of him , that was all .
It had to explain what Jazz .
Ailinn had never heard what .
Jazz , even if it was not played directly .
This was no longer of improvisation .
It was only room for a single'if ' in life .
The people wanted to start a verse where they end would be quite safe .
As well as the mind .
Its unpredictability , people nervous .
And Jazz was musical ausgedrückter intelligence .
When he was ten years old , was to have heard of Sammy Davis Junior without Kevern knew something about Jazz of the half-secret collection of old CDs of his father .
But at least that he had not Ailinn Fats Waller was black and white .
At their age , they probably could not remember a time , in the Popsänger were not black .
That was again no laws or constraints .
A compliant society meant that every element of this society grateful the principle of Gruppenbegabung agreed - grateful , as the fate spared .
People with Afro-Caribbean origin were suited by temperament and body for entertainment and sports , so sang and ran them .
People who originally came from the Indian subcontinent were blessed with electronic talent as by nature and were served with the task to ensure that no family remained without functioning telephone service .
What is left of the Polish community , did the drains ; what was left of the Greeks , fact plate .
On 711.824 , 126.041 , those on 115.657 from 11.910 106.382 , the Gulf States and 92.228 the Levant , their grandparents 20.191 71.777 on the country had not quickly rely on 572.797 than about what had happened , 518.151 , 451.681 , 56.161 if ES happen has happened - 362.409 , 81.165 from fear , to be charged on 21.629 for Feuerschürens on 38.643 , 45.414 , 254.861 from fear , then that the flames eat on 34.084 next 49.706 as they were - 88.385 , 62.585 , had opened the 31.791 , Labneh and Shisha-pipes-restaurants on 50.115 , 23.763 , remained in mind and have been on 65.170 30.717 51.243 , with the lack of low .
Each according to his ability .
Because they had heard only ballads , it fell Ailinn difficult to understand how the offensive words , the Kevern 's very front yard had ever could be set to music .
Music was an expression of love .
`` They are not really offensive , '' said Kevern .
Except perhaps for people whose feet are too big .
My father has never insult someone , but he loved this song .
He talked too much , but the neglected garden gave him a false sense of security .
Nothing could overcome the soundproofing of huge cabbage leaves .
Ailinn still do not understand .
Why would your father should love something ?
He wanted to say that it was a Jux , but hesitated to put two fingers to their lips again in their presence .
They already thought that he was a little strange .
`` it appeared to him , ''he said .
She shook her head in disbelief and kept Keverns perspective .
There was nothing to see in the world , as her ungekämmtes pitch black hair .
There was nothing that otherwise he would want to see .
`` If you say it , '' they mean no conviction .
But it never explains why you have me vorsingst .
They seemed to be honest .
My feet are too big ?
He saw yet again .
Your feet do so directly .
Perhaps your ankle , a little bit ...
And you say that you hates me because my ankle to fat ?
You hate ?
Of course I hate you .
This is only the stupid song .
He could have said `` I love you , '' but it was still too early .
`` Your thick ankles are precisely the reason why you find me gefällst , '' he tried it instead .
I am a bit perverse .
That sounded not right .
It was meant to be funny .
When he tried to be funny as his father did not reassuring Charm , because he needed to control the jokes inherent cruelty , he is often expressed in difficulties .
Perhaps his father wanted to be cruel .
Perhaps he wanted to be the , Kevern .
In spite of its kind eyes .
Ailinn Solomon 's was red and arose from their deck chair , raised the console and buried the wine they had drunk .
Holunderblütenwein drunkenness , was no excuse for him .
In their excitement , they seemed to tremble , like palm fronds in the storm .
`` your Dickkopf is precisely the reason why I took perverse to you myself , ''said they ...
Except that I am not at all .
They did it , both because of the unnecessary Unfreundlichkeit his words , as well as the fear , in their eyes , as they showed him auflehnte .
They thought that he would beat them ?
She had not told him of his life on the cold northern archipelago , where they grew up , but he had no doubt that it was essentially such as here .
The same huge and icy ocean broke up here and there on the shore .
On 265.142 509.686 on the same bewildered men , 219.699 , 127.370 with 118.763 , 37.738 still dickerer skin and 78.782 , verdrießlicher on 67.131 after the 56.161 , DEM what happened was 13.006 as it 57.759 their ancestors on 25.546 as 18.732 , smugglers and wreckers on 67.601 was gone on 60.620 of pub on 30.661 to pub , 155.872 13.522 always willing to impose on the hand on 50.462 30.235 against a woman on 68.347 , 58.840 , 41.528 on I refused or verlachte .
Dickkopf ?
It would have shown a big fist , if not farewells .
They only Knut Chen - Knut Chen was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women , an antidote to the vacuous love ballads from the console - they only beat Knut Chen and then .
Keverns believe it was an unnecessary refinement that Knut Chen was an act of violence .
Ailinn Solomon 's gave him a sign to go through her body .
He arose from the deck chair as an old man .
They also felt bleiern , but the impact of his grief surprised them .
That was not the end of the world .
They knew very few .
They saw him as he removed himself - as he watched from a room on the top floor of their companion - a man , complained had provoked by something he himself .
Adam leaves the garden , they thought .
They felt a sudden pain for him and men in general , although some had raised their hands against it .
A man turned on her , succumbed to his back , ashamed , defeated , without fighting spirit - why it was a sight that seemed to know them well , if they could not remember a single time , where they had seen something like this before the day before ?
As it was alone to get back on their feet Ailinn Solomons .

I must also ask : Are you an atheist ?
I believe this must not say , 'I replied ESME Nussbaum .
Are you lesbian ?
Once stood ESME on their right to privacy and refusal of the statement .

Once silence .
`` I ask not , ''said Luther Rabinowitz , finally , 'because I am against Atheismus , Lesbentum or feminism .
This is a vorurteilsfreier workplace .
We serve an unprejudiced society .
But certain types of hyper-sensitivity , which in themselves are absolutely unacceptable and commendable , occasionally can distort results , as you have presented to them .
They have obviously prejudices against the church , and these things that you describe as `` disingenuous '' and `` raw '' could be interpreted as well as an expression of strength and vitality of course by others .
If you happen to the herumreitet IS what happened when ES happened IS , as if it had happened yesterday , means to take its essential vitality to the country .
ESME Nussbaum looked around , while Rabinowitz said .
Behind his head repeated the advice of an LED lettering in Flamingo Rosa Ofnow gave the country in the last quarter-century or more .
Smile on their neighbours , you value your partner , you will hear ballads , please visit musicals , use your phone , you , you , you hear , you agree to excuse yourself .
Talk is better than silence gesungene word is better than the written , but nothing is better than love .
`` I can absolutely understand what you want , '' ESME Nussbaum said in a quiet voice , as she was sure that her boss had spoken to an end , `` and I say anything other than that we are still not healed as effectively as we fool ourselves .
My concern is that without notice of us , we may find , as we repeat the mistakes that led to disclose what will happen if IT IS done in the first place .
This time , but not the other , in which we miss our anger and mistrust .
Luther Rabinowitz formte in the hands of a pyramid .
To indicate a patience .
`` They go too far , '' he said , `` if you describe the actions as a '' mistake `` that our grandparents may or may not have committed .
They go too far , when you say that their `` rage ''and `` suspicions '' to `` other ''have been omitted .
It should be to remind anyone in your position , that the understanding of the past , such as the protection of the present , not by'us ' and'other ' are not necessary .
There was no `` and there was no'other ' .
It was a time of disorder , which is what we know .
`` From , if we are honest with ourselves , ''dared not part of society can claim to have acted well , ESME post .
I would accuse anybody .
Whether it was bad or good , what is done is done .
It was at that time .
There is nothing more to be said - because we are in agreement .
And assigned as it must be , if such a settlement would be appropriate and if there is a way to eradicate them , no fault must be repaid .
But what is the past , if we do not learn from it -
The past is designed to ensure that we forget it .
If I may say something -
Luther Rabinowitz , his pyramid coincide .
`` I will remember her report , '' he said and dismissed them .
The next day , when she went to work as usual , it has been overtaken by a motorcyclist , who described as passers-by , was driven into a kind of `` brutal rage '' on the footpath .

Amazon buys Twitch for $ 1.04 billion
Amazon has just confirmed , as reported information on Monday morning : the online retailers and Videoproduzent , and a number of other things , buy the Videostreamingdienst Twitch for 1.04 billion dollars ( 970 million US $ ) .
The announcement is not surprising , because no one expects a takeover of Twitch , but because it was widely assumed that YouTube buy the company .
Three months ago , it looked as if the sale of Twitch decided to Google 's video service for a cool billion . The cooperation also appeared , of course .
Twitch it was founded as a Justin.tv only three years ago , was a Live-version of YouTube - launched as a general Streamingdienst .
Instead , it was ' a platform for players , who published their Bravourstücke in games , a'YouTube for live games , so an insider .
The Twitch interface .
And `` let 's play , '' a video genre , in the opinion of the ( mostly older ) games give a veneer of secret science theatre , are already very popular on YouTube .
It is precisely that YouTube is often called , if you want to describe Twitch , so was the news that YouTube Twitch wanted to buy a little bored , a textbook example of an established technology company that buys a potential competitors .
A mystery to me why the deal with YouTube did not come about because the company was reportedly willing to pay as much as it is Amazon .
Everything that we know at the moment is Emmet Twitch sheer , President of this statement : `` We have decided on Amazon , because they believe in our community , they share our values and long-term vision , and they want to help us get there faster . ''
Another mystery is , frankly , the incredible success of Twitch .
For snobs like me who say that they prefer to watch a sport , it is difficult to understand the attraction , the assumption that others watching the games themselves to take the control console in the hand .
It is one thing to see a friend at 3 o'clock in the morning on the shoulder while they trailed by resident Evil , and quite another to watch a spinner as 20 times in a row in Call of Duty is shot in the head .
All of these games , you could see it now .
Another problem is that many of the most popular games are ego games today , so the watch without control over the look of their own perspective can be a good recipe for headaches .
I admit that the quick passes , all of our electronic age in the Roger Bannisters complete games in record time , are entertaining .
But as long as not a game or Humorvirtuose is Twitch-channel is probably not so very interesting .
But what sceptics as I know it ?
Twitch is called of 55 million of visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internetverkehrsspitzen .
And exactly how to make money from Amazon ?
It is hard to imagine that Twitch so elegantly integrated into Amazon instant Video , such as YouTube Twitch simply could swallow .
But Twitch has something that each company would like : Thousands of young men to be courted as advertisers .
As the chairman of Twitch , shear , said , 'both Twitch Amazon and believe in the future of the Gaming , `` and the medium shows no signs of contraction , not even - Schluck - as a spectator sport .

The population gets to feel the impact of the epidemic directly and urgent : Food are scarce .
On the markets , the supply of basic foodstuffs such as rice is waning .
At the same time , the strong international companies dependent region of our image , with far-reaching consequences .
The greatest danger is that international companies avoid the area for a long time , says Philippe Hugon by French Think Tank Iris .
What matters is how far and how long the virus will spread .
Investors can get the impression that it is dangerous to live in Guinea , Sierra Leone and Liberia and thus to invest , `` warns Hugon .
The disease burden on the budgets of the Member States also strapazierten
The disease is also the already strained state budgets of the countries concerned .
The rating agency Moody 's that their budgets to exhaustion of the deteriorating economy of the high expenditure for the health care system and , in addition , is concerned .

China denies Hong Kong law on government election , protesters swear vengeance
On Sunday , the Chinese parliament against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 elections despite the increased calls for democratic reform in Hong Kong 's electorate .
This approach is probably the long feeds the protests in Hong Kong Geschäftsbezirk , began in the space of a few hours after the announcement during activists planning and mobilisation .
The decision of the Chinese People 's Congress allows the communist leaders in principle to reject all the candidates are not loyal to Beijing .
This is no surprise , but it makes us angry , `` said Rechtsexpertin Emily Lau , leader of the Democratic Party .
That is not what was promised to Beijing .
They have lied to the residents of Hong Kong .
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime .
In its defence of the Chinese decision said Li R & D & I , Vizegeneralsekretär of the Standing Committee of the National People 's Congress , the licensing of public nominations ' chaotic'for the Hong Kong Government in the elections .
Since 1997 , when Britain returned control of the Chinese Hong Kong , Beijing has promised to let the people choose the government leaders from 2017 .
The Chinese leadership presented the decision on Sunday as a democratic breakthrough , because there is a direct suffrage to the citizens of Hong Kong , but the decision also makes clear that the Chinese leadership keeps the process by a nomination committee closely controlled by Beijing firmly in hand .
After a new clause should also be allowed only'candidates with love for the country and love to Hong Kong ' .
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most effective public protests took place in Hong Kong for several years .
The movement is behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong Occupy Central With Love and Peace , whose organizers have threatened to insulate the financial district if Beijing does not allow a genuine universal suffrage .
On Sunday evening , within a few hours after the announcement , hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain in front of the government headquarters in Hong Kong .
For the demonstration of the organisers said that their movement reached a new level of civil disobedience , and they were in the coming weeks , wave of protest .
They gave no details , however , apparently in order to avoid problems with the authorities .
In an online communication has told the organizers that the movement `` the occupation of the central district considered only as a last resort , an action that is expected to take place only if all dialogue opportunities have been exhausted , and there is no other choice .
We are sorry to have to say that all Dialogchancen today and the occupation of Zentralbezirks will definitely take place .
The authorities in Hong Kong have prepared on the announcement of Beijing for days , and it was on the Sunday before the government buildings more stringent security measures , including police forces and the barricades .
The unrest that they are losing control of their city , many in Hong Kong by the feeling .
The influx of people from the mainland reinforces the competition for products and services .
There is a growing fear that Hong Kong 's values such as democracy and freedom of speech are beginning to crumble under the growing pressure of Beijing .
Some have criticised the demonstrations of Occupy-Central-movement , because they are the affiliated - the lifeline of Hong Kong - compromises .
`` The protests , which they say , could cause major economic damage , depending on how many are involved and how long they last , '' said legal expert regime Ip , who criticised the movement for a long time .
We do not want any fears that Hong Kong spirals out of control .
This impression is bad for investment .
China 's state-controlled media also reported recently on the democracy activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western powers .
This summer , an unofficial referendum organised activists to voting rights on which 780.000 people took part - more than one-fifth of the voters in Hong Kong .
In July , tens of thousands attended one of the largest democracy demonstrations in the history of the region .

While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the shelters and the fight continues , the education authorities last week postponed the start of the school year .
`` I hope that the school is open again soon , so that we can continue to learn , as the children in the world and the Jewish children , '' said Mohammad Amara , a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza City .

Around the supply stands on the castle garden meadow had made it Salzwedeler , but also guests from the hotel and more comfortable surroundings .
It 's the first live performances , wippten enjoyed with the foot to the beat of cool drinks - in short , relaxation and pleasure were the order of the day .
And the right across the generations .

In a first cautious estimate the Salzwedeler involved in organising of around 1 200 visitors in the Burggarten tummelten .
There have been problems with the sound .
The Salzwedeler hip-hop band blocks ' n 'Rox broke their appearance so unnerved .
The technicians were to be capable of creating a halfway reasonable Sound .
The planned shisha lounges could not be built because the tents because of a puncture could not be brought to salt fronds .

The premiere of Amula-Open-Air was more of the visitor numbers as successful .
And in bad weather .

It is actually more philosophical testimony as a biography , which put on paper in 287 sides Konstantin Wecker , songwriter , a pacifist , politsicher activist , ex-prisoners , in `` monk and warriors .

And he is brutally honest : From the Onanie as high school student to shoplifting and drug use , he leaves no human weakness .
Also , to demonstrate how he himself has learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings .
Broad areas are too abstract , but even more important concepts : Love , soul , ego , Being in Now , spirituality - all that he tried to go to the bottom , in a very philosophical , but also very personal way .
And he explained his pacifism , its social criticism , its political commitment - and , as the music has not only ( the Opernliebhaber became the Soul and Rockmusiker ) , but also those .
The latter has the Lebemann Konstantin Wecker `` by Subtraktion ' , as he says , ' by all unnecessary brake '' , closer to the asketischen monk .
Between all the hochgeistigen views but there are also a short anecdotes on earth : approximately on beatings in a restaurant or a crazy proposal used car , he planned on a tree .

Lots of pros , there 's arrival , the objective '' ) , turned out to be but on the mountain but when half professional and went 45 minutes without respiratory distress finish line .
He , too , is driven through the track in one go , as well as Nina Kuhn , spokeswoman of the town Oberursel , which had made together with Frank Grüneisen on the way .
For the two triathletes the `` Feldberg-cycling '' was not necessarily a sporting challenge : `` This is about charity , because we are happy with it - an exit we would have done in any case today , '' said Kuhn .

Why `` Guardians of the Galaxy '' no blockbuster was
`` The Expendables 3 '' by Sylvester Stallone played a less $ 30 million of its $ 90 million budget in the United States , while `` Sin City : A Dame to Kill For '' only grossed $ 12 million of its budget of 70 million dollars .
The tailored Cameron Diaz film `` Sex Tape '' played on the opening weekend a merely $ 14.6 million , while children 's films like `` Train Your Dragon 2 '' also disappoint in revenue .
An article in the Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that in children 's films , the lack of quality of the films could be the reason itself .
Collin called 2014 `` the worst year '' for children 's films to date , describing `` Train Your Dragon 2 '' as a purely `` functional '' fantasy sequel .
In films for a slightly older audience , it seems , however , as if the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem .
In July Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore- and Metacritic rating for each summer theatrical release , which has been shown between the American Memorial Day and July 20 , 2013 , and in the current year at least 2,000 screens .
The results are based on the opinion of moviegoers and film critic and suggest that this year 's hit movie of last year which are equivalent .
Some commentators believe that the development is due to changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of Web-streaming services like Netflix .
Director Jon Favreau , who is currently working on Disney 's forthcoming Jungle Book film , compared to the Hollywood Reporter website said : `` I think the times are changing . ''
We have to accept that and not try to run after the past .
Unlike the currently weak cash results of the Hollywood productions Netflix posted recently sales to streaming content in the amount of $ 1.2 billion , almost twice as much as last year , in which sales totaled $ 837 million .
Last summer , the director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios that they become very concentrated on film adaptations of comics and predicted a `` meltdown '' of Hollywood .
Viewed in light of the current downturn , argue some commentators that his gloomy prophecy could well contain a kernel of truth .
Due to the expected in the summer 2015 blockbuster potential , including Avengers : Age of Ultron , Minions and Jurassic World , however , other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic :
The producer of X-Men , Simon Kinberg , the decline in cash results recently described as simply `` cyclical '' and told Hollywood Reporter : `` The next summer will be the biggest summer at the box office at all , and no one is more concerned about the financial worries make. ``

Berkeley declared housing market back to `` normal ''
One of the most prominent builders of London pointed out that the housing market in the south east of England was again `` returned '' to normal levels .
Homes in the capital were highly coveted and the subject of enormous price increases , which the Bank of England due to the widespread fear moved in front of a credit bubble to put ceilings on mortgage loans in June .
Tony Pidgley , founder and chairman of the high-class construction company Berkeley said on Monday : `` Since the beginning of the current financial year , the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the peak in 2013 '' , adding that it provided a `` stable task environment '' .
The real estate market in London was well placed during the downturn , as foreign buyers thronged to the capital .
According to information from the land registry , the prices have risen in the metropolitan area alone last year jumped by 18.5 percent , far more than the average increase in England and Wales as a whole .
Average selling prices for Berkeley 's private , inexpensive and student services rose by about one-fifth last year and were the end of April to £ 423,000 .
A stronger pound has however made less attractive to foreign buyers in recent months real estate property in London - some of them have been put off by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric about a possible `` Villas control '' before the general election next May .
The London Estate Agents Foxtons warned last week that the mortgage market report for April , were presented in the stricter lending rules , would in the second half also lead to lower market growth in terms of real estate sales as in prices .
New data from the Bank of England released on Monday showed a decline in the mortgage approval in July , which also suggests that the housing market cools .
Hamptions International , another real estate agency , downgraded its prediction for the rise in house prices in London in 2015 down to 3 percent , based on an already weakening house price consciousness .
The transaction volume in the most expensive areas of London as Chelsea , Mayfair and Kensington is now every year declined by a quarter , so the broker WA Ellis .
Nevertheless , the desire for a home in the capital for Berkeley is a blessing , because the amounts due for forward sales amount to more than 2.2 billion pounds .
Mr. Pidgley added : `` The demand for the right , well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and as a result , the forward sales have remained stable . ''
In June , the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year to the end of April - nearly a third more than at the peak in 2007 before the crisis .
The annual pre-tax profit rose by 40 percent annually to 280 million pounds , while sales rose 18 percent to 1.6 billion pounds .
In an announcement on Monday before the annual meeting of the company Mr. Pidgley said that revenue for Berkeley would probably meet the current market expectations for the current year .
Analysts estimate consistently the annual pre-tax profit to 450 million pounds .
Berkeley shares were fixed in the afternoon London trade at 23.96 pounds .

Putin demanded from Kiev , the recording of `` statehood talks '' with the Eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin asked Russian media reports said on Sunday that the Ukrainian Government to end the fighting against separatists in the east of the country and receives directly with negotiations to `` rule '' the breakaway region .
His spokesman Dimitri Peskov was later clear that Putin had not meant that under the control of the separatist region of eastern Ukraine , a part of Russia will , but that his status towards Ukraine should be redefined to the Russian-speaking region the power to to provide representation of its rights and interests .
Putin 's call to the Kiev government to negotiate on equal terms with the pro-Russian rebel fits however since the start of the riots five months ago apparently pursued by him strategy : helping the separatists in taking of territories and pressure on the Ukrainian government to the newly proclaimed Region Novorossija to allow de facto independence for an alliance with Russia rather than the West .
In an interview with the state television channel one Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recapture held by separatist territories in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk , which were taken in March and April , after Moscow the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea had annexed on 18 March .
The Kremlin and the separatists have called the occupied territory as `` Novorossija '' or `` New Russia '' lately , a term reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary heyday of the Russian Empire .
Putin pointed out that all those who hope in the course of campaigns Ukrainian politicians for the elections on Oct 26 , and during the reign of groups to attack civilian communities in the areas held by separatists for early peace talks `` caught in its illusions '' are reported Itar -Tass .
`` We need to immediately enter into detailed discussions , not only on technical issues , but also to the political organization of society and the state status of East Ukraine , in order to safeguard the interests of the people there , '' he said .
Peskov said that Putin 's reference to the law in the context of greater autonomy must be seen to be discussed by the Kiev leadership for months to allay fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk .
Only the Ukrainian government may grant the eastern parts of the necessary autonomy , Peskov said .
It is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia , Peskov said , `` because it 's not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine , but an internal conflict in Ukraine . ''
The clarification of the Kremlin speaker to correct the `` misinterpretation '' of Putin 's remarks underscored the leadership of Russia in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the East as opposed to the direct annexation of the Crimea , where the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians .
Moscow would have far greater difficulty , the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine to annex , since most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and surveys from the period before the conflict resulted in a large majority for remaining in the Ukraine .
The autonomy that was approached by Russian diplomats in international forums would give the regional governments in Ukraine authority to negotiate their own trade agreements and foreign relations , and so the Kremlin effectively give control of an area that the Russian territory with the Crimea connects .
The annexed five months ago peninsula in the Black Sea is the home port for the majority of the Russian Navy and an important trading port and historic coastal region .
The regions between the Rostowgebiet in Russia and the Crimea is also rich in mines , factories and foundries that manufacture key components for the Russian military .
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko suggested in his inauguration speech on 7 June that the Ukrainian legislation - after elections - should consider additions to the Constitution , with which the respective regions greater control over their finances and the status of the languages ​​is given .
But his idea of ​​autonomy seems to stand in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels , their armament and incitement Moscow accused .
Putin 's last call to Kiev to negotiate with the separatists leaders at eye level , followed by a further advance of the rebels in the past week after Russian troops and tanks invaded over the previously peaceful areas along the Sea of ​​Azov in the eastern Ukraine .
The Russian-backed separatists took by surprise , which is the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to the Crimea , according to Ukrainian security official fears that control of Novoazovsk .
Because of this massive civil and military preparations are under way to fasten a steel industry Mariupol port with 500,000 inhabitants , lies between Novoazovsk and the narrow access to the Crimea .
Poroshenko said on Saturday at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels and asked for urgent action to prevent another Russian aggression against Ukraine , a former Soviet republic that is independent for 23 years .
`` We are nearing a point at which there is no turning back , '' warned Poroshenko .
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine .
The EU summit decided any concrete actions that leadership demanded the design of further sanctions against Russia , which should enter into force at an unspecified escalation of Ukraine crisis .
Ukrainian soldiers had to retreat in Ilowajsk from their positions after two Russian armored columns and 1,000 soldiers last week entered the Donezkregion to support the beleaguered separatist , Colonel Andrei Lysenko , spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council reports said on Saturday in Kiev ,
The first probably 63 Ukrainian soldiers who were trapped by the Russian invasion of Ilowajsk were exchanged on Sunday against 10 Russian paratroopers who had been captured a week ago on Ukrainian territory , Lysenko said on Sunday .

The villa had probably existed from the first to the fourth century AD , until the arrival of the Germans in what was then Roman Rhineland , suspected Morscheiser .

With Rona Fairhead , the BBC may have found the great director , she needs .
She arrives with a proud fame train of the banking world , the media management and the inner circle of the Tory party .
And it has its own combat experience .
Her career began with the global management consulting firm Bain and Co. , after which she moved to Morgan Stanley , Bombardier , ICI and the media world of Pearson .
She was seven years Chief Executive of the Financial Times and stepped back as the top item of the parent company Pearson went to a younger male counterparts .
Your severance was allegedly almost £ 1 million .
Her political ranking is solid .
It was recommended by David Cameron , Lord Browne , the former head of BP , as this was looking for more private-sector expertise in Whitehall : it became a consultant of the Cabinet .
Her husband is a former Tory councilor .
As early as May , I described the task of the Chairman of a poisoned chalice .
Not only is the BBC as a huge and complex unity at the heart of public life , but there is also an internal paradox in its structure .
The Trust works in two directions : inwards towards the first guard of the own management hierarchy in the BBC , but also to the outside as the voice of public concern and unrest , when things go wrong .
This ensures an almost untenable duopoly , which requires a complete comprehensive reform .
But what new incoming chairman would risk to begin to embark on anything and dismantle an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty , while this itself might bring about his job .
It is a difficult task .
And as if not enough , are also still many interested in the BBC reduced to see - obsolete power , money and status .
While the competition is getting closer and new technologies threaten old , comfortable collateral , the upcoming negotiation of royalties for the BBC is associated with special risks .
For the modest sum of £ 145.50 a year , the British public will buy into the certainly largest media companies in the world .
The BBC tells a good story : it says that it reaches 96 percent of all households and each of them only 40 pence per day costs .
And apparently increases the BBC on the popularity scale up again : 53 percent support today , compared to 31 percent 10 years ago .
The viewing and usage habits for the BBC have changed : nowadays I get news headlines on my phone and see missed programs later on my iPlayer .
But it remains a very beloved and respectable institution .
She needs a considerable chairman - I hope they found him .

Hütteldorfer after second win of the season in third place in the table .
With the 2 : 0 over Grödig has taken a conciliatory end on Sunday for a bitter Rapid week .
`` The victory is very liberating , '' said coach Zoran Barisic , whose team reached the off in the Europa League on Thursday an interim low .
`` The sense of achievement was incredibly important , '' confirmed Captain Steffen Hofmann and scorer who pushed forward with green and white in third place .
Schrammel-Traumtor brings Rapid to winning ways Rapid has shown with the second win of the season the right response to the disappointment to Helsinki and goes with a sense of achievement in the international break .
`` We wanted to show a positive response , '' said full-back Thomas Schrammel , who has paved the way to victory with his splendid leadership volley from Sechzehnereck after 14 minutes .
`` I thought , I hau the frustrations of Thursday pure and smacked him under the bar , '' the 26-year-old said with a smile .
Had met as Schrammel 13 Novmember 2010. so far the last time in a Bundesliga game that was still for Ried .
The first Championship goal in Rapid 's suits will therefore remain in his special remembrance .
`` For me , this is something very special , I 'm from the Rapid-junior '' Schrammel said .
Due to the short-term pelvic Blessur Mario Pavelic moved Schrammel from the left to the right defensive side and also made a very good job there .
He has enough experience that he can exercise this position reversed .
He deserved the goal he has this year already made some assists `` praised Barisic .
Team shows character Schrammel also supplied the cross for 2 : 0 by Hofmann after the hour , which finally brought the decision .
Because before that might well have write the guests .
`` Thank God we have had some luck today , '' remarked also Schrammel , who thus alluded to the divergence of performance and result in recent weeks : `` The results have not voted , but playfulness has always been good compared to last year '' ,
Barisic was even that one `` in many games before better than today '' was - against `` the strongest team that has played this season in this stadium . ''
The first three Punkter since July 26 have therefore proved that the team structure was intact despite the setbacks , `` Today my team has shown that it has character . ''
For him , no less gratifying : `` The fact that we finally played back to zero '' .
A lot of work during international break also the fact that with Brian Behrendt , Mario Pavelic , Christopher Dibon , Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger multiple failures are to be deplored , and Srdjan Grahovac , Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger gave their Startelfdebüts , the victory makes even more valuable .
`` One must not forget , '' Barisic , with Behrendt and Pavelic players lost in the past three days , `` which were very stable lately '' admonished .
The international break should thus be used to `` to lick wounds and a bit zuzulegen in the physical realm , '' said Barisic who has five Under-21 players in its ranks .
One , the break probably comes particularly located , Captain Hofmann .
He tears up for the team , going through pain over it .
In this difficult period , he has shown that he is a very important player for us , `` stated Barisic .
Hofmann gave the Rapids game before being substituted in the 68th minute , not only the structure but also scored the second goal .
For the 33-year-old who completed his 350th Bundesliga match , it was the first hit out of the game since November 2 , 2013 ( 4 : 2 over the Admira ) .
Hofmann : `` Can not believe that now everything is good '' `` We 've certainly had a bit of luck , but eventually the luck must come back to us as well .
Now it was high time , `` Hofmann said .
He warned course to concentrated Next work : `` One must not always see the black and white .
We have in recent weeks played not as bad as has been shown .
But we must not also believe that now everything is good .
The importance of his role for the team , he could not deny .
It 's a very young team , I can help at the moment very much .
The talk in certain phases but at me to `` , Hofmann said .
Grödig coach Michael Baur and his team had little to reproach .
He regretted the quick goal `` from the category magic door '' , as well as the regular gate of Nutz in the 40th minute which was disallowed by referee Kollegger wrongly .
The only criticism that I can make the team is that we in some stages were not concrete enough towards the goal .
Since we have had too little accounts .
Centre Back Maximilian Karner saw it similarly : `` It has the same bad start , then we have found but pure , and even scored a goal .
On the whole would have been possible more .

Exclusive extract from Howard Jacobson 's acclaimed new novel about love and the letter `` J '' .
They melted away , so you could best describe it , they broke up slowly like a box that you have in the rain leave .
Occasionally told him a woman that he was too serious , demanding , intense , distant and perhaps a little crabby .
And then shook his hand .
Crabby he knew .
He was prickly as hedgehogs in , yes .
The last victim of this Stacheligkeit was just incipient affair that had been promising for relieving lonely boredom of his life as usual , and might even have brought him a certain satisfaction .
Ailinn Solomons was a trembling delicate beauty with untamed hair and a fluttering heart of a village in the North Island , which was even more remote and harsher than Port Reuben .
She had come with a previous accompaniment to the south , held the Kevern for her aunt , and had inherited in a damp but paradisiacal valley with the aptly named Paradise Valley a lot .
For several years no one had lived in the house .
The pipes were leaking , were in the bathrooms even spiders , slugs had left their mark on all the windows and thought they owned it all , and the garden was overgrown with weeds that looked like giant cabbages .
It was like the house of a children 's story , both menacing as tempting a garden full of secrets .
Portrait of the author : Howard Jacobson , whose novel `` J '' stands on the longlist for the Man Booker Prize in 2014 .
The shortlist will be announced in the coming week .
Kevern had sat holding hands with Ailinn on the broken sunbeds in the tall grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon . Both had absentmindedly snapped into the service console with soothing music and calming messages supplied the land , as the sight of her crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song of a long-forgotten black entertainers , which his father loved listening with closed shutters in the house ,
Your feet are too big .
Because of their innate aggressiveness songs of this kind were not played on the console .
Not prohibited - Nothing was really banned - just not played .
It has been successfully obsolesziert so obsoleszieren like the word .
The general taste managed what decrees and regulations have never managed and how people choose books at the From the rags-to-riches memoir , cookbooks and romances , so they chose the ballad with the music .
In the euphoria of the day Kevern began playing an imaginary piano and to sing big feet in a rough-comic Serenade Ailinns .
Ailinn did not understand .
`` This was a well-known song of a jazz pianist named Fats Waller , '' he told her and automatically put two fingers to his lips .
That his father had always done to stop the letter J , before he came out of his mouth .
It had started out as a game between him and his father when he was young .
His father had played it with his own father , as he had told .
When you begin a word with a J , without laying two fingers on your lips , it will cost you a penny .
It was already at that time was not a very fun game and it was now not very funny .
He knew that this was expected of him , that was all .
It had to explain what was jazz .
Ailinn had never heard what .
Jazz was , even though he was not directly prohibited , not played .
The improvising was no longer modern .
There was only room for one `` if '' in life .
People wanted at the beginning of a tune to be quite sure where they would end up .
Likewise , the mind .
His unpredictability made people nervous .
And Jazz was musically expressed understanding .
Although he had become 10 years old without having heard from Sammy Davis Junior , knew Kevern about Jazz from the semi-secret collection of old CDs of his father .
But at least he did not have to explain Ailinn that Fats Waller was black .
At her age , she probably could not remember a time , in the pop singer were not black .
Again was , no laws or constraints .
A conforming society meant that every element of this society gratefully agreed to the principle of group talent - grateful as the spared by fate .
People with African-Caribbean origin were eligible by temperament and body type for entertainment and sports , so they sang and ran .
People who originally came from the Indian subcontinent , were blessed by nature with such electronic talent and were cared for with the task of ensuring that no family remained without a functioning telephone service .
What was left of the Polish community , taking care of the sewage system ; what was left of the Greeks , smashed plates .
Those whose grandparents had not left the country quickly from the Gulf states and the Levant as WAS DONE WAS WHEN IT DONE WAS to be geschah- lest charged fire inciting , for fear even that the flames would consume the next - had Labneh- and shisha pipes restaurants opened , talked and were considering depressed with the inaction .
Each according to his abilities .
Since she had only heard ballads , it fell Ailinn hard to understand how the offensive words that had just sung her Kevern , were each set to music .
Music was an expression of love .
`` They 're not really offensive , '' said Kevern .
Except perhaps for people whose feet are too big .
My father never insulted anyone , but he loved this song .
He talked too much , but the neglected garden gave him the false sense of security .
Nothing could overcome the sound of giant cabbage-like leaves .
Ailinn still did not understand .
Why would your father something should love ?
He wanted to say that it was a joke , but hesitated to put in her presence again two fingers to his lips .
She thought already that it was a little weird .
`` It seemed to him funny , '' he said instead .
She shook her head in disbelief , blocking Keverns view .
It was all over the world to see nothing more than her unkempt black hair .
There was nothing he would not otherwise want to see .
`` If you say so , '' they mean without conviction .
But that does not explain why you sing to me .
She seemed worried honest .
Are my feet too big ?
He looked again .
Your feet so not right .
Maybe your knuckles , a little bit ...
And you say you hate me , because my ankles are too thick ?
Hate you ?
Of course I do not hate you .
It 's just that stupid song .
He could have said `` I love you '' , but it was still too early .
`` Your thick ankles are exactly the reason why I like you , '' he tried instead .
I 'm a bit perverse .
That did not sound right .
It was supposed to be funny .
If he was trying to be funny , he brought himself often in trouble because he does not like his father had the soothing charm , the one needed to tame the inherent cruelty in jokes .
Perhaps his father wanted to be cruel .
Maybe he wanted , Kevern , be .
Despite his friendly eyes .
Ailinn Solomons blushed and rose from her deck chair , threw to the console and spilled the wine they had drunk .
Elderflower wine , so was drunkenness is no excuse for him .
In her excitement she seemed to tremble , like palm fronds in the storm .
`` And your thick head is exactly the reason why I 'm attracted to you pervert , '' she said ...
Except that I 'm not .
He felt sorry for , both because of the unnecessary rudeness of his words as well as the fear that showed in her eyes when she rebelled against him .
She thought that he would beat them ?
She had not told him about the life on the cold northern archipelago , where she had grown up , but he had no doubt that it is essentially so was like here .
Here , the same huge and icy ocean broke down as there on the shore .
The same confused men , with even thicker skin and morose after what had happened as it had been their ancestors as a smuggler and beach robbers moved from pub to pub , always ready to raise his hand against a woman who refused to join them or ridiculed ,
Dick head ?
They would have shown her a thick fist when she was not looking !
They snog only - smooching was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women , an antidote to the bland love ballads from the console - they smooch first and then beat .
After Keverns view that was an unnecessary refinement since the smooching itself already constituted an act of violence .
Ailinn Solomons gave him through her a sign to go .
He rose from the deck chair like an old man .
She felt too leaden , but the force of his sadness surprised her .
That was not the end of the world .
They knew each other hardly .
She watched him as he walked away - like from a room upstairs while her companion was watching him - man , weighed down with something that he himself had conjured up .
Adam leaves the garden , she thought .
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general , although some had their hands raised against them .
A man turned away from her , bent his back , ashamed , defeated without fighting spirit - why that was a sight she seemed to know well if you still could not remember a single time , in which they anything like this before had seen the day before ?
When she was alone again , Ailinn Solomons looked down at her feet .
Several years ago the just told incidents worked Esme Nussbaum , an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow , the non-legislative monitoring body for the public mood , on a short presentation about the continued violence in low- and middle-level in exactly those areas , where the reduction , if not elimination have been , most likely to occur , given the money and energy that had been invested in the eradication of this violence .
`` It has already done a lot , and a lot remains to be done , '' she wrote , `` to appease the innate aggressiveness of a people led thousands of wars and most of them won , especially in the remote areas and valleys of the country , in where the sweet breath of human kindness has been historically despite the towering steeples between the hedges rarely felt .
But some characteristics turn out to be ineradicable .
The higher the steeple , it seems , the lower the passion he still wakes .
The population is crying while listening to sentimental ballads , drunk with stories about Overcoming difficulties and asserts firmly believe in the virtues of marriage and family life , but not only keeps the former rudeness rural communities as well as our urban fabric firmly in hand , but there is also evidence for the emergence of a new and sneaky contentiousness at home , at work , on the streets and even on the playing fields .
`` You have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate , '' said her mentor , when he had read the whole report .
I suggest that you read less fiction .
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head .
I also have to ask : are you an atheist ?
`` I think that I need not say , '' replied Esme walnut .
Are you a lesbian ?
Again Esme invoked their right to privacy and denial of testimony .
Feminist ?
More silence .
`` I do not ask that , '' Luther Rabinowitz said finally , `` because I was against atheism , lesbianism or feminism .
This is a prejudice-free workplace .
We serve an unprejudiced society .
But certain types of hypersensitivity , which is absolutely acceptable and laudable in itself , can occasionally results as you imagined it , distort .
They themselves have obviously prejudices against the Church , and those things that you describe as `` sneaky '' and `` raw '' could of course strength and vitality are interpreted by others as well as an expression of .
If you continue on the harping , what will happen is when it happened is as if it , if it had happened would have happened yesterday , means the country to take its essential vitality .
Esme walnut looked around while Rabinowitz said .
Behind his head a repeated LED lettering in Flamingo Pink the advice that Ofnow had left the country in the last quarter of a century or longer .
Smile your neighbors , you cherish your partner , listen to ballads , visit musicals , use your phone , talk , explain , listen to you , you agree to excuse yourself .
Speaking is better than silence , the sung word is better than the written , but nothing is better than love .
`` I understand completely , what are you getting , '' Esme Walnut answered in a calm voice , as if she was sure that her boss had finished speaking , `` and I say nothing more than that we are not healed as effective as we delude ourselves .
My concern is that we might find there again without warning us , as we repeat the mistakes that led only to what HAPPENED WHEN IT HAPPENED ever .
This time there are not the other , where we leave our anger and our distrust .
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands .
In order to imply patience of a saint .
`` You go too far , '' he said , `` if you act as a '' call errors `` who our grandparents may or may not have committed .
You go too far , if you say that they had omitted their `` anger '' and their `` distrust '' of `` other '' .
It should not be necessary actually to remember someone in your position that we and `` others '' speak in understanding the past as in the protection of the present , not by `` us '' .
There was no `` we '' and there were no `` other '' .
It was a time of disorder , that 's all we know .
`` From when we are honest with ourselves , '' Esme dared to interject , `` can claim no part of society , to have behaved well .
I accuse no one .
Whether it was done badly or well , what 's done is done .
That was then .
This requires nothing more to be said - because we agree .
And must be assigned to exactly how not to blame , as well as any debt must be repaid if such repayment would be appropriate and if there was a way to repay it .
But what is the past if we do not learn from it -
The past is to ensure that we forget .
If I may say something to -
Luther Rabinowitz let coincide his pyramid .
`` I will consider their report , '' he said , and dismissed them .
The next day when she went to work as usual , she was hit by a motorcyclist who was passers as described , driven in a `` brutal anger '' on the footpath .
Coincidences there .

Ebola : The epidemic burdened West Africa 's economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a serious blow to the economy .
Markets have been orphaned - and international companies go the distance .
The devastating Ebola epidemic offset the economy of West Africa a severe blow .
The harvest rotted in the fields , the mines are left orphaned and the markets - the virus has severely the region added .
Some international companies are already at a distance .
`` The Ebola epidemic is not just a medical crisis , but also an economic , '' says the head of the African Development Bank , Donald Kaberuka .
Liberia is the hardest hit
`` It 's a total disaster , we lose a lot of money , '' says Alhaji Bamogo , who sells on the second largest market in Liberia 's capital Monrovia clothing .
Hits the market , only those who want to buy food or something for disinfection against Ebola .
Liberia is the hardest hit by the virus alone here fell fever more than 600 victims .
Recently declared the health authorities , the disease had advanced in every corner of the country .
Even in Guinea , Sierra Leone and Nigeria , the virus has spread .
In total , more than 1,500 people died , thousands more infected per se .
Foreign companies deduct employees
Everywhere in the resource-rich countries put companies out of their operation .
Foreign companies like the steel group Arcelor Mittal deduct their employees , several international airlines no longer fly to the affected regions .
The local traders and farmers respond : Few merchants will leave their homes to get supplies .
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia who are under quarantine , rotting among other things that are important for the export cocoa and coffee beans in the fields .
The farmers do not dare to leave their homes for the harvest .
Food is scarce
`` People are getting less traveling , '' says Phillipe De Vreyer , Paris Expert for the economy of West Africa .
The man , for example , which normally goes to the market and sells his vegetables , prefers to stay at home .
Therefore , the population gets the consequences of the epidemic to be felt directly and urgently , food is scarce .
In the markets of dwindling supply of staple foods such as rice .
At the same time heavily dependent on international companies Region threatens a loss of image - with far-reaching consequences .
The greatest danger is that international companies generally avoid the area for a long time , says Philippe Hugon of the French think tank Iris .
What matters is how far and how long the virus will not spread .
For investors the impression could arise , `` that it is dangerous to live in Guinea , Sierra Leone and Liberia , and thus also to invest , '' warns Hugon .
The disease burden and the strained budgets of States
The disease also burdened the already strained budgets of the countries concerned .
The rating agency Moody 's is concerned that their budgets are strongly stressed by the high costs for the health system and also from the deteriorating economy .
The African Development Bank pledged already , help out the health systems of the affected countries at 60 million dollars ( 45 million euros ) .
Noticeably , the effects are already in Nigeria , where so far only a few Ebola cases were diagnosed .
While the oil-rich region in southern Niger Delta is not affected so far .
But elsewhere already many people stay at home for fear of contagion .
Even reservations in hotels back significantly .

Production in the euro zone on a 13-month low
The increase in production in the euro zone slowed in August to the lowest point of the past 13 months , a closely watched study .
The final Markit purchasing managers ' index in the manufacturing sector ( PMI ) fell in August to 50.7 in , after a reading of 51.8 in July .
An indication over 50 indicates an expansion .
New orders declined and factories experienced burglaries in a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia via Ukraine .
Making the numbers before the meeting of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) on Thursday a .
The markets expect the Bank a clear plan for dealing with a faltering recovery in the euro zone as well as the threat of deflation in an inflation rate of only 0.3 % .
There is speculation to the fact that the head of the ECB , Mario Draghi , could provide further information during the course of this week , if he draws a quantitative relief for the euro area into consideration , according to those that were made by Britain and the United States during the financial crisis .
`` Although a small growth is better than no growth , the braking effect of the growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty for manufacturers have become more apparent , '' said Rob Dobson , senior economist at Markit .
The factory PMI for Germany , the largest trading partner of Russia in the EU , fell to its lowest level in 11 months at 51.4 .
In the meantime , fell in the second largest economy of the block , France , the PMI to 46.9 .
France remains a problem child , as well as the descent in Italy of a solid expansion to stagnation .
Evidence that incentives for growth in key industrial mechanism Germany , Spain and the Netherlands are no longer effective are also not reassuring , `` said Mr Dobson .
The decline in industry probably stoking the fire of analysts expect further monetary or fiskale incentives .
Positive news came from the Republic of Ireland , where the PMI rose to 57.3 , its highest level since the end of 1999th
Howard Archer , chief economist at IHS Global Insight , said : `` The best thing you can say for the purchasing managers ' index in the manufacturing sector in the euro area in August is that after the sector continues to grow . ''

A charter for all the complicated details but it is not .

However , the NRW-CDU stands by its no to a toll equal on all roads .
Merkel stressed Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble ( CDU ) bring constructively in the discussions for a bill .
About the topic , he had spoken with Dobrindt also other ways to enable more private capital for investments in infrastructure , such as also in broadband expansion .

CDU Vice Armin Laschet reiterated its objections .
`` The coalition agreement was never expecting to bemauten all county and federal highways , '' said the North Rhine-Westphalian CDU regional chairman .

4 tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you want to take pictures or videos underwater , there is a selection of devices .
The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot , like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam like the GoPro Hero3 + Silver Edition , both of which can be had for about $ 300 .
I took these photos on a family celebration with several cameras , all of which are available at a price of under $ 350 .
Regardless of the equipment , there are some rules for the best results .
Control your equipment twice .
Even if you have a waterproof camera , make sure that the battery compartment and other compartments are sealed .
Make . Your camera also on the photos or videos , which you want to record
Some cameras and camcorders feature scene and shooting modes with which the exposure time for the dim underwater conditions is optimized .
And before you jump into it , check the depth to which your equipment is functional .
Some cameras are only allowed up to 5 feet , others to 50 or 60 feet .
Search through our Buying and reviews for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models .
Make multiple recordings - because many will not fold .
Point-and-shoot cameras have an LCD , allowing you to compose images , Action Cams normally .
Even if you have an LCD , it is difficult to consider this under water , and the correct image adjustment is a matter of luck .
So you make a lot of shots .
If your camera has a series mode , with a series of shots with slightly different exposure settings to be made , then use it .
Stay close to the surface .
The light is dramatically worse the farther you move away from the surface .
If possible , so stay close to the surface , if you shoot in a pool , a lake or the sea .
This allows you to bring more color to your photos ; The deeper you go , the less color you will see .
Walk up close to the objects .
This is also good advice to country , but he is under water all the more important because of poor lighting conditions .
It is especially important when you are working with an action cam : These devices often have a fixed wide-angle lens , which means that you need closer to your objects if they are to fill the entire image frame .

Tax burden of businessmen in the Washington area increases with the economic recovery
An economic recovery means more customers , more sales and new jobs .
It also means higher taxes .
State and local tax bills for businesses in the country rose last year slightly , while accelerating the economic recovery , a new study published in the past week , and the company in the Washington area were no exception .
Companies in the District , Maryland and Virginia together paid $ 27.6 billion to state and local agencies in the financial year 2013 , an increase of 3.8 percent compared to the revenues of 2012 totaling $ 26.6 billion .
The state and local tax burden of companies rose last year by 4.3 percent to 671 billion $ to , compared to 3.9 percent the year before , and it was the third consecutive year of growth after the several years of declining assessments in 2009 and 2010 ,
State taxes rose more sharply than the local taxes , by 4.3 percent , according to the study , which was carried out by the service agency Ernst & Young with the Center for State Taxation , a tax policy group .
More than half of the tax revenues of the District , 56 percent comes from corporate taxes , while 36 percent of the revenue from Maryland 's undertakings .
Virginia scored 28 percent the lowest tax revenue from businesses .
Much of the increase in tax revenues is due to a recovery in property values ​​of companies , researchers , which resulted in an increase in property taxes by 3.7 percent this year after three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent say .
While a large part of these gains came from large states like California , New York and Texas , the process seems to be true also for the Washington area .
Companies in the District , Maryland and Virginia together paid about $ 10 billion in state and local property taxes last year , compared to 9.6 billion dollars 2012 - an increase during the year by 4.2 percent .
But the apparent recovery in housing values ​​is in Maryland is not as effective in increasing state and local tax revenues because the property taxes amount here on just over one fifth of the tax assessments of companies .
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay nearly half of their state and local taxes in the form of property taxes .
`` The following occurs in Maryland : a large part of real estate , particularly in the tax area to DC , is either owned by the government or by non-profit organizations that pay no property taxes , '' said Douglas Lindholm , Managing Director of the Center on State Taxation .
Maryland is therefore forced to rely for example much more on income taxes in order to provide the same services may be offered by other States .
The recent rebound in tax revenues by companies can not be attributed solely to the recovery of the property market
Corporate income seem to recover well , the data .
Companies in the region reported on income tax in the state organizations of $ 2.3 billion compared to 2.1 billion in 2012 .
Maryland took $ 1 billion in corporate income taxes , the highest amount in the region .
While the trend in the same direction , the local tax burden for companies not rise evenly in all three locations .
The rate of increase in the District corresponded with 4.3 percent the national average , while the increase in Maryland was markedly higher , 4.9 percent .
Only Virginia reported a below-average tax revenue of 4.1 percent .
Virginia has 6 per cent in all three official areas which significantly lowest corporate income tax ( in all three there are fixed corporate tax rates ) .
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and in the District at relatively high 9.975 percent .
A similar study by the US Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that in Virginia less state and local business taxes are required and a better overall control climate prevails as in Maryland .
In the study , the District has not been studied .
Despite the advantages Virginia is pressurized by its southern neighbors .
North Carolina has adopted legislation to reduce its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent , the same rate as Virginia , and the rate will fall to 5 percent in the coming year .
If the state continues to achieve its income targets in the coming year , this bill could reduce the corporate income tax rate of the state until 2017 up to 3 percent .
In the meantime , it seems the small businesses in the Washington area better to go , and therefore they pay more state and local taxes , as the most recent study .
Corporate taxes , which are paid as personal income taxes by small business people - a transition structure , according to which the majority of small businesses are organized - in the District , Maryland and Virginia rose last year by 20 percent to 2.4 billion dollars , a significant faster rate of growth than the corporate taxes in total .
The researchers say that the trend and the rise will probably continue in the corporate tax rates across the country this year , with an increase in general More Wehr tax revenues for the state and the local governments by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to same period last year .
Nevertheless , the Washington area could lag if the spending cuts the federal government affects the labor market in the region .

Amazon buys Twitch for $ 1.04 billion
AMAZON confirmed just what information was reported on Monday morning : The online retailer - and video producer , and a variety of other things - is buying the video streaming service Twitch for $ 1.04 billion ( 970 million USD ) .
The announcement comes as a surprise , not because no one had a takeover of Twitch expected but because it was widely believed that YouTube would acquire the company .
Three months ago it looked as if the sale of Twitch to the video service of Google decided for a cool billion thing , and cooperation also appeared naturally .
Twitch , founded only three years ago as Justin.tv , was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube .
Instead , it quickly became a platform for players who wanted their bravura pieces published in games , a `` YouTube for live games , '' said an insider .
The Twitch interface .
And `` Let 's Play '' , a video genre , the ( mostly older ) give in the alls play an air of secret science theater , are on YouTube already very popular .
The fact is that YouTube is often referred to when describing Twitch , so was the news that YouTube Twitch wanted to buy , received a bit bored , a textbook example of an established technology company that buys a potential competitor .
It is a mystery why the deal with YouTube was not successfully , as the company reportedly was willing to pay as much as Amazon .
All we know right now about this statement of Emmet Shear , President of Twitch : `` We opted for Amazon , because they believe in our community , they share our values ​​and long-term visions and they want to help us quickly get there. ``
Another secret is , frankly , the incredible success of Twitch .
For snobs like me who declare that they prefer to play sports than watch her , it 's hard to understand the attraction , which assumes watch others play themselves instead of taking the control console in the hand .
It 's one thing to a friend by 3 clock in the morning to look over his shoulder as she sneaks through Resident Evil , and quite another to watch a spinner in how he is shot 20 times in succession in Call of Duty in the head .
All these games you could now watching .
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are first-person games , so the Watching without their own control over the viewing perspective may be a really good recipe for a headache .
I admit that the quick runs in the complete the Roger Bannister of our electronic age all the games in record time , are entertaining .
But as long as not a game or a virtuoso humor is going to be Twitch channel is probably not so very interesting .
But what the skeptics as I know it already ?
Twitch is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic peaks .
And how exactly will Amazon make it money ?
It is hard to imagine that Twitch is so elegantly integrated into Amazon Instant Video , like YouTube Twitch just could swallow .
But Twitch has something that every business would like to have : thousands of young men who are being courted as advertisers .
As the chairman of Twitch , Shear said , Amazon and Twitch `` both believe in the future of gaming , '' and the media shows no signs of shrinking , not even - gulp - as a spectator sport .

Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher death rates by ovarian cancer in rural areas .
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have a video tribute for her mother put online , who died of ovarian cancer in 2007 .
For women in rural areas of Australia , there is a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than women in cities .
Researchers analyzed the medical records of more than 1,100 Australian women , in which 2005 Ovarian cancer has been found , and found that only 25 percent were still alive five years after diagnosis .
The lead researcher Susan Jordan from QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those who lived in rural and remote regions of the state , the risk of death during the study by 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas .
SMALL STUDY : New drugs could slow lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers examined the medical care of women over seven years .
Dr. Jordan said that a woman 's age at diagnosis , the type of ovarian cancer , pre-existing conditions as well as the social and economic status also influenced the chances of survival .
For older women and those whose cancer was more advanced at diagnosis , the survival rate was lowest .
For those who lived in rural and remote regions of the state , the risk of death during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas .
Although the study did not examine why women living outside the city are more likely died of ovarian cancer , Dr. Jordan suspected a delayed diagnosis and the lack of access to the best treatment centers as possible factors for it .
`` This disease is best treated by gynecologic oncologists , and these are mostly to be found in major cities , '' she said .
Despite the improvement of telemedicine services , to oppose the distances something she suggested as a possible remedy a gain of service flown in doctors before to give specialists the opportunity to provide women closer to their home , as well as treatment programs for people living outside their region .
Dr. Jordan said that the study regardless of geographic status a poor long-term survival rate in women of ovarian cancer revealed and underlined the need for better treatment and prevention strategies .
The funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer study is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia .
In March 2013 told Elisha Neave , a young mother of 33 years from the Gold Coast , that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer .

Lenny Henry : My father never took me in his arms .
Never said `` I love you ''
Henry was one of seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in the year 1958th
His father , who died when Henry was 19 , worked in a factory and their relationship was limited .
Henry is rehearsing for a comedy , Rudy 's Rare Records , partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and from the series was on Radio 4 .
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap , with lively melodies .
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments .
He visited `` many '' therapies after his mother 's death , and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father .
It was hard to know him .
You never saw his face , only heard his voice : `` Listen to the noise on .
Let your sister in peace .
Move !
I want to watch cricket .
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who were already grown up when I was a child - went with him to the pub and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass , or the beauty of a cricket stroke .
I never had such a conversation with him .
A large part of my life it was this serious guy in the corner who was reading the newspaper .
Recently Henry opened a foundry in Dudley , and although the conditions are better than in the days of his father , he nevertheless won an insight into how life must have been for him .
It is now a little brighter , but they are dark , smoky , deep Stygian labyrinth with flame shock and smoke and lots of soot .
My father lay formerly simply into the tub and then you could hear him slowly as he began to sing , because he could wash the foundry itself .
When I walked around there , I realized that he had done for years , to bring the food to the table , and my respect for him grew .
Nevertheless , Henry grew up as a child without his parents ' expressions of love .
My father never hugged me , he never said `` I love you '' .
Only when there towards the end of her life suffered by my mother , we began to `` I love you , I love you , I love you '' to say .
By his own daughter Billie , with Dawn French , he was able to share the love that he had missed as a child .
Could you even with the `` I love you '' stop ?
Stop it but to embrace me !
Dad , I 'm 22 !
with Dawn French .
Why should not we be friends ?
She is a great mother .
It 's still friends with French , with whom he was married for 25 years .
Dawn is a good person .
Why should not we be friends ?
She is a great mother .
Henry 's mother was diabetic .
That contributed to her death .
So when I very was very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes , my doctor said , `` You must be radical .
So I moved through this fitness thing and also had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms .
It 's very hard .
And it 's exhausting .
No one likes to eat carrots .
Henry 's career change is perhaps in its elegant , close-cropped beard .
Since he has been praised by critics for his Othello , he is paid to the theater .
This was followed by The Comedy of Errors , and then Fences by August Wilson .
That 's a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that have filled his busy working life .
He started only 16 years ago when he worked in a factory .
A DJ spotted him on the stage , as he imitated people and wrote to New Faces of him .
His television career began in the mid-seventies . `` I was the only black impersonator / comedian on television for quite a long time . ''
He learned on the job .
I had to grow up not only before the public eye , but also learn from 1975 to 1985 , as I was able to be an efficient jokes-narrative machine , while I was a star on television , and it was really difficult .
Lenny 1975 New Faces
As his manager the stage right at the Black and White Minstrel Show possessed a light entertainment program , in which the people `` black anmalten '' , Henry led his comedy there over five years .
In my family it was very uncomfortable .
I wish somehow that it never happened , but I do not regret that I did it .
It was a weird , uncomfortable position for me , but I was working on big projects , and learned how to deal with a large audience .
But these `` years of award-winning lightweight pillar of British television '' was also a `` grotesque parody of black people . ''
The introduction of characters that the British black culture both mocked as celebrated , Henry worked in the eighties to an alternative comedy circuit .
The first row of the Lenny Henry show went on the air in 1984 , and in the nineties he has worked as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Head ! known .
Advertising , documentaries , TV series and movie roles marked his next decade , but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv 2008 , he thought to himself : `` What are you doing next , Len , because it all feels like when you bring only the time rum or will walk a little on the spot. ``
Thereafter , a documentary series for Radio 4 was titled What 's So Great About ... ?
The first episode turned to Shakespeare .
In Shakespeare I was downright allergic .
I had never learned in school right about him and held him for a domain predominantly middle-class whites in tights and a cabbage in front it .
So I was very afraid .
Everyone we interviewed for the show , Peter Hall , Trevor Nunn , Adrian Lester , Judi Dench said , `` You should try it .
Do not make it bad if you do not know what you 're talking .
Take a couple of words in his mouth , and then you 'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so .
Henry led to 20 lines from Othello 's last speech on the documentary and he was thrilled .
I had the feeling that I could do it .
It was almost as if someone had finally put my head right .
`` That 's what , it 's a serious matter , take them seriously , learning your lines , researching a bit .
The samples were brutal , and I read this piece for months before we did .
And it was a success .
They seemed to expect a car accident and that just did not happen .
And soon he appeared in the comedy of errors .
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I could not believe it .
There was a moment when I thought , `` Oh , you 've changed . '' ``
There was a technical error and Henry felt instinctively that he had to entertain the audience .
`` A little voice told me , '' You have now bridged 10 minutes while they repair the computer. `` ''
Instead , the stage manager announced that the show would go on , once the problem had been solved .
I walked off the stage and something inside me said , `` Oh , thank God . ''
I am not responsible for it .
I can leave someone else .
`` You play in a play , so stay in your role . ''
Henry in Fences at the Duchess Theatre
To learn the text for Fences was demanding .
Panic is very good , which strengthens the tendons .
Also was well received , so it is like a big sign of the gods who tell me `` This is your destiny . '' ``
He says this , of course , with a thundering voice .
So I stick to it .
I really love that .
I love to be in a rehearsal room .
But Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is permeated by humorous outbursts , while he imitates persons repeatedly .
I have decided not to make stand-up comedy , because I think that this kind of instant gratification of a room full of strangers is somehow dangerous .
If you are looking for the all the time , you go with it before a wall .
I step sometimes live at the Apollo when I feel like it , but overall it does not give me as much as before .
I ask him if he will ever again make a stand-up comedy tour .
The fun I had in a room with a director who helps to shape a beginning , middle and end of a journey - I do not think I want to give up ever again .
Is this so its new incarnation ?
I think so .
I like being an actor .
It 's fun .
One always tells a story , and that 's great .
I love stories .
People love stories .

Judge temporarily stops law that all abortion clinics in Louisiana could force the closure
A US federal judge on Sunday stopped provisionally the implementation of a law in Louisiana , said of the lawyers that it would probably have led to the closure of all five abortion clinics of the state .
This measure , which has been made into law by Bobby Jindal , the governor of Louisiana , in June and September 1 , will come into force , would doctors who perform abortions , compel a patient enrollment right at a hospital within a radius of 30 miles to acquire their practice .
The decision of the judge , however , means that doctors can continue for the time being legally perform abortions , while they apply for such a right .

Within a month a hearing for the judge is set to bring about a more permanent decision for the law .

Thousands of Israeli children from the areas near the Gaza Strip returned on Monday back to school after they had spent the summer in bomb shelters , while rocket and mortar fire came down and on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas Schools in Gaza remained closed , while the area of ​​the fighting recovered .
The school brought the launch of rockets drawn bullet holes communities in southern Israel a sense of joy and anticipation , but the signs of the battles are still fresh .
In the southern city of Ashdod remote employees of `` Pashosh '' -Kindergartens , which was hit by a missile , before the arrival of students shrapnel from the walls and sliding panels .
`` We have a little bit afraid , but excited , '' said Ronit Bart , local resident in Kibbutz Saad and local English teacher .
Many children from our area desperately need a return to a routine .
Your 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it felt `` a bit weird '' to suddenly go back to school .
`` Those were difficult times , and we are not at all gone out of the house , '' she said .
President Reuven Rivlin visited the kibbutz near the border with Gaza , to offer his support .
Until a ceasefire interrupted the war last week remained thousands of residents of the border communities as Saad in their homes or left their homes to farther from Gaza to move to safer areas and to avoid the rocket and mortar fire .
Many residents of Nahal Oz , a community near the border with Gaza , in which a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar shell , still reluctant to return .
The Ministry of Education announced , about a dozen families had not yet returned .
Their children were provisionally accommodated in other schools .
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot , a border town with Gaza , which is ravaged by Palestinian fire .
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said `` we will ensure that their knowledge Acquire and provide you security . ''
Israel and Hamas agreed last Tuesday to a unbefristeteten ceasefire .
The ceasefire provided for an immediate end to the fighting ; However , important issues remain unresolved , such as the demand by Hamas for a lifting of Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of the air and sea ports in Gaza .
Israel calls for disarming Hamas and handing over the bodies of two killed in the fighting Israeli soldiers .
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin later this month in Egypt .
In the war , more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed , three quarters of them civilians , and at least 494 children , according to estimates of the Palestinians and the UN .
Israel denies this information and estimates that there are at least half of those killed is fighters , but did not provide any concrete evidence to support this information .
On the Israeli side , 66 soldiers and six civilians , including a Thai worker killed .
Hamas and other militants in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortar shells during the fighting on Israeli towns from which most of the south .
Meanwhile , led the Israeli military by more than 5,000 aircraft and other attacks .
Damaged or destroyed Israeli attacks thousands of houses in the Gaza area and around 250,000 people studied in more than 100 UN schools refuge that were converted into temporary shelters .
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the shelters and continue the fighting , the education authorities last week postponed the start of the school year .

On the bouncy castle at the garden party on Saturday was a lot going on .
The concept of the organizers agreed .
Despite strong downpour on Saturday night an estimated 1200 music fans came to the open-air festival in the castle garden .
At times , had to be stopped the intake .
`` This was annoying , '' said Ron Sem , one of the organizers .
Salzwedel l light and fun .
Of two Spanish words Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem have formed the name Amula .
For the Open Air in Burggarten Salzwedel should radiate brightness during the day and in the evening through various shows .
Well , the fun comes by themselves anyway .
This was evident already early Saturday , when the first visitors encouraging respect for Open Air .
A festival for all generations had promised the organizers .
And they succeeded .
Around the supply stands in the castle garden meadow it had Salzwedeler , but also guests from near and made himself comfortable .
They followed the first live performances , bobbing his foot in time , enjoyed cool drinks - in short , pure relaxation and enjoyment were announced .
And across the generations .
While lounging on a blanket on the extra-angekarrten white sand at the beach , others feasting on a quarter of wine in the wine cellar , the young raged on the bouncy castle , which was a great attraction for the younger guests .
But even when face painting , volunteers had their hands in the truest sense of the word fully to control the crowd and to conjure up imaginative creations in the little faces .
The older children took advantage of the table soccer or participated in a skateboard workshop , to the Good Foot crew from Salzwedel hosted .
Until the big rain came .
Shortly before 17.30 clock he pelted down on the visitors , especially families ran away and dryness .
But the attractiveness of the feast did no harm .
`` There were more people than expected , '' said Ron Sem , the `` success across the board '' spoke of a .
Therefore a repetition of the big party next year precludes anything .
Although necessary to work more on content and size of the event , Sem made in a first record on Sunday against the People 's voice clearly .
When angry he described that in the meantime the intake had to be stopped .
Obviously , the security firm had been booked with insufficient forces .
The result : Some who had already paid were no longer on the site .
The response was very good .
In a first tentative estimate of Salzwedeler co-organizer of about 1200 visitors who cavorted in the Burggarten said .
There were problems with the sound equipment .
Therefore Salzwedeler hip hop band Blocks`n`Rox broke her appearance from exasperated .
The technicians were not able to create a halfway reasonable sound .
The planned hookah lounges could not be established because the tents could not be brought to Salzwedel because of a flat tire .
`` Next year , however , they are doing '' , said the organizer .
The premiere of Amula Open Air was visits more than succeeded .
And in bad weather .
However , the organizers have made some mistakes that are forgiven the first time yet , but must be disposed of in the second edition .
In the social network Facebook , organizers must take criticism .
`` Sorry , but for twelve euros you expected more , '' said Melanie Meier expresses at the event page .
`` You have taken a bit sadly , '' Ele Carpenter says in the same place .
Others see the initial problem is not quite as tight .
I find it very good that some not only talk stupid , but really try to put something together .
Hats off ! `` Stephanie writes for Jenß Amula .
Now the organizers remains a year to remedy these criticisms .

House prices have experienced the biggest increase in winter seven years shows a widely observed index .
The RP Data Core Logic Hedonic Home Value Index of particular houses in the Australian capital rose in August by 1.1 percent , so the RP data on Monday .
With this increase , the total increase is in June , July and August at 4.2 percent , the largest increase in the winter months since of 2007 .
The annual price increase was 10.9 percent , more than twice as high as the increase in the 12 months to August 2013 but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country .
The research director of RP Data , Tim Lawless , said that Sydney and Melbourne drive a two-tier market .
The figures from RP Data show that house prices in Sydney rose last year by 16.1 percent , against 11.7 percent in Melbourne .
The following markets are Adelaide , Brisbane and Darwin , where prices rose by an average of five and six percent .
At the other end of the scale is Canberra , which was hit hard by the cuts in government spending and where prices rose over the year by only 1.4 percent .
Mr. Lawless also said that with the beginning of spring , an increase would be observed in the property for sale now for the coming months , which would subject the market `` a real test . ''
`` If you look at the constantly high rate of sales prices , a generally rapid sales rate and the persistent low interest rate environment , it is likely that home prices will rise even further in the next three months , '' he said .

Children need roots and wings
44 years he was in the teaching profession , including 23 as a head teacher .
From that time Manfred Richter knows many seasoned Peter Hausener and Kollbacher from their time as students .
His methods were sometimes unconventional , but always supported by his quest to see the students humans .
Sněžka is the most famous mountain of the Giant Mountains .
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motive of his home .
Richter was born in 1930 in Trutnov / North Bohemia , today Trutnov .
Already with 14 he became interested in after four years of high school for the teaching profession .
One year later , the Sudeten Germans were expropriated .
Within half an hour , the family had to leave their house .
After a few months in a camp it was in 1946 after Bayern - in the boxcar .
So was staggered judge the Upper Franconian village sinks .
The teacher training was held in Bamberg .
These Manfred Richter had six ten kilometers walk to the next station a week , take the train to Bamberg , there walk three kilometers through the city to school and back in the evening .
After two months , Manfred Richter was in a Red Cross home in Bamberg a sleeping : with up to 15 fellow students in a dormitory .
In 1951 he made the first and in 1954 after three years of teacher trainees the second state examination .
Since Upper Franconia for him had no vacant teaching position , he applied to Upper Bavaria and came on November 1 , 1954 , the school in Kollbach .
The `` Miss-room '' was his first `` official residence '' in the schoolhouse .
In 1958 he moved into the newly built house next to the school teacher a three-room service apartment .
This house was bought by Manfred Richter in 1980 , after the school had been dissolved in 1968 Kollbach .
Until then there were in Kollbach in Schulverband Petershausen-Kollbach three classes and in Petershausen five .
From the school year 1968/69 these were summarized in Petershausen in today 's town hall .
As the Schulverband Indersdorf was founded , only the primary school remained in place .
In order to avoid a downgrade in the now smaller school , joined the then Rector Georg Sigl to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor .
But Petershausen grew , and so the children and their teachers could relate to today 's construction , from September 1982 , which was extended by Judge retirement in 1997 .
Manfred Richter praises the simple generosity of Mayor Ludwig Götz , who had also rely on community charges a workroom and a broader 1997 basements , although that was not eligible under the guidelines for school buildings .
`` Mayor Götz was very friendly school , '' says Richter remembered gratefully .
In his whole career Manfred Richter has never forgotten the speech of a government representative who had responded to a presentation of a School Board on Law and Justice : `` We must never forget the love . '' Manfred Richter sat around , what he had heard as a young teacher .
`` You have to give to the children two things : roots and wings , '' says the now 84-year-old .
And he had to learn : `` This does not always succeed '' . Whether he as only his students or just his own six children said , is not entirely clear .
In any case , the judge was doing sometimes unconventional .
When students started fighting , they received from him not as a detention and have not been sentenced to detention .
At the expense of the community had two pairs of judges can purchase boxing gloves and let the two rivals compete against each other , even if the baby you should have a violet .
For the benefit of the school used as a judge Rector a good relationship with the then Mayor Ludwig Götz ( CSU ) .
This moved the non-party judges after retirement to 1996 to stand at least the last on the CSU list for the local council .
But Richter was selected in sixth place and joined the CSU .

China refuses Hong Kong law on government election , protesters vow retaliation
On Sunday , the Chinese Parliament , despite the increased calls for democratic reforms decided against the nomination of candidates for the elections in 2017 by the Hong Kong electorate .
This approach probably fired the long announced protests in Hong Kong 's business district , while activists initiated the planning and mobilization to within hours of the announcement in the way .
The decision of the Chinese People 's Congress will allow the Communist leaders in principle , reject all non Beijing loyal candidates .
`` This is not unexpected , but it makes us angry , '' said legal expert Emily Lau , chairman of the Democratic Party .
That 's not what Beijing had promised .
You lied to the people of Hong Kong .
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime .
In his defense of China 's decision said Li Fei , Deputy Secretary General of the Standing Committee of the National People 's Congress that allowing public nominations in the elections for the Hong Kong government to `` chaotic '' would .
Since 1997 , when Britain returned control of Hong Kong to the Chinese , Beijing has promised to let the people choose the government presided from 2017 .
The Chinese leadership presented the decision of Sunday as a democratic breakthrough because it gives the citizens of Hong Kong direct suffrage , but the decision also makes clear that the Chinese leadership firmly maintains the flow through a controlled closely by Beijing nominating committee in his hand .
According to a new clause also should only candidates are admitted `` with love of country and love for Hong Kong '' .
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest protests in Hong Kong and publikumswirksamsten held for several years .
Behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the movement Occupy Central With Love and Peace , whose organizers have threatened to foreclose the financial district , if Beijing does not allow genuine universal suffrage .
On Sunday night gathered within hours of the announcement , hundreds of Occupy Central supporters in the rain in front of the government headquarters in Hong Kong .
The demonstration organizers said that their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience and they were planning a protest wave in the coming weeks .
However , they did this , no further details , apparently in order to avoid problems with the authorities .
In an online message , the organizers stated that the movement `` has drawn the occupation of the central district only as a last resort , an action that should only take place when all dialogue opportunities have been exhausted and no alternative exists .
Sorry to have to say that all dialogue opportunities have been explored today , and the occupation of the central district will definitely take place .
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for days to the announcement in Beijing , and there were on Sunday in front of the government building more stringent security measures , including police officers and barricades .
The riots are reinforced by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they slowly lose control of their city .
The influx of people from the mainland increased competition for products and services .
In addition , the fear grows that the values ​​of Hong Kong begin as democracy and freedom of speech under the growing pressure Beijing to crumble .
Some criticized the demonstrations of the Occupy Central movement as it business operations - the lifeline of Hong Kong - hazardous .
`` The protests , of which they speak , could cause great economic damage , depending on how many are involved and how long they last , '' said legal expert Regine Ip , which has long criticized the movement .
We do not want stoke fears that Hong Kong out of control .
This impression is bad for investment .
The state-controlled media in China also reported recently on democracy activists in Hong Kong as controlled by Western powers subversive agents .
This summer organized an unofficial referendum activists to the voting rights , where 780,000 people took part - over a fifth of voters in Hong Kong .
In July , tens of thousands took part in one of the largest democracy demonstrations in the history of the region .

Andrew Lawson was a man of the variety whose character changed things , even in such a gigantic organization like the NHS .
As an advisory anesthetist he devoted his career to the task , both to spare the patients the agony of the disease as well as the anguish of treatment .
Among his patients , so remembers his wife , was an MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture .
Lawson knew that the doctors diagnoses and diseases are important , while the treated are mainly busy with something completely different : pain .
One day in 2007 , he was the one whose ordeal began .
`` I did not feel , '' he wrote in May of this year .
I had difficulty to rouse me .
While he struggled with the flu-like symptoms , he noticed that he eagerly reproached his wife Juliet .
`` I want it all at once rather than later , '' he noted .
As Juliet was for a week on a business trip to Lawson felt quite unusually , and worried for no reason .
Something was in the air .
He asked a colleague to make an X-ray examination of his chest .
Just two weeks ago he had been in the French Alps for skiing .
The result of X-ray examination was before .
He was suffering from mesothelioma , an incurable cancer , which the pleura , so attacks the lungs be coated skin .
As with most cancers , the exact trigger is often difficult to determine .
For example , while some smokers develop lung cancer , lung cancer sufferers all have not been previously smoking .
But mesothelioma is different .
In almost all cases the trigger is an asbestos - contact with the fiber building materials , once as a `` miracle substance '' was but has since been recognized as deadly .
For most of us , mesothelioma is a disease that can easily ignore how .
Asbestos is ultimately a product of the past .
The most dangerous type of asbestos was no longer used in Great Britain since the 1960s , when the industry voluntarily undertook , this no longer use .
Even where it was still used , only people working in certain sectors directly with the substance - plumbers , construction workers , carpenters and shipyard workers , for example .
As an industrial hazardous substance from another time , he now seems to be hardly worrying .
But this complacency is misplaced .
United Kingdom , it seems , is today experiencing the culmination of a Mesoltheliom epidemic .
There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world .
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year , twice as many people die from this disease than in traffic accidents .
Annual numbers of Mesotheliomtodesfälle since 1980 and likely future deaths in the UK
The reason why we are experiencing the deadly effects now , although asbestos is illegal for years ( 1999 , all types of asbestos prohibited ) , is that a mesothelioma developed after decades .
And the scourge of mesothelioma is not limited to former workers of the construction industry .
Asbestos was , and is often still present in the houses in which we live , the offices where we work , the schools where we learn and the stores where we shop .
And therefore knows Mesothelioma no class barriers , financial limits , professions or age .
The privileged bastions , from the elegant department stores in London up to private schools , are not a shelter .
The Parliament buildings are contaminated with asbestos .
Even in the hospitals where we need not be healthy , have already been identified as initial foci of this deadly carcinogen .
Andrew Lawson was not old .
He was not a plumber .
It was hard indeed to imagine where he could possibly come into contact with asbestos .
Then he found out .
`` It looks as if a lot of asbestos was present in the tunnels at Guy 's Hospital , where I completed my education for six years . '' he wrote .
All - students , nurses , doctors and porter - use the tunnel .
One wonders how many of my peers are suffering from the same disease ?
Unfortunately , he could at least partially answer this question .
`` Of the four doctors who have been trained at Guy 's Hospital , and the sick in the past five years to mesothelioma , '' he wrote in 2010 in a letter , `` I am the last one who is still alive . ''
How many of us are still ill ?
At Andrew Lawson mesothelioma was diagnosed at the age of 48 years .
When he died on 17 February this year , he was 55th
This was an unusually long survival .
Fifty percent of all Mesotheliomerkrankten die within 8 months after diagnosis .
The disease is always fatal .
Therefore , we can only repeat Lawson 's question : `` How many of us are still ill ''
The leading expert of Britain to mesothelioma , Professor Julian Peto , believed to 1870-2050 , when the asbestos epidemic in the UK is expected to grind to a halt , a total of 90,000 of the disease have fallen victim to .
Most of them do not have any idea that they are going to die so at the moment .

A quick look at the records of the courts to which the parties concerned often call for compensation claims , shows how far the scourge of Mesothelioma is already widespread .
In June this year Marks & Spencer admitted , for example , to have negligently exposed to asbestos Janice Allen .
She worked for nine years for the chain from 1978 to 1987 , was in charge on the clothing department at two sites - one of which is the flagship store on Oxford Street .
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years than when she started working at M & S .
Now she has two children in their twenties .
`` Before this thing , '' she says , `` I had never heard of mesothelioma , I do not even really knew anything about asbestos .
I never thought that this would affect me times .
There are few people who know a lot about asbestos .
The fact is that the term asbestos is not a substance , but a group of six minerals relates .
The name comes from the word `` asbestiform '' ago , a description of the fiber structure that makes the material resistant and flexible .
Three of the six were used in construction .
Chrysotile , also known as white asbestos , which today is by far the most commonly found asbestos in buildings .
It was used for roof tiles , floor tiles , pipe insulation , boiler insulation , even for brake linings in cars .
It is less deadly than other forms of asbestos , but is considered yet by the EU and the WHO as a `` major health hazard '' or death .
More dangerous , however , is the brown asbestos ( amosite ) and the blue asbestos ( crocidolite ) .
Britain was once the world 's largest importer of brown asbestos , and experts suggest that `` there is significant , but indirect evidence that this was a major reason for the unique high Mesotheliomraten . ''
An employee of Marks & Spencer has been suspended in the flagship store in Oxford Street , London , asbestos Alamy
Janice Allen has perhaps not seen as a typical Mesotheliomopfer , but the work of Julian Peto suggests that her story is by no means unusual .
He has conducted a study of those affected submitted , is shown in that `` a substantial proportion of mesothelioma with no known exposure was probably caused by work or in the home by asbestos contact in the environment . ''
A majority of these contacts based on his testimony to the `` normal use and aging '' of our building .
It looks as if no one could expect to be safe .
A report by Goddard Consulting , which has studied the Palace of Westminster shows how people could also have been at the heart of government , unknowingly exposed to the substance .
2009 Goddard reported that the service shafts and pipes were contaminated after the committee rooms of Parliament with asbestos , whose fatal fibers could be stirred up by something as harmless as `` strong air movements '' .
Parliament members are often accused , to look after their own interests , but here it looks like , as would apply to the reverse .
While the Directorate of the Parliamentary Labor Service insisted that the Palace of Westminster had received a `` clean bill of health '' , it is now undisputed that must be applied £ 1 billion effort over several years to renovate the Parliament to modernize the electrical systems and the asbestos to remove , and that after the general elections of 2015 , the Members will probably take more at the nearby QE2 conference center than on the green benches in Westminster .
The Goddard report also pointed out that `` the presence of asbestos has not been handled in accordance with the relevant provisions . ''
No one can know if this mismanagement will cost lives .
Anything you can do now is wait .
A person who was able to determine the exposure to asbestos never exactly is Graham Abbott , a general practitioner .
As Andrew Lawson believed the 50-year-old Abbott that he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals .
`` I worked in a hospital , were decided positively in the asbestos litigation , '' he says , `` but I can not prove it in my case .
It is so difficult to remember all the places you 've worked , and to the data .
What did he still remembers the exact day early December 2009 , where he got such a kind of fever .
He was 45 , and led straight late in the evening an operation .
Suddenly I had chills .
It came all of a sudden .
I felt terrible .
I thought no longer to create the ride home .
As a doctor , knew Abbott that the pain from the pleura , skin stemmed around his lungs around .
But as Janice Allen he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma .
He did not go a month working .
Surprised doctors did X-rays of his chest and put on Pleurakathether to remove fluid from the lungs and to test in the laboratory .
His complaints , however , remained without diagnosis .
His health improved slowly , and he returned to work .
However , from time to time , the symptoms returned , often after exercise and heavy breathing .
2011 was a patient Abbotts with similar symptoms in his practice and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma .
But even now it is not joined Abbott in his own case .
After all , his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with asbestos .
The compound in the case was clear .
In September 2011 , Abbott 's condition deteriorated again and his doctor brought his CT scans and X-rays to an expert group .
In December 2011 , exactly two years after Abbott had felt ill for the first time , equipped with a camera probe was inserted into the cavity between the rib and the pleura .
I am an optimist .
I 'm mostly just continue , `` he says .
Frankly , I had not made me so worried .
But Rachel , my wife , was worried .
The result of the biopsy was the week between Christmas and New Year before : `` They told me that it was mesothelioma . ''
Graham Abbott : mesothelioma diagnosis
Suddenly Abbott had to take appointments with Macmillan nurses , one of which told him a lawyer .
Only now he realized the extent of the epidemic .
`` It turned out that asbestos was very widespread , especially in large public buildings , where pipes were often insulated with asbestos , '' he says .
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings , ill now .
And so mesothelioma will now face younger people who have not worked in the typical occupations .
The most dangerous pipes with asbestos insulation in hospitals were below the earth , so patients were more likely not exposed to the substance .
But many employees who transferred in pedestrian tunnels from one building to another ( as Andrew Lawson ) or ate in canteens underground ( as did Graham Abbott often ) , were most likely in contact with toxic substances .
It turns out that for several decades after the war hospitals for patients were potentially life-saving , but life-threatening for the attending physicians .
He is still far today .
Students presented their Bunsen burner from asbestos mats .
And it concerns not only hospitals .
Asbestos has been widely used because of its fabulous insulating and flame retardant properties in offices , shops , libraries and town halls .
Even schools .
In fact , many people have probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom .
Throughout the country , thousands of hours chemistry , students have parked their Bunsen burner on asbestos mats .
On the subject of asbestos is now websites frequently addressed in schools .
And meanwhile , have so innocent objects in our homes as floorboards or shed roofs default contain asbestos .
`` It is an industrial poison that in large parts of our real estate is included , '' remarked Andrew Morgan , the lawyer who has represented Andrew Lawson in his trial of Guy 's Hospital .
In one case , was the only contact that occurred an affected woman , the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s .
So beware how you demolish your garden shed .
The effects of diagnostics , and the knowledge that the disease is incurable , is immense .
`` It takes a while to process it , '' says Graham Abbott .
I went back to work and tried to go on , but I realized that I could not concentrate on what I was doing .
I was two weeks in practice .
Then I knew I had to go and I take care of myself .
Well , I 'll see no more Christmas .
With the greatest difficulty was the change in perspective from the position of a doctor to a patient .
Like countless patients before him , he remembers how he was overwhelmed by all the information that he had to come to terms .
`` It was very hard to take it all , '' he says .
`` I asked my doctor , '' as long as I do ? ``
And you gave me about 12 months .
I remember that I thought , `` Well , I 'll see no more Christmas .
That 's it. `` ''
Mesothelioma is particularly insidious because it is our life-support mechanism - the breathing itself - is that caused the deadly cancer .
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by exposure to asbestos .
Asbestos consists of tiny fibers .
If the asbestos is swirled and the fibers are inhaled , they can relax in the pleura , the skin around the lungs , fix .
Asbestos fibers irritate the pleura and can cause cell mutations .
`` The problem arises with the needle-like asbestos fibers inhaled , '' said Professor Tom Treasure , a cardiothoracic physician who moved to the Guy 's Hospital in 2001 .
Exactly the hospital , from the Andrew Lawson believed that it has exposed him to asbestos , is now ironically , a leading center for the treatment of mesothelioma .
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were probably also exposed to asbestos during their training at the hospital .
Once the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue , says Treasure , `` they are pushed out of the breathing process to the edge , where the skin is .
By nature , it is invasive from the beginning .
The usual options for other cancers not work as well with mesothelioma .
The effectiveness of an operation , for example , been hotly debated .
Some say that it was worth a try .
Treasure denies this .
`` You can not cut out the pleura , '' he says .
They come with the knife not around it .
Meanwhile , says the cancer `` to chemotherapy is not very good , '' the `` effect shows '' , but does not heal .
`` Sometimes there are long-term survivors , '' says Treasure .
But in the end they all die .
Fortunately , some patients live really long , much longer than expected .
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis .
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis Graham Abbott is still struggling .
Having contacted mesothelioma , Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson , who had become four years after his diagnosis , a one-man support and advisory office for Mitbetroffene .
`` Hello , cancer center , '' he introduced himself with calls happily .
`` He was very positive , '' says Abbott .
He had his diagnosis received 4 years ago and was still very active .
Originally Abbott had been offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would last four months and probably prolong his life only by one month .
`` I was desperate , '' he says .
I wanted to give up .
Lawson , however , made it `` things to make them appear in a more positive light . ''
After consulting several doctors Abbott , decided his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang Lazdunski continue cardiothoracic specialist at Guy 's .
`` We had an advantage in that I did not have to be made , I just called and got an appointment , '' Graham admits .
A normal patient would have to get a referral and have to wait for the approval of treatment .
Money is crucial for mesothelioma sufferers to perceive the best available therapies .
But if these treatments ultimately fail inevitably , are many sufferers of another financial worry - about the future of the families they leave behind .
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation .
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP .
`` It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous for your health , '' says Morgan .
But what in the 1960s has changed , that it was realized that even a very low burden posed a health risk .
And here the negligence of the company began to play a role .
Andrew Lawson and Guy 's Hospital made their case finally at , but it was not what Morgan calls a `` full compensation '' , as Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was attributed to asbestos a contact at Guy 's .
After investigating his death a spokesman for the Guy 's , but confirmed that `` the asbestos fibers have been removed in the affected basement area in the 1990s . ''
That was too late for Andrew Lawson .
How asbestos can be removed
Indeed , it is for mesothelioma sufferers who seek to compensation , an enormous problem , assign the deadly asbestos contact a company or workplace - usually decades after the events .
Many of their former employer have been sold or closed .
Insurance documents can be lost .
And those who defend themselves against claims , know that the time for them , but certainly not with the plaintiffs .
In response , there was this year significant new legislation that makes it easier for mesothelioma sufferers easier to sue for compensation , even if their former employer are not to be found .
The law has a funded by the insurance industry fund of £ 350 million set for all who have been diagnosed by June 2012 , be able to demonstrate a contact , but can sue anybody .
In these cases , the applicants will receive 80 percent of what a court in an ordinary lawsuit for damages they could award - about 120,000 pounds .
Approximately 300 successful applications to the program are expected per year .
Andrew Morgan thinks like so many mesothelioma sufferers that £ 350 million represented a `` very good job '' in the insurance industry .
`` That 's a deal from insurers for insurers , '' he says , and suggests that it is this amount to a quarter of these , which insurers would have paid if the time would not ignore gone above and mesothelioma sufferers find the company and they might accuse normal .
Even Mike Penning , the then Work and Pensions Minister , admitted that the law `` not perfect '' is .
But both Penning as Morgan agreed that in view of seven deaths a quick action is necessary daily .
`` The people are suffering so much and need help now , '' said Penning during the second consultation of the mesothelioma law in December of last year .
At this point , Graham Abbott was in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang Lazdunski for 19 months .
After their first consultations Long-Lazdunski recommended an operation , from which it expects a positive effect unlike Tom Treasure .
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy , with the Lang-Lazdunski can present a survival rate for five years of up to 40 percent .
Abbott felt strengthened .
`` This is of course with the most important thing , '' says Abbott .
This can be seen repeatedly in patients .
There 's something that keeps you going up .
If you give up , you 're doing very rapidly worse .
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012 .
He had the end of August the last of six chemotherapy cycles behind .
Aftercare scans showed no signs of disease .
Then I had a scan in March 2014 .
There were several cancer-spots around my chest .
I was just 50th
This is not life-threatening .
That 's lebensbeendend .
Again , Abbott underwent six cycles of chemotherapy .
Now no trace of the tumor longer visible .
But the process is physically and mentally exhausting .
You have to think of practical things - about the money , if I 'm not , for example , or my wife to show how the boiler timing works .
If you get bad news , you will be negative .
You must look to the future .
As a father of Ellie , 16 and Tamsin , 14 , which is not always easy .
`` For parents , the difficulties , '' he says .
It 's hard to know what to say and how much .
When I received my first diagnosis , I told my girls that I had a disease with which I would not be old .
They had varying reactions .
Tamsin is very sociable and boisterous .
They told their friends and soon we got a lot of calls .
Ellie was more reserved .
They did not say much .
Such conversations are something that have to go through all cancer patients .
But for Mesotheliomerkrankte such talks are not permeated by hope , not a trace of hope of survival .
The disease brings ( as ultimately also for Stephen Jay Gould ) a grim security .
As Andrew Morgan says , `` mesothelioma is not life threatening .

Feminists criticize racial issue and police behavior after Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson , Mo . earlier this month .
The participants raised their hands in the air and sang , `` Hands up , do not shoot , '' while she waited outside the funeral .
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson , Mo , because of the shooting death of unarmed teenager Michael Brown , the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists .
After her experience set white feminist commentators sex before the race when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income inequality .
While tensions in the Midwest but rose and across the country were given attention , saw Perez that the responses of white women turned to 100 % to the breed .
Compared with the responses of black women shortly after the shooting on August 9 , the personal essays came with titles such as `` thought to Ferguson by a white woman '' and `` feminism is not just about the oppression of women '' relatively late .
But for Perez meant an important change .
`` I do not think there are many people in the feminism that will be on the White and speaking privileges on such high-class kind , '' she said .
People felt urged to express something to the incidents .
It is characteristic of the crisis in which we find ourselves , and because the situation in Ferguson is ethnicized that you need to express that .
For English Professor Koritha Mitchell from Ohio State University Ferguson brought problems to light , which black Americans are exposed to every day , but which are not considered to be `` women 's issues '' in the cultural space .
`` I can publish something funny on Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 Likes from everywhere , '' said Mitchell .
If I post something about how Colored stand in their own country under siege , the silence is deafening .
`` How can it be safe for women to speak publicly about a relationship , but not on safety in public places ? '' she asked .
Have studied in US history for black women as Mitchell , the race , gender and sexuality , there is no dichotomy between racial and gender problems .
For them , black women have not had the luxury of the issues cleanly separate ; they live every day in the combined reality .
While white women now join the race and gender issues in the mainstream feminist circles , says Angela Hattery , Professor of Women 's and Gender Studies at George Mason University that her predecessors were doing the opposite .
`` Between 1865 and 1890 , at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the justification was almost always the rape of a white woman , '' said Hattery .
White women had to be involved in the story to justify the lynching .
For Hattery the split between white and black women came to the point where the white fighters for women 's suffrage as Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late years of the 19th century and found that the struggle for the right to vote a on each group could be successful : women or black .
`` They made the decision to stand up for women 's suffrage , and the right to vote for blacks was to come later , '' said Hattery .
If one remembers such things , one realizes with power , why black women white women do not dare .
We have our job not done well .
We have never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons .
Even after women were given the right to vote in 1920 , it took another decade until white women organized against lynching in the Association of Southern Woman Hanes Prevention of Lynching .
The group was created almost 40 years after the original request for help on the part of black women , says Mitchell .
For Mitchell , the flood of white feminist responses to the issues raised by Ferguson - police behavior , racial discrimination - a mirror of the time , where white feminists `` catch '' toyed with the problems faced by black women sat down for generations apart .
`` Would not it be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms the right to education of a child would take as seriously as they do with the right to control conception ? '' asked Mitchell .
Feminists of the second generation who have built their careers on the struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives , are now trying to understand what that means .
The famous white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went two weeks after the shooting death of Michael Brown on Facebook and published an incisive article by Rebecca Carroll , a columnist of the Guardian , in which it calls for more protests of white Americans against racism .
`` I hope that women who have a different , but parallel reason to understand a body inherent danger - and views on race that are significantly different in public polls - will lead the changes , '' wrote Steinem .
Although Steinem represents a more intersectional feminism , are addressed in the race as well as gender issues , some are still baffled by their comments on the race issue in America .
Christina Sommers , a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of `` Who Stole Feminism ? '' She told The People that young men in the United States , especially young black men , `` far more vulnerable than their sisters , '' but Steinem comments on Ferguson standing in contrast to her earlier criticism .
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women , but almost nothing for boys .
But when the White House recently released a small program , My Brother 's Keeper , hung up to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men , there were angry reactions from many feminists , including Gloria Steinem .
The ratio of police to the black community is not the only problem that pushes to the forefront of mainstream feminism .
After the US border police have seized nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the southwest border of the country this year , the topic of immigration reform comes to the surface again - this time as a women 's issue .
Andrea Mercado , Co-Chairman of We Belong Together , an organization that mobilized women for immigration reform , said that for a reconsideration of the issue as an important women 's issue , they only had to publish the stories of immigrant women .
`` These speak for themselves , '' said Mercado .
If the vast majority of work visas go to male immigrants who are the women who accompany them , in a position in which they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation .
`` These stories will find an echo in the women 's organizations , '' she said .

The hell decade of the survivors of Beslan : Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school , such as the fact entangled children suffer today .
Ten years ago , more than 1,000 people by Chechen militias in a school in Beslan in southern Russia were taken hostage .
More than 330 people , more than half of them children , were in the three-day ordeal that shocked the world , killed .
We returned to Beslan , to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the atrocity in the classroom .
Exactly a decade after the terrible siege of the school in Beslan , in which 334 people died , including 186 children , warned the heroic survivors last night in front of a new apocalypse in Ukraine .
Took as a fanatical Islamist terrorists children and parents on 1 September 2004 , the beginning of a new school year , captured and killed , seemed like the most evil of evil .
The tragedy united West and East in disgust , and then turned , surprisingly , in action and hope for the future in the middle of the worst misery .
Ten years later , we returned to Beslan , to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the atrocity in the classroom .
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance , though the memory of that terrorist hell they will pursue forever .
Your greatest hope ?
That the war , which Ukraine now haunts - and in the children as they die - now comes to an end .
The girl , who was photographed in an attempt climb back into the battered Schulsporthalle
She was photographed by the famous Russian photographer Dimitri Beliakow and famous when she tried only in their underwear , climb back into the battered school gymnasium after a mine had exploded .
Totally confused Aida looked after her mother Larissa , now 40 years old .
Both were believed to be dead , but she survived .
`` A woman told me that I should run for my life , but I could not , '' said Aida time .
My legs were covered in blood .
I got up and climbed back inside to look for my mother .
A soldier brought them to safety .
After a series of operations they thought he was completely cured , however , said yesterday : `` Three months ago , the pain returned .
I am afraid that I have to have surgery again .
Some shrapnel still in my knee .
Your goal now is to be dentist to help people like her were helped by doctors .
`` This tragedy changed my life , but it has not broken me , '' she says belligerently .
`` That 's happened to me , and can not be changed .
Once a year I always go to the gym , to remind me of those who have stayed there .
My friends and I try on other days not to talk about it .
The pain is too great .
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there .
We played together when we were little , and dreamed of going to school together .
`` I do not want to get married until I finish my studies and my career start .
On a family I think later .
She says that the siege will always remain a part of it , although the memory of each year is somewhat weak .
I am happy that many people around the world still remember our horror and we are so grateful for the help we received from people all over the UK and .
If I line the photo of me see how I climb back into the school , I think a lot of people see it for the first time , understand our disaster and help ensure that it does not happen again .
The boy , who fled through the hail of bullets , in the opinion , was his mother dead
It was his first day of school ( Russians go with 7 years in the school ) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara .
The age of seven , he said , `` Mom told me to lie down if there was an explosion , and hold her hand . ''
After an explosion , he thought she was going to die .
They said to him , `` Run . ''
Fearful that she might be dead , he fled and saw on the way a crying infant , took her by the hand and fled through a hail of bullets .
His father Vladimir , who joined his son outside in the arms , said : `` Damir told me that his mother had died .
He said : `` I could not save them . ''
In reality , Tamara had stumbled outside and with leg injuries in the hospital , turn on the assumption that her son had died .
After their reunion , she said : `` I cried for joy .
I could not believe it .
He ran in and hugged me .
Damir was later flown to London ( from the now defunct News of the World ) to obtain by the then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie the title of Barnardo 's Children 's Champion .
`` This horror haunting you every day , but I wish I could quit remember , '' he said yesterday .
But I can say it is paler in my memory .
I remember that I immediately afterwards threw all my toy guns .
But now I can computer games with shot scenes and that 's no problem for me .
`` I 'm not afraid to go back to the gym , but I do not think about myself after .
I remember these children with whom I played in the yard , and did not make it out .
We never say that they were killed or are dead .
We say that they have remained in the gymnasium .
I remember very well on my trip to London , especially at the toy store , where I could pick me everything I wanted , and the ride in an open-topped car .
But now he 's afraid to place such as Ukraine , where wars cause the kind of misfortune that he and his friends suffered .
This horror haunting you every day , but I wish I could stop myself to remember .
`` I 'm so sorry to all those who suffer from the horrors , '' said Damir , the last week as a volunteer working in a monastery .
I want so much to help .
I will one day go to the police and hope they take me next year at the Training Academy .
His mother Tamara , 48 , said : `` 37 children from our neighborhood were killed , can you imagine that ?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege , there was simply no children who could call and walk around , and this silence lasted for many months .
She vividly remembers her trip to London with Damir .
People in London were crying when I told our story .
I understood then , as people can understand on the other side of the world , our feelings , and show their support .
She was Cherie Blair and her foundation grateful for the price and the possibility to travel to London in autumn 2004 .
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her yourself , that 10 years have passed , but I still remember the meeting me her and her husband in London , and as the Damir and has helped me .
I still remember how Damir wanted something to eat borscht and they called all the local Russian restaurants .
I remember how he played with waiters in a restaurant . Damir shot with his water pistol at them and they ran away and played with him .
And that was only one month after the horror .
I was surprised that the British so willingly shared our pain and supported us .
She said : `` I always think that this world has not improved in these 10 years .
In Ukraine , the war is now on , and every day people are dying , and I believe that many children have been killed and are still killing .
These are precisely those children like ours .
I think that for many of the war is a part of the messages that they hear when they are bored or busy with something else .
I know just what these people feel the whole horror .
And I can not stop doing it , to feel it .
Nothing has changed , the people want to still kill each other and that 's so sad .
Damir was tall and is a very gentle and quiet boy , he is not aggressive or angry .
He is not looking for revenge , for example , he is not overwhelmed by the recent atrocities .
I know that he does not remember it , but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go to the gym and there ignite candles .
When he was small , he suffered - I remember how he sometimes lay down on the bed , her face turned away from us , for hours .
Not asleep , his eyes were open .
I also remember how he threw away all his weapons and other military toys . Damir is now 17 , taller than me , handsome , intelligent and healthy .
I can hardly believe that I had a few hours so sure that he was dead and I would never see him again .
When I recovered after the blast and got to my feet , I looked around , and saw around hell to me , with all lying about body parts .
I was absolutely sure that my little boy could have survived impossible in this hell .
`` I remember that I called to him , '' Damir , run , run away `` , but I was so sure he had not heard me .
But he has heard it and he ran away .
And so life goes on , unlike many others , for us .
Georgy Ilyin , 17
The boy , whose terrible picture after the siege became a symbol of the horrors of Beslan was
Trost : The Beslan survivors Georgy Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege in 2004 , right a picture of George today
His blood-streaked face was lined with fear as he ran for his life , while Chechen terrorists gunned down his classmates .
His image was one of the most shocking symbols for the barbarity of Beslan .
His mother Fatima , 54 , a doctor , had dropped him off for his first day of school before they rushed off to bring her elder son Vladimir to the university .
`` I left the farm about two minutes before the terrorists stormed it , and so my little boy stayed there for three terrible days alone , '' she recalls .
Not quite alone , there was a whole family of relatives from us , but they were all killed .
Only my George managed to survive .
The closer this date gets , the harder it is to remember and talk about it is .
There is no single day on which we do not remind us of this tragedy .
We do not think that it 's a long time ago , I think it would have happened yesterday , some scenes from these days haunt me all the time .
No one will ever forget , I promise you .
Insistently : The image of George ( left ) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was a statue ( right ) immortalized .
I remember that George on this day so much wanted to go to school . He said he wanted to hug his teachers .
I knew only that he was alive when I saw him on TV .
And now there is even the statue of the weeping Georgy in San Marino .
George sees the image does not like , and it is hidden in our home on the bookshelf .
I understand that , but I also think that the people around the world thanks to this image feel our pain .
Georgy says today : `` It is important for that to happen it never again .
`` I doubt that we will ever know the truth .
The people investigating such tragedies again and never learn the truth .
And now they are investigating the crash of the Boeing in Ukraine .
Will we ever find out what caused it ?
This world will be something terrible .
`` I can not understand how that 's possible , because if you ask the people , nobody wants a war , so how does this happen ?
Ten years is nothing in such pain .
We need dozens of years to forget it a little bit .
It has attacked my health and I feel it still .
About three or four years I have had a few nightmares because of the siege , but then it got better .
I went later in 2004 , back to school and had every day anxiety .
I thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed .
That is why I always go to the gym when September 1st is approaching .
I want to express my my old childhood friends tribute .
It 's hard for me to go to the gym , but I have to do it .
I do not feel as victims , this story is now a part of my past .
I will not forget it , but I do not pity me .
My life goes on .
I have finished school this year and visit a medical college in Vladikavkaz .
I 'm going to be a heart surgeon .
My first choice was a training in the army .
I wanted to be a soldier , but my health did not allow that .
I wanted to fight for my country , but that will not happen .
Georgy Fanijew , 20
The boy who survived , though he was caught at the feet of a murderous terrorists
A miracle : Georgy Fanijew was captured during the siege at the feet of a murderous terrorist , but he managed to survive .
During the siege , he was trapped in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb that was attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist .
It really is a miracle that he was not killed .
`` We feel it as if it were yesterday , '' says George , who wanted to go as an intelligence officer for the FSB , but could not do because of health damage caused by the siege .
It 's still with me , there is nothing that I have left behind me .
I 'm older now and people say that children can easily deal with bad experiences - I have to say that 's not true .
`` In 2006 I worked with psychologists and felt after actually a little better , but I can not forget it .
And I 'd like to forget .
2005 - the year after that - was the first and only time that I went to the gym again .
I lost consciousness .
I 'll never go back there and do not ask me to show you where I 've been sitting in this famous image .
Survivor : Georgy Fanijew today , with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is enormous , and I wear it every day with me .
My friends know that I do not like thinking about it or talk about it and they never asked me after school .
Physically I 'm fine .
I should be careful with my injured knee , but now I can run well .
But because of my health , I could not study at the Secret Service Academy of the FSB in St. Petersburg , as I wanted .
I have my documents , also sent medical and they answered that it was not possible .
My second passion was the animals , so I went to the veterinary institute .
I have been there already two years behind me .
He learns the treatment of all animals `` of cats to cows '' .
He said : `` I knew that I would never tell my children about my experiences .
In addition , children should not know anything and they should not suffer it , of course .
His mother Marina , 42 , said : `` This pain never leaves me .
He is in my soul , worse if the anniversary is approaching .
I 'll go to the celebrations commemorating .
I know that George will not go there .
It still needs to be much more violent for him because he was there and I did not .
I waited for him at home and could not help .
I am so thankful to God that he has been returned to me . Here in Beslan are all drawn from it .
It remains in us .
George is now an adult , but this horror is still in him .
It 's hard to accept that , if a bit so happens Unfair .
He is a boy , he likes sports , but he is unable to attend due to his knee .
He was operated on several times , he can run , but do not exercise .
I would say that he has overcome the horror to 50 % , but you can never completely overcome and forget .
This terrible experience will always haunt us .
Many friends and neighbors were killed in the siege , and the only strengthened my pain .
I 've lost a lot of people I knew well and who were dear to me .
My son is with me , and that is the greatest gift that God could give me , but my heart weeps for those killed .
I know of families in which new children were born , but also of widows , who never remarried .
It 's hard to accept that life goes on , even if you do not want that .
I 'll never forget how my heart leaped within me as I saw him in the hospital .
And now I see what 's going on in the world - wars in other regions .
What fight these people ?
Why did they kill each other ?
The war is now very close to our country and I can not believe almost .
We were used to be a friendly country , how can it be that we are now struggling ?
People and children suffer , I am sure that for many children have been killed in Ukraine , and many are killed .
If we could just all grab and throw these Rebels - as far away as possible .

Return to the very American ideal of labor rights as human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have introduced a bill to establish the organization of trade unions as a civil right .
`` Just as unions die , die , the middle-class jobs , '' said Ellison , a Democrat from Minnesota and vice chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress .
Therefore I proudly together with the civil rights icon John Lewis staff the Enabling Act before .
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal possibilities in cases of discrimination because of the organization of trade unions , as with other forms of discrimination - and so will stop anti-union set forces .
Supplementing the national labor law law to create an opportunity for discrimination exposed workers to organize a union representative to a civil court to sue for justice - and to obtain damages or fines - is a sensible and necessary initiative .
But it 's certainly not a radical initiative - at least not by American standards .
In fact , the best way is to understand what suggest Ellison , Lewis and the other sponsors of their bill that would link back to a very American idea .
Despite the setbacks , which the unions have been exposed in recent years - in Wisconsin , Michigan and other states across the country - have Americans once countries around the world encouraged to recognize workers ' rights to expand and to be observed .
There was a time , to the millions of Americans still remember when this country called democracy , freedom of speech , press freedom and the right to organize in the same breath .
When the United States occupied after World War II Japan , encouraged General Douglas MacArthur and his staff the country to adopt a constitution which should ensure that the militarized autocracy Hedki Tojo would be replaced by democracy .
In full awareness of the fact that the workers and their trade unions took a role in the creation of a new Japan , they used a language that explicitly recognized that `` the rights of workers are guaranteed of association and collective bargaining and action . ''
When the United States occupied after World War II Germany , urged General Dwight Eisenhower David and his staff the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that the fascism of Adolf Hitler would be replaced by a strong democracy .
In recognition of the fact that the workers would have to organize , and should raise their voice in the new nation , the Germans added a clause that explicitly testified : `` The right to form associations to the working and economic conditions secure and will improve each individual and each profession or trade guaranteed .
Agreements that restrict this right or aim it is to reduce null and void ; it targeted measures are unlawful .
As the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt presided over the International Commission on Human Rights held , by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was designed , as it was taken over by the United Nations as a global agreement in 1948 added Roosevelt and the other author of a guarantee a that `` everyone has the right to form trade unions for the protection of his interests or to join them. ``
For generations , Americans accept the basic premise that labor rights are human rights .
As this country other countries to discuss how they could form civil and democratic societies , declared Americans , that the right to form a union - and that this union then could take part in collective bargaining as an equal partner with companies and government agencies - to be protected must .
Having these rights in America came under fire , it is actually very wise , to the American ideal to perform again in mind , according to which working people must have the right to unite and make their voices heard in a free and open society .
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. , fifty years ago said :
History is a great teacher .
Now all know that the workers ' movement , the strength of the nation is not restricted , but enlarged .
By raising living standards of millions of people working has created miraculously a market for industry and lifted the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production .
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths , but history preserves .
The history remembers , and we should do well .
The formal recognition of labor rights as human rights - and the enhancement of the protection of citizens ' rights to protect against discrimination in the establishment of employee representation - is long overdue .
Keith Ellison and John Lewis to renew the ideals that have made America great in the past and the promise of democracy cashed .

Matthies says : It 's time for big-linking
Given the galloping technological progress , which threatens to transform our cozy home in high-tech control centers , our columnist Bernd Matthies comfort with a very familiar electronic accessories .
While I write this , my eyes fall on the spiral cord connecting the handset to the phone , and I think : Wow , how retro is that ?

Tighten the castle clubs soon join forces ?
Recently there have been quarrels between the two Wolfratshauser castle clubs .
Now the board members think about possible cooperation after .
As a model for the reconstruction of Wolfratshauser castle led by the late Richard Dimbath , former chairman of Wolfratshauser castle Friends at the project in French Guédelon .
A year ago , there was not a good climate between the castle and the castle club friends Wolfratshausen .
Pronounced seemed different so far the positions should be how to deal with the history of Wolfratshauser castle and a possible reconstruction .
Now the two camps to move toward each other : It will be soon held discussions on a common approach .
This is confirmed by the club directors Torsten Sjöberg ( Burgverein ) and Herbert Piffl ( Burg friends ) on demand of our newspaper .
`` I called and suggested that we could sit down together once Mr. Piffl '' says Sjöberg .
In his view , all the members of both teams could continue pulling back together .
So were recorded faster visible results .
While the castle Friends at the sudden death of Richard Dimbath until recently had a reconstruction of the castle on the mountain forest in the eye , is the castle club Sjöberg the `` development and Erlebbarmachung '' of the site at the forefront .
Herbert Piffl , Vice Chairman of the castle and friends has been very pleased by its own account on the call .
Since Dimbaths death he stands in front of the castle friends .
A new chairman is to be found in mid-September in a general meeting .
Currently the association has , according to the 74-year-olds around 40 members .
`` After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath we leave the association 's activities rest out of respect first . '' This `` thinking phase '' was necessary in order `` to consider how it could go on . ''
According Piffl the new chairman will then go into the conversation with the Castle Club .
Until then , the castle and friends might also make an impression of the mood within their grouping .
A candidate for the presidency , there is not currently says Piffl .
`` But I am confident that someone will find '' . He himself does not want to run , because they are domiciled in Bad Toelz .
The new chairman should be a Wolfratshauser .
The Tölzer wanted in the project `` but very happy to cooperate . ''
The different points of view when it comes to reconstruction are likely to remain in the eyes Piffls in the near future .
It commends Dimbath as `` missionary '' who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle .
Two similar , already far advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not a pipe dream .
A high participation of the population as well as by volunteers from around the world they are a tourist attraction .
Piffl : `` I too was skeptical at first .
But over time I am more and more come to the conclusion that it makes sense to move the project forward . `` It could a '' unique selling point `` for Flößerstadt be created .
There nothing else .
In addition , the project by EU grants , admission tickets and potential sponsors would be financed , believes Piffl .
`` The idea of ​​reconstruction so I will personally do not simply throw overboard '' . He hoped that the castle club in this point may move slightly .
Their goal , the history documented first , `` is important and good . ''
Then you could see .

Clever ways to save money at university textbooks
As the cost of college textbooks for many students be more than 1,000 dollars per year , the fast second semester student Matt Schroeder considered a clever saving idea .
He invented a lending system for books written by graduate students and offered a nominal compensation to delay the return sales .
`` My math book normally costs 180 $ , but I got it for $ 10 for one semester and a Chick-fil-A biscuit , '' said Schroeder , 19 , who attended the Covenant College in Georgia .
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $ 430 , he said .
He spent $ 120 .
The college management said that students on average spend more than $ 1,200 a year for textbooks and study material , but that it would be several cost-containment options for students .
Online shops and creative approaches as the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of choice for students .
Renting textbooks is popular , and so students can use a book for a semester , often at a much lower price than the purchase .
Neebo Inc , which operates more than 250 university bookstores , said that the hiring of textbooks has doubled since 2011 .
Polls in the industry show that about a quarter of the books was hired in the college bookstores last spring semester , said Vice President Neebos Tevor Meyer .
Less than half of all textbooks to buy , according to the trade association National Association of College Stores in campus bookstores .
Here 's the basics for the best deals .
Buy Online
Some new books cost online , only a third of the price for which they are to have the campus bookstore .
The ninth edition of `` Calculus '' VNO Ron Larwon , Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs nearly $ 290 , however , may be obtained from the specialized textbook retailer Chegg.com for $ 239.99 .
Buy Used
If one notes the other or normal signs of use do not mind , used books are a good option .
`` Calculus '' is used to Chegg.com for $ 93.49 to have .
Matt Casaday , 25 , graduating student at Brigham Young University , says that he has spent on Amazon.com 42 cents for a used copy of `` Strategic Media Decisions : . Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business ''
The book was sold new for $ 48 .
Academics like Ingrid Bracey , director of University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls advised students to ask their professors if earlier editions are admissible .
Sometimes the updates for the term papers are not relevant .
In such cases , older issues can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest issue .
Except Chegg and Amazon also Half.com by eBay Inc is a popular alternative for used books .
Rent
Renting textbooks is worth considering if you treat them reasonably well , remember to return them and after completing the course does not want to keep the books .
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book .
A student could , for example , `` Calculus '' rent for the duration of a semester for about $ 20 .
Check with the hire of the provisions of the business , also on penalties , which , if necessary , apply for writing notes , underline or signs of wear .
Tenants beware : If you do not return the book , the penalties can even exceed the price of a new book .
E-Books
Also e-books rather than traditional textbooks are an option .
Sometimes these books de facto be hired by an electronic license for a certain period of wholesalers such as Amazon.com , Barnes & Noble and Chegg Inc. is provided .
In Chegg can `` Calculus '' for 6 months rent for about $ 61 .
Bracey says that students often find in literature courses the best deals , as many classics can be downloaded for free nowadays , while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive .
Look around in any case .
Joe Gault , 29 , who will soon visit the Pepperdine Law School , recommends the ISBN number for the price determination in books , since you can be sure to find the right textbook .
And before an online order you should consider as Gault , if the book is actually available .
This lesson he learned the hard way .
He bought a book that had four weeks for delivery and eventually paid the full price in the college bookstore .

Tax burden of businessmen in the area Washington increases with the economic recovery
A recovery of the economy means more customers , more sales and new jobs .
It also means higher taxes .
State and local notices of assessment assessment notices bills demands levies for enterprises in the country went up in the last year easily while the economical recovery was speeding up , such an again published study in the last week , and the companies in the Washington room did not form any exception .
Companies in the area District , Maryland and Virginia paid 27.6 billion to state and local authorities in the financial year 2013 , an increase of 3.8 % against the revenues of 2012 at the level of 26.6 billion .
The state and local tax burden of companies rose last year by 4.3 % to 671 billion , compared to $ 3.9 % in the year before , and it was the third growth year in a row decisions after the several years of decline in 2009 and 2010 .
State taxes rose to more than the local taxes , by 4.3 % , so the study by the services agency Ernst & Young with the Centre for State taxation , was carried out of a tax policy group .
More than half of the tax revenue of the District , 56 % , comes from corporate taxes , while 36 % of revenue Mary ends up are coming from companies .
Virginia is the least tax revenue with 28 % of companies .
Much of the increase in the tax revenue is justified in a recovery of the GDP of companies , say the researchers , which led to an increase in the real estate taxes by 3.7 % in this year after the three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 % .
While a large proportion of these profits was coming from large states such as California , New York and Texas , the course seems to extend to Washington .
Companies in the District , Maryland and Virginia paid more than $ 10 billion at state and local property taxes in the last year , compared with $ 9.6 billion 2012 - an increase in a year by 4.2 % .
But the apparent recovery with the case of the real property values is not so effective in Maryland during the rise of state and local tax yields since the real property taxes amount to just more than one fifth of the notices of assessment assessment notices bills demands levies of enterprises here .
Companies in Virginia and DC pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes .
`` In Maryland following happens : A big part of the real properties , in particular in the tax field around D.C. , is either in the possession of the government or of non-profit-organizations that '' do not `` pay '' any real property taxes , said Douglas to Lindholm , manager of the center on State Taxation .
Maryland is therefore forced to rely on the income taxes for example much more in order to be able to offer the same services which other states offer .
The recent recovery in the tax revenues by companies alone can not be attributed to the recovery of the real estate market
Corporate income also seem to recover , such as the data .
Companies in the region reported income taxes in state organizations of 2.3 billion compared to $ 2.1 billion in 2012 .
Maryland took $ 1 billion in corporate income taxes , the highest amount of the region .
While the trend is going into the same direction , the local tax burden does not go up for enterprises at all three places evenly
The increase in rate in the District was 4.3 % with the national average , while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher , 4.9 % .
Only Virginia reported a average tax revenue from 4.1 % .
Virginia has by far the least corporate income taxes ( in all three there are fixed corporate tax rates ) with 6 % in all three areas of competence .
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is approaching at 8.25 % and the relatively high 9.975 % .
A similar study of the US Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year has shown that in Virginia smaller state and local corporate taxes are required , and there is a better overall tax climate than in Maryland .
In the study was not investigated the District .
Despite the advantages Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbors .
North Carolina passed legislation to reduce its corporate tax rates this year of 6.9 % to 6 % , the same rate as Virginia , and the sentence will fall in the coming year to 5 % .
If the government continues to achieve its income targets in the coming year , this law could reduce the corporate income tax rate of the state to 2017 apart from 3 % .
In the meantime , it seems as though the small businesses in the room Washington better to leave , and they pay therefore more state and local taxes , such as the recent study .
Corporate taxes that are paid as personal income taxes by small businessmen - a temporary structure that most small businesses are organized - in the District , Maryland and Virginia rose last year about 20 % to 2.4 billion , a clear faster growth rate as corporate taxes as a whole .
The researchers say that the trend and the rise near the enterprise steering wheels as a whole will presumably stop country this year with a rise of the general increase dam tax yields for the state and the local governments about 6.2 percent in the first three quarters 2014 in comparison with the same period of the previous year .
But the Washington area may lag behind if the spending cuts in the federal government for the labour market in the region .

Putin demanded of Kiev the inclusion of 'national ' talks with the eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin required under Russian media reports on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop the fighting against the separatists in the east of the country and take them immediately with negotiations on the `` statehood '' of the breakaway region .
His speaker Dimitri Peskow explained later that Putin did not think in this way that the field of east Ukraine standing under the control of the separatists becomes a part of Russia , but that his status must be defined opposite Ukraine again in order to give the power to the representation of his rights and interests to the Russian-speaking region
Putin `` s appeal to the government to negotiations on an equal footing with the Russian insurgents , however , is on the since the beginning of the riots five months ago seems to be persecuted strategy : Assistance for the separatists in the adoption of territories and pressure on the Ukrainian Government to allow place the newly proclaimed region Novo expo-centre de facto independence for an alliance with Russia with the West .
In an interview with the state television channel : Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recapture the areas held by separatists in the eastern regions Donetsk and Luhansk that were adopted in March and April , Moscow was annexed the Ukrainian peninsula Crimea on 18 March .
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently held the area as ' Novo expo-centre 'or ' New Russia ' , a term that recalls the vorrevolutionäre center of the Russian empire .
Putin pointed out that all those who , in the wake of the campaigns Ukrainian politicians for the elections on 26 images and during government groups civilian communities in the areas of separatists squeaker attack hope for early peace talks ' trapped in their illusions ' , this .
`` We must begin immediately detailed discussions , not only to technical issues , but also to the political organisation of society and the State of status of the South-East Ukraine , in order to protect the interests of the people who live there , 'he said .
Peskow said that had to be seen Putin `` s reference to the statehood in the context of the greater autonomy , which will be discussed for months ago by the leadership in order to allay fears in Russian-speaking areas that threatened their cultural and linguistic rights .
Only the Ukrainian government can give the necessary autonomy to the eastern fields , said Peskow .
We are not talking about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia , Peskow said , 'because it is not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine , but an internal conflict in Ukraine ' .
The clarification of the Kremlin speaker to correct the `` misinterpretation '' of Putin `` s remarks underscored the leadership of Russia in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the East , unlike the direct Annektion of Crimea , on which the majority of the 2 million people are ethnic Russians .
Moscow would have annexed far greater difficulties the regions Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine there most of the 6.5 million people no Russians and turned out from the time before the conflict a broad majority to remain in Ukraine .
The autonomy which was spoken to by Russian diplomats on international forums would give the regional governments in Ukraine proxy to discuss own commercial agreements and exterior relationships , and give so the Kremlin de facto the control of a field which combines the Russian state field with the Crimea .
The home port for the majority of the Russian navy as well as an important commercial port and historical coast region is the five months ago annexed peninsula in the Black Sea .
The regions between the biggest area in Russia and the Crimea is , moreover , rich in mines , factories and foundry that produce important components for the Russian military .
The Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko suggested during his speech for the inauguration on 7th June that the Ukrainian legislation is supposed to consider - after new choices - additions to the constitution with which a greater control is empowered to the respective fields about their finances and the status of the languages .
But his idea of autonomy seems in sharp contrast with those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels , has been accused of their arming and incitement Moscow .
Putin `` s last request to Kiev to negotiate with the separatists leaders on an equal footing , followed an further encroachment of the rebels in the past week after that Russian troops and tanks on the previously peaceful region along the Sea of Azov in the eastern Ukraine .
The separatists supported by Russia took control in the surprise attack which according to apprehensions of Ukrainian security guards the first step of a campaign for the takeover is to the strategic coast region up to the Crimea from Nowoasowsk .
For this reason , massive civilian and military preparations began to Mariupol , to strengthen a steel industry port with 500,000 people that lies between Nowoasowsk and close access to the Crimea .
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels and asked urgently a former Soviet republic which is independent for 23 years for actions in order to prevent a further Russian aggression against Ukraine .
'We are on the eve of the point of no return , ' warned Poroshenko .
There are thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks now on the territory of Ukraine .
The EU peak did not conclude any concrete actions , the leadership demanded the draft of further sanctions against Russia which are supposed to come into force with the case of an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis .
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk after two Russian tanks pillars and 1,000 troops entered the Donetsk region last week in order to support the besieged separatists , Colonel Andriy Lysenko , Speaker of the Ukrainian of National Security and Defence Council reports on Saturday in Kiev .
The first probably 63 Ukrainian soldiers who have been included by the Russian incursion into Ilowajsk , have been exchanged on Sunday against 10 Russian paratroopers that had been taken prisoner a week ago on Ukrainian territory told Lysenko on Sunday .

Do the castle associations pull soon at a rope again ?
Last there was again and again dispute between the two Wolfratshauser castle associations .
Now the boards think about a possible cooperation .
As a model for the reconstruction of the Wolf Council dentine Burg led the late Richard Dimbath , a former chairman of the Wolf Council dentine Burg friends , to the project in the French and reliable .
A year ago yet no good climate existed between the castle association and the castle friends wolf council beluga .
The seemed very different positions , as with the history of the Wolf Council Hauser Castle and a possible reconstruction should be handled .
Now the two warehouses on each other move too : Conversations are supposed to be led already soon about a common procedure .
The association executive boards confirm to Torsten Sjöberg ( Castle association ) and to Herbert Piffl ( Castle friends ) on demand of our newspaper that .
`` I called Mr Piffl and suggested that we could get together once '' , tells Sjöberg .
According to his opinion all members of both associations could pull in the future again at a rope .
So more quickly visible successes are to be made .
While the castle friends were having a reconstruction of the castle around the suddenly late Richard Dimbath till the end at the mountain wood in mind , stands for the castle association around Sjöberg the `` development and Erlebbarmachung '' of the ground at most front place .
Herbert Piffl , Second chairman of the castle friends , was very pleased with the call .
Since Dimbaths death he heads the castle friends .
A new chairperson is supposed to be found in the middle of September in a general meeting .
At present , the association matters according to the 74-year long about 40 members .
`` After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath we made the association activities out of respect rest first of all '' . This `` thinking-phase '' was necessary in order to `` consider how it could go on '' .

He recognizes Dimbath as a `` missionary '' who have always believed in the reconstruction of the castle .
Two similar , already far advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not a pipe dream .
By a high level of participation of the population , as well as by voluntary workers from around the world , it is a tourism hot spot .
Piffl : `` I was sceptical at the beginning .
But , over time , I was convinced more and more that it is reasonable to advance the project ' . An `` alone position feature '' can be created for the raft man city .
Here , there is nothing else .
Moreover , the project would be funded by EU subsidies , public tickets and potential sponsors , Piffl believes .
`` I personally do not want to fling the idea of the reconstruction simply overboard therefore '' . He hopes for the castle association moving in this point maybe a little .
Their aim to document the history , first of all , 'is important and well `` .

Exclusive departure from new novel highly vowed to Howard Jacob sons of love and the letter `` J . ''
Run you , one could describe it best so , they dispersed slowly as a cardboard which one has in the rain leave .
Sometimes a woman told him , it is too serious , hard , intensive distant and perhaps a little snappish .
And the hand shook to him then .
Snappishly he knew .
It was prickly , as in hedgehogs , yes .
The last victim of this Stacheligkeit was a just beginning affair which had been more promising for a relief of the secluded boredom of his life than else , and maybe would have brought him even a certain contentment .
Ailinn Solomons was a tremblingly tender beauty with uncurbed hairs and a fluttering heart from a village on the north island which was even even remoter and rougher than port Reuben .
It had come to South , with an older firm held Kevern for their aunt , and that had inherited a land in a particularly but paradisiacal valley with the good name paradise Valley .
For several years , no one had lived in the House .
The pipes were leaking , in such spiders were still , slugs had left their mark on all windows and believed that all belongs to them , and the garden was operated with weeds adult that looked like huge cabbages .
It was a garden of full secrets as the house from a child fairy tale , both alarming and enticing .
Portrait of the author : Howard Jacobson , whose novel `` J '' on the long list for the Man Booker price 2014 .
The short list is announced in the coming week .
Kevern had sat with Ailinn händchenhaltend on the broken beach chairs in the high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon . Both had latched themselves absentmindedly into the service console that supplied the country with calming music and calming news when the sight of their crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song of a for a long time forgotten black entertainer which his father had listened to gladly near closed rolling shutters in the house .
Your feet are too great .
Because of their very aggressiveness songs of this type were not played in the console .
Not prohibited - nothing was so right - is simply not banned .
It has been successful obsolesziert obsoleszieren , as the floor .
The general taste created , what decrees and rules would never have created , and choose the Vom plate scrubber zum-millionaire-memoirs , cookery books and love novels as the people at books , so they chose with the case of the music the ballads .
In the euphoria of the day began to play Kevern an imaginary piano and to record on large feet in a coarse-funny serenade Ailinns .
Ailinn did not understand that .
That was a well-known song of a jazz pianist called fats Waller , `` he declared them and laid automatically two fingers on his lips .
His father had always done that in order to stop the letter J before his coming from his mouth .
It began as a game between him and his father , when he was still small .
His father had played it with its own father , it was reported .
If you begin a word with a J without putting two fingers over your lips , it costs you a penny .
It had not been a very funny game , and it was not now very amusing .
He knew that this was expected of him and that was all .
It had to be declared what jazz was .
Ailinn had never heard what .
Jazz was not played even if it was not directly forbidden .
The improvising was not more modern .
It was only room for a single `` if '' in life .
People wanted to be sure at the beginning of a sort of tune , where it would end .
Just as the mind .
Its unpredictability made the people nervous .
And jazz was musically expressed intelligence .
Although he had become 10 years old , without Sammy Davis junior to have heard something about jazz Kevern , knew from the half secret collection of old CDs of his father .
However , at least it did not have to declare Ailinn that Fats Waller was black .
In their age , it could not recall a time when pop singers were not black .
Again , was no laws or constraints .
A consistent society meant , that every element of this society agreed thankful the principle of the group talent - thankfully as the ones spared to from the fate .
People with Afro-Caribbean origin were appropriate by temperament and build for entertainment and sports , so they sang and they go .
People who came from the Indian subcontinent initially were blessed as of the nature with electronic talent and were looked after with the task of guaranteeing that no family without functioning engineer 's order wire unit telephone stayed .
What was still remaining from the Polish community cared around the canalization ; what was remaining from the Greeks smashed plates .
Those from the Gulf States and the Levant , whose grandparents had not left the country rapidly than what happened when IT happened happen- for fear of being accused of fire fuelling , even for fear that they would use the flames next - was Labneh- and exposed to Shisha bidding restaurants , views and with the inaction depressed .
Each according to his skills .
Because they had heard only ballads Ailinn , it was difficult to understand how the insulting words that you are Kevern premixed , art , had ever .
Music was expression of love .
'The are not really offensive , ' Kevern said .
Except perhaps for people whose feet are too large .
My father has never offended someone , but he loved this song .
He spake too much , but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive sense of security .
The sound absorption of the gigantic cabbage-like leaves could not overcome anything .
Ailinn still not understood .
Why your father should have loved something like that ?
He wanted to say that it was a , however , hesitated to lay in its present another two finger on the lips .
You already thought that he was a little strange .
'It seemed to him , ' he said instead .
You thereupon read their heads and impeded Keverns point of view .
It did not admit anything else on the whole world see , as their uncombed raven hair .
There was nothing , what it otherwise would want to see .
`` If you say it '' , she thinks without conviction .
But that does not declare why you vorsingst it to me yet .
It seemed honestly worried .
Are my feet too large ?
He saw this again .
Your feet so directly .
Perhaps your ankles , a little bit ...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick ?
Hate you ?
Of course , I do not hate you .
But that is only the stupid song .
He would have been able to say 'I love you , but it was still too early .
`` Your thick ankles are exactly the reason why you made me , '' he tried it instead .
I am a bit perverse .
That did not ring correctly .
It had to be funny .
If he tried to be funny , he often in trouble killed himself , because it did not have as his father , the soothing appeal that would be needed to control the cruelty inherent in jokes .
Perhaps his father also wanted to be cruel .
Perhaps , Kevern that he wanted to be .
In spite of his friendly eyes .
Ailinn Solomons became red and rose from their deck chair , made the console and shed the wine that they had drunk .
Elder flower wine , so binge was not an excuse for him .
In their excitement seemed to tremble , palm fronds in the storm .
'And your fat head is precisely the reason why I am perverse , `` they said .
Except that I am not at all .
It did him , both because of the tired of unnecessary werent of his words , as well as the fear , which showed in their eyes , as they revolted against him .
Did she think that he would beat it
It had not told him about the life on the cold northern archipelago , where she had grown up , but he did not have any doubts that it was like this basically as here .
The same vast and hard ocean broke up here and there on the shores
The same confused men , with even thicker skin and more vexing after DAS what had happened than their ancestors had been as smugglers and beach Snatchers , drew from bar to bar , always ready to raise the hand against a woman , who rejected them or derided .
Stubborn person ?
Those ones would have shown her a thick fist if she did not look out !
You first smooch - Smooching was the most frequently used word for an erotic attraction between men and women , an antidote for the meaningless love ballads from the console - with her first smooch and beat then .
According to Keverns view that was an unnecessary processing since the smooching represented even an act of violence .
Ailinn Solomons admitted a sign to him through their body go .
It rose from the beach chair as an old man .
She felt also leaden , but the impact of his grief surprised her .
That was not the end of the world .
But you knew .
She watched to him , as he left - so as from a room in the upper stick their companion watched him during that - a man , burdened by something that he himself had caused .
Adam leaves the garden , she thought .
You felt a sudden pain for him and men in general , even though some of their hands against they had made .
A man turned away from it bent his back , abashed , conquer , without fighting spirit - why that was a sight that it seemed good to know , when they could remember nevertheless not onto an only time , at which she had seen something like that before the present day already once ?
When it was again alone , Ailinn Solomons looked at their feet .
Many years before the just reported incidents ESME Nussbaum , an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year old researcher working on a short speech on the continued violence in the task of Ofnow , the non-legislative surveillance control for the public mood , on low and middle level in the regions in which to expect their reduction , if not abolition , at the most , in view of the money and energy that the eradication of this power had been invested in .
`` It has already done a great deal , and a great deal still needs to be done , '' she wrote `` in order to placate the inherent aggressiveness of a nation that led a thousand wars and won most of them , especially in remote corners and valleys of the country in which the sweet whiff of human kindness was feels historically , despite the church towers emerging between the Hecke rare .
But some properties turn out as ineradicable .
The higher the church tower , it seems like this , the passion in a the smaller way that it keeps on waking .
The population cries during the hearing of sentimental ballads , intoxicates with histories about overcome difficulties and claimed to believe in the virtues of marriage and family lives firmly , however , nevertheless only the former brutality does not hold the rural municipalities just the same as our urban structures do in the hand , but there are also proofs for the origin of a new and insidious belligerence at home , at the job , on the streets and even on the grounds .
`` You have an unfortunate tendency to exaggeration , '' said their mentor , when he had read the whole report .
I suggest that you read less novels .
ESME Nussbaum bowed their head .
I must also ask : Are you atheist ?
`` I think I do not need to say '' , ESME Nussbaum answered .
Are you a lesbian ?
Again ESME referred to their right to privacy and rejection of the statement .
Feminist ?
Again silence .
`` I do not ask , '' then Luther Rabinowitz said `` because I would be against atheism , Lesbentum or feminism .
This is a prejudice free workplace .
We serve a prejudice free society .
However , specific types of hypersensitivity that are completely acceptable and commendable in themselves can distort on the occasion of results as you adopted it .
You yourself have prejudices obviously against the church , and these things which you refer to as `` insidious '' and `` raw '' strength and vitality could be interpreted by others just as well than expression of one of course .
When one rides out wider on the , what happened if IT has happened as if it would have happened yesterday if it had happened means , to take his essential vitality the country .
ESME Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz was speaking .
Repeated behind his head a LED lettering in flamingo pink the advice that Ofnow the country in the last quarter century or longer had given .
Smile you its neighbours , value your partner , listen ballads , visit musicals , use their telephone , talk , explain , listen to you , you agree , I am sorry .
Speaking is better than silence is , the sung word is better than the written one is , but nothing is better than love is .
`` I understand what you want to absolutely , also , '' replied ESME Nussbaum with a steady voice , as I am sure she was that their superior to the end of had spoken , `` and I say nothing other than that we have not healed as effective as we are deluding ourselves into thinking .
My concern is that we may recover ourselves without warning in how we repeat the mistakes that any first to DAS what happened when IT has happened .
This time the others at whom we skip our rage and our distrust are not it , however .
Luther Rabinowitz shaped a pyramid with the hands .
In this way , the patience of then point out .
'You go too far , ' he said , 'if you acts as ' mistake 'who have committed not our grandparents or perhaps also .
And they also go too far , if you say that their 'anger ' and the 'mistrust ' to 'other ' would have left out .
It should not really be necessary to remind someone in your position that we in understanding the past as in the protection of the present , not by 'us ' and `` other '' speak .
There was no `` we '' and there were not any `` else '' .
It was a time of disorder , that is what we know .
`` Of that one if we are honest to ourselves ourselves '' dared to throw in ESME , `` to have behaved well , '' no part of the society can claim .
I would accuse anyone .
Whether it badly or well what happened was done is happen .
That was then .
More does not have to be said with regard to that anything - there we agree agreed to ourselves .
And exactly as no fault has to be assigned , so also no fault has to be paid off if such deletion would be appropriate and if it would give a way to wipe it out .
But to what is the past , if we do not learn from it -
The past is designed to ensure that we forget about it .
If I may say something about that .
Luther Rabinowitz made his pyramid falling down .
'I will consider her report , ' he said and sacked them .
On the next day , when it went as usual to the work it was run over by a motorcyclist who had gone onto the footpath , described as passers-by , in a kind of `` brutal rage '' .
There are coincidences .

In a comment onto the New Press it contradicts statements of the manager Peer Medau and certifies this to pose `` as a commander '' .
The style of the University of this is not , it says in the communication .
It is the family Medau already `` Mitte June orally on the suggestion made by the University has been informed .
The statement that the plans became known only in July , are definitively wrong so Pötzl .
At the same time , he points out that it is not in the plans for 'Vorfestlegungen or even decisions , however , is it ' preferences ' .
Also the expansion of the narrow street , necessary for the access up to the castle is less dramatic than feared by the Medaus .
By a nine metres wide street was and is not the speech .
It is a question to present state of 5.50 meters , that is `` a meter more widely than up to now , '' declared Pötzl .
The argument of the Medau-operators that their parking areas clear of all charges and school-own in future are used then only still by students of the college wants to make not be meant for Pötzl .
Zugeparkt does not become at all because that can be dissolved as at other public parking places in the meantime intelligently .
Think of the residents
The creche Bergwichtel that is on the ground and before whose entry door would lead along the access to the parking deck is not supposed to be influenced according to the university education president .
Rather it gives to consider `` that it is not a question only of the creche here but also around the residents at the emptying to the Friedrich Streib street and the 800 pupils of the adjacent secondary school .
It is a question therefore of a lot more than of individual interests of the gentlemen Medau `` , so Pötzl .
Whether the criticism of the parents Advisory Board of crèche with the expansion of the street would a `` of the few natural spots Coburgs lost '' , `` right to say whether the reader can decide for themselves '' .
At the beginning of October Pötzl wants to inform the councillors , together with the State Construction Office Bamberg of the structural development of the College by 2020 'and speak to the importance of the new development in this context .
Peer Medau last week had the parents of the crèche on the plans of the university .
Accordingly should the access for the new parking deck not as up to now above the campus and the Friedrich Streib street , but over the Medau mountain lead .
In this way , the narrow streets would have to be extended on such a kilometre length in a two-way .
According to the Medaus projections would a tenfold increase in the transport of high .

According to the kata Ter Office are the price in the city last year alone has risen by 18.5 % , far more than the average increase in England and Wales as a whole .
The average sale prices at Berkeleys private , economical and studentischen offers climbed around approximately a fifth in the lasted year and lay at the end of April around the 423,000 £ .
A stronger pound has , however , made in the last few months property in London to foreign buyers less attractive - some of them are also by the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric about the possible 'expensive ' properties been deterred prior to the general elections next May .
The London estate agent Foxtons warned in the last week against the mortgage market report leading also to smaller market growth for April in which sharper granting of credit regulations were presented in the second year half both with the case of the real property sale and with the case of the prices .
New data from the Bank of England of Monday show a decline in the mortgage approval in July , which suggests that the housing market also cooling .
Hamptions International , another property agency , corrected its forecast for the rise in the real estate prices in London for 2015 down to 3 % , on the basis of an already weakening house price awareness .
The transaction volume in the most expensive areas of London as Chelsea , Mayfair and Kensington year went back in the meantime about a quarter for year , according to the broker Wa Ellis .
But the desire is a blessing to a home in the capital for Berkeley since the amount due amounts to more than £2.2 billion for appointment sales .
Mr Pidgley added : 'The demand for the right , well-planned product on the best locations remained stable and as a result of the deadline sales have remained stable . '
In June , the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year until the end of April - almost a third more than the peak 2007 before the crisis .
The annual input tax result changed annually 40 percent onto 280 million £ , the turnover about 18 percent on 1.6 billion £ .
In a communication on Monday before the annual meeting of the company said Mr Pidgley that the revenue for Berkeley in the current year is expected to comply with the current market .
The analysts estimate Euros annual Board to 450 million .
Berkeley-stocks stood in the afternoon fixed in the London trade at 23.96 £ .

We are pleased to be able to respond to this demand and the first luxurious travel service of Britain for students today .
In order to be able to make a particularly impressive performance at the University , the company also offers transport options as private aircraft , Rolls-Royce phantom , Aston marten or McLaren P1 .
Mr leaders also declared that the service has a security section .
This service is an ideal alternative for students who otherwise would have to drive their belongings through the country in a dangerously overloaded car .

4 tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you wish to make photographs or videos underwater , there is a choice of equipment .
The cheapest option is a watertight Point-And-Shoot , such as the Nikon AW120 or a Action-Cam as the first Hero3 + Silver edition , which are both for about $ 300 .
I have received these photos of a family party with several cameras available for a price of less than $ 350 .
Regardless of the equipment , there are a few rules for the best results .
Check your equipment twice .
Even if you have a watertight camera , make sure that the battery compartment and other subjects are closed .
Put your camera on the photos or videos , which you want to capture .
Some cameras and camcorders have scene and photo modes with which the exposure time is optimized for the dim underwater conditions .
And before you jump in , you check until which depth your outfit is operative .
Some cameras are approved only for up to 5 feet , others to 50 or 60 feet .
Search for digital cameras in our purchase leader and the evaluations for traditional and waterproof models .
You are multiple photos - because many will not work .
Point-and-Shoot cameras have a LCD , with which you can compose pictures , Action-Cams usually not .
Even if you have a LCD , it is difficult to do so under water , and the right image attitude is a matter of chance .
So you do many photographs
If your camera has a row mode with which a series of photos with slightly changed illumination attitudes are done , you use it .
You remain near the surface .
The light becomes dramatically worse the wider you leave the surface .
If possible , they remain so close to the surface if you do photographs in a pool , a lake or the sea .
So you can also bring more color in your photos ; the deeper you go , the less color you will see .
Approach close to the objects .
The country is also a good Council under water , but it is all the more important because of the bad light conditions .
It is completely especially important if you work with an Action-Cam : These devices have often a firm wide-angle coverage lens which means , that you thicker onto your objects must , if these are supposed to fill the entire picture frame .

Lenny Henry : My father has never taken me to the poor .
Never said `` I love you
Henry was one thing of seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in the year 1958 .
His father , who had died when Henry 19 has worked in a factory and their relationship was limited .
Henry performed for a comedy , every jobs ' , which is based in part on an imaginary conversation with his father and the series to Radio 4 .
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap , with lively melodies .
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments .
He visited many therapies after the death of his mother , and Henry is thinking about its relationship with his father .
It was hard to know him .
One never saw his face , heard only his voice Stop with the crash .
Leave your sister in peace .
Move !
I want to look cricket .
My older brethren Seymour and Hilton - the were already grown up , when I was a child - went with him in the pub and talked about things , such as the form of beer glass or the beauty of a cricket .
I never had such a conversation with him .
A majority of my life it this serious form in the corner that read the newspaper .
Recently , Henry opened a foundry in Dudley , and although the conditions are better than in the days of his father , but it won an insight into how the life may have been for him .
It is now somewhat brighter , but they are dark to buy , deep stygische labyrinth 84kg with fire and smoke and a great deal of soot .
My father simply lay down formerly into the tub and then one could hear it slowly how he started singing because it could wash the foundry of themselves .
When I pictures there , it was clear to me that he had done so for years , in order to bring the food on the table , and my respect for him was greater .
Nevertheless Henry grew up as a child without love evidence of his parents .
My father never embraced me , he never said `` I love you '' .
Only when it was my mother against the end of their lives badly , we began to `` I love you , I love you , I love you to say .
By its own daughter Billie , with Dawn , he was able to share the love that he had missing as a child .
You could stop once with that `` I love you '' ?
Hearing but to embrace me .
But Daddy , I am 22 .
With Dawn French .
Why should we not be friends ?
It is a great mother .
It is gotten used still with French with which it was married 25 years .
Dawn is a good man .
Why should we not be friends ?
It is a great mother .
Henry 'own mother was a diabetic .
That contributed to their death .
When I was so very , very overweight and symptoms of diabetes showed , said my doctor `` you must be radically .
That is why I went through this fitness and also a drastic diet had to do in order to reverse the symptoms .
It is very difficult .
And it is hard .
No one eats like carrots .
Henrys career change is perhaps in his elegant , a Bart .
Since it was praised by the critics for his Othello , it is captured by the theater .
This was followed by The comedy of errors , and then fences of August Wilson .
That is another experience than the sitcoms and dies that filled its occupied working life .
It began with only 16 years ago , when he was working in a factory .
A DJ discovered him on the stage , when he people imitation and wrote to New Faces about it .
His television career began in the middle of the 1970s . `` I was the only black clone / comedian on television for a very long time . ''
He learned in the profession .
I did not have to become tall only before the eyes of the public , but learn also from 1975 to 1985 how I could become an efficient Witze-Erzähl-Maschine while I was being a star through the television and that was really difficult .
Lenny 1975 with New Faces
There his manager the stage right at the Black and White Minstrel Show had , a light conversation program in which the people painted themselves black Henry performed his Comedy there more than five years .
That was very unpleasant to my family .
I wish somehow that it would be never happened , but I do not regret that I have done .
It was a strange , uncomfortable position for me , but I have worked in giant projects and have learned how to deal with a large public .
But this `` prize-winning light column of the British watching television lasting for years was also a '' grotesque parody of black people. ``
Through the introduction of figures , both the British black culture , celebrated mock as Henry worked in the 1980s to an alternative comedy circle .
The first series of Lenny Henry show went 1984 on shipment , and in the nineties , he was , among other things , as the chef Gareth Black lock in the comedy series boss ! .
Advertising documentaries , TV-series and reels of film shaped his next decade , but according to his BBC-series LennyHenry.tv 2008 he thought himself : `` What you do as next , Len , because it feels so everything when you bring only the time for that or kick a little on the place . ''
After that , a documentary number came to radio 4 with the title What `` s So Great On ... ?
The first consequence turned around Shakespeare .
I was downright allergic to Shakespeare .
I had never learned something about it correctly in the school and mainly held it for a domain of the middle class , whiteness , in tights and a cabbage in front in that .
So I had big fear .
All of us who for the show interviewed , Peter Hall , Trevor Nunn , Adrian Lester , Judi Dench said 'you should try it .
Do not make it bad if you do not know what they are talking about .
Take a few words in their mouths , and then you will understand why we love all Shakespeare .
Henry listed 20 lines from Othellos of last speech for the documentary and it was enthusiastic .
I had the feeling that I could create .
It was almost as if someone would have put me on its head correctly .
`` For that it works , it is a serious thing , take it seriously , learn your text , investigates a little .
The tests were brutal , and I read this piece for months before we did it .
And it was a success .
They seemed to expect a car crash , and this happened not easy .
And soon he was in the comedy of errors .
I was sudden in the national theater and I could hardly believe it .
There was a moment , as I thought , 'Oh , you have changed . '
There was a technical error and Henry felt instinctively that he had to maintain the audience .
A small voice said to me , 'You must bridge 10 minutes now , while they are dealing with the computer. ``
Instead of this the stage conductor announced that the idea would go on as soon as the problem is solved .
I went from the scene and anything in me said 'Oh , thank God ' .
I am not responsible for this .
I can leave it to anyone else .
`` You plays in a play , in other words , in your role . '
Henry in fences at the Duchess Theatre
The text for fences to learn was demanding .
Panic is very good , that strengthens the sinews .
The sold well , so it is as a great sign of the gods , which tell me here is ' `` provision .
He says this , of course , with a thundering voice .
So I will say it .
I really love that .
I love to be a test .
Henry still has , however , the head of one comedian - our conversation is from humorous outbreaks pulled through , while he is imitating persons again and again .
I decided not to make any Stand-up-Comedy because I believe that this type of immediate satisfaction of a Chamber is somehow dangerous to full foreigners .
If one is looking for that , it is in this way to a wall .
I perform sometimes live in the Apollo if I fancy for this purpose , but in total it does not give to me so much as formerly .
I would like to ask him whether he will make a Stand-up-Comedytour ever again .
The fun that I have in an area with a director , which helps to craft a start , a central part Member and the end of a journey - I do not believe that I would ever like to give up again .
So here is the its new incarnation ?
I have already think .
I am a actor .
It is a mockery .
One always tells a history and that is great .
I love stories .
The people love stories .

Merkel speaks command : Toll will come `` very clearly ''
Now the Chancellor is committed it clear once again .
A licence for all complicated details but it is not .
Persistent concerns from the CDU against the car toll have wroth the CSU .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken for continuing opposition from their CDU a definitive conclusion for the introduction of a toll for passenger cars .
`` In order to say it very clearly : It stands in the coalition contract , and it will come '' , said the party leader on Monday after meetings of the CDU top committees in Berlin .
Merkel did not commit himself to a detailed model for the time being , however .
In the are black and red government programme 'certain parameters ' .
Alexander about iconic ( CSU ) have 'made a proposal , and in which we are working now ' .
The NRW-CDU insists on their rejection of a toll on all roads .
Merkel also pointed out , Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble ( CDU ) return engage constructively in the discussions for a bill .
On the subject , have spoken about it with also on further opportunities to activate more private capital for investment in infrastructure , such as the broadband development .
`` Since is nothing special ' . Schäuble had on Sunday a Der Spiegel , left report protectorate , his house ZoneAlarm its own approach in order to reward motorway investors with tolls - after the election 2017 .
CSU leader thicket Seehofer warned then before developing in the cabinet toll draft against the responsible minister .
CDU-Bundesvize Mr Laschet confirmed its objections .
`` The coalition contract never came from that , all circular and federal streets too bemauten '' , the North Rhine-Westphalian CDU country chairperson said .
In this respect , it is an important signal that Seehofer has announced plans to discuss the subject again .
Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate alone amounts to opposition to the plans from the CDU country associations .
Apprehensions are background , that a toll influences the small border traffic to neighboring states .
Seehofer had called for coalition loyalty because of the toll criticism from the ranks of the CDU .
The Left is failed to the plans in view of the dispute in the Union as .

Matthies means : Highest time for the great cross-linking
Faced with the galloping technical progress that it threatens to change our comfortable into High-Tech control rooms home our columnist Bernd Matthies with some extremely familiar electronic accessories comforts himself .
While I am writing that here , my look falls onto the coiled cord which unites the listener with the telephone , and I think : Boah , as retro that is then ?
But a consideration is behind that : If the cable was not , all listeners would fly around in shortest time in an abandoned way in the house , and that would be still significantly more retro .
Already applies in the disgust Tron , ( disgust Tron , ?
No , typing error : Electronic ) sector the rule that the world novelty is electronic waste from today , from tomorrow , bought - is out of date .
And who has a tube television set for example today still in the living room , that one only says in this way that he refuses television fundamentally .
Why these considerations ?
Because the pushing of the IFA makes our absolute incompetence to us clear again at the radio tower in this week in questions of the electronics .
The layman who mastered formerly washing machine and CD Player blindly does not understand today even the purpose of the devices which are spread with incomprehensibly vain Expertensprech in front of it `` connected Home , Wearables , Health Care and Urban Technologies '' promise us the press office .
It still works ?
Over what one is supposed to talk to people , the apparently voluntary such curd expand ?
Basically it is a question for about 20 years particularly of our being supposed to cross-link our house most pleasingly .
So that the yogurt itself reorders itself so that the fire detector on vacation informs us on the Maldives that it burns in the study Grad .
And would it not be wonderful if we by the office from the airconditioning on our early arrival ... ?
Yes , however , requires an air conditioning .
But a dream will certainly will soon be true : We raise our watch , tell her according to 'vacuuming ! ' - and at home from the dust Aug .
Misleading .
Everything does not come to anything smaller than a revolution does : `` The borders between white and brown product become blurred '' , a branch expert whispers , one can connect the washing machine with some headphones , who sends to steam the weather report and the data glasses indicate how long the pizza still needs in the oven , what , however , does not use anything because we stand in the jam .
From the daily practice we also know : If a fashionable equipment is really urgently needed , is guaranteed the battery empty .
What a further reason for this is that the coiled cord will withstand the next radio shows at the telephone .

Why `` authorities of the Galaxy '' did not become a cash box hit
`` The Expendables 3 '' of New Year `` s Eve Stallone played less than 30 million dollars of its 90 million dollars of households in the US , whereas ' sin City : A lady to kill For '' only 12 million dollars of its budget of $ 70 million played .

In July entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore- and Metacritic evaluation for every summer film start , that between the American Memorial Day and the 20th July 2013 and in the current year on at least 2000 canvases was shown .

The school start brought a feeling to the municipalities drawn from missile bullet-hole holes from joy and expectation in the south of Israel , but the signs of the fights are still fresh .
In the southern city of Ashdod employees of the `` Pashosh '' -kindergarten , which was hit by a missile removed shrapnel shards of the walls and shifting-walls prior to the arrival of the students .
'We have a bit fear , but are excited , ' said Ronit Bart , someone who lives on in the Kibbutz Saad and teacher there .
Many children from our area urgently need the return to a routine .
Your 11-year old daughter Shani Bart said it feels `` a little funnily '' suddenly again to go into the school .
'The were difficult times , and we have not gone at all from the House , ' she said .
President Reuven Rivlin went to the Kibbutz near the border to Gaza , in order to offer his support .
Until an armistice suspended the war last week thousands of inhabitants of the border municipalities as Saad in their houses stayed or their houses left in order to keep on moving into more secure areas away from Gaza and to escape the missile and mortar fire .
Many inhabitants of Nahal Oz , a municipality near the border to Gaza in which a 4-year old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar shell still hesitate with the return .
The Ministry of Education , shared with a dozen or so families was not yet returned .
Your children were placed temporarily in other schools .
A school in Sderot , a border town to Gaza , which was drawn from the Palestinian bombing visited Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu .
It has called on the children to learn a lot and said 'we will make sure that they gain knowledge and offer security .
Israel and Hamas agreed last Tuesday on an unbefristeteten ceasefire .
The truce guaranteed for an immediate end of the fights ; important problems remain , however , unresolved , as the demand of the Hamas for a cancellation of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of the air and lake harbors in Gaza .
Israel calls for a disarmament of Hamas and the transfer of bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting .
A new round of indirect talks is likely to begin in this month in Egypt .
In the war more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed , three quarters of them civilians , and at least 494 children estimates of the Palestinians and the UN .
Israel denies these information and reckons that it is a question of fighters with the case of at least half of the killed ones did not present , however , any concrete proofs of these information .
On the Israeli side were 66 soldiers and six civilians , including a Thai workers , killed .
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired off 4,591 missiles and mortar shells during the fights onto Israeli cities , most in the south of the country .
Meanwhile , the Israeli military led more than 5,000 air- and other attacks .
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in the Gazagebiet and about 250,000 people searched refuge that preliminary shelters were altered into in more than 100 UN schools .
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the shelters and the fight continues , the educational authorities last week postponed the beginning of the school year .
`` I hope , the school is soon again opened so that we keep on being able to learn so as the children in the world and the Jewish children '' , Mohammad Amara , a 13-year old boy that currently lives in a school in Gaza city , said .

Going back to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
The Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have tabled a proposed law in order to build the organisation of trade unions as some civil rights .
'Die as trade unions , die the means class jobs , ' Ellison said , a democrat in Minnesota and deputy chairman of the Progressive people in Congress .
That is why I am proud , together with the citizens right icon John Lewis the employees empowerment law .
This landmark law gives workers the same legal opportunities in the case of discrimination because of the Organization of trade unions as with other forms of discrimination - and forces in such a land unionized stopped .
The addition of national work right law , in order to create an opportunity for a discrimination abandoned workers to organise a union representation in order to bring a complaint before a civil court for justice - and in order to obtain compensation or penalty - is a sensible and necessary initiative .
But it is not a radical initiative with security - at least not according to American standards .
In fact the best kind and manner for the sense of what Ellison , Lewis and the further sponsors of their bill suggest is the connection back for a very American idea .
In spite of the setbacks to whom the trade unions were misfired in the last years - in Wisconsin , Michigan and other states in the whole country - Americans encouraged once countries in all world to acknowledging stretching and stopping industrial law .
There was a time which millions of Americans still remember , when this country mentioned democracy , freedom of speech , freedom of the press and the union right in a breath .
When Japan filled the United States after the Second World War , general Douglas Mac Arthur and his stick encouraged the country to adopting a constitution which is supposed to guarantee that the militarized autocracy Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy .
In full consciousness of that , that the workers and their trade unions during the creation of a new Japan took a role , they used a language that acknowledged explicitly that `` the rights of the workers to union and common negotiating and action are guaranteed . ''
When the United States fill after the Second World War Germany , general Dwight David Eisenhower and his stick pushed the Germans , to write a constitution that would provide that that the fascism Adolf Hitlers would be replaced by a strong democracy .
In recognition of the fact , that the workers would have to organize , and should rise their voice in the new nation , the Germans inserted a stipulation that testified explicitly : `` The right to base unions around which Work and economical conditions to safeguard and to improve is guaranteed to every individual and every profession or trade .
To curtail it agreements that restrict this right or are aimed at that are zero and vain ; measures being aimed at that are unlawful .
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt held the chairmanship about the International Human Rights Commission from which the General declaration of the human rights was projected as it was taken over in 1948 of the United Nations as a worldwide agreement Roosevelt and the other authors inserted a guarantee that `` everyone has the right to form trade unions to the protection of his interests or to join them . ''
Since generations Americans accept the basic premise that labour rights are human rights .
As this country other countries in this case advised as one can shape civilian and democratic societies Americans declared that the right to the foundation of a trade union must be protected - and on this trade union may participate in collective negotiations as an equivalent significant partner with enterprises and government places then .
After these rights is turned out in America under fire , indeed very points to make clear the American ideal , therefore , the working population must be right to unite and voice to be heard in a free and open society .
How pastor Martin Luther King , Jr. , who said fifty years ago :
The story is a great teacher .
Now they all know that the labor movement did not restrict the strength of the nation , but extended it .
Through the increase of the standard of living of millions of people work created a market in wondrous way for the industry and raised the entire nation to inconceivable production levels .
Those who attack the work , forget these simple truths , but the story is preserved .
The history remembers , and we should also do that .
The formal recognition the industrial law as human rights - and the enlargement of the protection of the civil rights as protection against discrimination during the creation of employee representations - is for a long time overdue .
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals which made America big in the past and kept the promise of democracy .

Because the head diplomat at the same time , the EU will deputy of the Commission President Juncker .
The pending approval of the European Parliament is as safe .
Otherwise , President Giorgio Napolitano would not have mentioned hardly an `` important recognition of the role of Italy in the EU , the nomination of the 41 year old leader of the ruling Democratic Party .
La Repubblica spreads optimism , that the Mogherini proven for almost two decades in leading party offices and known to their ambition will show herself increased to the `` enormous challenges '' .

Since 2008 she is a member of the chamber of deputies in which she is an expert for defense and European and international matters .
As Renzi in February 2014 became Prime Minister , he was Mogherini on his Secretary of State .
If the PD has today again a better relation to the strong peace movement in the country that contributed to the more than 40 percent of voices of the party at the EU choices in May , Federica Mogherini has a part of that then how in PD-circles is noted down .
The reproaches in Brussels , the new High Representative have too little diplomatic experience , so is it lacks substance , will be dismissed in the PD .
In Brussels , especially from Poland and the Baltic members suspicious realistic emphases of her for the crisis are pursued in Ukraine and framed as a `` pro-Russian course . ''
She approves the pipeline South Stream practiced by the Russian Gasprom company above which Russian natural gas is supposed to be transported under avoidance of Ukraine directly according to Southern Europe , which is used also for the energy protection of Italy .
After Renzi had entered upon his term of office in July as a EU chairperson , Mogherini for their first state visit traveled to Moscow .
Photos that showed it with Putin at the Shake-hands were received in Brussels with indignation , in the same way , that they invited the Kremlin leader for October to one May countries economic peaks

The people of London wept when I told our history .
At that time I understood how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings , and their support .
It was thankful for the price and the possibility to travel to London in the fall 2004 to Cherie Blair and to their foundation
I wish I could Cherie call and simply say that have passed 10 years , but I am still remind me of the meeting her and her husband in London , and how the there and has helped me .

Damir became large and is a very soft and quiet boy , it is not aggressive or angry at all .
He does not seek revenge , for example , for it is not overwhelmed by the last dreadful atrocities .
I know that he does not like to remember , but he has six close friends from the class and they go occasionally in the sports hall and ignite candles there .
When it was smaller , he suffered from that - I remember as he laid onto the sofa sometimes , turned away the face from us , for hours .
Not sleeping , his eyes were open .
I remember , as he threw all its weapons and other military game witness . There is now 17 , greater than I , Catherine , intelligent and healthy .
I can hardly believe that I was so secure for some hours that it is dead and I would never again see it
When I recovered after the explosion and came to the legs , I looked around , and the hell looked around me around , with parts of the body lying around everywhere .
I was absolutely sure that my small boy could have survived in this hell .
`` I remember that I called on him , '' Damir , , run away ' , but I was also so sure that he had not heard me .
But he has heard it and it is ears when she ran away .
And so the life , different than that of many others , for us goes wider .

There is not any single day , at which we do not remember this tragedy .
We do not think that it long ago is , I believe that it would be done yesterday , some scenes from these days constantly follow me .
No one will ever forget , I can assure you .
Powerful : The image of Georgij ( to the left ) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as a statue ( to the right ) .
I remember , that Georgij wanted to go so gladly on this day to the school . He said he wants to embrace his teacher .
I knew only that he was alive , when I saw him on television .
And now there is even this statue of the crying Georgij in San Marino .
Georgij does not see the picture gladly , and it is hidden with us at home in the bookshelf .
I understand that , but I also believe that the people in the world thanks to this image our pain .
Mr says today : `` It is important that such a thing can never happen again .
`` I doubt that we ever find out the truth .
The people examine such tragedies again and again and never find out the truth .
And now they examine the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine .
Will we find out ever what caused it ?
This world becomes something terrible .
`` I can not understand how this is possible , because if you ask the people , nobody wants a war , so how is this happening ?
Ten years have nothing in such pain .
We need dozens of years , around it one to forget little in a small way .
It attacked my health and I still feel it .
For about three or four years , I have had a few nightmares because of the siege , but then it was better .
I went later in the year 2004 back in school and had every day fear .
I thought of my friends and classmates , which had been killed .
For that I always go into the gym when the 1st September comes closer .
I want to say my old childhood friends toll .
It is difficult for me to go to the gym , but I have to do it .
I do not feel as victims , this story is now a part of my past .
I will not forget it , but I do not pity myself .
My life goes on .
I have completed this year the school and visit a medical college in Vladikavkaz .
I will become heart surgeon .
My first election was a training in the army .
I wanted to become a soldier , but my health did not let this happen .
I wanted to fight for my country , but that will not happen .
Georgij Fanijew , 20
The boy lived , to feet , even though it was caught a murderous terrorists
A miracle : Georgij Fanijew was during the siege caught to root of a murderous terrorist , but he managed to survive .
During the siege , it was caught in the gym and was next to the bomb , which was attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist .
It is really a miracle that he was not killed .
`` We feel it as if it have been yesterday '' , says Georgij that wanted to go to the FSB as a secret service officer , but could not do this because of his sanitary damages due to the siege .
It is still with me , it is not anything which I have let behind myself .
I am now older and people say that children can deal with terrible experience - I must say that this is not true .
`` In 2006 I worked with psychologists and felt after that a little better in fact , however I can not forget it .
And I would like to forget .
2005 - the year after that - was the first and only time that I back into the gym .
I lost the consciousness .
I will return never again there and they do not ask me to show you where I was in this famous picture .
Survivors ' : Georgij Fanijew today , with a host of themselves in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is enormous and I carry it every day with me .
My friends know that I do not like to think and speak or they never asked me after the school .
I am well physically .
I should be careful with my injured knees , but I can now go well .
But because of my health I could not study at the secret service academy of the FSB in St. Petersburg as I wanted .
I have my documents also the medical ones sent in and they answered , that it is not possible .
The animals have been my second passion , so I went to the veterinary institution .
I have already there two years behind me .
He learns the treatment of all animals `` of cats up to cows '' .
He said : 'I knew that I would report back to my children never by my experience .
About that children should not know anything and they should not suffer it as a matter of course either .
His mother Marina , 42 , said : `` This pain leaves me never .
It is in my soul , worse , if the anniversary comes closer .
I will go to the celebrations in memory .
I know that Georgij will not go .
It must be much more for him , because he was there and I do not .
I waited at home on him and could not help .
I am God so grateful that it was returned to me . Here in Beslan all of them are drawn
It remains in us .
Georgij is now an adult , but this horror is still in it .
It is heavy to accept that when something so Unfair happens to one .
He is a boy , it may sport , but it can not due to its knees .
He was operates on several occasions that he can run , but no sport .
I would say that he overcame the horrors to 50 % , but one can never overcome that and forget that .
This terrible experience will always follow us .
Many friends and neighbours were killed during the siege and the only increases my pain .
I lost many people who I knew well and who were expensive to me .
My son is with me , and that is the greatest gift that God could make me , but my heart cries for the people killed .
I know of families , in which new children were born , but also of widows , the never again have married .
It is heavy to accept that the life goes on even if one does not want that .
I will never forget how my heart jumped in me when I saw it in the hospital .
And now I see what in the world goes on - wars in other regions .
What do these people fight for ?
Why do they kill each other .
The war is now very close to our country and I can almost not believe that .
We were formerly a friendly country , as it can be that we fight now ?
People and children suffer , I am sure that in Ukraine have many children were killed and many be killed .
If we include and could throw out all these rebels , as far away as possible .
Aljona Tskajewa , 10
The baby who was borne movingly so by a special task force out of danger
Saved : Aljona Tskajewa is saved by a Russian special task force ( to the left ) .
It is now ten ( to the right ) and does not remember the atrocities at all .
The world stopped in 2004 the breath when the baby Aljona was taken into the pauper of a Russian policeman by Beslan from the siege .
The terrorists made her go , but they held up their 30-year old mother , the 10-year old sister Kristina and their brother Makhar in the school gym in their cruelty .
Makhar , then three years old , escaped , but Aljonas mother and sister died in the murderous slaughter .
Your father Ruslan got married since then , and has a little girl , with its new wife Svetlana that he named after its lost daughter Kristina .
Aljona , today ten years old , does not remember the siege and grew up to an intelligent and happy girl , neighbors say .
`` You are now a big happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children '' , a close friend says .
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to spare them all the memories that approach with the tenth anniversary .
You will understand why .

Perry from Texas says that reducing tweet was not authorized
A tweet of official account of the Republican Texas Governor Rick Perry , on Sunday contained a reduce comment on the democratic local government lawyer that is at the heart of a legal charges against it because of the abuse of power .
The tweet was put out later and user account was compensated for it by another from Perrys who denied the previous one .
Just a tweet which was not authorized by me was sent from my account .
`` I do not approve of the tweeting and removed it '' , it was said in the later information
Employees of Perry did not answer inquiries for comments immediately .
Although the tweets of Perrys went out official user account , it was not clear who in fact helps himself the Feed .
In the former tweet a disadvantageous picture was drawn of the district state attorney of Travis county , Rosemary Lehmberg that was condemned in April 2013 because of drunken driving .
Perry inserted a veto against a financial promotion of their office when she refused to resign which led into Austin for an accusation against Perry - who could be a premiership candidate possibly in 2016 - in front of a gravel jury this month .
The text of the tweets : 'I am not always drunk with the triple permitted alcohol mirror . But if I do , I would accuse Governor Perry , if he ausplaudert . '
I am the drunk democrat in Texas .
Loam Bergs office was not with the leadership on the investigation into the Grand jury against Perry .
This has led to a special prosecutor from Michael McCrum from San Antonio , who was selected by a Republican judge .
Perry pleads not guilty and the prosecution called a political trick .
His highly class team of legal advisers applied with the judge entrusted with the case , to reject the accusation and argued , that the law with which against the service-oldest governor in the history of the Texas state is proceeded is unverfassungsgemäß diffuse .
Perry stopped $ 7.5 million of public money to the Public integrity Unit of the state - that is based on County in Travis and investigates cases of government corruption in Texas - than Lehmberg refused to resign .
This veto guaranteed for a public complaint on the part of a left watchdog-group .
Perrys official account is updated often - and sometimes famous .
After it had closed with the case of the election meetings in Iowa during his premiership candidacy 2012 as Fifth , Perry understood on speculations that it will stop in his posting a tweet of a photo of themselves while jogging near a lake with the words `` South Carolina , we come '' !

Production in the euro zone on a 13-month-depression
The increase in the production in the eurozone slowed in August at the lowest point in the last 13 months , such a exactly observed study .
The final Markit purchasing managers index of the manufacturing ( PMI ) fell in August at 50,7 in , after a state of 51.8 in in July .
A specification over 50 indicates an expansion .
New tasks went back and factories experienced burglaries of tensions increasing in a time between the EU and Russia about Ukraine .
The figures take place before the meeting of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) on Thursday .
The markets expect the Bank a clear plan for dealing with a hesitant recovery of the euro area , as well as for the threat of deflation with an inflation rate of only 0.3 % .
There is speculation to the head of the ECB , Mario Draghi , will be able to give further information during this week whether it takes a quantitative easing into account for the eurozone according to those that have been carried out by the United Kingdom , and the US during the financial crisis .
'Even though a small growth is better than no growth , have become the deterrent effect of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties for producers more clearly said , ' Rob Dobson , senior economists in desks .
The Fabrik-PMI for Germany , the largest trading partner of Russia in the EU , fell to their lowest in 11 months with 51.4 .
In the meantime the PMI fell on 46.9 in the second-largest economic nation of the block , France .
France remains a problem child , as well as the decline of Italy of a solid expansion to stagnation .
Tips on growth stimuli not gripping in the key industry mechanism Germany as well as in Spain and the Netherlands anymore are also not calming `` , said Mr Dobson .
The decline of the industry is fueling the fire of analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal incentives .
A positive information came from the republic of Ireland , where the PMI went up on 57.3 , the highest level since end 1999 .
Howard Archer , chief economist at IHS Global Insight , said : 'The best that can be said for purchasing managers index of manufacturing in the euro zone of August is that after that the sector is continuing to grow .
He added : 'Producers in the eurozone find the life is currently appears very difficult , because the current increased geopolitical tensions - particularly in relation to Russia and Ukraine - continue to increase uncertainty in the difficult conditions in many countries .
This increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular , and the confidence of the consumers , and probably leads to that some orders delayed or even be cancelled , especially major orders .
He said that it is increasingly likely that the ECB must introduce a kind of QE `` , although we suspect that this will be limited . ''

Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment lead to higher death rates by ovarian cancer in rural areas .
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have a video tribute for their mother online , the 2007 ovarian cancer .
For women in the rural areas of Australia , there is a higher risk of ovarian cancer to die than for women in cities .
Researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1100 Australians with whom in 2005 ovary cancer was found , and stated that only 25 percent were still at the life five years according to the diagnosis .
The chief research officer Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research institutes said , that for those ones that lived in rural and remote regions of the state the mortality risk during the study lay about 20 percent higher than for those ones in town areas .
Small study : New medicines could slow down lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers investigated the health care of women more than seven years .
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in the diagnosis , the type of ovarian cancer , existing previous illnesses as well as social and economic status also influenced the chances of survival .
For older women and those whose cancer had continued to the diagnosis time already further the survival rate was low .
For those ones that lived in rural and remote regions of the state the mortality risk lay during the study about 20 percent higher than for those ones in town areas .
Although the study did not examine , why outside of the city living women with higher probability at ovary cancer died , Dr. Jordan presumes a late diagnosis and the lacking access to the best treatment centers as possible factors for that .
'This disease is best dealt with by gynaecological oncologists , and these are to be found in major cities , ' she said .
Despite the improvement of telemedicine services to counter the distances with something it has proposed strengthening the service of doctors flown in as possible in order to give specialists able to look after women more densely at their place of residence and treatment programmes for people outside their region .
Dr. Jordan said , that the study showed a bad long-term survival rate independently of the geographical status with women in the ovary cancer and underlined it the need for better treatment and provision strategies .
The study financed by Rio tinto ride to conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia .
In March 2013 Elisha Neave , a young mother of 33 years of the gold coast , found out that she had an aggressive form of ovary cancer .

Richter stops law temporarily , that all abortion clinics could force in Louisiana for the closing
A US federal judge stopped on Sunday the conversion of a law into Louisiana , from which attorneys say that it would presumably have led to the closing of all five abortion clinics of the state , temporarily .
This measure which was raised by Bobby Jindal , governor of Louisiana , in June for the law and is supposed to come into force on 1st Sept. would force doctors who carry out abortions to gaining a reception admission right near a hospital within a radius of 30 miles around their practice .
The decision of the judge means , however , that the doctors for the time being legally abortions continue to carry out , while they can apply for such a right .
`` The plaintiffs can continue working law-consistently while they are making an effort to obtain these rights , wrote federal judge John deGravelles in its judgment .
Within a month will be set a hearing for the judges , for the law in order to bring about a more permanent decision .
Abortion proponents welcomed the decision , the youngest one in a series of judgments against similar measures and said that doctors would win so more time in order to attain hospital installation rights .
`` Meant '' the present decision that the women escape `` in Louisiana '' `` an insidious law that wants to take their health and their rights from them '' , Nancy Northup , president and chairperson of the center for reproduction rights that had complained on behalf of three of the five clinics of the state in order to stop the law , said .
It was not immediately clear whether the judgment applied also to the doctors from the two clinics which had not followed the complaint and applied also installation rights at it .
Louisiana is one of 11 states that enacted similar laws and courts have recently declared such measures in Alabama and Mississippi for not constitution .
Key places of a law in Texas , which would have forced most of the clinics remained in the state for the closing , were stopped by a federal judge on Friday .
Abortion supporter and the American college of Ostretricians and Gynecologists , as well as the American Medical Association say that investment rights require unnecessary restrictions from doctors .
Abortion opponents argue that the measures are used for the protection of the health of women , although some welcomed the effects of a closure of clinics .
Only a doctor who carries out in Louisiana abortions , has Patienteineinweiserechte , told the Centre for reproductive rights .
If all remaining doctors are forced in the state not to carry out any abortions anymore , this doctor would not carry out the operation anymore for fear around his security said the group .
Their argument against the judgment said representatives of the State of Louisiana that they would punish no doctors because of the implementation of abortion , would be during their requests for I way rights still pending .

Tenant looked out : If you do not return the book , the punishment fees can even exceed the price of a new book .
E-books
Also e-books instead of traditional textbooks are an option .
Sometimes these books de facto are hired by an electronic licence for a certain period of industry as Amazon.com , Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc. is provided .
At Chegg one can rent `` calculus '' for 6 months for about 61 $ .
Bracey says that students find the best offers frequently in literature courses since many classics can be downloaded nowadays freely while scientific and engineer-scientific textbooks are can be very expensive .
Look around is in any case .
The ISBN-number recommends for the pricing at books Joe Gault , 29 , who soon will go to the Pepperdine Law School , since one can be so secure to find the correct textbook .
And before an online-order one should check , according to Gault , whether in fact the book is in stock .
This lesson he learned the hard way .
He bought a book that delivery time had and paid four weeks after all , the full price in the College book store .

Glandorf resigns from handball national team
Holger Glandorf will not play anymore for the DHB-team .
An assortment of FHM SG Flensburg-Handewitt led for this decision especially health problems .
The decision was not easy for me , it matured over several months .
It is time for me to listen to the messages of my body and to end my career in the national team 'told the world champion of 2007 on his Facebook page
It is therefore with a balance sheet of 167 which and 576 gates for Germany in the international retirement .
Because the throw-tremendous moving area player wants to go from Flensburg to champion-League-winner a few years on door hunting , it is not now available to the new coach of national team Dagur Sigurdsson .
With the Icelander who announces his cadre on Tuesday for the international matches against Switzerland Glandorf led a `` long and good conversation .
His ideas and approaches inspired me just as they will inspire my long-standing other players and my successors .
But for my club , I would like to be available healthy in the next few years , longer regeneration breaks that the current double burden does not allow are needed .
The left-hander had had to fear quite his career end in 2012 according to a heel infection .
Because of Achilles tendon problems it had been able to be handled by team doctors of the German handball Federal Government ( DHB ) with a cortisone syringe that later a strong inflammation had activated .
An emergency operation and two more interventions followed .
Then Glandorf had announced a complaint against the team doctor , the quarrel ended with a comparison .
Twelve years pro- and eleven years of national team career do not go past any body without a trace .
I have some health construction sites , which I can no longer ignore .
After the three infection-conditional foot operations that occurred in 2012 in short distances I have never gotten my blood pressure correctly into the grip .
Of course there are some other Joburg conditional complaints .
Already at the beginning of the year , I noticed that , while I control my head , but my body can not deceive , `` explained Glan village in the interview the magazine 'handball Time '' .
For a comeback it would be prepared only in the absolute emergency .
`` If all else fails , I am always conversation-ready '' , declared the twofold head of a family to the specialist magazine .
However , I can count the years in which I can still play handball at a hand .
I must also say that I became also quite humble after my long stay in hospital in 2012 , which affects my health .
According to my career I would at least quite just like to be able to go .
Next to the WM title 2007 and the profit of the champions League 2014 it got 2008 ( HSG north horn ) and 2010 ( TBV Lemgo ) the EHF cup .
In 2012 it safeguarded the Europe cup of the cup winners to itself furthermore with Flensburg .

Andrew Lawson was a man of the sort that character changes things even in a so gigantic organization as the NHS .
As a consultative but no anesthetic doctor he devoted his career to the task to be spared the sick both the agony of the disease , and the pain of treatment .
Among his patients , so his wife remembers , a MI6 employee was that had to live from tortures with the disastrous effects .
Lawson knew that the doctors are the diagnoses and diseases important , whereas the next Generation offers mostly with something quite different : Pain .
One day in 2007 , however , he was the one whose ordeal began .
`` I did not feel myself , '' he wrote in May this year .
I had difficulties to raise me .
While he was fighting with the flu-similar symptoms , he noticed that it did his wife Juliet reproaches impatiently .
`` I want everything more directly than later , '' he noted .
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week , lawsone fully felt unusually , and without reason concerns .
Anything was in the air .
He asked a colleague to carry out a radiological examination of its breast .
Only two weeks ago it had been in the French Alps for the skiing .
There was the result of the X-ray test .
He suffered from mesothelioma , a incurable cancer , the breast fur , in other words the the lungs on drawing the end of skin .
As with the case of most cancer illnesses the exact trigger is to be determined mostly heavily .
For example , while some smokers are falling with lung cancer , all Lungenkrebserkrankten were not previously smokers .
But Mesotheliom is different .
In almost all cases , the cause is an asbestos burden - contact with the fibre material that was once seen as `` miracle material but has now been recognised as serious
For most of us , teambuilding is a disease that can ignore how easy .
Asbestos is , after all , a product of the past .
The most dangerous asbestos type was not used in Britain since the 1960 `` s more than the industry has committed itself voluntarily to stop using this .
Also , where it was still used , only people worked in certain branches directly with the material - plumbers , building workers , carpenters and dockers for example .
As an industrial dangerous material from another time it today hardly yet seems to be alarming .
But this complacency is inappropriate .
Britain , it seems , is experiencing the culmination of a Mesoltheliom disease .
There are more deaths from teambuilding here than in any other country in the world .
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year twice as many people die from this disease than road accidents .
The annual figures Mesotheliomtodesfälle since 1980 and expected future deaths in the United Kingdom
The reason why we are seeing the fatal consequences now , even though it is asbestos for years illegal ( 1999 have been banned all types of asbestos ) , is that developed a teambuilding only after decades .
And the scourge of mesothelioma is not limited to former workers the construction industry .
Asbestos was , and is frequent still , in the houses available , in which we live , the offices in which we work , the schools , in which we learn and the businesses in which we shop .
And that is why teambuilding knows no class barriers , financial borders , professions or age .
The privileged bastions , of the elegant department stores in London to private schools , are not a harbor .
The Parliament building are asbestos contaminated .
Also in the hospitals in which nevertheless we are supposed to become healthy were defined already as initial stoves of this fatal carcinogen .
Andrew Lawson was not old .
He was not a plumber .
It was difficult for him in fact to imagine where it could have come possibly with asbestos in contact .
Then he found it .
`` It looks as if in the tunnels at the Guy 's an amount of asbestos were available to hospital , where I completed my training for six years . '' He wrote .
All - Students , nurses , doctors and gatekeepers - use the tunnels .
One wonders how many will be my age at the same disease ?
Unfortunately , he was unable to answer this question , at least in part .
`` From the four doctors that were trained at the Guy 's hospital , and that fell with Mesotheliom ill in the last five years '' he wrote in 2010 in a letter , `` I am the last one that still lives . ''
How many of us will fall ill ?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with Mesotheliom in the age of 48 years .
When he died on 17 February this year , he was 55 .
That was an unusually long survival time .
Fifty per cent of all Mesotheliomerkrankten die within 8 months after the diagnosis .
The disease always ends fatal .
We can therefore only repeat Lawsons question : 'How many of us will fall ill ? '
The leading expert Britain `` s to mesothelioma , a professor Julian Peto , assumes that between 1870-74 and 2050 , if the asbestos epidemic in the United Kingdom is expected to come to a standstill , a total of 90.000 of the disease will be the victims .
Most of them have no idea at the moment , so that they will die .

A short look onto the files of the courts which the concerned persons turn to frequently because of claims for compensation shows how far the scourge of the Mesothelioms is already spread .
In June this year `` s Marks & Spencer has , for example , too , to have stopped Janice of All negligently cast an air asbestos .
She worked nine years for the chain , from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible on the clothing department in two locations - one of them the purchase in the Oxford Street .
Mrs Allen was only 18 years as , when it began its work in M & S .
Now it has two children in the twenties .
In this matter , `` says , 'I had never heard of teambuilding , I had not even really on asbestos .
I never thought that I would affect the .
There are few people who know a lot about asbestos .
The fact is that the term asbestos is not one substance , but a group of six minerals .
The name stems from the word 'Asbestiform `` , a description of the fibre structure that makes the material resistant and flexibility .
Three of the six have been used in construction .
Chrysotile asbestos , also known as white asbestos today , is by far the most widely found asbestos in buildings .
It was used for roof plates , slabs , tube isolations , storage water heater isolations , even for brake linings in cars .
It is less serious than other asbestos forms , but is regarded as a major health risk `` with possible death by the EU and the WTO .
More dangerous is , however , the brown asbestos ( Amosite ) and that blue asbestos ( Cape asbestos ) .
Britain was once the world `` s largest importer of brown asbestos , and experts believe that '' it clear indirect evidence that this is a major reason for the uniquely high Mesotheliomraten .
A member of Marks & Spencer was taken in the flagship store in the Oxford Street , London , exposed to asbestos Alamy
Janice Allen may have seen not as a typical Mesotheliomopfer , but the work of Julian Peto suggests that their history is not unusual .
He has presented a study of those affected , in the is presented that 'was caused a substantial proportion of the mesothelioma without known suspension through work or in this House probably by asbestos contact in the environment ' .
A majority of these contacts is based according to his statement on the `` normal use and aging '' of our buildings .
It appears that no one can expect to be safe .
A report by Goddard consulting , the Palace of Westminster has investigated , shows how people in the heart of the government , unknowingly may have been exposed to the substance .
In 2009 , Goddard reported that the service formulating and pipelines behind the committee rooms of Parliament with asbestos whose serious fibres could be caused by something as safe as `` strong air movements '' were contaminated .
Members of Parliament are accused often to look after their own interests , but it looks as if the opposite would have to .
While the management office of the Parliamentary Work Service was insisting on the Westminsterpalast receiving a `` clean health certificate '' , meanwhile it is undisputed that 1 billion £of amount of work must be found over several years in order to renovate the parliament to modernize the electrical installations and that asbestos remove , and that according to the general elections in 2015 the representatives will presumably rather meet in the QE2 conference center seemed likely than on the green banks in Westminster .
The Goddard report also indicated that 'was not handled the presence of asbestos in accordance with the relevant provisions ' .
No one can know whether this mismanagement will cost lives .
Everything that can be done now is wait .
A person who was able to determine the contact with asbestos never exactly is Graham Abbott , a general practitioners .
As Andrew Lawson the 50 old Abbott suspect that it was stopped in its work in hospitals , the asbestos .
`` I have worked in a hospital in which asbestos complaints positive were decided , '' he says , `` but I can not prove it in my case .
It is so difficult to remember all places which one worked on and onto the data .
At which it still exactly remembered is the day at the beginning of December 2009 at which he got such kind of fevers .
He was 45 , and was late in the evening by an operation .
I had suddenly joggling-frost .
It was all of a sudden .
I felt terrible .
I thought not to get the trip left home .
As a doctor knew Abbott that the pain of breast fur , the skin by his lungs came around .
But how Janice Allen he had no reason to suspect , a mesothelioma .
He was not a month to work .
Amazed doctors made X-rays of his breast and apply Pleurakathether in order to take liquid from the lungs and to test in the lab .
His complaints , but without diagnosis .
His health improved slowly , and it has returned to his job .
From time to time the symptoms returned , however , often after sporting activity and violent terrorists .
2011 was a patient Abbott `` s with similar symptoms in its practice and has been diagnosed with teambuilding later .
But also now Abbott did not combine this with his own case .
After all , its patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with asbestos .
The connection in the case was clear .
In September 2011 Abbotts state worsened again and his family doctor brought his CT-Scans and X-rays to an expert group .
In December 2011 , exactly two years after Abbott felt for the first time ill , introduced a with a camera equipped probe in the between the music and the breast .
I am an optimist .
I am generally simple further , `` he says .
To be honest , I had not made me so many concerns .
But Rachel , my wife , was concerned .
The result of the purpose : Lay in the week between Christmas and New Year : 'I was told that it was teambuilding . '
Graham Abbott : Diagnosis teambuilding
Suddenly Abbott had appointments with Macmillan-nurses from whom one recommended him to take an attorney .
Only now he understood the extent of the epidemic .
`` It turned out that asbestos was very widespread especially in big public buildings in which tubes were often isolated with asbestos '' , he says .
The people , that the asbestos in these buildings were stopped , fall ill now .
And it is now teambuilding younger people who have worked in the typical professions .
The most dangerous tubes with asbestos isolations in hospitals below the earth , so patients were not stopped the material
But many employees , that changed into pedestrian Tunneling from a building into the other one ( as Andrew Lawson ) or ate in underground canteens ( as it often did to Graham Abbott ) , came with greatest probability into contact with the poisonous substances .
It shows that were for several decades after the war hospitals for patients may save lives , but slum-livers for the Firouz doctors .
It will also still today .
Pupils geared their bunsen burners to asbestos mats .
And it is not just hospitals .
Asbestos was due to its fabulous insulating and flame retardant polyester properties often in offices , shops , libraries and city halls .
Also schools .
Indeed , many people have had the first asbestos contact in the classroom .
Everywhere in the country , in thousands of chemistry hours , pupils geared their bunsen burners to asbestos mats .
The issue of asbestos is spoken about Web sites now often in schools .
And meanwhile so innocent objects in our houses as slabs or scale roofs contained asbestos as a default .
'It is a industry poison that is contained in large parts of our real estate , ' noticed Andrew Morgan , the lawyer who Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy 'has represented .
In one case , the only way that a woman remembered was the dismantling of a garden box in the 1970 `` s .
So you look out as you tear down your garden box .
The effects of the diagnosis , and the knowledge that the disease is incurable , is immense .
A while regrets to process that `` , Graham Abbott says .
I went back to work and tried to continue , but I noted that I could not focus on what I have done .
I was two weeks in practice .
Then I knew that I had to go and take care of myself .
Well , I am not going to further Christmas .
With the greatest difficulty was the perspective change of the position of a doctor to that of a patient .
As countless patients before him , he remembers how overwhelmed it was from all the information with which he rightly had to come .
It was very difficult to include all of this , `` he says .
`` I asked my doctor 'how long I still have ? '
And I was still around 12 months .
I remember that I thought , `` Well , I am not going to further Christmas .
That was it then. ``
Teambuilding is particularly insidious , because it our lives conservation mechanism - the breathe itself - is that caused the fatal cancer .
Most of the cases of teambuilding are caused by asbestos .
Asbestos consists of smallest fibres .
If the asbestos is has caused and the fibres are inhaled , can they in the pleura , skin , by the lungs .
Asbestos fibers irritate the pleura and can activate cell mutations .
`` The problem arises with the inhaled acerose asbestos fibers '' , so professor Tom treasure , a heart thorax doctor that changed Hospital in 2001 onto the Guy 's .
Exactly the hospital , of the Andrew Lawson believed that it has suspended the asbestos , is now ironically , a leading centre in the treatment of mesothelioma .
Treasury knew lawsone and dealt with some others that probably during their education in the hospital the asbestos were stopped .
As soon as the asbestos needles reach the pulmonary fabric treasure says `` where the skin is , if they are pressed from the breath process onto the edge .
By nature it is from the beginning invasive .
The usual options on other cancers not work in teambuilding so good .
The effectiveness of a operation , for example , is hotly contested .
Some say that it is worth a try .
Treasure denies that .
`` One can not cut out the pleura '' , he says .
You are not with the knife .
Meanwhile , the cancer is not to chemotherapy very well , `` the '' effect ' , but does not cure .
`` Sometimes there are long-term on living , '' says treasure .
But in the end they die all .
Fortunately , some patients live long , in fact , much longer than expected .
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis .
Two and a half years after its own diagnosis is fighting Graham Abbott still .
After he had contacted mesothelioma , Abbott in contact with Andrew Lawson , of the four years after its diagnosis a Check-In man support and consultancy for company had become Mitbetroffene .
He imagined `` Hallo , cancer headquarters , '' cheerfully in the case of calls .
`` He was very positive , '' says Abbott .
He had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier , and was still very active .
Initially , Abbott had been offered to six chemotherapy cycles , which would last four months and likely to extend his life by only a month .
'I was desperate , `` he says .
I wanted to give up .
Lawson , however , was ' things in a slightly more positive light ' .
After the consultation of several doctors Abbott , its treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski , decided to continue heart-thorax-specialist at the Guy .
`` We had an advantage by the fact that I do not further had to be referred , I called simply and got a date , '' Graham .
A normal patient would must be given a reference and have to wait for the approval of the treatment .
Money is crucial for Mesotheliom-ills in order to be able to use the best available treatments .
But if these treatments finally inevitably fail , many are affected by a different financial concern - on the future of the families who leave them .
And so they are directed to the courts in the hope of compensation .
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP .
`` It is since 1898 known that asbestos is extreme dangerously for the health '' , says Morgan .
But what in the 1960 `` s changed is that it was realized that was also a very low burden a health risk .
And here the negligence of companies began to play a role .
Andrew Lawson and Guy was laid in their case , finally , but it was not what Morgan a 'full compensation ' , as has been able to prove not Lawson with absolute certainty that teambuilding be on a asbestos contact on Guy 'was due .
After the investigation on his death confirmed a spokesman for the Guy ' , however , that ' have been removed the asbestos fibres in the affected Keller area in the 1990 `` s .
This was for Andrew Lawson too late .
How asbestos can be eliminated .
It is actual for Mesotheliom ills that make an effort for compensation , an enormous problem to assign the fatal asbestos contact to a company or a job - usually decades after the incidents .
Many of their previous employers have been sold or closed .
Insurance documents can be lost .
And those who are against claims , know that the time for it is , but certainly not with the prosecutor .
As reaction to that there were this year clear new legislations that it makes more simply for Mesotheliom concerned persons to demand a compensation even if their former employers are not to be discovered anymore .
The law established a fund of 350 million £for all that were diagnosed after July 2012 supported by the insurance industry be able to prove a contact , but not be able to sue anybody .
In these cases , the plaintiffs receive 80 % of what a court could have given to them in a normal compensation process - roughly 120,000 £ .
Some 300 successful applications in the programme are expected per year .
Andrew Morgan feels like so many Mesotheliom concerned that £350 million represented a 'very good work of the insurance industry .
`` That is a deal of insurers for insurers '' , he says , and points out that it is a question of a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay with the case of this sum if the time had not passed over that and Mesotheliom ills find the enterprises and they could sue normal .
Also Mike penning , former work and retirement minister , admitted that the law is not `` perfect '' .
But both penning and Morgan admitted that faced with seven deaths a fast action is necessary daily .
`` The people suffer so much and need help today , '' said penning during the second hearing of the Mesotheliom-law in December of last year .
At this point , Mr Abbott was for 19 months in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski .
According to their first deliberations Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation , of which he unlike Tom treasure a positive impact expected .
This has been accompanied by a radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy with which Lang-Lazdunski can present a survival rate more than five years of up to 40 % .
Abbott felt strengthened .
That is , of course , with the most important thing , he says .
You can see that again and again in patients .
There is something that you can continue .
If you give up , you are feeling very quickly more bad .
Graham Abbott subjected himself to the operation in March 2012 .
At the end of August , he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles .
After concern scans is showing no signs of the disease .
Then I had a scan in March 2014 .
There have been several cancer-spots by my chest .
I became 50 .
That is not life-threatening .
That is life-ending .
Again Abbott subjected himself to six chemotherapy cycles .
Now is not a trail of tumours more visible .
But the process is very hard physically and psychologically .
You need to think of practical things - on the money , if I am not more , for example , or to my wife , as the storage water heater timing worked .
If you get bad news , you will be negative .
You must look forward .
As father of Ellie , 16 , and Tamsin , 14 , that is not always easy .
'For parents is the difficult , `` he says .
It is difficult to know what we should say and how much .
When I received my first diagnosis , I said to my girls that I would have an illness with which I would not get old .
You responded very different .
Tamsin is very sociable and impetuous .
She told it to their friends and we got soon many calls .
Ellie was more cautious .
You did not say a lot .
Such discussions are something that have to go through all cancer patients .
But for Mesotheliomerkrankte such conversations are not from hope pulled through , not of a track of hope for survival .
The disease brings ( as end to Stephen Jay Gould ) a grim security .
As Andrew Morgan says , `` mesothelioma is not life-threatening .

It is the ideal isolation material for the steam engines and turbines of the industrial revolution .

No compensation is paid .

Leonidas asked into regressing arena
Not only the gladiators stood ankle in the slush at the first Rhine wild boar Roman day in the recreational park .
But the appeal of the event was strong enough to attract more than 1,000 visitors yesterday that defied the rain taking a shower and autumnal cold and be absolutely thrilled at the historical spectacle .
There was a colored round of representations , performances , games , exhibits and information about the time of the Romans and their importance for the Rhineland .
Martial fighter force of regressing school of `` Amor Mortis '' , who used every rain pause for demonstrating a robust fight art in the arena preserved with soft sand , was main attraction of the day undoubtedly
Regressing owner 'Leonidas `` proved humor and competent host and sent his men after each other to the sound of the heroic match regressing in various types .
First it was up to the `` Provocatoren '' with rectangular shield and Kurzschwert and football fall at the left leg and appeared at the right wing .
The `` Essedarii '' with breast-plate , short sword , and throw out , as well as iron regressing helmet , leg and poor protection , followed .
The appearance of the `` Retiarius '' who competed with the `` Secutor '' with casting net , Trident and dagger and pushed the lad to ground after short fight was especially impressive .
There the swords cracked metallically at each other , the shields schepperten and the throw lances flew humming through the arena , that one fear and bangs could become around the health of the gladiators .
But on the had Pliva 'Summa Rudi ' s ' , the like barks referee , always a close eye .
`` We wanted to make the Roman everyday life revived and make the culture of Roman time real '' , declared intention to Lorenz Euskirchen , chairman of the organizer `` Circle of friends Römerkanal '' , behind the spectacle .
After two years of preparation time an `` Oppidum Romanum '' , a Roman city , became from the recreational park for a day as Vizebürgermeister Claus Wehage found in his greeting word .
After all , the Romans has not only brought war and occupation in our region , but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we still revere today .
Remains of that were to be marveled at also at the Roman day , about instance `` aqueduct marble '' of the Roman channel bridge eleven meters high and 1400 meters long that some day stood at Lüftelberg .
The Frontinus-Gesellschaft , the water and energy once and now , and Managing Director Petra Fricke knew : 'Today , we are still benefit from the knowledge of that time `` .
This is also confirmed Diplom surveyor Ralph saint of `` engineer team two '' from Rheinbach , the measuring instruments , as the Romans Chorobat Groma or Dioptra retrieve .
The Roman villa into rough drafts presented to Blankenheim and models of the excavations anno 1894 as well as bricks from the Original-Hypokauste , the hot air heating which once warmed up the Roman villa .
Impressing also the footprints that had been left behind by wolf and fox two millennia ago in the kicks of clay before one burned these .
In 2011 the office had dug up the remains of a Roman villa for ground care of monuments with the case of the Rhineland country association in the trade park north in Rheinbach .
We found encirclement walls of a building for growing crops for industry for trade building construction with a dry kiln for dry cereals and malting .
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica , an agricultural good declared archeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser .
She introduced a series of find pieces from these excavations in a glass showcase cabinet , under that a big plate , several fine glass envelopes as well as parts of a dainty necklace .
The villa existed presumably from the first up to the fourth century according to Christ , up to the idea of the Germans in the then Roman Rhineland , Morscheiser presumes .
With it the children occupied themselves furthermore with the Roman windmill game , similar to the present nine men 's Morris , or they wrote their names with metal styluses as once the Roman pupils on guard boards
At the state of the Roman thermal springs Zülpich the children mosaics themselves were allowed to put , make glass mosaics at the state of the glass museum Rhine creek and help themselves Nettersheim at the state of the Eifel natural center a heavy wheat mill of stone in order to mill the flour for a pancake bread or a muesli
With the carefully reproduced Roman touring car drawn by two cold-blooded animals the visitors have gone through the amusement park and has also past the impressive state of the Urban grammar school that `` presented the results of its '' Roman project weeks ' here .
With a Roman week of the 13th to 21st September also the municipality guard mountain into that brings in Rhineland-wide called out Roman year 2014 , that is supposed to remind Augustus of the death of emperor 2000 years ago .
Together with the home and historical ver a , as well as the watch Berger hiking Verein , the partnership association and the layman game circle , inter alia , be Oberbachem thematic hikes , a lecture , cook evenings , as well as guides for school classes and offered to the Roman past Bergs watch .
In this case , for example , a Roman legionnaire will tell about his work on the drafty guard mountain , plants than living monument introduced by the Treaty of time and a funny teaching-hour on people communication between a group submitted to Wachtberger `` Germans ' and consulted Romans .
The Adendorfer elementary school dedicates itself within the framework of a project week to the Roman topic .
With the Roman week the numerous ones are supposed to be done frequently but no more at first sight visible tracks of the Romans in guard mountain in an again learnable way .
In the watch Berger Rathaus will be a small presentation to the Fund of the Berkumer Matronenheiligtums in 1879 , .

Konstantin Weckers merciless , honest memoirs
It is actually more philosophical report than biography , which brought Konstantin Wecker , singer-songwriter , pacifist , into `` Monk and warrior '' political-surely activist , ex-prisoner , on 287 pages to paper .
Not chronologically , but more thought shred for thought shreds the inhabitant of Munich born on 1st June 1947 wrote down his memoirs , introduced every chapter through a suitable song text .
And it is in this case ruthlessly honest : From the onanism as a Gymnasiast up to the shoplifting and drug consumption he does not skip any human weakness .
Also , in order to show how he learned even tolerance in the contact with his fellow men .
Broad space are also abstract , but all the more important terms : Love , soul , ego , the existence in the now , spirituality - all the he tried to get to the bottom , in a very philosophical , but also very personal way .
And it explains also his pacifism , his social criticism , his political engagement - and also , as only the music did not shape him ( the opera lover became the Soul and skirt musician ) , but also his prison stay .
Latter familiarized also the ascetic monk that arises for `` through subtraction '' with the playboy Konstantin Wecker as he says `` when one leaves out everything unnecessary '' .
Between all the highly-intellectual opinions there are , however , also short anecdotes for the derivation : About instance about fights in a restaurant frequented by GIs or a crazy drive in the case of which he aimed for a tree frontally .

Amazon buys $ 1.04 billion for With
Ginebra has just confirmed , had reported what information on Monday morning : The online retailer - and video producer , and a number of other things - is buying the video streaming service after for 1.04 billion ( $ 970 million US $ ) .
The announcement comes as a surprise , not because no one had expected a takeover of shrug , but because it was assumed that YouTube would win the company .
Three months ago , it looked as if the sale of With to the video service of Google for a cool billion decided , and the cooperation also appeared of course .
Shrug that only three years ago as Justin.tv was established had started as general Streamingdienst - a living version of YouTube .
Instead of this that it wanted to publish their acts of daring a platform quickly for players in games , a `` YouTube for live games '' , such an insider .
The Twitch-interface .
And '1,081 play ' , a video genre , in which who preached the ( mostly older ) give a veneer of secret science theatre , are popular on YouTube already very .
It is now the case that YouTube is often mentioned in order to describe shrug , so it has become the information that YouTube shrug wanted to buy , something boredly , a textbook example of an established engineering company that buys a potential competitor .
It is a mystery why the deal with YouTube was not achieved , since the company reportedly was prepared to pay as much as Amazon .
All that we know at the moment about that is this statement of Emmet shear , president of Twitch : `` We decided for Amazon because they believe in our Community they split up our values and long-term visions and they want to help us with reaching there more quickly . ''
Another secret is , to be honest , the incredible success of With .
For snobs as me that declare that they do sport more gladly than to watch during that , is to watch it to others during the playing heavily to understand the attraction that comes from that instead of taking even the control console into the hand .
It is a thing to look to a friend at 3 o 'clock in the morning over the shoulder while she is creeping through resident Evil and something very else , to watch to a silkworm moth during how it is fired into the head 20 times after each other in call of Duty .
All these games could now just look at you .
Another problem is that many of the most popular games being ego-games today , so the watch without its own control of the look perspective can be a very good recipe for headaches .
I admit that the rapid flows into which Roger Bannisters of our electronic age complete whole games in record time , entertaining .
But as long as a game or humor virtuoso is not in this case , his Twitch-channel is not presumably so very much interesting .
But what skeptics know as I have ?
After is called of 55 million of different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic .
And as exactly Amazon wants to make money from that ?
It is difficult to imagine that is so after in instant Ginebra , after such as YouTube simply would have been able to swallow .
But after has something that would have every business : Thousands of young men , which are courted as advertisers .
How the chairperson of Twitch , shear , did not say yet Amazon and Twitch `` believe both at the future of the gaming '' , `` and the medium does not show any signs of a shrinkage once - swallow - as spectator sport .

With Rona fair head the BBC found the great director who it needs .
It arrives with a proud fame train from the bank world , the media management and the internal circle of the Tory-party .
And it has its own front experience .
Your career began with the case of the worldwide management consulting company bain and Co. , on which she changed ICI and the media world to Morgan Stanley , Bombadier , from Pearsons .
It was for seven years a CEO of the Financial Times and resigned when the top post of the mother company Pearsons went to a younger male counterparts .
Your compensation was supposedly almost 1 million £ .
Their political ranking is sound .
It was recommended David Cameron Lord Browne to the former chairman of BP than this searched for more private-sector expertise in White House : It has become the adviser cabinet .
Her husband is a former Tory township board member .
In May , I described the task of the chairman with a poisoned chalice .
Not only is the BBC as a huge and complex unity in the heart of public life , but there is also an internal paradox in its structure .
The confidence works in two directions : Towards inside onto the first guard of the own management hierarchy in the BBC , however also to the outside as a voice of public concern and noise if the things work wrongly .
That guarantees for an almost untenable duopoly , the need for a complete comprehensive reform .
But which again incoming chairperson would risk to line up , to hit everything and to take apart an institution which is as complex as a Chinese dynasty while even maybe he is depriving himself of his job in this case .
It is a difficult task .
And as if that were not enough , are also still many interested in the BBC reduced to see - power , money and status outdated .
While the competition is coming closer and new technologies are threatening old , comfortable securities the pending negotiations of the royalties are joined with special dangers for the BBC .
For the modest sum of 145.50 £per year the British public buys into the certainly largest media company in the world .
The BBC tells a good history she says that it reaches 96 percent of all budgets and costs only 40 pence to each of them per day .
And it seems that the BBC KDM is rising to back up again : 53 % support it today , compared to 31 % 10 years ago .
The visual and consumer habits for the BBC have changed : I get nowadays news headlines on my mobile phone and see missed programmes later on my iPlayer .
But it remains a very beloved and considerable institution .
It needs a considerable chairman - I hope it has found it .

Children need roots and wings
44 years it was in the teaching profession , of that 23 as headmasters .
From this time Manfred Judge knows many were Petershausener and Kollbacher from their time as students .
His methods were sometimes unconventional , however , always taken from its desire to see the person in the student .
The Schneekoppe is the best known mountain of the giant mountains .
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motive from his home .
Judges was in Čapek / born today , Tuesday .
Already with 14 he was interested in the teacher profession after four years of high school .
A year after the Sudeten Germans were confiscated .
Within half an hour the family had to leave their house .
After some months in a warehouse it went in 1946 to Bavaria - in the good freight car carriage .
So it brought judges into the upper-Franconian depression village .
The teacher training took place in Bamberg .
For this purpose Manfred Richter six times weekly had to run ten kilometers to the next railway station , go going with the railways according to Bamberg , there three kilometers crossways through the whole city to the school and in the evening back .
After two months Manfred Richter got a sleep occasion in a red-cross-home in Bamberg : Together with up to 15 schoolmates in a sleep hall .
In 1951 it did teaching position candidate the first and in 1954 after three years the second state examination .
As Germany had no free teachers for him , he toughies in Upper Bavaria and came on 1 November 1954 to the school in Zaglav .
The `` young woman area '' was his first `` official residence in school construction .
In 1958 , he got a three area official residence in the newly built teacher house next to school .
Manfred Richter bought this house in 1980 after the school had been solved in Kollbach 1968 .
Until then there were three classes in Kollbach in the school association Petershausen-Kollbach and in Peter beluga five .
From the school year 1968 / 69 these were summarized in Peter beluga in the present city hall .
When the school association Indian village was based , only the primary school remained in place .
In order to avoid a downgrading of in the now smaller school , the former Rector Georg choose to Karl field - and Manfred judges was his successor .
However , Peter beluga has increased , and so the children and their teachers from September 1982 could get the current construction , which was expanded in 1997 , after Richters retirement .
Manfred Judge extols the simple generosity of the former mayor Ludwig Götz that additional on community costs a skill space and build 1997 basement rooms during the enlargement made , although this was not eligible to the guidelines for school buildings .
'Mayor will was very school friendly ' , reminded judges grateful .
In his whole career Manfred Richter has never forgotten the speech contribution of a government representative which had answered a paper of a school council on right and justice : `` One must never forget the love '' . Manfred Richter transformed , what it had belonged to there as a young teacher .
We must give the children two types : Roots and wings , `` the today 84-year long one .
And he had to find out : `` That does always not succeed '' . Whether it means only his pupils or just the same his own six children there is not very clear .
In any case , was judge actions sometimes unconventional .
If they can they got to adapt , not a criminal work and were also have not to sit .
At the expense of the municipality Richter had made buy two pairs of boxing gloves and made the two opponents be lined up against each other even if there should be once in this case a violet .
For the welfare of the school Richter maintained a good relation to the former mayor Ludwig Götz ( CSU ) as a rector .
This convinced the independent judge of that after his superannuation , 1996 at least than last to run for the district council on the CSU list .
But judges was continue to six and joined the CSU .

China refused Hong Kong right to government election , demonstrators swear retaliation
On Sunday , the Chinese Parliament decided , despite the growing calls for democratic reform against the nomination of candidates for the elections in 2017 by the electorate from Hong Kong .
This procedure inspires presumably the long announced protests in Hong Kong 's business district while activists were leading the planning and mobilization for this purpose within less hours according to the announcement into the ways .
The decision of the Chinese People `` s Congress allows the Communist leaders in principle , all not Beijing loyal candidates .
`` The is not unexpected , but it makes us but wroth , '' said right expert Emily Lau , chairman of the Democratic Party .
That is not what Beijing had promised .
It has lied to the inhabitants of Hong Kong .
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime .
In his defense of the Chinese decision Li Fei , vicesecretary-general of the Constant Committee of the National Nation Congress , said that the admission of public nominations would be too `` chaotic '' at the choices for the government from Hong Kong .
Since 1997 , when Britain returned the control of Hong Kong to the Chinese , Beijing promised to make the people from 2017 choose the government presidency .
The Chinese leadership presented the decision of the Sunday as a democratic breakthrough because there is a direct right to vote to the citizens of Hong Kong , but the decision makes also clearly that the Chinese leadership keeps the course firmly through a nomination committee closely controlled by Peking in the hand .
According to a new stipulation only candidates `` with love of the country and love of Hong Kong '' are in addition supposed to be admitted .
The decision follows a summer of some of the largest and most visible protests were to be held in Hong Kong for many years .
Behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong , the movement occupy Central In Love and peace is that organizers has threatened to cut off the financial meltdown if Beijing does not allow any real universal suffrage
At the Sunday evening hundreds of Occupy-Central-supporters had met within few hours according to the announcement in the rain before the government headquarters in Hong Kong .
During the demonstration the organizers said that their movement have reached a new stage of civil disobedience and they planned protest waves in the coming weeks .
You did not give further information to seemingly avoid by problems with the authorities .
In an online communication the organizers informed , that the movement `` the occupation of the Central District only when last resort took into account , an action that only then should take place if all dialogue opportunities are exploited and there is no other choice .
We are sorry about having to say that all dialog chances were exploited today and the occupation of the central district will occur definitively .
The authorities in Hong Kong have for days on the announcement of Beijing , and it were prepared on Sunday before the government buildings more stringent security measures including police forces and barricades .
The riots are supported by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are losing control of their city slowly .
The influx of people from the mainland reinforces the competition for products and services .
Moreover , there is a growing fear that the values such as democracy and freedom of speech Hong Kong under the growing pressure of Beijing begin to crumble .
Some criticized the demonstrations of the Occupy-Central-movement since it endangers the business concern - the lifeline of Hong Kong .
`` The protests that they speak of could cause great economic damage , depending on how many are involved in this and how long they last , '' legal expert Regine Ip said that criticizes the movement for a long time .
We do not want to create any fears that Hong Kong spirals out of control .
This impression is bad for investment .
The from a government viewpoint controlled media of China reported also recently about the democracy activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled from western powers .
This summer organised activists an unofficial referendum on the electoral rights , which were attended by September people - more than a fifth of the voters in Hong Kong .
In July , tens of thousands of one of the largest democracy demonstrations in the history of the region .

Feminists criticize according to racial issue and police behaviors Ferguson
The unarmed teenager became early this month of a police officer in Ferguson , Mo . killed .
The participants lifted their hands into the air and sang , `` Hands high , not fire '' while they were waiting before the funeral .
After two week long protests in Ferguson , Mo , because of the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists .
After their experience put white feminist commentators the sex before the race , when it comes to reproduction right and raise income disparities .
While the tensions were going up in the Middle west , however , and receiving country observation as a whole , Perez saw that the answers were about the race from white women to 100 % .
In comparison with the answers of black women shortly to the shots of the 9th August the personal essays with titles as `` thoughts '' came `` of a white woman '' to Ferguson `` and '' feminism does not turn only around the suppression from women `` relatively late .
But for Perez that meant an important change .
`` I do not believe that one finds many people in the feminism that be about the white and speak privileges in so highly class way she said .
The people felt for this purpose pressed into squeezing out something for the incidents .
It is typical of the crisis in which we are and because the situation in Ferguson lawmaker so that they must put it .
For English professor Koritha Mitchell of the Ohio state University Ferguson problems onto the light to whom black Americans that , however , are considered not as `` Woman topics '' in the cultural room are abandoned every day brought .
`` I can publish something merry on Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 likes here from everywhere '' , said Mitchell .
If I post something over how colors stand in their own country under siege , the silence is deafening .
'How can it be for women sure to speak publicly about a relationship , but not on security in the public sphere ? ' She asked .
For black women as Mitchell who studied race , sex and sexuality in the history of the USA there is not any dichotomy between race and sex problems .
For them black women do not have the luxury of clean , had to separate the issues ; they live every day in the combined reality .
While white women are combining the topics now race and sex in the feminist main stream circles Angela Hattery , professor for women and sex research at the George Mason University , says that their predecessors did the opposite .
`` In between 1865 and 1890 at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the reason was almost always the rape of a white woman '' , said Hattery .
White women have had to be involved in the history to justify the Lynch murder .
For Hattery the split came between white and black women at the point at which white fighters analyzed the country for the woman right to vote as Susan B. Anthony in the late years of the 19th century and stated that the fight could be successful for the right to vote only for in each case a group : Women or blacks .
'You made the decision to stand up for the right , and the right to vote for blacks should come later , ' Hattery said .
If one remembers such things , it becomes conscious to one with power why colored women do not trust white women .
We did not make our job good .
We never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons .
Also after women received the right to vote in 1920 , it lasted another decade until white women organized themselves against the lynching in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of lynching .
The group was almost 40 years after the original request for assistance from black women , says Mitchell .
For Mitchell the flood of white feminist reactions to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behavior , race discrimination - is a mirror of the time , in which white feminists `` call tracing call holds '' played with the problems with which black women sat down from each other since generations .
`` It would be great if the activists , the feminist platforms traditional over such relief the right to education of a child so seriously would take as they did with the right to design control ? '' Mitchell asked .
Feminists of the second generation that based their career on the fight for reproduction rights and the access to contraceptive means attempt to understand now what means that .
The well-known white feminist activist of their children was two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown on Facebook and has published an article by Rebecca Carroll , certain dates only of the Guardian , which calls for more protests from white Americans on the subject of racism .
`` I hope for women who have an other , but parallel reason for understanding a danger being inherent in the body - and opinion on the race which are clearly different in public inquiries - mentioning the changes '' , wrote Steinem .
Even though Steinem for a more through feminism , be addressed in the race , as well as gender issues are perplexed by some of their comments on the race issue in America but .
Christina summer , a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of `` Who stole feminism ? '' Said to She The People that young men in the United States , in particular young coloured men , `` are far more vulnerable than their sisters , '' but Steinems comments on Ferguson are contrary to its previous criticism .
There are now hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women , but almost nothing for boys .
But when the White House recently a small programme , My Brother 's keeper opened , to vulnerable young black and to help Hispanic men , there was annoying reactions of many feminists , including Gloria Steinem .
The relationship between the police to the black community is not the only problem that at the forefront of the mainstream feminism is pressing .
After the US border police picked up almost 63,000 unaccompanied capella minors at the southwest border of the country this year , also the topic of the immigration reform goes again onto the surface - this time as a woman topic .
Andrea Mercado , co-chairperson of We Belong Together , of an organization which mobilizes women for the immigration reform said that for a new consideration of the topic as an essential woman topic she must publish only the histories of the immigrant women .
`` These speak for themselves , '' Mercado said .
If the great majority of the work visas goes onto masculine immigrants , the women who accompany it are in a position in which they are sensitive to domestic power and exploitation .
`` These stories will find a echoes in the women '' s organisations , `` she said .

On the hopping-castle during the castle garden party some was on Saturday rid .
The concept of the organizers was right .
In spite of the strong downpour at the Saturday evening approximately 1200 music fans came to the Open-Air-celebration in the castle garden .
The admission temporarily had to be stopped .
`` That was angry , '' said Ron SEM , one of the organizers .
Salt whisk l light and fun .
Maxim Sachraj and Ron SEM formed the name Amula from two Spanish words .
Because the Open Air in the Salzwedeler castle garden is supposed to radiate brightness through various shows on day and at the evening .
Na , and the fun comes in any case of alone .
That was proved already on the early Saturday , when the first visitors to the Open Air prepared themselves .
The organizers had promised a party for all generations .
And they succeeded in this .
Around the supply stands at the castle garden meadow Salzwedeler had it , but also guests from their immediate surroundings .
You followed the first live appearances , bobbed with the foot in time , enjoyed cool drinks - shortly : Relaxation pure and was pleasure announced .
And that right through the generations .
While ones were lolling about onto covers on the extra carted white sand at the beach bar , other at a quarter of wine in the Vinothek refreshed , the junior staff raged on the hopping-castle that was a big attraction of attraction for the smaller guests .
But also at the the voluntary helpers had to do all hands to child makeups fully in the truest sense of the word in order to become gentleman to the crush and to conjure imaginative creations into the small faces .
The larger ones used the football player tables or participated in a skateboard-workshop which the Goodfoot-crew adjusted from Salzwedel .
Until the big rain came .
He was shortly before 5.30 p.m. on the visitors , particularly families were looking for the space and dry .
But the attractiveness of this did not diminish .
`` More people came than expected , '' would say Ron SEM , who spoke of a `` success on the whole line '' .
Therefore , nothing is opposed to a repeat of the major party in the coming year .
Although at content and size of the events must be done , SEM made clear in a first balance on Sunday to the people .
He designated as annoyed , that meanwhile the admission had to be stopped .
Obviously , the security company with too little forces have been booked .
The consequence : Some that already had paid did not come anymore to the ground .
The resonance was very good .
In a first cautious estimate the Salzwedeler co-organizer spoke of about 1200 visitors who romped in the castle garden .
There were problems with the case of the audio engineering .
The Salzwedeler vois recordable bloc `` broke it from their appearance therefore folksonomies .
The technicians have not been able to create a halfway reasonable .
The planned Shisha-Lounges could not be built up because the tents could not be brought to salt whisk because of a puncture .
'Next year they will be `` , but the organisers .
The premiere night of the Amula-Open-Airs was from the numbers of visitors more than succeeded .
And the in bad weather .
However , the organizers committed some errors which are still forgiven with the case of the first time , but were eliminated have had them with the case of the second edition .
In the social network Facebook the organizers must take criticism .
'Sorry , but for twelve euros simply `` expected ' more 'Melanie Mary is expressed in the event .
`` You have unfortunately taken a bit , '' says Ele Zimmermann at the same place .
Others do not see the initial problems very so narrow .
I think it is very good that not only embraces some stupid , but also really try to put something on its feet .
Guard off `` ! Stephanie Jenß to the Amula writes .
Now the organizers have a year of time in order to stop these criticism points .

There is silence under this treetop
We showed a powerful tribe during our puzzle task of the summer series `` My piece of the Rhöner Glück '' on the last Friday .
There are still several of these giant trees in the rural district , the shown copy is the `` nanny-goat silence oak '' above Unterweißenbrunn .
A bumpy footpath leads up to the about 600 years old oak .
It is past fields , basalt stone clusters and basalt stone seas .
A small piece below the kind of bottomless pit of the farmer mountain , a kilometre north of the road to it is wise .
The natural monument looks energetic , it projects over the other trees of the surroundings and it reminds of an American mammoth tree with an extent of more than eight meters .
A small Buddha on a tree Stumpf suggests that it is a spiritual or mystical place .
But despite intensive research , there were only references to the names of origin .
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider consulted the Bischofsheimer archive extra and consulted older people from Unterweißenbrunn in order to find out which circumstance has it with the nanny-goat silence oak .
The result of his inquiries remained the very sober explanation for the name .
Accordingly the goat herdsmen are supposed to have driven their animals until about 80 years ago onto the meadows arduously cleared and released from stones from Unterweißenbrunn .
At the foot of the tree the animal guardians exhausted from the rise are supposed to have taken a rest .
Meanwhile the field gained his importance back , because on the meadows goat herds graze in fact again .
The field was in addition declared as the nuclear zone of the biosphere reservation , if Schneider kept on finding the way out .
During the entry of the crowds one should make but caution , because the basalt warmed up by the sun is a popular whereabouts for common vipers .
A path leads from under white Brunn to the tree , but something is hidden .
Other ways are indicated , the direction high Rhön reach and an extended hike .

Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke a call to order after continuous resistances from her CDU for the introduction of a passenger car toll .
To say “ around it completely clearly : It stands in the coalition agreement , and she will come ” , said the party chief on Monday to meetings of the CDU leaders committees into Berlin .
In a detailed model Merkel did not commit itself however for the time being .
In the black-red government program “ certain parameters ” are mentioned .
Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt ( CSU ) made “ a proposal , and at that now one continues working ” .

Merkel stressed , also Ministers of Finance Wolfgang Schäuble ( CDU ) brings themselves constructionally into the consultation for a bill .
Beyond the topic he spoke with Dobrindt even about further possibilities of activating more private capital for investments in infrastructure about also with the broadband development .
“ There nothing at all special is to ” . Schäuble had a “ mirror ” - report uncommented calmly , its house checks its own concept , in order to recompense motorway investors with toll revenues - on Sunday after the choice 2017 .
CSU boss of Horst Seehofer warned thereupon before it to develop in the cabinet of toll concepts against the responsible Minister .
CDU Bundesvize Armin Laschet affirmed its objections .
“ The coalition agreement never assumed that , all circle and federal highways to bemauten ” , said the North-Rhine/Westphalian CDU regional chairman .
To that extent it is an important signal that Seehofer now announced to speak again about the topic .

Background are fears that a toll impairs the small frontier traffic to neighbour states .
Seehofer had required because of the toll criticism from numbers of the CDU coalition loyalty .
The left one views the plans in view of the controversy in the union as failed .
“ Murks toll is dead ” , said party chief Bernd Riexinger of the “ new of Osnabrück newspaper ” ( Monday ) .
“ With toll the Minister ” fails . Dobrindt wants a sticker obligation on all German roads would bring in , which 2016 to start is .
Domestic autoowners may not be loaded according to coalition agreement however additionally .
Therefore they are to receive a full reconciliation for toll over the Kfz tax .
The model may not disadvantage foreign drivers however in accordance with your-genuinly because of their nationality .

Why “ Guardians OF the Galaxy ” no cash hit became
“ The Expendables 3 ” of Sylvester Stallone brought in less than 30 million dollar its 90 million dollar budget in the USA , during “ Sin City : A lady ton kill For ” only 12 million dollar of his budget of 70 million dollar brought in .
The film “ sex Tape ” tailored to Cameron Diaz brought in on opening weekend only 14.6 million dollar , while children 's films likewise disappoint like “ Drachenzähmen easily made 2 ” with the incomes .
An article of the telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that with the children 's films the lack of quality could be with the films themselves the reason .
Collin called 2014 “ the worst year ” so far for children 's films and described “ Drachenzähmen easily made 2 ” as purely “ functional ” fantasy continuation .
With films for a somewhat older target audience it seems however in such a way , as if the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem .
In July entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic evaluation for each summer film release , which was shown between American Memorial Day and 20 July 2013 and in the current year on at least 2000 canvases .
The results rely on the opinion of the cinema visitors and film critics and point to the fact that the film hits of this year those of the past year equivalently are .
Some commentators mean that the development to changing Sehgewohnheiten and the increasing popularity of Web Streaming services are to due such as Netflix .
Director Jon Favreau , who works at present on of Disney soon appearing jungle book film , said Hollywood Reporter opposite the web page : “ I believe , the times change . ”
We must accept and not try that to run after the past .
Contrary to at present weak cash results of the Hollywoodproduktionen Netflix obtained in recent time of sales with Streaming contents at a value of 1.2 billion dollar , nearly twice as much like last year , in which the revenue 837 million dollar amounted to .
In the last summer the director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for the fact that they concentrated too much on filmings of comics and prophesied a “ core melt-through ” Hollywoods .
In the light of the present wing over seen some commentators argue that its dark prediction can quite contain a true core .
Due to the potential cash hit , under , it which can be expected in the summer 2015 , Avengers : Age OF Ultron , mini ONS and Jurassic World are however more optimistic other representatives of the film industry :
The producer of X-Men , Simon Kinberg , described the decrease of the cash results recently as simply “ cyclic ” and said opposite Hollywood Reporter : “ The next summer will be the largest summer at the cinema cash at all , and nobody becomes more around the business worrying . ”

Putin requires the admission of “ statehood discussions ” of Kiev with east Ukraine
Russian president Wladimir Putin required Russian media reports according to on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stops and directly with negotiations to the “ statehood ” of the disloyal region takes up the fights against the separatists in the east of the country .
His spokesman Dimitri Peskow got straight later that Putin had not meant with it that the area standing under control of the separatists becomes east Ukraine a part of Russia , but that its status must be redefined opposite Ukraine , in order to give to the Russian-speeking region power for the agency of his rights and interests .
Of Putin call to the Kiev government to negotiations on eye level with the per-Russian insurgent ones fits however the strategy apparently pursued by him since beginning of the excesses five months ago : Help for the separatists when taking areas and pressure on the Ukrainian government , in order to make for the again proclaimed region possible Novorossija actual independence for an alliance with Russia instead of with the west .
In an interview with the national television station channel unity condemned Putin the Ukrainian military campaign to the recapture of the areas in the eastern regions Donezk and Luhansk , thought of separatists , which were taken in March and April , after Moscow the Ukrainian peninsula Crimea to 18 . March had annexed .
The Kremlin and the separatists called lately the taken area “ Novorossija ” or “ new Russia ” , a term , which reminds of the pre-revolutionary gloss time of the Russian empire .
Putin pointed out that all those , which attack in the course of the campaigns of Ukrainian politicians for the elections on 26 October and during government groups civilian communities in the areas thought of separatists for imminent peace talks hope “ in their illusions ” are imprisoned reported Itar Tass .
“ We must take up immediately detailed discussions , not only to technical questions , but also for the political organization of the society and the state status of southeast Ukraine , in order to protect the interests of there living humans , ” said it .
Peskow said the fact that of Putin reference to the statehood in the context with the larger autonomy had to be seen , which is discussed for months by the Kiev guidance , in order to scatter fears in Russian-speeking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights is endangered .
Only the Ukrainian government can give the necessary autonomy to the eastern areas , said Peskow .
Here not Ukraine and Russia goes , said Peskow , “ because it not around a conflict between Russia around negotiations between and Ukraine goes , but around an internal conflict in Ukraine . ”
The clarification of the Kremlin spokesman for the correction of the “ misinterpretation ” of Putin remarks underlined the claim to leadership of Russia while handling the separatist rebellion in the east contrary to the direct Annektion the Crimea , on which the majority of the 2 million inhabitant ethnic Russians are .
Moscow would have far larger difficulties to annex the regions Donezk and Luhansk in east Ukraine since most of the 6.5 million inhabitant are not Russians and surveys showed a broad majority for the whereabouts in Ukraine from the time before the conflict .
The autonomy , which was responded by Russian diplomats to international forums , would give to the regional governments in Ukraine authority to negotiate own trade agreements and external relations and so the Kremlin de facto control of an area to give , which connects the Russian national territory with Crimea .
Five months ago the annexed peninsula in the black sea is the home port for the majority of the Russian navy as well as an important commercial port and a historical coastal region .
The regions between the Rostov area in Russia and Crimea is beyond that rich at mines , factories and foundries , which manufacture important components for the Russian military .
Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko suggested with his speech to the inauguration on 7 June that the Ukrainian legislation - after new elections - was to consider additives for condition , with which the respective areas larger control of their finances and the status of the languages is granted .
But its conception of autonomy seems to stand for their armament and goading Moscow on in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels , is accused .
Of Putin last request of Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders after eye level followed after a further penetration of the rebels in the past week , after Russian troops and tank penetrated over the before peaceful region along the Asow sea into east Ukraine .
The separatists supported by Russia transferred in the coup , which is according to fears of Ukrainian police officers the first step of a campaign for the assumption of the strategic coastal region up to Crimea , control of Nowoasowsk .
For this reason substantial civilian and military preparations started , in order to fasten Mariupol , a steel industry port with 500.000 inhabitants , which lies between Nowoasowsk and the narrow entrance to the peninsula Crimea .
Poroshenko spoke a former Soviet republic , which is independent for 23 years on Saturday with a meeting of the European Union-guidance in Brussels and asked urgently for acts , in order to prevent a further Russian aggression against Ukraine .
“ We stand shortly before one point , at which it gives no back more , ” warned Poroshenko .
Thousands of strange troops and hundreds strange tank are now on the territory of Ukraine .
The EU summit did not decide concrete actions , the guidance required the draft of further sanctions against Russia , which are to go in effect with a unspezifizierten escalation of the Ukraine crisis .
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw themselves from their positions into Ilowajsk , after two Russian tank columns and 1,000 soldiers penetrated in order besieged last week into the Donezkregion , separatists to support , said Colonels Andrij Lysenko , Sprecher of the Ukrainian national safety and defence council reports on Saturday in Kiev .
The first probably 63 Ukrainian soldiers , who were included by the Russian idea in Ilowajsk , exchanged on Sunday against 10 Russian paratroopers , who had been imprisoned taken one week ago in Ukrainian area , communicated Lysenko on Sunday .

Lenny Henry : My father never took me into the arm .
Has never said “ I loves you ”
Henry was from seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in the year 1958 .
Its father , who died , when Henry was 19 , worked in a factory and their relationship was limited .
Henry rehearses rare records , which are partly based on an imaginary discussion with its father and developed from the series on radio 4 for a comedy , Rudy 's .
That soundtrack is a mixture from reggae and RAP , with lively melodies .
But Henry had to work itself by some difficult childhood moments .
It visited “ many ” therapies after the death of its mother , and Henry is thoughtful over its relationship with its father .
It was heavy to know it .
One never saw its face , heard only its voting : “ Stop with the noise .
Leave your sister in peace .
Move you !
I want to look Cricket .
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - which had already arisen , when I was a child - went with him into the tavern and spoke about things , like the form of the beer glass or the beauty of a Cricketschlags .
I had never such a discussion with him .
A majority of my life it was this serious type in the corner , which the newspaper read .
Recently Henry opened a foundry in Dudley , and although the conditions are better than at times of its father , he won nevertheless an insight of as the life for him might have been .
It is now somewhat brighter , but they are dark , stygische labyrinths smoke-filled and deep with flame impacts and smoke and much soot .
My father put to hear in former times simply into the tub and then could one him slowly , how he began to sing , because he could wash the foundry of itself .
When I ran around there , it became clear me that he had for many years done that , in order to bring the meal on the table , and my attention for him became larger .
Henry buildup nevertheless as a child without love testifying of its parents .
My father never embraced me , he said never “ I loves you ” .
Only as it to my mother toward end of their life badly went , began we , “ I loves you , I loves you , I loves you ” to say .
By its own daughter Billie , with Dawn French , he could divide the love , which he had missed as a child .
Could you times with “ I love you ” to stop ?
Stop nevertheless embracing me !
Dad , I am 22 !
with Dawn French .
Why should n't we be friends ?
She is a great mother .
It is still friendly with French , with which it was 25 years married .
Dawn is good humans .
Why should n't we be friends ?
She is a great mother .
Henrys own mother was Diabetikerin .
That contributed to its death .
As I thus very much , very overweight became and symptoms of diabetes showed , said my physician “ you must be radical .
Thus I pulled this fitness thing through and had also a drastic diet to make , in order to turn around the symptoms .
It is very heavy .
And it is arduous .
Nobody eats gladly carrots .
Perhaps Henrys career change shows up in its elegant , shortcut beard .
Since it was praised by the critics for its Othello , he is taken in of the theatre .
The comedy of the erring followed , and then Fences of August Wilson .
That is another experience than the sitcom and comedies , which filled out its busy working life .
It began with only 16 years , when he worked in a factory .
A DJ discovered it on the stage , as he people imitated and wrote new Faces over him .
Its television career began in the middle of the seventies . “ I was for a rather long time the only black Imitator/comedian on TV . ”
He learned in the profession .
I did not only have to become large before the eyes of the public , but also from 1975 to 1985 to learn , how I could become an efficient joke telling machine , while I was by the television a star , and that was really with difficulty .
Lenny 1975 with new Faces
Since its manager possessed the stage right at the Black and White Minstrel show , an easy entertainment program , in which the people painted themselves “ black ” , specified Henry its Comedy there over five years .
My family was very unpleasant that .
I wished somehow that it would have never happened , but I do not repent that I did it .
It was a strange , unpleasant position for me , but I cooperated in giant projects and learned , how one deals with a large audience .
But this “ price-crowned light column for many years of the British television ” was also a “ grotesque parody of black people . ”
By the introduction of figures , which lampooned and celebrated the British black culture both , Henry in the 80s worked on an alternative Comedykreis .
The front row of Lenny Henry Show went 1984 on transmission , and into the 90s he was among other things as the kitchen boss Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series boss ! admits .
Advertisement , documentary films , TV-series and roles coined its next decade , but after its BBC series LennyHenry.tv 2008 it imagined : “ Which you make next , Len , because it feels in such a way everything , as if bring you only the time rum or step a little on the place . ”
Afterwards a documentary series came in such a way for radio 4 with the title What 's Great About… ?
The first consequence turned around Shakespeare .
On Shakespeare was I proper allergically .
I had learned and regarded at school never correctly something over him him predominantly as a domain of the middle class , white one in thights and a cabbage in front in it .
Thus I had large fear before it .
All , which we interviewed for the show , Peter Hall , Trevor Nunn , Adrian Lester , Judi Dench said “ you should it times try .
Do not make it bad , if you do not know , about which you talk .
Take a few words into the mouth , and then you will understand , why we love all Shakespeare in such a way .
Henry specified 20 lines from Othellos of last speech for the documentary film and it was enthusiastic .
I had the feeling that I could create that .
It was nearly , as if someone would have put the head finally correct to me on .
“ Around it , it goes is a serious thing , takes it seriously , learns your text , investigates a little .
The samples were brutal , and I read this piece for months , before we made it .
And it was a success .
They seemed to expect a car accident , and the happened simply not .
And soon it arose in the comedy of the erring .
I in the national theatre and I were sudden could it hardly believe .
There there was one moment , when I thought , “ Oh , you changed. `` ''
There was a technical error and Henry felt instinctive that he had to maintain the audience .
“ A small voice told me “ you must now 10 minutes bridge , while they repair the computer. `` ''
Instead the stage leader announced that the conception would continue , as soon as the problem was solved .
I went from the stage and something in me said “ Oh , thank God ” .
I am not responsible for it .
I can leave that someone else .
“ You plays in a play , therefore remain in your role . ”
Henry in Fences at the Duchess Theatre
The text for Fences to learn was demanding .
Panic is very good , strengthens the chords .
Also arrived well , it is thus like a large sign of the Gods , me say “ that is your regulation here. `` ''
He says this , naturally , with a THUNDERING voting .
Thus I remain thereby .
I really love that .
I love it to be in a sample area .
Henry has however still the head a comedian - our discussion is from humorous outbreaks pulled through , while it imitates people again and again .
I decided to make no condition UP Comedy because I find that this kind of the immediate satisfaction of a hall of full strangers is somehow dangerous .
If one looks for that all the time , one drives thereby before a wall .
I arise sometimes live in the Apollo , if I have in addition desire , but altogether give not so much it to me like in former times .
I ask it whether he will make ever again a stand-up comedy tour .
That joke , which I have a beginning in an area with a director , who helps thereby , to form a center section and the end of a travel - I do not believe that I would like to ever again give up .
Is that here thus its new incarnation ?
I think already .
I am gladly an actor .
It makes joke .
One always tell a story , and that is great .
I love stories .
Humans love stories .

Under this treetop prevails rest
We showed a powerful trunk with our task of mystery of the summer series “ my piece of the Rhöner luck ” on past Friday .
Several of these tree giants there are still in the district , the shown copy is the “ Geißruheiche ” above Unterweißenbrunn .
A bumpy footpath leads up to that approximately 600 years old oak .
It goes past at ouples , basalt cairns and basalt stone seas .
A bit underneath the quarry north of the farmer mountain , a kilometer the road after instruction brook , there stands it .
The natural monument looks vital , it exceeds over the other trees of the environment and reminds with an extent from over eight meters to an American sequoia .
A small Buddha on a stump points to the fact that it concerns a spiritual or mystical place .
But despite intensive searches there was only referring to the name origin .
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider consulted specially the Bischofsheimer archives and asked in order to experienced older people from Unterweißenbrunn , which Bewandtnis has it with the Geißruheiche .
The result of its investigations remained the quite sober explanation for the name .
Therefore the goat shepherds their animals from Unterweißenbrunn are to have toilsomely stubbed on those and to have driven from stones released meadows to forwards about 80 years .
At the foot of the tree the animal guardians exhausted by the ascent are to have rested themselves .
In the meantime the range won its meaning back , because on the meadows actually again herds of goat feast .
In addition the range was explained as the core zone of biosphere reserve , cutters continued to find out .
When entering the accumulations of stone one should let caution reign however , because of the sun warmed up basalt is also for cross otters a popular place of residence .
A trail leads from Unterweißenbrunn to the tree , which is appropriate however for something hidden .
Further ways are signposted , the direction Hochrhön climb and to an expanded migration invite .
Where does those stand for castle surrounded by moats ?
Castle surrounded by moats , which is looked for with our next task , are to be found rather rare however in the height .
The reflection in the ditch already gives a good impression of the building , but we have some historical buildings in the district , to which building-counter-protect fit could .

Tax burden of businessmen in the area Washington rises with the economic recovery
A recovery of the economy means more customer , more sales and new jobs .
It means also higher taxes .
National and local tax assessments for enterprises in the country rose last year easily , while the economic recovery accelerated itself , so a again published study in the past week , and the companies in the area Washington did not form an exception .
Enterprises in the area District , Maryland and Virginia paid together 27.6 billion $ to national and local places in the financial year 2013 , a rise by 3,8 percent in relation to the incomes of 2012 at a value of 26.6 billion $ .
The national and local fiscal charges of the enterprises rose last year by 4,3 percent to 671 billion $ on , compared with 3,9 percent in the year before , and it was the third growth year in consequence after the several years of sinking answers 2009 and 2010 .
National taxes rose more strongly than the local deliveries , by 4,3 percent , so the study , which was accomplished by the service agency Ernst & Young with the center for national taxation , a tax policy group .
More than half of the tax revenues of the District , 56 percent , originates from corporate taxes , while 36 percent of the incomes of Maryland from enterprises originate .
Virginia obtains the smallest tax revenues from enterprises with 28 percent .
A majority of the rise with the tax revenues is justified in a recovery of the real estate values of the enterprises , says the researchers , what led to an increase of the real estate taxes by 3,7 percent in this year after the three following each other years with growth rates of less than 1 percent .
While a large part of these profits originated from large states such as California , New York and Texas , the expiration seems to apply also to the area Washington .
Enterprises in the District , Maryland and Virginia paid together over 10 billion $ at national and local real estate taxes last year , compared with 9.6 billion $ 2012 - a rise in the process of one year by 4,2 percent .
But the apparent recovery at the real estate values is not so effective in Maryland with the increase of national and local tax revenues , since the real estate taxes amount here to scarcely more than one fifth of the tax assessments of enterprises .
Enterprises in Virginia and D.C. pay nearly half of their national and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes .
“ In Maryland the following happens : a large part of the real estate , in particular in the tax area around D.C. , is either in the possession of the government or from Non profit organizations , which do not pay real estate taxes , ” said Douglas Lindholm , Geschäftsführer the center of on State rating .
Maryland is compelling much more on the income taxes to rely for example in order to be able to offer the same services , which offer other states .
The recent recovery with the tax revenues by enterprises can not be added alone to the recovery of the property market
Enterprise incomes seem to likewise recover , so the data .
Enterprises in the region reported over income taxes with state organisations of 2.3 billion $ compared with 2.1 billion in the year 2012 .
Maryland took 1 billion $ in enterprise income taxes , the highest amount of the region .
While the trend goes into the same direction , the local tax burden for enterprises does not rise evenly at all three places .
The rise rate in the District corresponded to the national average , while the rise was clearly higher in Maryland , with 4,3 percent 4.9 percent .
Only Virginia announced a tax revenue below average of 4,1 percent .
Virginia has with 6 percent in all three competences clearly smallest enterprise income taxes ( in all three there is firm of taxation of enterprises sets ) .
The taxation of enterprises set in Maryland lies with 8,25 percent and in the District with relatively high 9.975 percent .
A comparable study of the US-Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that in Virginia smaller national and local corporate taxes are required and altogether a better tax climate prevail than in Maryland .
In the study the District was not examined .
Despite the advantages Virginia stands under pressure by his southern neighbour .
North Carolina adopted laws for the lowering of his taxation of enterprises sets in this year from 6,9 percent to 6 percent , which same sentence as Virginia , and the sentence will sink in the coming year on 5 percent .
If the state reaches further its income goals in the coming year , this law could reduce the enterprise income tax rate of the state until 2017 up to 3 percent .
In the meantime the small firms in the area Washington seem to be better , and they pay from there more national and local taxes , so the recent study .
Corporate taxes , those as personal income taxes by small businessmen to be paid - a transition structure , after which most small businesses are organized - in the District , Maryland and Virginia rose last year by 20 percent to 2.4 billion $ , a clear faster growth rate than the corporate taxes altogether .
The researchers say that the trend and the rise will probably stop country with the corporate taxes generally speaking in this year , with an increase of the general multi-military tax revenues for the state and the local governments by 6,2 percent in the first three quarter 2014 in the comparison to the same period of the previous year .
Nevertheless the area Washington could lag behind , if the output shortage of the Federal Government affects the job market in the region .

China refuses Hong Kong right to government choice , demonstrator swears retaliation
On Sunday the Chinese parliament decided despite the increased calls after democratic reforms against the nomination of candidates for the elections 2017 by the Hongs Konger constituency .
This action probably beacons the long announced protests in of Hong Kong business district , while activists initiated planning and mobilization in addition within a few hours after the announcement .
The decision of the Chinese congress of people makes it possible to the communist leaders in principle to reject all not Peking-faithful candidates .
“ Does not come unexpectedly , but it makes us nevertheless furious , ” said Rechtsexpertin Emily Lau , chairman of the democratic party .
That is not what had promised Peking .
One lay the inhabitants of Hong Kong .
And it is clear that we have to do it with an authoritarian regime .
In its defense of the Chinese decision said left protect , vice-Secretary-General of the standing committee of the national congress of people that the permission of public nominations would be “ chaotic ” with the elections for the Hongs Konger government too .
Since has Peking promised 1997 , when Great Britain returned control of Hong Kong to the Chinese , to let the inhabitants select starting from 2017 the government presidency .
The Chinese guidance presented the decision of Sunday as democratic break-through , because there is the citizen of Hong Kong a direct right to vote , but it makes the decision also clear that the Chinese guidance keeps the expiration firmly by a nomination committee controlled closely of Peking in the hand .
In addition after a new clause only candidates are to become certified “ with love for the country and love for Hong Kong ” .
The decision follows one summer , in which some the largest and audience-most effective protests in Hong Kong for some years took place .
Behind the per-democratic campaign in Hong Kong the movement Occupy cent ral With Love stands and for Peace , whose organizers threatened to bulkhead the financial district if Peking does not permit genuine general right to vote .
On Sunday evening within a few hours after the announcement hundreds of Occupy Central supporters in the rain before government headquarters in Hong Kong had met .
During the demonstration the organizers said that its movement had achieved a new stage of civil disobedience and they planned protest waves in the coming weeks .
They made however no more details to apparently avoid in order problems with the authorities .
In a report of online the organizers communicated that the movement considered “ the occupation of the central district only as last means , an action , which was to take place only if all dialogue opportunities are exhausted and no other choice exists .
It does suffering to us , says to have that today all dialogue opportunities were exhausted and the occupation of the central district will definitely take place .
The authorities in Hong Kong prepared for days for the announcement of Peking , and intensified security measures were valid for police force and barricades inclusively on Sunday before the government building .
The riots are strengthened by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they lose slowly control of their city .
The influx of humans of the mainland strengthens the competition around products and services .
In addition the fear grows that the values of Hong Kong begin to crumble such as democracy and free speech under the increasing pressure of Peking .
Some criticized the demonstrations of the Occupy Central movement , there it the business concern - which vital lines of Hong Kong - endanger .
“ The protests , of which they speak , could cause large economic damage , depending on , like many in it are involved and like for a long time them to persist , ” said Rechtsexpertin Regine Ip , which criticizes the movement for a long time .
We do not want to stir fears up that Hong Kong turns out out of control .
This impression is bad for investments .
The state-controlled mediums of China reported also recently on Demokratieaktivisten in Hong Kong as subversive agents steered of western powers .
In this summer activists organized an unofficial referendum to the choice elections , in which 780,000 humans participated - more than one fifth of the voters in Hong Kong .
In July tens of thousands participated in one of the largest democracy demonstrations in the history of the region .

Already with 14 it was interested after four years high school in the teacher profession .
One year after the Sudeten Germans were expropriated .
Within a half hour the family had to leave their house .
After some months in a camp it went 1946 to Bavaria - in the goods railroad car .
Thus it led to end up judges in the upper-Frankish lowering village .
The teacher formation took place in Bamberg .
In addition Manfred Richter had to run six times per week of ten kilometers to the next station , drive with the course to Bamberg , go there three kilometers straight through the whole city to the school and in the evening back .

it made first and 1954 for 1951 after three years teaching profession candidate the second state examination .
Since Upper Franconia for it did not have a free position for teachers , it applied to Upper Bavaria and came themselves on 1 November 1954 to the school into Kollbach .
The “ Ms room ” was its first “ official residence ” in the school building .
1958 it referred a three-room official residence in the newly built teacher house beside the school .
This house bought Manfred Richter 1980 , after the school in Kollbach had been dissolved 1968 .
By then there were three classes in Kollbach in the school federation Petershausen Kollbach and in Peter living five .
Starting from the school year 1968/69 these were summarized in Peter living in the today 's city hall .
When the school federation Indian village was created , only the primary school remained in the place .
In order to escape a demotion in the smaller school , the rector at that time Georg Sigl changed to Karl field - and Manfred Richter became its successor .
But Peter living grew , and so the children and their teachers could refer the today 's building , which was extended 1997 after judge retirement starting from September 1982 .
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the mayor at that time Ludwig Götz , who let a work area build at community costs additionally and with the extension of 1997 cellar areas , although after the guidelines for school 's buildings eligible for subsidy was not .
“ Mayor Götz was very schoolfriendly ” , remembered judges gratefully .
In his whole career Manfred Richter never forgot the speech contribution of a government representative , who had answered to a paper of a school advice on right and justice : “ One may never forget the love ” . Manfred Richter converted , which he had heard there as young teachers .
“ One must give two different kinds to the children : ” , The today 84-year old says roots and wings .
And it had to experience : “ Does not succeed always ” . Whether he means only his pupils or exactly the same his own six children there , is not completely clear .
In each case was judge doing sometimes unconventionally .
If pupils flogged themselves , they got a punishing work from it not and also not for being kept in after school were condemned .
At the expense of the community judge two pair boxing gloves had let purchase and let the two contractors begin against each other , even if there should be thereby times a violet .
For the well-being of the school judge maintained a good relationship to the mayor at that time Ludwig Götz ( CSU ) as a rector .
This induced the non-party judge after its retirement to stand as a candidate 1996 at least as last on the CSU list for the local council .
But judge was preselected at place six and joined the CSU .

4 hints for better underwater photos and videos
If you liked to make gladly photos or videos under water , there is a selection of devices .
The most inexpensive option is a waterproof POINT and Shoot , as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or a Action Cam like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver edition , which both are to be had for approximately 300 $ .
I took up these photos with a family celebration with several cameras , which are available all at a price of under 350 $ .
Independently of the equipment there are a few rules for the best results .
Control your equipment twice .
Even if you have a waterproof camera , make sure that the battery box and other subjects are closely locked .
Adjust your camera also to the photos or video , which want to take up you .
Some cameras and Camcorder have scene and admission modes , with which the exposure time for the dämmrigen underwater conditions is optimized .
And before you jump inside , check , until into which depth your equipment is functional .
Some cameras are certified only for up to 5 foot , others to 50 or 60 foot .
Look in our purchase leader and the evaluations for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models .
Make for multiple photographs - because many will not fold .
POINT and Shoot cameras do not have an LCD , with which you can compose pictures , Action Cams normally .
Even if you have an LCD , it is difficult to view this under water and the correct framing is a luck thing .
Thus you take many photographs .
If had your camera a row mode , with which a set of photographs also easily changed exposure settings are made , use it .
Remain close of the surface .
The light becomes dramatically worse , the further you depart from the surface .
If you remain possible thus closely at the surface , if it photographs in a pool , a lake or the sea to make .
Thus you can bring also more color into your photos ; the more deeply you go , to the less color you will see .
Approach closely to the objects .
That is also ashore a good advice , but he is all the more important under water because of the bad lighting conditions .
It is completely particularly important , if you work with a Action Cam : These devices often have a firm wide angle lens , which means that you must more closely to your objects near , if these are to fill out the entire picture framework .

At present travelers would have to take the detour over Changsha in that to hunan province , complained left .
Also the administration the guangdong province , whose capital is Guangzhou , hopes for the airline connection .
The vice-governor of the province , Chen Yunxian , placed this desire with its discussion with the Social Democrats into the foreground .
“ That is a very good idea ” , answered shepherd Gümbel - the Chinese vice minister Li Jinjun , an intimate connoisseur of Germany , nodded approving .
Maintained partnership
The affable vice-party chief of Guangzhou hopes that he can visit Frankfurt in the next year to a partnership meeting .
Left Yiwei already was at the Main , but not yet in this function .
He came only in this year into the office , after its predecessor had been carried because of accusations of corruption from the office .
Also the local party chief Wan Qinglian had to go .
The action against the functionaries from Guangzhou is part of a country-wide campaign against the corruption in a party and administration , which are implemented by head of state Xi Jinping with hardness .
New leading politician Li Yiwei had worked before his party career for an American enterprise , which in the Communist Party of China is most unusual .
Before its assumption of office in Guangzhou it was active as a top official in Fujian , where the car maker VOLKSWAGEN establishes a large work .
Frankfurt was received officially more than one dozen of partnerships between cities .
The connection to that 9000 kilometers removed Guangzhou belonged to those , which are from both sides maintained , approximately with a student exchange .
Last year the 25-year old existence of the GermanChinese connection was celebrated .
The South Chinese metropolis at the Perl river is nearly as strongly as whole thereby with their resource Hessen .
In the next year it wants to reach a gross domestic product of 250 billion euros , reported left .

The tradition of the graduation balls in the USA is transferred now to the universities , where Freshmen of appearances with the private airplane are offered .
We are pleased to be able and that the first luxurious travel service of Great Britain for students today offer to react to this demand .
In order to be able to obtain a particularly impressing appearance at the university , the enterprise offers also to transport options such as private airplanes , roll Royce Phantom , Aston Marten or McLaren P1 .
Mr. Stewart also indicated that the service had a safety section .
This service is an ideal alternative for students , who would have chauffeur otherwise their belongings in a dangerously überladenen car by the country .
Together with our new VIF options we look forward to ensure in this year that the students reach the university with a minimum of expenditure and a maximum at luxury .
An employer speaker said that still no new reservations would be present , since the service had been just introduced added however that “ students booked the service in the next weeks ” became .
In addition the enterprise communicated that it expects a market for this offer despite the study fees of 9.000 £ per year .
Students today differ in their expectations and requirements much from the students before 10 , 20 , 30 or 40 years - it is more importantly ever to make a great first impression and with VIF one can do exactly that .
The national student union criticized the service however as taken off .
Megan Dunn , Vizepräsidenten of the NUS for university formation said : “ This offer seems completely separate from the life the majority of the students .
Many students , who begin this month with the study , see themselves to a crisis of the cost of living suspended , since the available financial assistances do not hold in the form of credits and scholarships with the strongly rising bills for the simplest bases of life step , before they can remember at all to spend thousands of pound on something so simple like the arrival in the student hostel .

The protest movement in Pakistan , stated by the opposition politician Imran Khan and the clergyman Tahirul Qadri , continue .
In the capital Islamabad stormed approximately 1000 demonstrators the national television station PTV .
Minister of Information Pervaiz Rashid said , the protesters would have known soldiers however PTV building urge .
The transmitter stopped its enterprise for approximately 40 minutes , sends in the meantime however again .
At the same time approximately 3000 demonstrators tried to arrive at the residence of prime minister Nawaz Sharif .
Remotely from it they supplied a kilometer approximately supplied with sticks and stones collisions with safety forces .
The police used tear gas .
The demonstrators demanded Sharifs resignation , this reject however .
The army of the country reminds meanwhile to a political solution of the conflict to waste “ without time and use without force ” .
After a meeting in headquarters on Sunday evening divided the military with : “ The army remains obligated for its role to ensure the security of the state ” .
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and already more frequently revolted .
The opposition politician Imran Khan accuses Prime Minister Sharif with the parliamentary election in the May of year passed to have cheated .
The protests had on the weekend escalated , after Khan and Qadri had called their supporters to penetrate to Sharifs residence .
Three humans had been killed .

Andrew Lawson was a man of the sort , a whose character changes things , even in a as gigantic organization as NHS .
As an advisory anaesthesia physician he dedicated his career to the task to save to the patients both the death throes of the illness as well as the agonies of the treatment .
Among his patients , then its wife remembers , was a MI6-Mitarbeiter , which had to live with the devastating effects of tortures .
Lawson knew that the diagnoses and diseases are important to the physicians , while the treated ones are busy with somewhat completely different one predominantly : Pain .
One day in the year 2007 it was however that , whose suffering way began .
“ I did not feel , ” wrote he in the May of this year .
I had difficulties to gather up me .
While it fought with the flu-similar symptoms , he noticed that he made impatiently reproaches for his Mrs. Juliet .
“ I want all dearer immediately than later ” , noted he .
When Juliet was , felt for one week on a business trip Lawson unusual-proves completely and without reason concerned .
Was appropriate for something in air .
It asked a colleague to make an x-ray examination of its chest .
Only two weeks ago it in the French alps to the skiing had been .
The result of the x-ray examination was present .
He suffered from mesothelioma , an incurable cancer , which attacks the chest skin , thus the lungs covering skin .
As is the case for most cancer conditions is difficult the exact trigger usually to determine .
While for example some smokers at cancer of the lungs get sick , not all cancer of the lungs-gotten sick were early smoker .
But mesothelioma is different .
In nearly all cases the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fiber building material , which was considered once as “ miracle material ” however in the meantime as deadly was recognized .
For most of us mesothelioma is an illness , which can to be easily ignored as .
Asbestos is finally a product of the past .
The most dangerous type of asbestos was not no more used in Great Britain since the 1960er years , than itself the industry obligated voluntarily not to use this no more .
Also , where it was still used , only humans in certain industries worked directly with the material - plumbers , construction workers , carpenters and throwing workers for example .
As an industrial dangerous material from another time it seems to be still causing concern today hardly .
But this self-satisfaction is inappropriate .
Great Britain , then seems it , deeply felt today the high point of an Mesoltheliom epidemic .
It gives more deaths by mesothelioma here than in every other country in the world .
With altogether 2,500 deaths per year twice as many humans at this illness die as with traffic accidents .
Annual numbers of the mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and prospective future deaths in Great Britain
The reason , why we experience the deadly effects now , although asbestos is illegal for years ( 1999 all asbestos types forbidden ) , is that a mesothelioma develops only after decades .
And the scourge the mesothelioma is not limited on former workers the construction industry .
Asbestos was , and is frequently still , in the houses present , in which we live , which offices , in which we work , the schools , in which we learn and which business , in which we buy .
And from there mesothelioma does not know class barriers , financial borders , professions or age .
The privileged bastions , of the elegant department stores in London up to private schools , are not a shelter .
The parliament building are asbestos-contaminated .
Also in the hospitals , in which we are nevertheless healthy to become to be supposed , already as an output herd of this deadly carcinogenic agent constituted .
Andrew Lawson was not old .
He was also no plumber .
It fell it indeed heavily to introduce itself where he could possibly have come with asbestos into contact .
Then it found it out .
“ It looks in such a way , as if in the tunnels at the Guy 's hospital , where I completed six years long my training , was present a quantity asbestos. ” it wrote .
All - students , nurses , physicians and doormen - use the tunnels .
One asks oneself , how many become my contemporaries at the same illness suffering ?
It could unfortunately at least partly answer this question .
“ Of the four physicians , who were trained at the Guy 's hospital , and who got sick in the last five years at mesothelioma ” , wrote he to 2010 in a letter , “ are I the latter , still live . ”
How will many of us still get sick ?
With Andrew Lawson mesothelioma at the age was diagnosed by 48 years .
When it died on 17 February of this year , he was 55 .
That was an unusually long survival period .
Fifty percent of all mesothelioma-gotten sick die within 8 months after the diagnosis .
The illness ends always mortally .
We can repeat from there only Lawsons question : “ Will still get sick like many of us ? ”
The prominent expert of Great Britain to mesothelioma , professor Julian Peto , assumes that between 1870 and 2050 , if the asbestos epidemic will presumably come into Great Britain to succumbing altogether to the victim it will be pleased to 90,000 of the illness .
Most of it have for the moment still no idea that they will die in such a way .

A short view of the documents of the courts , to which the concerning turn frequently because of demands for payment of damages , shows , how far the scourge of the mesothelioma is already common .
In June this Marks & Spencer added for example , Janice Allen to year negligent-proves asbestos to have suspended .
She worked nine years long for the chain , from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible over the clothe department on two locations - one of it the Flagshipstore in the Oxford Street .
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years as , when it began her activity with M & S .
Now it has two children in the 20s .
“ Before this thing , ” it says , “ I ever of mesothelioma had heard , I not yet times really did not know something about asbestos .
I would have never thought that would concern me times .
There are only few humans , who know much about asbestos .
Fact is that the term asbestos refers not a substance , but a group of six minerals .
The name is due to the word “ Asbestiform ” , a description of the fibrous structure , which makes the material resistant and flexible .
Three of the six were used in construction industry .
Chrysotil , also as white asbestos admits , is today by far most frequently found asbestos in buildings .
It was used for roof slabs , floor panels , Rohrisolationen , storage water heater isolations , even for brake linings in cars .
It is less mortally as other asbestos forms , of the European Union and the WTO as “ large health risk ” with possible resulting in death is however nevertheless viewed .
More dangerous are however the brown asbestos ( Amosit ) and the blue asbestos ( Krokydolith ) .
Great Britain was once the world largest importer of brown asbestos , and experts assume that “ there are clear , however indirect notes for it that this was a principal reason for the singularly high mesothelioma rates . ”
An employee of Marks & Spencer was exposed to London , asbestos in the Flagshipstore in the Oxford Street , Alamy
Janice Allen did not see herself perhaps as a typical mesothelioma victim , but it points the work of Julian Peto to the fact that her history is not under any circumstances unusual .
It submitted a study of the concerning , in which it is represented that “ a substantial portion of the mesotheliomas without well-known suspension was probably caused by work or in the house by asbestos contact in the environment . ”
A majority of these contacts is based to its statement after on the “ normal use and aging ” of our buildings .
It looks in such a way , as if nobody can assume that to be safe .
A report of Goddard consulting , which examined the palace of Westminster , shows , how humans could have been suspended also in the heart of the government , unknowingly the material .
2009 reported Goddard that the service pits and pipings behind the committee areas of the parliament with asbestos were contaminated , whose deadly fibers could be whirled up by somewhat as harmless as “ strong air movements ” .
Members of parliament are frequently accused of to worry about their own interests but it looks in such a way here , as if the opposite would apply .
While the management of the parliamentary one insisted labor service on the fact that the Westminsterpalast a “ clean health certificate ” had received , is it in the meantime undisputed that 1 billion £ effort over several years be brought up must , in order the parliament to recondition , the electricity installations to modernize and the asbestos remove , and that after the general elections 2015 the delegates will meet probably rather in the nearby QE2-Konferenzzentrum as in the green banks in Westminster .
The Goddard report pointed out also that “ the presence was not handled by asbestos according to the respective regulations . ”
Nobody can know whether this Miss management will cost lives .
Everything that one can do now , is waits .
A person , those the contact with asbestos exactly to never determine could is Graham Abbott , a general physician .
Like Andrew Lawson the 50-year old Abbott assumes that it was exposed to the asbestos during its work in hospitals .
“ I worked in a hospital , in which asbestos complaints were decided positively ” , say he , “ however I can it in my case not prove .
It is so difficult to remember all places on which one worked , and the data .
That it is still exactly reminded the day at the beginning of December 2009 , on which he got so a kind fever .
It was 45 , and accomplished straight late in the evening an operation .
Suddenly I had vibration frost .
It came completely suddenly .
I felt terribly .
I believed not to create the trip home any longer .
When physician knew Abbott that the pain was due to the skin to the chest skin , around its lungs .
But like Janice Allen it did not have a reason to assume a mesothelioma .
It did not go one month to work .
Surprised physicians made radiographs of his chest and set Pleurakathether , in order to take and test in the laboratory liquid out of the lungs .
Its complaints remained however without diagnosis .
Its health improved slowly , and it returned to its job .
Occasionally the symptoms returned however , frequently to sporty manipulation and violent breathing .
2011 came a patient Abbotts with similar symptoms in its practice and with mesothelioma were later made a diagnosis .
In addition , now did not connect Abbott this with his own case .
Finally its patient was older some decades and directly with asbestos had worked .
The connection in the case was clear .
In September 2011 Abbotts condition worsened again and its family doctor brought its CT-scans and radiographs to a team of experts .
In December 2011 , accurately two years after Abbott for the first time suffer yourself had felt , became a probe equipped with a camera into the cave between the rib and the chest skin inserted .
I am an optimist .
I continue mostly simply , ” say he .
Honestly said , I had worried not at all so many .
But Rachel , my wife , was anxious .
The result of the Biopsie was present in the week between Christmas and New Year : “ One told me that it was mesothelioma . ”
Graham Abbott : Diagnosis mesothelioma
Suddenly Abbott had dates with Macmillan nurses , of whom one recommended to him to take itself a lawyer .
He understood the extent of the epidemic only now .
“ It turned out that asbestos was very far common , particularly in large public buildings , in which pipes were insulating with asbestos often , ” says it .
Humans , who were exposed to the asbestos in these buildings , get sick now .
And in such a way mesothelioma meets now younger people , who did not work in the typical professions .
The most dangerous pipes with asbestos isolations in hospitals lay underground , therefore patients were probably rather not exposed to the material .
But many employees , who changed in pedestrian tunnels of a building in the other one ( how Andrew Lawson ) or in underground cafeterias ate ( like it Graham Abbott often did ) , came with largest probability into contact with the poisonous substances .
It is shown that over several decades after the war hospitals for the patients were possibly life-saving , but life-threateningly for the treating physicians .
It is also still today removed .
Pupils turned their Bunsen burners off to asbestos mats .
And it does not only concern hospitals .
Asbestos was used due to its marvelous isolating and flame retarding characteristics frequently in offices , business , libraries and town halls .
Also schools .
Actually many humans probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom .
Everywhere in the country , in thousands of chemistry hours , pupils turned off their Bunsen burners to asbestos mats .
To web pages the topic asbestos is now frequently responded in schools .
And meanwhile as innocent articles contained asbestos in our houses as floor panels or shed roofs according to standard .
“ It is an industrial poison that in large parts of our real estate is contained , ” notices Andrew Morgan , the attorney , who represented Andrew Lawson during its process against Guy 's hospital .
In a case the only contact , which occurred to a woman concerned , was the outline of a garden shed into the 1970ern .
Thus you watch out , how you tear your garden shed off .
The effects of the diagnosis , and the knowledge that the illness is incurable , it is immense .
“ It takes a while to process ” says Graham Abbott .
I went again to the work and tried to make further but I noticed that I could not concentrate on that , which I did .
I was two weeks in practice .
Then I knew that I had to go and to care me around me .
Well yes , I will experience no further Christmas .
With the largest difficulty was the Perspektivwechsel of the position of a physician to some patient .
Like countless patients before him it reminds of it , how he overwhelms from all the information was , with whom it by right to come oneself had .
“ It was very heavy to take up all this ” says it .
“ I asked mean physician “ like for a long time have I still ? ”
And one gave me still about 12 months .
I do not remember that I thought , “ well yes , I a further Christmas will experience .
That was it then. `` ''
Mesothelioma is particularly insidious , because it our life support mechanism - which breathing - it is that causes the deadly cancer .
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact .
Asbestos consists of smallest fibers .
If that is whirled up asbestos and the fibers are inhaled , they can itself in the chest skin , which skin around the lungs , to determine .
Asbestos fibers irritate the chest skin and can cell mutations release .
“ The problem develops in such a way for professor Tom Treasure , a heart thorax physician , who changed 2001 to the Guy 's hospital with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibers , ” .
Exactly the hospital , by which Andrew Lawson is assumed a prominent center that it exposed him to the asbestos , now ironically , with the treatment of mesothelioma .
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some different , which were probably likewise during their training in the hospital exposed to the asbestos .
As soon as the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue , Treasure says , “ it by the breath procedure to the edge is pressed , where the skin is .
By nature it is invasive from the outset .
The usual options with other cancer conditions do not work with mesothelioma so well .
The effectiveness of an operation is for example hot disputed .
Some it mean that she is worth an attempt .
Treasure answers that in the negative .
“ One can not cut the chest skin out , ” says he .
They do not come around with the measurer therefore .
Meanwhile the cancer does not address “ on chemotherapy very well , ” the “ effect shows ” , but does not heal .
“ Sometimes there are long-term survivors , ” says Treasure .
But in the end they all die .
Fortunately some patients live actually for a long time , much longer than expected .
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis .
To two and a half year after his own diagnosis Graham Abbott fights still .
After it had contacted mesothelioma , Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson , who had become four years after its diagnosis a one-man support and a consulting office for affected too ones .
To “ cancer center , ” he had an interview hello , with calls merrily .
“ It was very positive , ” says Abbott .
It had received and was still very active its diagnosis 4 years before .
Originally Abbott six chemotherapy cycles had been offered , which would extend four months to last and its life presumably only by one month .
“ I had despaired , ” say he .
I wanted to give up .
Lawson created it however “ the things in a somewhat more positive light appear to let . ”
After the consultation of several physicians decided Abbott , its treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunski to continue Herz-Thorax-Spezialist at the Guy 's .
“ We had an advantage thereby that I did not have to be further-referred , I called simply and got a date , ” admit Graham .
A normal patient would have to receive a transfer and for the approval of the treatment to wait would have .
Money is crucial for mesothelioma-gotten sick , in order to be able to notice the best available therapies .
But if these treatments finally fail inevitably , many concerning of another financial concern stand - over the future of the families , which leave them .
And in such a way they turn to the courts in hope for compensation .
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan von Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP .
“ It is since 1898 well-known that asbestos is extremely dangerous for the health , ” says Morgan .
But which changed into the 1960ern is that one recognized that also a very small load represented a health risk .
And here the negligence of the enterprises began to play a role .
Andrew Lawson and Guy 's hospital settled her case finally , but it was not what calls Morgan a “ full compensation ” , since Lawson could not prove with absolute security that its mesothelioma was to due to an asbestos contact at the Guy 's .
After the investigation to its death a spokesman of the Guy 's confirmed however that “ the asbestos fibers in the basement area concerned were removed into the 1990ern . ”
That was too late for Andrew Lawson .
As asbestos can be removed
It is actual for mesothelioma-gotten sick , which strive for compensation , an enormous problem to assign the deadly asbestos contact of a company or a job - normally decades after the incidents .
Many of their former employers were closed sold or .
Insurance documents can be lost .
And those , which resist requirements , know that the time for it is , but completely surely not with the plaintiffs .
As reaction to it there were clear new legislation , which simpler for mesothelioma-concerned it makes in this year , to sue for a compensation even if their former employers are not to be found any longer .
The law could prove from the insurance industry promoted funds of 350 million £ for all furnished , which were diagnosed after July 2012 , a contact , but nobody to sue be able .
In these cases the plaintiffs receive 80 percent its that could have awarded a court in them - about 120,000 to normal damage suit £ .
About 300 successful requests with the program are expected per year .
Andrew Morgan thinks as so many mesothelioma-concerned that 350 million represented £ to “ very good work ” of the insurance industry .
“ That is a deal of insurers for insurers , ” says it , and suggests the fact that it concerns with this sum a quarter of its , which insurers would have had to pay , if the time had not passed over it and mesothelioma-got sick the enterprises find and it normally sue could .
Also Mike Penning , work at that time and pension Minister , admitted that the law was not perfect “ ” .
But both Penning and Morgan addition that in view of seven victims daily fast acting was necessary .
“ Humans suffer so much and need today assistance , ” said Penning during the second hearing of the mesothelioma law in the December of the past year .
At this time Graham Abbott was for 19 months in the hands of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunski .
After its first consultation long Lazdunski recommended an operation , from which he expects a positive effect contrary to Tom Treasure .
This was accompanied by a radiotherapy and a chemotherapy - a three-fold therapy , with which long Lazdunski can present a survival rate over five years of up to 40 percent .
Abbott felt strengthened .
“ That is naturally the most important with , ” says Abbott .
One sees that again and again with patients .
There is there something that lets you continue .
If you give up , are you very fast more badly .
Graham Abbott underwent in March 2012 of the operation .
At the end of August had it the last six chemotherapy cycles behind itself .
Aftercare scans did not show any signs of the illness .
Then I had a scan in March 2014 .
There were several cancer marks around my chest .
I became straight 50 .
That is not life-threatening .
That is life-terminating .
Again Abbott underwent six chemotherapy cycles .
Now no trace of the tumors is more visible .
But the procedure is physically and psychologically much exerting .
They must think of practical things - of the money , if I am not any more , for example , or my wife to show , how the storage water heater time attitude functions .
If you receive bad news , become negative .
They must look forward .
As a father of Ellie , 16 , and Tamsin , 14 , that is not always easy .
“ For parents that is heavy , ” says it .
It is difficult to know , what one is to say and like much .
When I mean first diagnosis received , said I mean girls that I would have an illness , with which I would become not old .
They reacted completely differently .
Tamsin is very informal and impetuous .
It told her friends and we got soon a great many calls .
Ellie was more reserved .
She did not say much .
Such discussions are something , which all cancer patients must go through .
But for mesothelioma-gotten sick such discussions are from hope did not pull through , not from a trace of hope for surviving .
The illness brings ( as finally also for Stephen Jay Gould ) a furious security .
Like Andrew Morgan says , “ mesothelioma is not life-threatening .

Leonidas asked into the gladiator arena
The gladiators did not only stand ankle-deep in mud with the first Rheinbacher Roman day in the recreational park .
But the attraction of the event was strongly enough , in order to attract yesterday far over 1000 visitors , who defied the rainstorms and autumnal cold weather and let themselves of historical spectacle completely inspire .
There was multicolored round dance of representations , performances , plays , exhibits and information over the time of the Romans and its importance for the Rhineland .
Main attraction of the day was certainly the martial fighter troop of the gladiator school “ Amor Mortis ” , which used each rain break to demonstrate in the arena prepared with soft sand their robust combat art .
Owner of gladiator “ Leonidas ” showed itself as more humorous and expert Präsentator and sent successively its men into the ring to the heroical duel in different gladiator kinds .
First the “ Provocatoren ” was at the row with rectangle sign and short sword as well as splint at the left leg and support of the arm at the right arm .
The “ Essedarii ” followed with chest sign , short sword and throw lance as well as iron gladiator helmet , leg and bracer .
The appearance of the “ Retiarius ” was particularly impressive , which began with throw net , trident and dagger against the “ Secutor ” and pushed after short fight the guy to ground .
There the swords crashed metallically together , the sign rattled and the throw lances flew buzzing by the arena that a fear fears for and become could the health of the gladiators .
But on those the impressive “ Summa Rudis ” had , the muscular arbitrators , a always attentive eye .
“ We wanted to let the Roman everyday life revive again and the culture of the Roman time experiencable to make ” , described Lorenz Euskirchen , chairman of the organizer “ circle of friends Roman channel ” , the intention behind that spectacle .
After two years preparation time became from the recreational park for one day a “ Oppidum Romanum ” , a Roman city , as vice-mayor Claus Wehage in its greeting determined .
Finally the Romans brought not only in our region , but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings , which we admire this very day to war and conquest .
Remnants of it were to be admired also at the Roman day , about “ aquaduct marble ” of the eleven of meters high and 1400 meters are enough for Roman channel bridge , which once with Lüftelberg .
The Frontinus society confronted the water and power supply once and now , and managing director Petra Fricke knew : “ We draw still today benefits from the knowledge from at that time ” .
Confirms also diploma survey engineer Ralph Heiliger of “ engineer team two ” from Rhine brook , which presented measurement instruments of the Romans such as Chorobat , Groma or Dioptra .
The Roman mansion in bright home presented sketches and models of the excavations in the year 1894 as well as bricks from the original Hypokauste , to the warm air heating , which warmed up once the Roman mansion .
Impressing also the foot castings , which by wolf and fox had been left two millenia ago in the kicks from tone , before one burned these .
2011 had excavated the office for ground monument conservation at the regional organization Rhineland the remnants of a Roman mansion in the trade area north in Rhine brook .
One found surrounding walls of an economic building with a Darre for drying grain and to the malting process .
The building belonged probably to a mansion Rustica , a agricultural property , described the archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser .
A set of finds from these excavations presented it in a glass showcase , among them a large plate , several fine glass containers as well as parts of a delicate necklace .
The mansion existed probably from first to the fourth century after Christ , up to the idea of the Teutons in at that time Roman Rhineland , assumes Morscheiser .
With it the children were occupied besides with the Roman windmill play , similarly the today 's mill play , or them wrote as once the Roman pupils their names with metal styluses on wax tablets .
At the conditions of the Roman hot springs Zülpich the children mosaics themselves were allowed to put , at the conditions of the glass museum Rhine brook glass mosaics to tinker and at the conditions the nature center the Eifel nice home a heavy wheat mill from stone serve , in order to grind the flour for a pita bread or muesli .
With faithfully the copied Roman travel car pulled by two cold-blooded animals the visitors drove by the recreational park and went past thereby also at the impressing conditions of the urban High School , which presented the results of their “ Roman project weeks ” here .
With one Roman week of 13. until 21 September also the community being awake mountain will bring itself into the Roman year proclaimed Rhineland far 2014 , which is to remind of the death of emperor Augustus before 2000 years .
Together with the homeland and historical societies as well as the Wachtberger walking club , which becomes partnership club and the layman play group Oberbachem among other things thematic migrations , a lecture , cook evenings as well as guidance for grades offered and to the Roman past of being awake mountain reminds .
For example a Roman legionnaire is presented plants of its work on the drafty being awake mountain to tell , as living thinking marks from the Roman time and a funny lesson in things understanding among nations between a group of Wachtberger “ Teutons ” and tightened Romans is presented .
The Adendorfer primary school dedicates itself in the framework one project week the Roman topic .
With the Roman week are not to be made again more tangible the numerous , frequently however any longer at first sight visible traces of the Romans in being awake mountain .
In the Wachtberger city hall will remind a small presentation of the find of the Berkumer of matron shrine in the year 1879 .

Harburg : Tents for new refugees
At new countries the place are accommodated now refugees in tents .
The center Erstaufnahme for refugees in Harburg bursts from all seams .
Now the authority for domestic affairs let three tents of the red cross set up beside it .
The district politicians were only a short while before informed - they are few enthusiastically .
“ These striking jerk actions stir far reservations of the citizens and give to the district politicians no possibility , constructionally in the human accommodation of refugees of participating ” , say for instance Britta Herrmann , Fraktionsvorsitzende up of the Greens in the Harburger district meeting .
Their party demands that the district administration Harburg places unused houses at present to the accommodation to the order .
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents .
Reasons for the overstocking in the Erstaufnahme are the attack of person seeking helps - and the circumstance that the authorities can not make sufficient places available in ancillary facilities .
Many refugees remain longer from there than the regular three months .

Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobsons 's high-praised new novel over love and the letter “ J ” .
They dissolved , then one could describe it best , her dissolved slowly like a cardboard , one let which be located in the rain .
Occasionally a Mrs. , he told him was too seriously , arduously , intensively , reserved and perhaps somewhat kratzbürstig .
And then the hand shook to it .
It knew Kratzbürstig .
It was prickly , as in hedgehogs , yes .
The last victim of these pricklyness was a straight affair beginning , which had been more promising for an alleviation of the lonely boredom of its life than otherwise , and him perhaps even a certain satisfaction would have brought .
Ailinn Solomons was trembling a tender beauty with untamed hair and a fluttering heart from a village on the north island , which was even still been a long way and rougher than haven Reuben .
She had come with an older company to the south , which regarded Kevern as its aunt , and whom a property in a damp however paradisiacal valley with the appropriate name Paradise Valley had inherited .
Over several years nobody had lived in the house .
The pipes were leaking , in the baths were still spiders , naked snails their traces on all windows had left and believed , that belonged to them everything , and the garden was with weeds to over-grow , which looked like enormous cabbages .
It was both threatening and enticing like the house from a child fairy tale , a garden of full secrets .
Portrait of the author : Howard Jacobson , whose novel “ J ” stands on the Longlist for which one Booker Preis 2014 .
The shortlist is announced in the coming week .
Kevern had sat with Ailinn little hand-holding on the broken beach chairs in the high grass and an unusually warm spring afternoon had enjoyed . Both had latched themselves spirit-absent into the service console , which supplied the country with reassuring music and calming news , when the sight of their crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song one for a long time forgotten black entertainer , to which its father had listened gladly with closed roll shops in the house .
Your feet are too large .
Due to their very own aggressiveness song of this kind no more were not played on the console .
Did not forbid - nothing was so correctly forbidden - simply not played .
It successfully obsolesziert , as the word obsoleszieren .
The general taste created , which decrees and regulations would have never created , and how the people select of the Tellerwäscher to millionaire memoirs , cook books and love novels with books , then they selected the ballads with the music .
In the euphoria of the day Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and to sing about in a roughfunny serenade Ailinns large feet .
Ailinn did not understand that .
“ That was a well-known song of a jazz pianist named Fats Waller , ” explained it and put automatically two fingers to its lips .
That had always done its father , in order to stop the letter J , before he came from his mouth .
It had begun as a play between it and its father , when it was still small .
Its father had played it with his own father , then he had told .
If you begin a word with a J , without putting two fingers over your lips , it costs a penny you .
It had been no very hilarious play already at that time , and it was not still very hilariously .
He knew , that was expected this by him , that was everything .
It had to explain , what jazz was .
Ailinn had not heard ever which .
Jazz was not played , even if it were not directly forbidden .
Improvising was not modern any longer .
It was only place for only one “ if ” in the life .
Humans wanted to be completely safe at the beginning of a melody , where them would end .
Likewise the understanding .
Its unpredictability made humans nervous .
And jazz was in music expressed understanding .
Although it had become 10 years old , without of Sammy Davis Junior to have heard , Kevern knew somewhat about jazz of the half secret collection of old CDs of its father .
But at least it did not have to explain Ailinn that Fats Waller was black .
At its age it could not remember probably to a time , in which pop singers were not black .
Again was valid , no laws or obligations .
A conformal society meant the fact that each element of this society agreed gratefully the principle of the group gift - gratefully as of the fate spared .
Humans with afro Caribbean origin were suitable by temperament and figure for entertainment and sport , therefore and ran they sang .
Humans , who originally came from the Indian subcontinent , were blessed as of nature with electronic talent and were cared for with the task to guarantee that no family without functioning service telephone remained .
Which still from the Polish community was remaining , worried about drains ; which from the Greeks was remaining , plate smashed .
Those from the Gulf States and the Levante , whose grandparents had not left the country fast as WHICH HAPPENINGS WERE , IF IT WERE HAPPENING event from fear of fire stirring to be accused from fear even that the flames would consume them next had opened - Labneh and Shisha whistle restaurants , held themselves consider and became depressive with the inactivity .
Everyone after its abilities .
Since it only ballads heard had , to understand fell it Ailinn heavily , how insulting words , which had sung Kevern it straight , set to music per become could .
Music was expression of love .
“ Are not really insulting those , ” said Kevern .
Except perhaps for humans , whose feet are too large .
My father never insulted someone , but he loved this song .
It talked too much , but the neglected garden gave him the deceitful feeling of security .
Nothing could overcome the sound absorption of the enormous Kohl-like sheets .
Ailinn did not understand yet .
Why would your father have something so dear should ?
He wanted to say that it was a Jux , hesitated however , to put in their present again two fingers to the lips .
It thought anyway already that he was somewhat strange .
“ It appeared to it hilariously , ” said it instead .
It shook disbelievingly its head and blocked Keverns view .
There was nothing else to see around the world , as its ungekämmtes jet-black hair .
There was nothing that he would have wanted to see otherwise .
“ If you it say , ” my her without conviction .
But it does not explain yet why you sing it to me .
It seemed honestly anxious .
Are my feet too large ?
He looked again .
Your feet so directly not .
Perhaps your ankles , a small little…
And you say , you hate me , because my ankles are too thick ?
You hate ?
Naturally I do not hate you .
That is nevertheless only the stupid song .
He could have said “ I loves you ” , but it was still too early .
“ Your thick ankles are exactly the reason , why you please me , ” he tried it instead .
I am there a little perverted .
That did not sound correctly .
It should have been funny .
If it tried to be funny he brought himself often in trouble , because he did not have like its father the reassuring Charm , which one needed , in order cruelty inherent in jokes to bezähmen .
Perhaps father wanted to be to be also cruel .
Perhaps it , Kevern , wanted to be .
Despite its friendly eyes .
Ailinn Solomons became red and rose from its beach chair , upset the console and buried the wine , which they had drunk .
Elder bloom wine , therefore was not drunkenness an apology for it .
In its excitation it seemed to tremble , like palm fronds in the storm .
“ And your thick head is exactly the reason , why I feel perverted to you moved , ” she said…
Except that I am that not at all .
She did suffering , both because of the unnecessary unkindliness of its words as well as the fear , to him who showed up in their eyes , when them revolted themselves against him .
Did it think that he would strike her ?
It had not told it of the life on the cold northern archipelago , where she had grown up , but he did not have doubts that it was essentially like that like here .
The same enormous and ice-cold ocean broke here as there on the bank .
The same confused men , with still thicker skin and more morosely after the WHICH HAPPENING WAS than it their ancestors than smugglers and beach robber had been , pulled from tavern to tavern , always ready , the hand against a woman to raise , those them refused myself or derided .
Thick head ?
Those would have shown it a thick fist , if them did not watch out !
They only smooch - smooching was the most frequently used word for an erotic attraction between men and women , an antidote to the insignificant love ballads from the console - it only smooch and then strike .
After Keverns opinion was an unnecessary refinement , since smooching already represented an act of the force .
Ailinn Solomons gave to go to it through its body an indication .
He rose from the beach chair like an old man .
It felt likewise leaden , but the force of its mourning surprised her .
That was not the end of the world .
They nevertheless hardly knew each other .
It watched it , as it departed - as of a room in the upper stick her companion it thereby watched - a man , weighted by somewhat , which he had caused .
Adam leaves the garden , thought her .
It felt a sudden pain for it and men generally , although some their hands had raised against her .
A man turned away from it , its back bent , ashamedly , defeated , without fighting spirit - why that was a sight , which she seemed to know well , if she could not remember nevertheless only once , at which her something like that the today 's day ago had already seen ?
When it again alone was , Ailinn Solomons looked on its feet .
Some years before straight told occurrences worked Esme Nussbaum , intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year old researcher on behalf of Ofnow , which non-legislative monitoring device for the public tendency , at a short lecture on the continued force on low and middle level in exactly the regions , in which their decrease , if , earliest are had to be expected not abolishment , considering the funds and energy , which had been invested into the extermination of this force .
“ It was done already much , and much , ” wrote it must be still done to appease “ around the innate aggressiveness of a people who led thousand wars and won most of it , in particular in the remote corners and valleys of the country , in which the sweet breath of human friendliness was felt rarely historically seen despite the high-rising steeples between the hedges .
But some characteristics turn out as ineradicable .
The more highly the steeple , then seems it , the smaller the passion , which it wakes further .
The population cries when hearing sentimental ballads , inebriates themselves at stories over overcome difficulties and states to believe firmly in the virtues from marriage and family circle to but nevertheless only the earlier rawness does not keep the rural communities firm just like our urban structures in the hand , but there are also proofs for developing a new and perfidious contentiousness at home , on the job , on the roads and even on the playing fields .
“ You have a unfortunate tendency for exaggeration , ” meant their mentor , when it had read the whole report .
I suggest that you read fewer novels .
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head .
I must also ask : are you atheist ?
“ I believe , which I do not have to say , ” answered to Esme Nussbaum .
Are you lesbian ?
Again Esme referred to its right to privacy and refusal of the statement .
Feminist ?
Again silence .
“ I do not ask that , ” said Luther Rabinowitz finally , “ because I against atheism , Lesbentum or feminism would be .
That is an impartial job here .
We serve an impartial society .
But certain kinds of hypersensitivity , which are actually absolutely acceptable and praise worth , can distort occasionally results , as you presented it .
They have obviously prejudices against the church , and these things , which call you “ perfidiously ” and “ roughly ” , could be naturally interpreted of others just as well than expression of one strength and vitality .
If one continues to harp on on , WHICH HAPPENING IS , IF IT IS HAPPENING , as if it , if it had happened , would have happened yesterday , meant , to take to the country its substantial vitality .
Esme Nussbaum looked around , while Rabinowitz spoke .
Behind its head a LED signature in flamingo-pink repeated the pieces of advice , which Ofnow had longer given to the country in the last quarter century or .
If you smile at their neighbour , esteem their partner , hear you ballads , visit you musical , use you their telephone , speak you , explain you , listen you , agree you , apologize you .
Speak is better as silence , the sung word is better than the written , but nothing is better than love .
“ I understand absolutely , on which you want outside , ” answered Esme Nussbaum with calm voting , when she was safe that its superior had in the end spoken , “ and I said nothing else , that we did not heal yet so effectively , as we fool ourselves .
My concern lies in the fact that we regain us without preliminary warning possibly thereby as we repeat the errors , which ARE in the first place to the WHICH HAPPENING , IF IT IS HAPPENING led .
This time there is however not the others , at which we vent our anger and our distrust .
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with the hands .
In order to suggest thereby a patience of a saint .
“ You go too far , ” said it , “ if you to actions as “ errors ” to designate , which committed our grandparents perhaps or also not .
They go also too far , if you speak of the fact that these would have vented their “ anger ” and it “ distrust ” at “ others ” .
It should not be necessary actually to remind someone in your position of the fact that we with the understanding of the past as with the protection of the present , not of “ us ” and “ others ” to speak .
There was none “ we ” and it gave no “ different ” .
It was a time of the disorder , which is everything that we know .
“ Of that , if we are honest to us , dared ” Esme to throw in , “ no part of the society to state can well to have behaved .
I do not complain anybody on .
Whether it was done badly or well , what happened , is happened .
That was at that time .
In addition nothing more must be said - there are we us united .
And exactly like no debt to be assigned must , then also no debt must be erased , if such a repayment were appropriate and if there were a way to erase it .
But for which the past serves , if we do not learn from it -
The past serves for the fact that we forget it .
If I may say to it something -
Luther Rabinowitz let his pyramid collapse .
“ I will consider , ” said and dismissed its report he her .
On the next day , when she went as used to the work , it was run over by a motorcyclist , who , as passerbies described , had driven brutal rage ” in a kind to “ on the footpath .
There are coincidences .

Smarter ways to saving with university text books
Since the costs of university text books of many students more than 1,000 $ per year are , the nearly secondary term student Matt Schroeder considered himself a smarter savings idea .
It invented a borrowing system for books of students of higher terms and offered a nominal compensation , in order to delay the back sale .
“ My mathematics book costs normally 180 $ , but I received it for 10 $ for one term and a Chick fil A cookie , ” said Schroeder , 19 , the Covenant college in Georgia visited .
For the last term the needed books would have cost , said it to 430 $ it .
It spent 120 $ .
The college line communicated , which students spend annually on the average more than 1,200 $ on text books and study material that there would be different curbing cost expansion options for the students however .
Online shops and creative approaches like the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of the choice for the students .
Renting of text books becomes more popular , and so students can use a book one term long , frequently for clearly a favourable price than with the purchase .
Neebo Inc. , which operates more than 250 university book shops , communicated that renting librettos had doubled itself since 2011 .
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of the books was rented in the college book shops in the past spring semester , said Neebos vice-president Tevor Meyer .
Less than half of all text books according to statement of the trade association national Association OF college store in campus book shops are bought .
Here is the multiplication table for best deal .
Online buy
Some new books cost online only one third of the price , for which they are to be had in the campus book shop .
The ninth edition of “ calculus ” vno Ron Larwon , Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs nearly 290 $ , can however with the specialized text book retailer Chegg .com for 239,99 $ be referred .
Used buy
If the notes other or normal signs of usage anything do not constitute , used books are a good option .
“ Calculus ” is to be had used on Chegg.com for 93,49 $ .
Matt Casaday , 25 , conclusion student at Brigham Young University , says that it spent 42 cents on Amazon.com on a used edition of “ Strategic Media Decisions : Understanding The Business end to OF The Advertising Business . ”
The book was sold again for 48 $ .
University graduate such as Ingrid Bracey , Leiterin of the University OF Massachusetts at the Amherst college Without of embankment recommended students to inquire with her professors whether earlier expenditures were permissible .
Sometimes the updates for the seminar work are not relevant .
In such cases older expenditures can often be acquired for a fraction of the costs of the newest edition .
Except Chegg and Amazon also Half.com of eBay Inc. is a popular alternative for used books .
Rents
Renting text books is a consideration worth , if you treat it to some extent well , remembers , to return it and you the books after conclusion of the course not kept would like .
They can save more than 80 percent of the costs of a again bought book .
A student could rent for example “ calculus ” for the duration terms for approximately 20 $ .
Inform about the regulations of the business with that you rent yourselves , also about the penalty charges , which result if necessary for the letter of notes , underlinings or signs of usage .
Tenant watched out : If you do not return the book , the penalty charges can even exceed the price of a new book .
E-Books
Also E-Books instead of conventional text books are an option .
Sometimes these books are de facto rented , by an electronic license for a certain period of wholesale dealers such as Amazon.com , Chegg as well as Barnes & Noble Inc. one makes available .
With Chegg one can rent “ calculus ” for 6 months for approximately 61 $ .
Bracey says that students in literature courses find frequently the best offers , since many classical authors can be downloaded nowadays free of charge , while scientific and engineer-scientific text books can be very expensive .
In any case look around .
Joe Gault , 29 , which will visit the Pepperdine Law School shortly , recommends the ISBN number for the price regulation with books , since one can be so safe , to find the correct text book .
And before an online order one should check , so Gault whether the book is actually available .
He learned this lesson the hard way .
He bought a book the fact that four weeks delivery time had and paid finally the full price in the college book shop .

Production in the euro zone on a 13-Monats-Tief
The rise with production in the euro zone slowed down in August on the lowest point of the last 13 months , so an exactly observed study also .
The final Markit purchase manager index of the producing trade ( PMI ) fell in August on 50,7 in , after conditions of 51,8 in July .
An information concerning 50 indicates an expansion .
New orders decreased and factories experienced break-downs in a time of rising tensions between the European Union and Russia over Ukraine .
The numbers arrive before the meeting of the European central bank ( EZB ) on Thursday .
The markets expect a clear plan for handling a hesitating recovery of the euro zone as well as for the threatening deflation from the bank with an inflation rate of only 0.3 % .
It adds to speculations that the director/conductor of the EZB , could make Mario Draghi , in the process of this week more further details , whether it considers a quantitative relief for the euro zone , according to that , which was made by Great Britain and the USA during the financial crisis .
“ Although a small growth is better than no growth , is the braking effects of the increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties for the manufacturers become , ” said more clearly Rob Dobson , leading economist with Markit .
Factory PMI for Germany , the largest trade partner of Russia in the European Union , fell on the lowest level in 11 months with 51,4 .
In the meantime France , PMI fell on 46,9 in the second largest economic nation of the block .
France remains a problem child , like also the descent of Italy from a solid expansion to the stagnation .
Referring to it that incentives for growth do not reach in the key industry mechanism Germany as well as into Spain and the Netherlands any longer , are likewise not reassuring , ” said Mr. Dobson .
The decrease of the industry probably stirs the fire up of the analysts , which expect further monetary or fiscal incentives .
A positive message came from the Republic of Ireland , where PMI rose to 57,3 , the highest level since at the end of 1999 .
Howard Archer , Chefwirtschaftsexperte with IHS Global Insight , said : “ The best , which one can say for the purchase manager index of the producing trade in the euro zone from August , is that thereafter the sector grows further . ”
It added : “ Producers in the euro zone find the life at present obviously quite with difficulty , there the current increased geopolitical tensions - particularly regarding Russia and Ukraine - to uncertainties in the further difficult conditions in many countries increase .
These increased uncertainties impaired completely clearly the economy - in particular , and probably lead the confidence of the consumers , and to it that some orders are delayed or even cancellation , in particular large orders .
He said that it becomes “ ever more probable ” that the EZB must finally introduce a kind of the QE , “ although we assumes that this will be limited . ”

Ebola : The epidemic loads of west Africa economy
The Ebola epidemic in west Africa is also a heavy impact for the economy .
Markets are become an orphan - and international enterprises go on distance .
The devastating Ebola epidemic shifts the economy of west Africa a heavy impact .
The harvest rots on the fields , which are mines abandoned and which markets becomes an orphan - the virus added to the region heavily .
Also some international enterprises already go on distance .
“ The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis , but also an economical ” , judges the boss of the African development bank , Donald Kaberuka .
Liberia is hardest concerned
“ It is a total disaster , we loses very much money ” , says Alhaji Bamogo , which sells Monrovia clothes on the second largest market in of Liberia capital .
On the market comes only , who wants to buy food or something for disinfection against Ebola .
Liberia is hardest of the virus met , alone here fell the fever more than 600 humans to the victim .
Recently the health authorities , the illness explained in each angle of the country had penetrated .
Also in Guinea , Sierra Leone and Nigeria the virus spread .
Altogether already more than 1500 humans , thousand further died were infected .
Foreign companies withdraw employees
Everywhere in the resources-rich countries companies suspend their enterprise .
Foreign enterprises like the steel concern Arcelor Mittal withdraw their employees , several international airlines do not approach the regions concerned .
Also the native resellers and farmer react : Only few merchants leave still their places of residence , in order to procure supplies .
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia , which stand under quarantine , among other things the cocoa and coffee beans on the fields , important for the export , rot .
The farmers do not dare it to leave for the harvest it home .
Food becomes limited
“ Humans will less and less travel ” , say Phillipe De Vreyer , Paris expert for the economy of west Africa .
The man for example , normally on the market goes and its vegetable rather at home sold , remains .
The population gets therefore the consequences of the epidemic urgent to directly and feel : Food becomes limited .
On the markets the supply of staple food shrinks such as rice .
An image damage threatens the region strongly dependent on international companies at the same time - with sweeping consequences .
The largest danger is that international companies avoid the area in principle over long time , says Philippe Hugon of the French Think tank iris .
Is crucial , as far and how long the virus will still spread .
With investors the impression can develop , “ that it is dangerous , in Guinea , Sierra Leone and Liberia warns to live and thus also invest ” , Hugon .
The illness loads also the strained national budgets of the states
The illness loads also the national budgets of the states concerned strained anyway .
The rating agency Moody 's fears that their budgets strongly by the high expenditures for the health system and additionally by the worsening economy are strained .
The African development bank already promised to help out the health systems of the countries concerned with 60 million dollar ( 45 million euros ) .
Noticeable the effects also already are in Nigeria , where so far only few cases of Ebola were diagnosed .
The oil-rich region is not so far concerned in the southern Niger delta .
But already many humans from fear of an infection remain elsewhere at home .
Also reservations in hotels decrease clearly .

Kenya registers officials , in order to dam “ spirit employees ”
Kenya began to register all civil servants biometrically in order to delete “ spirit employees ” from the pay rolls of the government .
Employees , who do not register themselves in the next two weeks , were not no more paid , read a report of government .
The government assumes that thousands of people receive salary payments also after their parting from the public service still .
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised 2013 with his assumption of office to fight corruption in the public service .
With an examination at the beginning this year it was stated that at least 1 million $ ( 700,000 £ ) per month were lost at payments for “ spirit employees ” and by other abusive financial practices .
The government assumes that salaries are disbursed further on accounts , after a person died or the public service leaves report Wanyama Chebusiri for the BBC from the capital Nairobi .
All officials must appear now in the next two weeks with identification centers , in order to guarantee that their data are taken up over the biometric registrations , in a government message were communicated .
All , this not without a convincing apology would do by the pay roll were painted , did not continue to read the report .
“ By this action substantially to the rationalization of the public service is contributed , as the actual number of officials is determined and also the pay roll on both government levels is settled - in such a way “ the spirit employees are eliminated ” , ” said Anne Waiguru , the cabinet secretary in the Ministry for decentralization and planning .

When the 2nd table tennis district class was painted some years ago for rationalisation of the league organization , that was a step into the right direction .
Now the German table tennis federation took an additional 3rd Bundesliga in the program .
The consequence : Who did not ascend , descended .
Thus of Goettingen avoided , plays class-highest team torpedo in first league relegation the descent in the coming season however only fifth-rate ones .
Fourth-rate ones remain torpedoes ladies , despite their magnificent victory into the regional league .
The boys and girls of torpedo start in the Lower Saxony league , just as the boys the sports club of the Weende .
The SG Lenglern and the torpedo reserve begins in the new local league , in which national league are no Göttinger club more represented .
With the ladies the TTV Geismar in the local league plays , torpedo second in the national league .
Which by the composition looks like a better district class , now new highest regional division is south .
Here TSV Seulingen , VfB Lödingsen , torpedo III , steps Geismar , installation-hits a corner , Hammenstedt , Bovender SV , Langenholtensen , the FC Weser and that on TTC .
In the district league Dransfeld and the sports club Weende allude , in the district class that TTC II , red Weis , the Bovender SV II and the teams of the TTV Geismar II and III . the highest regional division of the ladies begin at least in desired strength as regional representatives .
Güntersen , that TTC and the TTV Geismar II are here also from the portion .
In the district league accumulate torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen start .
With ever nine crews
The sports club Weende sends its girls into the small district league .
Also the district league relay of the SCW boys - there still torpedo II starts - is not complete .
In a district class Geismar , Tuspo Weende and the Bovender SV go into the season .
In the first season of the again-created region federation the two Göttinger eighth divisions with nine crews each start .
In the west relay red Weis the II , Bovender SV III , leaves oh II , are torpedo IV and V , MTV Grone , Dransfelder sports club II , Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II .
In the east relay play among other things Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen , Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen .
Lady eighth division consists of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen II , Bilshausen , Hemeln , Seulingen II , Tuspo Weende and the SG Rhume .
That is still better than in the circle Easter ode , where there are no more lady teams on area level .
Remarkably that none of the six 2.Kreisklassen reaches desired strength , here the innovative and bustling district executive will have itself to make already thoughts .

On the hopping castle with the castle garden festival some was the matter on Saturday .
The concept of the organizers was correct .
Despite the strong downpour on Saturday evening came roughly 1200 of music fan to the open air celebration in the castle garden .
Occasionally had admit to be stopped .
“ That was annoying ” , said Ron Sem , one of the organizers .
Salzwedel l light and joke .
From two Spanish words Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem formed the name Amula .
Because the open air in the Salzwedeler castle garden is to radiate brightness on the day and in the evening by various shows .
Well , and joke comes anyway from alone .
That showed up already in early Saturday , when the first visitors opened themselves to the open air .
The organizers had promised a celebration for all generations .
And that succeeded to them .
Approximately around the supply conditions on the castle garden meadow Salzwedeler , in addition , guests from the closer and further environment had made themselves it cosy .
They pursued the first live appearances , whipped with the foot in the beat , enjoyed cool beverages - short : Relaxation purely and benefit were announced .
And straight through the generations .
While the one on covers on the extra angekarrten white sand at the beach bar lolled themselves , others at a quarter wine in the Vinothek refreshed themselves , raved the new generation on the hopping castle , which was a large point of attraction for the smaller guests .
In addition , with child make-ups had the voluntary aides in the true sense of the word all hands fully to do , in order to become the crush gentleman and do magic fantasyful creations into the small faces .
The larger ones used the kicker tables or took part in a skateboard workshop , which the Goodfoot crew from Salzwedel aligned .
Until the large rain came .
Shortly before 17.30 o'clock it pelted down on the visitors , above all families looked for that width and dry one .
But did to the attractiveness of the celebration this no abort .
“ Came more humans than expected ” , said Ron Sem , which spoke of a “ success on the whole line ” .
Therefore oppose a repetition of the large party in the coming year nothing .
Although on contents and size of the event must be still worked , Sem in a first balance made clear on Sunday in relation to the voice of the people .
As annoying designated it that in the meantime admit to be stopped had .
Obviously the security company had been booked also too few forces .
The consequence : Some , which had already paid , did not come any longer on the area .
The resonance was very good .

The technicians were not able to create a halfway reasonable sound .
The planned Shisha Lounges could not be developed , because the tents could not be brought because of a flat tyre to Salzwedel .
“ In the next year they will be however thereby ” , so the organizer .
The premiere the Amula open airs from the numbers of visitors had more than succeeded .
And in bad weather .
However the organizers committed some errors , which are still forgiven with the first time , but with the second edition to be eliminated to have .
Also in the social network Facebook must put the organizers in criticism .
“ Sorry , but for twelve euros one expected , expresses themselves simply more ” Melanie Meier on the event side .
“ Took over , means you you unfortunately a little ” Ele Carpenter in same place .
Others do not see the initial problems completely so closely .
I find it very good that some do not only chat stupidly , but also really tries something on the legs to place .
Hat off ! ” , Stephanie Jenß writes to the Amula .
Now one year remains for the organizers time , in order to turn these points of criticism off .

In a statement to the new press it contradicts statements of managing director Peer Medau and certifies to this to pose “ like a general ” .
The style of the university is not that , is called it in the report .
Thus the family Medau was informed already “ in the middle of June verbally about the unjustified demand of the university .
The statement that only in July admits the plans became , are definitely wrongly ” , like that Pötzl .
At the same time it refers to it that it does not concern with the plans “ preliminary definitions or decisions ” , it however “ preferences ” would give .
Also the development of the narrow road to the lock , necessary for the approach road , is feared up less dramatically than of the Medaus .
From nine meters spread road were and are not the speech .
Wide a meter goes than so far ” , explains Pötzl to present conditions by 5.50 meters , that is .
The argument of the Medau operators that their free and schoolown park surfaces are in the future then only used by students of the university , wants not to let Pötzl be valid .
One does not park across at all , because as with other public parking lots meanwhile intelligently can be solved .
Of the adjacents resident think
The creche mountain dwarf , which is on the area and would lead before their doorstep the approach road to the parking deck along , is not to be impaired according to the university president “ ” .
Rather it gives to consider , “ that it not only around the creche goes here , but also around the adjacents resident at the inlet to the Friedrich Streib road and the 800 pupils of the neighbouring six-form high school .
It concerns thus much more than so around particularist interests of the Mr. Medau ” , to Pötzl .
Whether the criticism of the parents adviser of the creche , with which development of the road one “ few nature-left marks the Coburgs to be lost ” is entitled can decide “ the reader ” .
At the beginning of Octobers wants Pötzl as well as the national board of works Bamberg the town councillors about the structural development of the university to 2020 to inform “ and in this context the meaning of the new development address ” .
Peer Medau had informed past week parents of the creche about the plans of the university .
Therefore the approach road for the new parking deck is to lead not as before across the campus and the Friedrich Streib road , but across the Medau mountain .
Thus the narrow road on approximately a kilometer of length would have to be removed two-lane .
According to computer forecasts of the Medaus traffic in the park of lock high rock thereby would increase tenfold .
From approximately 2000 vehicles the speech is daily .
On the part of the city one did not want to express oneself so far to the project .

Perry from Texas says that disparaging Tweet was not authorized
A Tweet of the official user account of the republican governor von Texas , Rick Perry , on Sunday contained a disparaging remark over the democratic district public prosecutor , who is located in the center of a criminal accusation against him because of abuse of the office force .
The Tweet was deleted later and replaced by another by Perrys user account , which denied the previous .
Straight one was dispatched a Tweet from my account , which was not authorized by me .
“ I do not approve of the Tweet and him deleted , ” was called it in the later message .
Employees of Perry answered not immediately to requests after comments .
Although the Tweets proceeded from Perrys official user account , was not clear , who actually served the feed .
In the earlier Tweet a disadvantageous picture the district public prosecutor by Travis County , Rosemary Lehmberg , was drawn , who was at the wheel condemned in April 2013 because of drunkenness .
Perry inserted a veto against a financial transport of its office , when she refused itself withdrawing which to an accusation against Perry - which could be possibly 2016 presidential candidate - before a Grand jury this month in Austin led .
The text of the Tweets reads : “ I do not drive always drunk with the three-way permissible alcohol level… however if I it do , complain I governor Perry on , if he blabs it . ”
I am the most gotten drunk democrat in Texas .
Loam mountain office was not entrusted with the line over the investigation of the Grand jury against Perry .
This was led by Michael McCrum , a special public prosecutor from San Antonio , which was selected by a republican judge .
Perry pleaded for guiltily and did not call the accusation a political trick .
Its high-class team of legal advices requested with case entrusted judges , to reject which accusation and argued that the law , with which against the serve-oldest governor in the history of the State of Texas is proceeded is unverfassungsgemäß diffuse .
Perry stopped 7.5 million $ of national funds to the Public Integrity unit of the state - which resides in Travis County and in cases of national corruption in Texas determined - when loam mountain refused itself withdrawing .
This veto provided for a public complaint on the part of a left-standing Watchdog group .
Perrys official user account is frequently updated - and sometimes famous .
After it had locked at the choice elections in Iowa during its presidency candidacy 2012 as the fifth , Perry dealt with speculations that he will stop , by postete a Tweet of a photo of itself with jogging in the proximity of a lake with the words “ South Carolina , we comes ! ”

“ The sense of achievement was terribly important ” , confirmed Kapitän and Torschütze Steffen Hofmann , who advanced with green Weis at place three .
Schrammel Traumtor brings rapidly on winner route rapidly with the second win of the season the correct reaction to the disappointment against Helsinki showed and goes with a sense of achievement into the international match break .

“ I imagined , I strike whole frustration of Thursday purely and snapped him under the slat ” , meant the 26-year old smiling .
As Schrammel to 13 . Novmember had met 2010 to the last mark in a Bundesliga portion , still was for Ried .
The first championship hit in the rapidly Dress will therefore remain for it in special memory .
“ For me that is somewhat completely special , I am from the rapidly new generation ” , said Schrammel .
Due to the short term basin wound of Mario Pavelic Schrammel of the left moved on the right defensive side and made also there its thing very good .
It has enough experience that he can also mirror-wrongly exercise this position .
He earned the gate , afforded , praised he this year already some Assists ” Barisic .

Because before it quite also the guests could have written down .
“ Thank God we had , noticed today something luck ” also Schrammel , which alluded thereby to gaping achievement and result in the past weeks : “ The results were not correct , but the playful was always good in the comparison to the last year ” .
Barisic found even that one had been better “ in many plays than today ” before - against “ the strongest crew , which played in this season in this stadium ” .
The first Dreipunkter since 26 July proved from there that the crew structure the setbacks is intact to the defiance : “ Today my crew showed that it has a character ” .
For it not less pleasing : “ That we played finally again to zero ” .
Much work during international match break also the circumstance that with Brian Behrendt , Mario Pavelic , Christopher Dibon , Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger several losses are to be deplored , and Srdjan Grahovac , Stefan Stangl as well as Philipp Schobesberger their first eleven debuts gave , make the victory still more valuable .
“ One may not forget that ” , reminded Barisic , which lost players in the past three days with Behrendt and Pavelic , “ those lately was very stable ” .
The international match break must be used from there to add over “ wounds to leaking and in the physical range a little ” , explained Barisic , who has five U21-Auswahlakteure in its rows .
One , which the break probably particularly suits , is a captain Hofmann .
It tears up for the crew , goes over pain over it .
It showed straight ones in this heavy phase that he is for us a very important player ” , stated Barisic .
Hofmann gave Rapids before its replacing to the play in the 68 . Minute not only the structure , but obtained also the second gate .

Hofmann : “ Being allowed not to believe the fact that now everything is good ” “ we has probably also a little luck had but sometime must come the luck also to us back .
Now was it high time ” , said Hofmann .
It reminded certainly to concentrated continuing working : “ One may do that not always black and knows to see .
We did not play in the last weeks so badly , as that was represented .
In addition , we may not believe that everything is good now .
It could not deny the meaning of its role for the team .
It is nevertheless a very young crew , which I can help for the moment much .
Adhere in certain phases nevertheless to me on ” , said Hofmann .
Grödig coach Michael Baur had itself to accuse and its crew little .
It regretted the fast goal against “ from the category charm gate ” , as well as the regular gate of use in the 40 . Minute , which had been denied by arbitrator Kollegger to injustice .
The only reproach , which I can make for the crew am that we were not concrete direction gate in some phases enough .
There we had too few conclusions .
Interior defender Maximilian Karner saw it similarly : “ It began directly badly , then we found however pure and even a gate made .

Thomas Studanski might have slept past night well .
Because in its life the boss of the Oberurseler of brewing house drove yesterday for the first time with the wheel on Feldberg .
For the good purpose .
It can get over the small muscular strain there easily , particularly it the participation in 8th cycling on large Feldberg in favor of the club “ assistance for cancer-ill children ” ( Frankfurt ) also personally a valuable realization brought .
A great thing .
“ I know now that I can do that - great ! ”
Small short break on the way in the applause curve ?
No , if I had stopped , it would be out been…
As many tormented themselves Thomas Studanski , who sits for the CDU in the Oberurseler city council , the 718 participants yesterday in the early rope to mountains and arrived the exhaustion close , but happy on the plateau .
Others it fell more easily to overcome well the eleven kilometers long distance between high Marks and Feldberg .
Norman Dießner for example .
The Green Party politician from the district assembly - red Dress , red Bike - , arising completely in red , made some more at the start on understatement ( “ a lot of professionals , there is arriving the goal ! ” ) proved , then however at the mountain nevertheless as a half professional and went after 45 minutes without difficulty in breathing through the goal .
Also it drove through the distance in a slide , like also Nina Kuhn , press spokeswoman of the city Oberursel , which had made itself common with Frank Grüneisen on the way .
For the two triathletes “ Feldberg cycling ” was not necessarily a sporty challenge : “ Here it concerns Charity , there participates we gladly also - an exit we would today have made ” anyway , so for Kuhn .
On the way they had met Paul Wenzel from upper tire mountain .
The boy ( 12 ) had gone down in the morning after Oberursel , in order to pedal immediately thereafter the height .

It had focused 40 minutes with its 6,5-Kilo-Rennrad .
A crazy event .
For this purpose - there I am gladly thereby ” , meant Andreas Balzke .
The through-trained Mainz says of itself that it is a “ ambitious Rennradler ” .
That it must also be , because it was with the “ Fixie wheel ” on the way , that is also racing cycles , but without circuit…
The fact that it went loosely upward also without wheel proved not only the 20 ramblers , who over the white wall and the fox dance rose up to the summit , but also a jogger , who pulled a motor-car tire with weights at a cord behind itself .
Mountain rescue team physician professor Volker Lischke , who ensured equipped with its team , with Allrad Bully and Quad , for security , said : “ ” I know from Frankfurt , trained for special carriage trail , only that he pulls the carriage stop ” . The man is thus to a certain extent its own carriage dog .

The ramblers first at 9.30 o'clock .
The first cyclists and runner followed at 10 o'clock .

Under the slogan a “ and the participants celebrate cycling on Thursday in bath Vilbel had met and a concert of Van Baker & Band there had seen on again discovered ways between Nidda and Kinzig ” .
On Friday it became serious : The Radler continued to tackle the first stage , the 60 kilometers over Florstadt after bath Salzhausen and after Scots .
In bath Salzhausen became the sportsmen of mayor Hans-Peter Seum , who was along-started in bath Vilbel with the bicycle , and which welcomes chief of the own establishment bath Salzhausen , Petra Schwing-Döring .

Recollection on the very American ideal of the labor laws as human rights
The congressional representatives Keith Ellison and John Lewis brought in a parliamentary bill , in order to establish the organization of trade unions as civil right .
“ As trade unions , die also the middle class jobs die , ” said Ellison , a democrat from Minnesota and deputy chairmen progressive Caucus in the congress .
Therefore I present the employee enabling act proudly together with the civil right icon John Lewis .
This innovative law gives the same legal possibilities to workers with discrimination because of the organization of trade unions as with other forms of discrimination - and stops so anti-into a union stopped forces .
The addition of the national labor law law , in order to create a possibility for a discrimination suspended workers for the organization of a trade union agency to receive in order to complain before a civil court around justice - and around payment of damages or fines - is a meaningful and necessary initiative .
But it is not with security a radical initiative - anyhow not after American standards .
Actually the best way is to understand its that Ellison , Lewis and the further sponsors of its bill suggest , the connection back to a very American idea .
To expand and keep despite the setbacks , the trade unions were exposed to which in the past years - in Wisconsin , Michigan and other states generally speaking country - have Americans once countries in all world encouraged to recognize labor laws .
There was a time , which millions of Americans still remember , when this country called democracy , free speech , freedom of the press and the right of association in a breath .
When after the Second World War Japan occupied the United States , it encouraged general Douglas Mac Arthur and its staff the country to adopt a condition which is to guarantee that the militarized autocracy Hedki Tojos was replaced by democracy .
In full consciousness its that the workers and their trade unions took new Japan a role with the creation , used it a language , which recognized explicitly that “ the rights of the workers to combination and common negotiating are guaranteed and acting . ”
When the United States occupy Germany after the Second World War , Dwight David Eisenhower and its staff the Germans pushed general to write a condition which would ensure that fascism Adolf Hitlers was replaced by a strong democracy .
In acknowledgment of the fact that the workers would have themselves to organize , and their voting in the new nation raise should , the Germans inserted a clause , which stated explicitly : “ The right will improve to create combinations to secure around work and economic conditions and each particular and each profession or trade guaranteed .
Agreements , which limit this right or aim at , it to diminish are zero and futile ; whereupon aiming at measures are illegal .
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt held the presidency over the international human rights commission , by which the universal declaration of human rights was sketched , as it was taken over 1948 of the United Nations as world-wide agreement , inserted Roosevelt and the other authors a warranty that “ everyone has the right , to trade unions for the protection of its interests to form or them step . ”
For generations Americans accept the basic premise that labor laws are human rights .
When this country other countries advised how one could form civilian and democratic societies , Americans explained that the right to the establishment of a trade union - and whereupon that this trade union may participate then in collective negotiations as equivalent partners with enterprises and government agencies - to be protected had .
After these rights came in America under bombardment are it actually much point to lead itself the American ideal again before eyes therefore the working population the right to have must to unite and provide in a free and open society hearing .
As minister said Martin Luther King Jr. before fifty years :
History is a great instructor .
Now all know the fact that the workers ' movement did not limit the strength of the nation but increased it .
By the rise of the standard of living of millions of people work created a market for the industry in wondrous way and raised the entire nation to inconceivable levels of production .
Those , which attack the work , forget these simple truths , but history retains them .
History remembers , and which we should also do .
The formal acknowledgment of the labor laws as human rights - and the extension of the protection of the civil rights as protection against discrimination with the creation of representatives for the employees - is for a long time overdue .
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals , which made America in the past and which promises of democracy redeemed large .

Do the castle clubs pull soon to a strand ?
Last there was again and again discord between the two Wolfratshauser castle clubs .
Now the executive committees think about a possible co-operation .
As model for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser castle the deceased Richard Dimbath , former chairmen of the Wolfratshauser of castle friends stated , the project in the French Guédelon .
Still one year ago no good climate between the castle club and the castle friends Wolfratshausen prevailed .
Expressed differently so far the points of view seemed , how with the history of the Wolfratshauser castle and a possible reconstruction were to be gone around .
Now the both bearings approach one on the other : Already soon discussions are to be led across a joint action .
The club executive committees Torsten Sjöberg ( castle club ) and Herbert Piffl ( castle friends ) on demand of our newspaper confirm that .
“ I called and suggested Mr. Piffl that we could build ourselves up once ” , report Sjöberg .
According to him all members of both clubs could pull in the future to a strand .
So faster visible successes are to be registered .
While the castle friends had the deceased Richard Dimbath to last a reconstruction of the castle at the mountain forest in the eye around that suddenly , the “ development and experiencing bar making ” of the area in foremost place stand for the castle club around Sjöberg .
Herbert Piffl , second chairmen of the castle friends , was pleased according to their own statements about the call very much .
Since Dimbaths death it manages the castle friends .
A new chairman is to be found to in the middle of Septembers in a meeting of the members .
Momentarily the club counts 74-year old approximately 40 members according to .
“ After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath we let the club activities from respect rest first ” . This “ thinking phase ” was necessary , in order to consider “ , like it to continue could ” .
According to Piffl the new chairman is to then go into the discussion with the castle club .
By then the castle friends could make themselves also a current painting conveying a special atmosphere within their grouping .
There is , says a candidate for the presidency momentarily not yet Piffl .
“ However I am confident that someone will be ” . He does not want to stand as a candidate , because he has his domicile in bath Tölz .
The new chairman should be a Wolfratshauser .
The Tölzer wants to cooperate in the project “ however very gladly further ” .
The different points of view in things reconstruction will probably remain existing in the eyes Piffls in next time .
It appreciates Dimbath as “ missionary ” , which always believed in the reconstruction of the castle .
Two similar , already far progressed projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not a castle in the air .
By a high participation of the population as well as by voluntary aides from all over the world they are a tourist magnet .
Piffl : “ Also I was at the beginning sceptical .
But in the course of the time I am more and more arrived at the conviction that it is meaningful , the project to advance ” . A “ unique selling proposition ” can be created for the Flößerstadt .
Here it gives nothing else .
Besides the project would be eligible for financing by European Union-subsidies , visitor tickets and potential sponsors , believes Piffl .
“ I do not want to throw the idea of the reconstruction personally therefore simply over board ” . He hope that perhaps the castle club in this point moves something .
Their goal of documenting history first “ is important and good ” .
Afterwards one would know further marriages .

Feminists criticize race question and police behavior after Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed earlier this month by a police officer in Ferguson , Mo .
The participants lifted their hands into air and sang , “ hands highly , do not shoot , ” during them before the funeral waited .
After two-week protests in Ferguson , Mo , because of shooting the unarmed teenager Michael Brown noticed the Bloggerin Miriam Zoila Perez a change in the online discussions of white feminists .
After their experience white feminist commentators set the sex before the race , if it concerns to address reproduction right and income inequalities .
While the tensions in the middle west rose however and generally speaking country it received attention Perez saw that the answers of white women turned to 100 % around the race .
In the comparison with the answers of black women shortly after the shots from 9 August the personal essays with titles did not only come like “ thoughts on Ferguson of a white woman ” and “ feminism turn around the suppression of women ” relatively late .
But for Perez an important change meant .
“ I do not believe that one finds many humans , who speak privileges in so high-class kind about Weis its and in feminism ” said her .
Humans felt pushed to express something to the incidents .
It is characteristic of the crisis , in which we are and because the situation is so ethnisiert in Ferguson that they must express .
For English professor Koritha Mitchell of Ohio State University brought Ferguson of problems to the light , black Americans are exposed to which each day , who however not when “ women 's issues ” are regarded in the cultural area .
“ I can something hilarious ones on Facebook over me and mean partners publish and get 150 Likes from all sides , ” said Mitchell .
If I post somewhat over it how colored ones are located in their own country under siege , the silence is deafening .
“ As it can be safe for women to speak publicly about a relationship but not over security in the public area ? ” she asked .
For black women such as Mitchell , which studied race , sex and sexuality in the history of the USA , there is no dichotomy between race and sex problems .
For it black women did not have the luxury separate the topics cleanly ; they live each day in the combined reality .
While white women connect now the topics race and sex in the feminist mainstream circles , Angela Hattery , Professorin for women and sex research says at George Mason University that its predecessors did the opposite .
“ Between 1865 and 1890 at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the reason were nearly always the rape of a white woman , ” said Hattery .
White women had to be involved in history , in order to justify the lynching murder .
For Hattery splitting came between white and black women at the point , at that white fighters for the women 's suffrage such as Susan B. Anthony the country in the late years the 19 . Century it analyzed and stated that the fight for the right to vote could be successful only for in each case a group : Women or black ones .
“ You made the decision to use itself for the women 's suffrage and which right to vote for black ones should come later , ” said Hattery .
If one remembers such things , it becomes conscious one with power why colored women white women not to trust .
We did not make our job good .
We helped never black women to protect their husbands and sons .
Also after women received 1920 the right to vote , it took still another one decade , until white women organized themselves against lynching into the Association OF Southern Woman for the Prevention OF Lynching .
The group developed nearly 40 years after the original request for assistance on the part of black women , says Mitchell .
For Mitchell the flood of white feminist reactions to the questions - police behavior , racial discrimination - , raised by Ferguson , is a mirror of the time , in which white feminists “ catching ” played with the problems , with which black women sat down for generations apart .
“ Would n't it be great , if the Aktivistinnen , which have such traditional feminist platforms the right to education of a child as seriously would take as it with the right to conception control do ? ” Mitchell asked .
Feminists of the second generation , which develops its career on the fight for reproduction rights and the entrance to conception-preventing means , try to understand now , what that means .
The well-known white feminist activists Gloria Steinem two week to shooting of Michael Brown on Facebook and published a trenchant article of Rebecca Carroll , Kolumnistin of the Guardian went , in which she requires more protests from white Americans to the topic racism .
“ I hope that women , who have another , but parallel reason for it the body an inherent danger to understand - and opinions to the race , which are in public surveys clearly different - the changes would start become , ” wrote Steinem .
Although Steinem stands for a feminism rather intersektionalen , in which race is addressed just like sex topics , is nevertheless astonished some from their comments to the race topic in America .
Christina Sommers , Forscherin at the American Enterprise Institute and authoress of “ Who Stole Feminism ? ” The People that young men are far more vulnerable in the United States , in particular young colored men , “ than their sisters , said ” however of stone Ems remarks to Ferguson stands contrary to its earlier criticism opposite She .
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women , but nearly nothing for boys .
But when the white house presented recently a small program , My Brother 's keeper , in order to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men , it gave annoying reactions of many feminists , under it to Gloria Steinem .
The relationship of the police to the black Community is not the only problem that into the foreground of mainstream feminism pushes itself .
After the US-border police took up nearly 63,000 unaccompanied persons under age at the southwest border of the country in this year , also the topic of the immigration reform steps the surface - this time as a women 's issue .
Andrea Mercado , CO-chairman von We Belong Together , an organization , which mobilizes women for the immigration reform , said that for a new view of the topic as a substantial women 's issue she had to only publish stories of the immigrant women .
“ These speak for itself , ” said Mercado .
If the large majority of the work visas goes to male immigrants , are the women , who accompany her , in a position , in which they are susceptible to domestic violence and exploitation .
“ These stories find a response in the women 's organizations , ” told them .

Berkeley explains housing market again for “ normally ”
One of the most prominent building contractors Londons pointed out that the housing market was “ returned ” in the southeast of England again to normal level .
Homes of one 's own in the capital were hot in demand and the subject of enormous price rises , which induced the bank of England due to the wide-spread fear of a credit blister to set in June upper limits for mortgage credits .
Tony Pidgley , Gründer and Vorstandsvorsitzender of the high-class building contractor Berkeley said on Monday : “ Since beginning of the current financial year the market returned normal transaction levels since the highest level 2013 ” and added that this offers a “ stable action environment ” .

The average selling prices with Berkeleys private , inexpensive and student offers rose around approximately a fifth in passed the year and were appropriate for at the end of April around the 423,000 £ .
A stronger pound made real estate property in London less attractive however in the last months for foreign buyers - some from them also by the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric around a possible “ mansion tax ” before the general elections in coming May were deterred .
London real estate agent Foxtons warned in past week that the mortgage market report for April , in which sharper granting of credit regulations were presented , in which second half year even to smaller market growth both with the real estate sale and with the prices would lead .
New data of the bank of England of Monday show a decrease during the mortgage grant in July , which points likewise to the fact that the property market cools down .
Hamptions international , another real estate agency , corrected its forecast for the rise of the real estate prices in London for 2015 downward on 3 percent , for the basis one already now slacking off house price consciousness .
The transaction volume in the most expensive areas of London such as Chelsea , May-fair and Kensington decreased meanwhile year by year around a quarter , so the broker WA Ellis .
The desire for a home of one 's own is nevertheless in the capital for Berkeley a benediction , since the due amounts for future sales amount to more than 2.2 billion £ .
Mr. Pidgley added : “ The demand for the correct , well planned product at the best locations remained stable and as result also the future sales remained stable . ”
In June the enterprise reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes of one 's own in the year to at the end of April - nearly a third to more than to the highest level 2007 before the crisis .

Perhaps with Rona Fairhead the BBC found the great director , whom it needs .
It meets with a proud fame-drags from the bank world , the medium management and the internal circle of the Tory party .
And it has own front experience .
Their career began CO with the world-wide management consulting firm Bain and. , on which it changed to Morgan Stanley , Bombadier , ICI and the media world of Pearsons .
It was seven years long chairmen of the board of Financial Times and withdrew , when the highest post of the mother enterprise Pearsons went to a younger male colleague .
Their compensation amounted to allegedly nearly 1 million £ .
Also their political ranking is solid .
It was recommended David Cameron of Lord Browne , to the former chairman of BP , than this looked for more private-economical knowledge in Whitehall : it became the advisor of the cabinet .
Their husband is a former Tory Ratsmitglied .
Already in May I described the task of the chairman with a poisoned cup .
The BBC does not only stand as enormous and complex unit in the heart of the public life , but there is also an internal paradox in its structure .
The confidence acts in two directions : inward on the first guard of the own management hierarchy in the BBC , in addition , outward as voice of public concern and unrest , if the things run wrongly .
That provides for a nearly untenable duopoly , which requires for a complete comprehensive reform .
But which would risk again arriving chairmen it to begin to hit everything and take an institution apart , which is as complex as a Chinese dynasty , while he perhaps brings himself thereby around his job .
It is a difficult task .
And as that would be not already enough , is interested also still many to see the BBC reduced - power , money and status overhaul .
While the competition moves more near and old , comfortable collateral threatens new technologies , the lining up negotiation of the royalties for the BBC is connected with special dangers .
For the modest sum of 145,50 £ per year the British public buys itself into the surely largest media company of the world .
The BBC tell a good story : she says that she reaches 96 percent of all households and to everyone of it only 40 pence per day costs .
And apparently the BBC rises again upward on the popularity scale : They support 53 percent today , compared with 31 percent before 10 years .
The seeing and use habits for the BBC to have changes : I get nowadays news headlines on my mobile phone and see missed programs later on my more iPlayer .
But it remains a very much loved and considerable institution .
It needs a considerable chairman - I hope , her him found .

Amazon buys Twitch for 1.04 billion $
AMAZON confirmed just now , what had reported information on Monday mornings : The online retailer - and video producer , and a variety other things - buys the Videostreamingdienst Twitch for 1.04 billion $ ( 970 million US- $ ) .
The announcement comes surprisingly , not because nobody had expected an assumption of Twitch , but because it was assumed far away that YouTube would acquire the enterprise .
Three months ago it looked in such a way , as if the sale of Twitch was to the video service of Google for a cool billion done deal , and co-operation appeared also naturally .
Twitch , which was only created before three years as Justin.tv , was started as general Streamingdienst - a live version of YouTube .
Instead it became fast a platform for players , who published their bravura pieces in plays wanted , a “ YouTube for live plays ” , such an insider .
The Twitch interface .
And “ let 's play ” , a video category , in which know-it-alls give a painting of secret science theatre ( usually older ) to the plays , are on YouTube already much likes .
It is just like that YouTube is often called , if one wants to describe Twitch therefore became the message that YouTube Twitch wanted to buy , something bored taken up , a text book example of an established technology enterprise , which buys up a potential competitor .
It is a mystery , why that did not come deal with YouTube , since the enterprise was ready according to reports , just as much to pay as Amazon .
Everything that we know for the moment about it , is this statement of Emmet Shear , Präsident von Twitch : “ We have ourselves for Amazon decided , because they believe in our Community , it divide our values and long-term visions and them want us to help to arrive faster there . ”
A further secret is honestly said , unbelievable success by Twitch .
For snobs like me , which explain that they drive dear sport as thereby to watch , are it heavily to understand the attraction which assumes that , others when playing to watch instead of even the control console into the hand to take .
It is a thing to look a friend at 3 o'clock in the morning over the shoulder while it creeps by resident Evil , and somewhat completely different one to watch a crank how it is shot 20 times successively in call OF Duty into the head .
All these plays could view you now straight .
Another problem lies in it that many of the popular plays are today ego plays , therefore can watching without own control of the view perspective a correctly good recipe for headache be .
I admit that the high-speed runs , into which of Roger Bannisters 's our electronics age whole plays in record time complete are entertaining .
But as long as play or humor-virtuoso is not thereby , its Twitch channel is probably not so much interesting .
But which sceptics know like I already of it ?
Twitch is called of 55 million different visitor per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet peak traffic .
And how exactly does Amazon from it want to make money ?
It is heavy to imagine that Twitch is integrated so elegantly in Amazon Instant video , as YouTube Twitch could have swallowed simply .
But Twitch has something that would have each enterprise gladly : Thousands of young men , who are wooed as advertising customers .
Like the chairman Shear , said von Twitch , Amazon and Twitch “ did not believe both in the future of the Gaming , ” and the medium shows signs of a contraction , not yet times - sip - as spectator haven .

Matthies means : High time to large interlacing
In view of the galloping technical progress , which threatens to transform our comfortable home into high-tech control centres , our columnist Bernd Matthies with electronic accessories extremely trusted comforts itself .
While I write that here , falls my view of the coiled cable , which connects the listener with the telephone , and I think : Boah , how retro is ?
But behind it a consideration puts : If the cable were not , in no time all listeners would fly around abandoned in the house , and that would still importantly be more retro .
Anyway is valid on the ekeltronischen ( ekeltronischen ?
No , typing errors : electronic ) sector the rule that the world first is today the electrical scrap iron from tomorrow , bought - becomes outdated .
And who has for example still today another tube television in the living room , it says with the fact only that he rejects television in principle .
Why these considerations ?
Because the crushes of the Ifa at the radio tower this week again our absolute incompetence leads us in questions of electronics before eyes .
The layman , who controlled early washing machine and CD player blindly , does not even understand today the purpose of the devices , which are spread with incomprehensibly vain expert speech before it : “ Connected Home , Wearables , Health Care and urban Technologies ” promises us the press office .
Yes , it goes still ?
About what is one to talk with people , which spread obviously voluntarily such quark ?
In the reason it concerns yes for approximately 20 years above all that we are to interlace kindly our house .
So that orders itself additionally yogurt , so that the fire alarm communicates us on vacation on the Maldives that it burns in the work room degree .
And would n't it be marvelous , if we from the office the air conditioning system on our imminent arrival… ?
Yes , however an air conditioning system presupposes .
But a dream completely certainly shortly true : We lift our wrist-watch , say it according to “ sucking ! ” - and at home the dust suction robot drives off .
Err .
Everything runs out on nothing smaller than a revolution : “ The borders between whiter and brown goods blur ” , murmur an industry insider , one can the washing machine with a headphone connect , the steam oven send the weather forecast and the data glasses show , how long the pizza in the baking-oven still needs , which uses however nothing , because we are located in the back-up .
From daily practice we know in addition : If newfangled equipment is really urgently used times , is guarantees the accumulator empty .
Which a further reason for it is that the coiled cable at the telephone will survive also the next radios and television exhibitions .

Judge stops temporarily law that to the locking could force all abortion hospitals in Louisiana
A US-Federal High Court Judge stopped the conversion of a law to Louisiana on Sunday provisionally , of whom lawyers said that it would have probably led to the locking of all five abortion hospitals of the state .
This measure , which was raised from Bobby Jindal , governor from Louisiana , in June to the law and on 1 September to go in effect was , would force physicians , who would drive through abortions , to it , to acquire a patient admission right with a hospital within a radius of 30 miles around their practice .
The decision of the judge means however that the physicians would drive through provisionally further legally abortions can , while they request such a right .
“ The plaintiffs can continue working law-conformal , while they strive for the acquisition of these rights , ” wrote Federal High Court Judges John deGravelles in its judgement .
Within one month a hearing for the judge is set , in order to cause for the law a more permanent decision .
Abortion proponents welcomed the decision , which youngest in a set of judgements said against similar measures and that physicians would win so more time , in order to attain ill .
“ The today 's decision means that the women in Louisiana escape a perfidious law , which wants to take their health and their rights to them ” said Nancy Northup , Präsidentin and chairman of the center for reproduction rights , which had complained in the name of three of the five hospitals of the state , in order to stop the law .
It was not directly clear whether the judgement extended also to the physicians from the two hospitals , which had not followed the complaint and had not likewise requested briefing rights .
Louisiana is one of 11 states , which issued similar laws , whereby courts explained recently such measures in Alabama and Mississippi for not constitutional .
Key places of a law in Texas , which would have forced most of the hospitals remained in the state to the locking , were stopped by a Federal High Court Judge on Friday .
Abortion proponents and the American college OF Ostretricians and Gynecologists as well as American Medical Association say agreeing that briefing rights require unnecessary restrictions of physicians .
Abortion opponents hold out that the measures serve the protection of the health of the women , although some also the effects of a locking of hospitals welcomed .
Only one physician , who accomplishes abortions in Louisiana 's , had patient A INSTRUCTION RIGHTs , communicated the center for reproduction rights .
If all remaining physicians in the state are forced to accomplish no more abortions this physician became from fear around its security the operation any longer would not drive through , said the group .
With their argumentation against the judgement representatives of the state said Louisiana that they would not punish physicians because of the execution of abortions , while their requests for patient instruction rights would be still pending .

The hell decade of the survivors of Beslan : Ten years passed since the dreadful siege of the school , like the children involved in it still today suffer .
Before ten years over 1.000 humans of Chechnian militias in a school in Beslan in south Russia as hostages were taken .
More as 330 humans , more than half of it children , were killed in three-day-long martyrdom that the world shocked .
We returned to Beslan , in order to find some the victims , that had escaped death with the atrocity in the classroom .
Exactly among them 186 children , the heroical survivors warned one decade after the terrible siege of the school of Beslan , with which 334 humans died , past night before a new Apocalypse in Ukraine .
As fanatical Islamist terrorists children and parents on 1 September 2004 , which beginning of a new school year , imprisoned took and killed , seemed like the worst of the bad one .
The tragedy united west and east in abhorrence , and transformed then surprisingly into action and hope for the future in the middle in the worst misery .
Ten years later we returned to Beslan , in order to find some the victims , that had escaped death with the atrocity in the classroom .
We found surprising young people , who overcame resistances , although the memory of this hell of terror will always pursue them .
Their largest hope ?
That the war , which afflicts Ukraine now - and in that children like them die - now an end finds .
The girl , who was photographed with the attempt to back-climb into the shot-up school sports hall
It was photographed by the Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakow and famous , when her only in its underwear tried to back-climb into the shot-up school sports hall after a mine had exploded .
Completely confused Aida looked for Larissa for its mother , now 40 years old .
Both were considered dead , but them survived .
“ A woman told me , I was to run around my life , but I could not , ” said Aida at that time .
My legs were bathed in blood .
I rose and climbed in , in order to look for my mother .
A soldier brought it in security .
After a set of operations it held itself for completely healed , said however yesterday : “ Three months ago the pain returned .
I am afraid that I must be operated again .
Some garnet fragments are still in my knee .
Their goal is it now to become tooth lady doctor in order to help humans , as was helped to her by physicians .
“ This tragedy changed my life , but it did not break me , says ” it pugnaciously .
“ That happened to me , and which one can not change .
Once in the year I always go into the sports hall , in order to remind me of , which remained there .
My friends and I try not to talk on other days about it .
The pain is too large .
My best friend and future school fellow Dzera Gapoeva were killed there .
We played together , when we were small , and dreamed to go together to the school .
“ I do not want to marry , until I terminate my study and begins my career .
Of a family I think later .
She says that the siege will remain always a part by it , although the memory becomes somewhat weaker each year .
I am glad that many humans in the world remember still our frights and we are so gratefully for the assistance , whom we received ago from humans in Great Britain and everywhere .
If I see online the photo of me , how I back-climb into the school , I that many humans see it for the first time , think for understanding and to it contribute our disaster that something like that does not happen again .
The boy , who fled by hail of bullets , in the opinion , its mother is dead
It was its first school day ( Russians go with 7 years into the school ) and survived the three-day-long siege in the arms of its mother Tamara .
As a seven-year-old he said : “ Mummy told me , I am to lie down , if there were an explosion , and its hand hold . ”
After an explosion thought it , it would die .
She told him : “ Run . ”
Full fear , it , fled he can be dead and saw on the way a crying infant , seized it at hand and fled by a hail of bullets .
His father Vladimir , who closed its son outside into the arms , said : “ Damir told me that its mother had died .
He said : “ I could not save it . ”
In reality Tamara was tripped after outside and with leg injuries in the hospital , for their part in the acceptance that its son had died .
After its reunification she said : “ I cried for joy .
I could not believe it .
He ran and embraced themselves .
Damir was flown later to London ( of the newspaper news OF the World dissolved in the meantime ) , in order to receive from the Prime Minister at that time Tony Blair and his Mrs. Cherie the title of a Barnardo 's Children 's champion .
“ This horror pursues you each day , but I wished , I could stop with reminding , ” said he yesterday .
But I can say that it becomes pale in my memory .
I know still that I threw thereafter all my toy pistols away directly .
But I can not play computer games with firing scenes and that am for me a problem now .
“ I do not have a fear to decrease into the sports hall but I do not think about me .
I remember these children , with whom I played in the yard , and who did not create it after outside .
We never say that they were killed or are dead .
We say that they remained in the sports hall .
I remember very well my travel to London , particularly the toys shop , where I could select myself everything , which I wanted , and which trip in an open above car .
But now it has fear around place like Ukraine , where wars cause the kind of accident , which it and its friends suffered .
This horror pursues you each day , but I wished , I could stop to remind me of it .
“ It does in such a way suffering to me around all those , which suffer from the atrocities , ” said Damir , which worked past week as a volunteer in a monastery .
I want to help so gladly .
I want to go one day to the police and hope that they take me next year at the training academy .
Its mother Tamara , 48 , said : “ 37 children from our neighbourhood were killed , can imagine you that ?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege , it gave simply no children , who could call and run around , and this silence persisted many months .
It remembers lively its travel to London with Damir .
Humans in London cried , when I tell our story .
I understood at that time , how humans on the other side of the world can understand our feelings , and shows their support .
It was grateful to Cherie Blair and its foundation for the price and the possibility of traveling in the autumn 2004 to London .
I wished , I could Cherie call and to her simply say that 10 years passed , but I the meeting me it and their man in London to still remember , and how the Damir helped and me .
I remember still , how Damir wanted to eat gladly borshch and they called all local Russian restaurants .
I remember , how he played with waiters in a restaurant . Damir shot with its water pistol at it and it ran away and played with it .
And that was only one month after the horror .
I was surprised that the British divided so readily our pain and supported us .
She said : “ I always think that this world did not become better in these 10 years .
In Ukraine the war continues now , and each day die humans , and I believe the fact that many children were killed and still is killed .
Those are exactly such children like ours .
I think that for many the war is a part of the news , which hears it , if they are busy with something different one bored or .
I know simply , what these humans feel , the whole horror .
And I can not stop with feeling .
Nothing changed , humans wants still mutually to kill itself and that is so sad .
Damir became large and is a very gentle and calm boy , it is aggressive or furious not at all .
It does not look for example for revenge , it is not overwhelmed from the past atrocities .
I know that he does not remember gladly , but he has six close friends out of the class and her to go occasionally into the sports hall and ignite there candles .
When it was smaller , he suffered from it - I remember , as he on the sofa put sometimes , the face turned away from us , for hours .
Not sleeping , its eyes were open .
I remember also still , how he threw all his weapons and other military toys away . Damir is now 17 , more largely than I , good-looking , intelligent and healthy .
I can hardly believe that I unite hours was long so safe that it is dead and I would never see him again .
When I came myself to the explosion recovered and on the legs , I looked around , and saw hell around me , with parts of the body lying about everywhere .
I was absolutely sure that my small boy in this hell could not possibly have survived .
“ I remember that I shouted him , “ Damir , run , run away ” , but I was also so sure that he had not heard me .
But it heard it and ran away it .
And in such a way the life , differently than many different , continues for us .
Georgij Ilyin , 17
The boy , whose terrible picture became after the siege the symbol of the atrocities from Beslan
Comfort : The Beslan survivor Georgij Lyin with its mother Fatima after the siege 2004 , on the right of a picture of Georgij today
Its blutüberströmtes face was drawn of fear , when it ran around its life , while Chechnian terrorists shot his school fellows down .
Its picture was one of the most shocking symbols for the barbarism of Beslan .
Its mother Fatima , 54 , a lady doctor , had set him off for his first school day , before she rushed loosely , in order to bring her older son Vladimir to the university .
“ I left the yard about two minutes , before the terrorists him stormed , and so remained my small boy there for three terrible days alone , ” remember her .
Not all alone , there was a whole family of relatives of us , but they were killed all .
Only my Georgij created it to survive .
The more near this date moves , the more heavily is it to remember and of it talk .
There is not one day , on which we do not remember this tragedy .
We do not think that it for a long time ago is , I mean , some scenes would have happened from these days yesterday pursue me all the time .
Nobody is forgotten ever , promises I to you .
Urgently : The picture of Georgij ( left ) was one the most shocking attack and as Statue ( right ) was perpetuated .
I remember that Georgij wanted to go on this day so gladly to the school . He said , he wanted to embrace its teacher .
I knew only that he alive was , when I saw him on TV .
And now there is even this Statue of the crying Georgij in San Marino .
Georgij does not see the picture gladly , and it is at home in the bookshelf hidden with us .
I understand that , but I mean also that humans in all world feel our pain owing to this picture .
Georgij says today : “ It is important , which can never happen something like that again .
“ I doubt that we ever experience the truth .
Humans examine such tragedies again and again and never experience the truth .
And now they examine the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine .
Are we ever experienced , what caused it ?
This world becomes something terrible one .
“ I can not understand , how that is possible , because if you ask humans , nobody wants a war , thus as happens that ?
Ten years are not nothing at all with such pain .
We need dozens of years , in order to forget it a small little .
It attacked my health and feels I it still .
About three or four years long I had a few nightmares because of the siege , but then it became better .
I went later in the year 2004 again to the school and had each day fear .
I thought of my friends and school fellows , who had been killed .
Therefore I always go into the sports hall , if 1 September more near moves .
I want to mean to mean old childhood friends tribute to tribute .
It is heavy for me to go into the sports hall but I must do it .
I do not feel as a victim , this history am now a part of my past .
I will not forget it , but I do not pity myself .
My life continues .
I concluded and visit this year the school a medical university in Wladikawkaz .
I will become a heart surgeon .
My first choice was training in the army .
I wanted to become a soldier , but my health did not permit that .
I wanted to fight for my country , but that will not happen .
Georgij Fanijew , 20
The boy , who survived , although he was imprisoned to feet of a murderous terrorist
A miracle : Georgij Fanijew was imprisoned during the siege to feet of a murderous terrorist , but he created it to survive .
During the siege it was in the sports hall and sat beside the bomb , which was fastened to the foot of a murderous terrorist .
It is really a miracle that it was not killed .
“ We feel it , as if it would have been yesterday , ” say Georgij , which wanted to go as a secret service officer to FSB , but this because of its health damage due to the siege not to do could .
It is not still with me , it is anything that I left behind me .
I am now older and humans say that children can deal easily with bad experiences - I do not have to say , vote .
“ 2006 I worked with psychologists and felt for it actually somewhat better , but I can not forget it .
And I was gladly forgotten .
2005 - in the year after - was the first and only mark that I went again into the sports hall .
I lost consciousness .
I will return never again there and not ask you me ask not to show you where I sat in this famous picture .
Survivor : Georgij Fanijew today , with a photo of itself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is tremendous and I carries it each day with me .
My friends know the fact that I do not remember gladly or about it speaks and asked it me never for the school .
Physically am I well .
I should be careful with my injured knee , but I can now run well .
But because of my health I could not study at the secret service academy of FSB in Saint Petersburg , as I wanted .
I returned my documents , also the medical and answered her that it is not possible .
My second passion were the animals , therefore I went to veterinary Institut .
I have there already two years behind me .
He learns the treatment of all animals “ from cats to cows ” .
He said : “ I knew that I would never report to my children of my experiences .
About it children should not know anything and them should it naturally also suffer .
Its mother Marina , 42 , said : “ This pain never leaves me .
It is worse in my soul , if the anniversary moves more near .
I will go to the ceremonies to the memory .
I know that Georgij will not go .
It must be still many more violent for it , because he was not and I there .
I waited at home for him and could not help .
I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me . Here in Beslan all of it are drawn .
It remains in us .
Georgij is now an adult , but this horror is still in him .
It is heavy to accept if somewhat so unfair happens .
He is a boy , he likes sport , but he can not participate because of its knee .
It was operated several times , it can run , but drive no sport .
I would say that he overcame the horror 50 % , but one can never overcome and forget that completely .
This terrible experience will always pursue us .
Many friends and neighbour were killed with the siege and to strengthened only mean the pain .
I lost many humans , whom I could do well and who me were expensive .
My son is with me , and that is the largest gift that God could make for me , but my heart cries around the killing .
I know from families , in which new children were born , in addition , from widows , who never married again .
It is difficult to accept that the life continues , even if one does not want that .
I am never forgotten , how my heart jumped in me , when I saw it in the hospital .
And now I see , what proceeds in the world - wars in other regions .
For what do these humans fight ?
Why do they kill themselves mutually ?
The war is our country now much and I can that nearly not believe .
We were in former times a friendly country , how it can be that we fight now ?
Humans and children suffer , I am sure that in Ukraine many children were already killed and still many are killed .
If we only all these rebels to seize and eject could - as far away as only possible .

When Renzi became in February 2014 a Prime Minister , he appointed Mogherini as his Foreign Minister .
If the PD has today better relationship to the strong peace movement in the country , which contributed to over 40 percent the voices of the party with the European Union-elections in May , then , as in PD-circles is noted , Federica Mogherini had a portion of it .
The reproaching in Brussels , the new European Union-Außenbeauftragte too little diplomatic experience has , is missing it at substance , in the PD is thus countered .

It is a very young team , which I can help at the moment .
The stick in certain phases but to me , `` Hofmann said .
Grödig coach Michael Baur and his team had little to blame .
He regretted the fast against hit `` from the category Zaubertor '' as well as the regular gate of farm in the 40th minute , which was denied by the referee Kollegger wrongly .

Judge temporarily blocks legislation that could force all abortion clinics in Louisiana to close

This measure , which was made by Bobby Jindal , governor of Louisiana , into law in June and come into force on 1st Sept. to were doctors that perform abortions , forced to buy a patients right to a hospital within a radius of 30 miles of their practice .
The judge 's decision means that the doctors can continue to carry out preliminary legal abortions , while they apply for such a right .
`` The plaintiffs will be able to continue to work in accordance with the law , while trying to obtain these rights , '' Federal Judge John deGravelles wrote in his ruling .
Within a month , a hearing will be scheduled for the judge to make a more permanent decision for the law .
Abortion advocates welcomed the decision , the latest in a series of rulings against similar measures and said that doctors gained more time to obtain hospital admissions .
`` Today 's decision means that the women '' in Louisiana some underhand escape law which wants to deprive them of their health and their rights , Nancy Northup , president and chairman of the Center for Reproductive Rights , which sued on behalf of three of the five clinics in the state to stop the law .

Abortion supporters and the American College of Ostretricians crushing , as well as the American Medical Association have agreed to say that the rights of doctors demand unnecessary restrictions .

With Rona fair head the BBC has found perhaps the great director she needs .
She meets with a proud fame tow from the banking world , the media management and the inner circle of the Tory party .
And it has its own front line experience .
Her career began at the global management consulting firm Bain and Co. , where she moved to Morgan Stanley , Bomba , ICI and the world 's media .
She was seven years back , CEO of the Financial Times and came when the top post of the parent company 's went to a younger male colleague .
Your severance allegedly amounted to almost £1 million .
Even their political ranking is solid .
It was David Cameron recommended by Lord Browne , the former chairman of BP , when he was looking for more commercial expertise in Whitehall : It became an adviser to the cabinet .
Her husband , a former Tory councillor .
Back in May , I described the role of the chairman with a poisoned chalice .
Not only the BBC is a huge and complex unit at the heart of public life , but there is also an internal paradox in its structure .
The trust works in two directions : Inside at the first guard of their own management hierarchy at the BBC , but also to the outside as the voice of public concern and anxiety when things go wrong .
This ensures an almost untenable duopoly , which demands a full comprehensive reform .
But the new incoming president would risk it , to strike at everything and disassemble an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty , while he expresses themselves perhaps his job .
It is a difficult task .
And as if that were not enough , many are keen to see the BBC reduced - outdated power , money and status .
While the competition approaches and new technologies threaten the old , comfortable certainties , the upcoming negotiation of the royalties for the BBC is connected with special dangers .
For the modest sum of £145,50 per year , the British public certainly buys into the largest media company in the world .
The BBC tells a good story : It says that it reaches 96 percent of all households , and each of them only costs 40 pence a day .
And the BBC seem to rise on the popularity scale upwards again : 53 percent now support it , compared with 31 percent 10 years ago .
The sight and usage habits for the BBC have changed : Now I get news headlines on my mobile phone and see missed programs later on my iPlayer .
But it remains a very beloved and important institution .
It needs a great leader - I hope she has found him .

Among all the high-minded views , there are brief anecdotes on the earth : For instance about beatings in a restaurant frequented by Believing or a crazy ride , in which he proposed a tree head-on .

Students often differ in their expectations and demands from the students in 10 , 20 , 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression , and with VIF can be just that .
The National Students Union , however , criticised the service as aloof .
Megan Dunn , vice-presidents of the nus for higher education , said : `` This offer seems to be completely separated from the lives of the majority of students .
Many of the students who begin this month with the study , are facing a crisis in the cost of living , because the available funds can be in the form of loans and grants by the soaring bills are the simplest life step before they even think about spending thousands of pounds on something as simple as the arrival at the residence .

Two similar , already far advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not a pipedream .
Due to a high level of participation of the population , as well as by volunteers from all over the world , they are a tourist magnet .
Piffl : `` I was sceptical at the beginning .
But over time , more and more I have come to believe that it would be useful to advance the project . `` It could be a '' unique selling point `` for the river city .
Here , there is nothing else .
In addition , the project would be through EU subsidies , visitor tickets and potential sponsors fundable , believes Piffl .
`` The idea of the reconstruction , I personally do not simply throw it overboard . '' He hopes that the club moves perhaps on this point .

Back to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
The congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have tabled a bill to establish the organization of trade unions and civil rights .
`` Unions are dying just as the middle class jobs , '' Ellison , a Democrat from Minnesota , and vice-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus , said .
That is why I proudly present together with the civil rights icon John Lewis , the employee empowerment law .
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal possibilities for discrimination due to the organisation of trade unions , as with other forms of discrimination - and thus stop anti-union-minded forces .
The completion of the national labour law in order to create an opportunity for a discrimination abandoned workers to organize a union representation , in order to sue in a civil court for justice - and in order to receive compensation or penalty payments - is a useful and necessary initiative .
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards .
In fact , the best way is to suggest to the understanding of what Ellison , Lewis and the other sponsors of their bill , the link to a very American idea .
Despite the setbacks , which the unions were suspended in recent years - in Wisconsin , Michigan and other states across the country , Americans were encouraged in countries around the world to recognise work rights to extend and respect .
There was a time in which millions of Americans remember , when this country democracy , freedom of speech , freedom of the press and the right of association mentioned in the same breath .
When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War , General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution that would ensure that the militarised autocracy Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy .
In full awareness of the fact that the workers and their trade unions participated in the creation of a new Japan , using a language that explicitly recognized that the rights of workers are guaranteed of association and collective bargaining and action. ``
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II , General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff pressed the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that the fascism Adolf Hitler would be replaced by a strong democracy .
In recognition of the fact that the workers must organize and raise its voice in the new government added a clause explicitly testified : `` The right to form and to safeguard the health and economic conditions and to improve each and every profession or trade .
Agreements that restrict this right or aim to reduce it is null and void ; targeted measures are illegal .
As the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission on Human Rights , the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted in 1948 by the United Nations as a global agreement , Roosevelt and the other drafters added a guarantee that everyone has `` the right to form trade unions for the protection of his interests or '' to join them .
For generations , Americans accept the basic premise that labour rights are human rights .
When this country advising others how to civilian and democratic societies could form , Americans said that the law must be protected on the establishment of a trade union - and that these unions could then participate in collective bargaining as an equal partner with companies and government agencies .
After these rights were under attack in America , is it really wise , to lead the American ideal , according to which the working population must have the right to unite and to have a free and open society .
As pastor , Martin Luther King Jr. said 50 years ago :
History is a great teacher. ``
Now everyone knows that the labour movement did not restrict the strength of the nation but enlarged it .
By raising the living standards of millions , labour miraculously created a market for industry and lifted the whole nation to unimaginable levels of production .
Those who attack labour forget these simple truths , but history preserves them .
History remembers , and that is something we should do .
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights and protection against discrimination in the establishment of employee representatives - is long overdue .
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are renewing the ideals that made America great in the past and simply delivering on the promise of democracy .

The house prices have seen the strongest winter rise in seven years , a widely observed index shows .
The RP Data Core Logic Home Value Index Hedonic for homes in the Australian capital rose by 1.1 percent in August , the RP-Data on Monday .
This increase is the overall increase in June , July and August , at 4.2 percent , the largest increase in the winter months since 2007 .
The annual price increase of 10.9 percent , more than twice as high as the increase in the 12 months to August 2013 , but the increases were not distributed evenly across the country .
The RP Data research director , Tim but , told that Sydney and Melbourne drive a two-tier market .
The figures from RP Data show that house prices in Sydney rose by 16.1 percent last year , in Melbourne , compared to 11.7 percent .
The following markets are Adelaide , Brisbane and Darwin , where prices increased by an average of five and six percent .
At the other end of the scale , Canberra , which has been hit by cuts in government spending , where prices rose over the year by only 1.4 percent .
But Lord said that an increase in properties for sale in the spring at the beginning would now be for the next few months , which would subject the market `` a real test . ''
`` If you look at the continuing high rate of auction prices , a rapid rate of sales in general and the persistently low interest-rate environment , it is likely that home prices '' in the next three months will continue to rise , he said .

The Socialists in France should `` keep their mouths shut and put France in order , '' the most important ally of François Hollande said .
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left , `` to show their love '' for the controversial socialist president , whose cabinet reshuffle has met with disapproval in the vast majority of the French .
The president deserves everyone 's respect , he deserves our loyalty , he deserves our support .
`` It is our duty to remain by their side , '' he said to loud applause .
As reassuring , the prime minister insisted that his government 's controversial 35-hour week in France , despite fierce demands for an easing of regulation of Emmanuel Macrons , the new economy minister , not question .
On Saturday , Mr Hollande had called his Mitsozialisten to stand `` united '' with the government .
But Christiane Taubira , the justice minister , shared a spanner in the works in which she performed at a meeting of rebel Socialist member of parliament and the Socialist party criticised the fact that they take the French `` faith in their future . ''
Marine Le Pen , the far-right leader of the National Front derided the constant infighting of the Socialists and said that she could not imagine that the new Valls government would last more than a few months ?
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes , but Prince Manuel Valls does not either , they are forced to form a new government , if not the old has survived a summer .
`` And also the new autumn or winter is not '' survive , Miss Le Pen told supporters .
She repeated her party 's call for a dissolution of parliament and said that she is confident to emerge as the winner in the early elections and is ready for government .
France 's ruling party suffered a defeat in the local elections in March and the right-wing National Front was in the EU elections in May .
A survey in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche showed that 76 percent of the French believe that the Socialist Party is exposed to the risk of falling apart before the end of the term , Hollande 's 2017 into several rival factions .
Pascal Perrineau , a political scientist at Sciences Po University , warned that the French would quickly lose patience when the new Socialist government get any improvement in the economy and record unemployment figures .
`` There is a small window of opportunity , but public opinion quickly needs to feel that things are changing , '' he warned .
Otherwise , the situation could deteriorate further .

The tax burden of businessmen in Washington is rising with the economic recovery
A recovery of the economy means more customers , more sales and new jobs .
It also means higher taxes .
State and local tax issues for companies in the country increased slightly last year , while accelerating the economic recovery , according to a new study published last week , and the company in the Washington area was no exception .
Businesses in the District , Maryland and Virginia together paid $ 27.6 billion to state and local agencies in fiscal year 2013 , an increase of 3.8 percent compared to revenue of $ 26.6 billion in 2012 .
State and local tax burden of enterprises rose by 4.3 percent last year to $ 671 million , compared to 3.9 percent in the previous year , and it was the third year in a row of growth after several years of declining orders in 2009 and 2010 .
State taxes increased more than the local taxes , by 4.3 percent , according to the study carried out by the service agency Ernst & Young with the Centre for Business Taxation , a tax policy group .
More than half of the revenue of the district , 56 percent , came from corporate taxes , while 36 percent of revenues come from Maryland companies .
Virginia has the lowest tax revenue with 28 percent of company .
Much of the increase in tax revenues is due to a recovery of the real estate value of companies , researchers , leading to an increase in property taxes by 3.7 percent this year after three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent .
While a large proportion of these profits from large states such as California , New York and Texas , the process also seems to be true for the Washington area .
Businesses in the District , Maryland and Virginia together paid more than $ 10 billion in state and local property taxes last year , compared to $ 9.6 billion in 2012 - a rise in the course of a year by 4.2 percent .
But the apparent recovery in the real estate values in Maryland is not as effective in improving state and local tax revenue , because the real estate taxes amount to barely more than one-fifth of the tax issues of companies .
Companies in Virginia and D.C. are paying almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of property taxes .
`` In Maryland , the following happens : A large proportion of real estate , particularly in the fiscal area around D.C. , is either owned by the government or non-profit organizations that pay no property taxes , '' said Douglas Lindholm , director of the Center on State Taxation .
Maryland is therefore forced to rely much more on , for example , the income tax to be able to offer the same services that offer other states .
The recent recovery in tax revenues by companies can not only be attributed to the recovery of the real estate market
Company revenues appear to recover , so the data .
Businesses in the region reported on income taxes for state organizations of $ 2.3 billion compared with $ 2.1 billion in 2012 .
Maryland took a $ 1 billion in corporate income taxes , the highest amount in the region .
While the trend is heading in the same direction , the local tax burden on businesses is not rising uniformly in all three places .
The growth rate in the District met with 4.3 percent of the national average , while the rise in Maryland was significantly higher , 4.9 percent .
Only Virginia reported an average tax revenue of 4.1 percent .
Virginia has 6 percent in all three areas , the significantly lower corporate income taxes ( in all three there are fixed corporate tax rates ) .
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and the District at relatively high 9,975 per cent .
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that in Virginia lower state and local business taxes are required and , overall , a better tax climate than Maryland .
In the study , the District was not investigated .
Despite the advantages of Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbour .
North Carolina passed laws to reduce its corporate tax rate this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent , the same rate as Virginia , and the rate will fall to 5 percent in the coming year .
If the state continues to reach its revenue targets for the coming year , this law could reduce the corporate income tax rate of up to 3 per cent by 2017 .
In the meantime , it seems to be small businesses in the Washington area , and it therefore pay more state and local taxes , according to the most recent study .
Corporate taxes and personal income taxes are paid by small businessmen - a transitional structure in which most small businesses are organized - in the District , Maryland and Virginia increased last year by 20 percent to $ 2.4 billion , a faster rate of growth than the corporate taxes altogether .
The researchers say that the trend and the increase in corporate taxes across the country are likely to continue this year , with an increase of the general VAT revenues for 2014 , the state and local governments by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters compared to the same period of the previous year .
However , the region could lag behind Washington , if the federal government 's spending cuts affects the labour market in the region .

Exclusive extract from Howard Jacob 's new novel about love and the letter `` J '' hochgelobtem .
You zerflossen , one could best describe it , she slowly dissolved like a cardboard box that you have to stand in the rain .
Occasionally , a woman told him that he was too serious , demanding , intense , aloof and perhaps slightly kratzbürstig .
And then the hand shook him .
Kratzbürstig he knew .
He was stachelig , like hedgehogs , yes .
The last victim of this barbed approach was a very nascent affair for which was promising a relief of boredom of his life than usual , and perhaps even brought him a certain amount of satisfaction .
Ailinn Solo Mons was a trembling , delicate beauty with untamed hair and a fluttering heart from a village on the North Island , which was even more isolated and hostile than Port Reuben .
It came with an older companion to the south , Kevern held for her aunt , who had inherited a plot in a damp but heavenly valley with the aptly named Paradise Valley .
For several years , no one had lived in the house .
The pipes were leck , the bathrooms were spiders , slugs have left their mark on all the windows , and believed that they belong to all of this , and the garden was overgrown with weeds that looked like giant cabbage heads .
It was like the house out of a children 's story , both menacing and seductive , a garden full of secrets .
Portrait of the author : Howard Jacobson , whose novel `` J '' on the long list for the Man Booker Prize is 2014 .
The shortlist will be announced in the coming week .
Kevern and Ailinn holding had sat on the broken chairs in the high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon , and both had been playing a spirit absent in the console , which supplied the country with soothing music and besänftigenden news than the sight of her brown legs crossed reminded him of an old song , one long forgotten black entertainer , which his father had listened with closed blinds in the house .
Your feet are too big .
Due to their own aggressiveness songs of this kind were no longer played on the console .
Not banned - Nothing was played so well - just not banned .
It has been successful obsolesziert , like the word obsoleszieren .
The general flavour created what decrees and regulations had never managed , and how the people in the book From-dishwasher-to-millionaire-memoirs , cookery books and romantic novels , so she chose the music for the ballads .
In the euphoria of the day began to play an imaginary piano Kevern and a gross-funny serenade Ailinns big feet to eulogise , sing .
Ailinn understood that .
`` This was a well-known song of a jazz pianist called Fats 1971 , '' he told her , and automatically put two fingers to his lips .
It had always done his father to stop the letter J , before he came out of his mouth .
It began as a game between him and his father , when he was still small .
His father had played it with his own father , as he was told .
When you start a word with a J , without putting two fingers on your lips , it will cost you a penny .
It was not a very fun game back then , and it was not very funny .
He knew what was expected of him , that was all .
It had to explain what jazz was .
Ailinn had never heard of any .
Jazz was , even though he was not directly prohibited , not played .
The improvisation was not more modern .
There was only room for one `` if '' in life .
The people wanted to be at the beginning of a melody , where it would end .
Similarly , the mind .
His unpredictability made people nervous .
And Jazz was musically ausgedrückter mind .
Although he was 10 years old , without having heard about Sammy Davis Junior , Kevern knew something about jazz by the semi-secret collection of old CDs of his father .
But at least he had to explain Ailinn , Fats Waller was black .
At their age , they probably could not remember a time when Popsänger were not black .
Again , no laws or restrictions .
A compliant society meant that every element of this society gratefully agreed to the principle of the group talent - grateful like fate spared .
People of Afro-Caribbean origin were by temperament and conformation for entertainment and sports , so she sang and ran .
People who were originally from the Indian subcontinent , were blessed by nature with electronic talent and were served with the task of ensuring that no family was left without a working telephone service .
What was left of the Polish community , took care of the sewage system ; what was left of the Greeks smashed plate .
Those from the Gulf states and the Levant , whose grandparents left the country quickly than WHAT GESCHEHEN ship IF IT GESCHEHEN ship geschah- for fear of being accused of Feuerschürens , fearing that the flames would consume them next - had Labneh- and shisha-pipe-restaurants opened , consider themselves and were depressed by inaction .
Each according to his abilities .
Because she had heard only ballads , Ailinn found it difficult to understand how the offensive words that she had just vorgesungen Kevern , could ever be synchronized .
Music is an expression of love .
`` These are not really '' offensive , Kevern said .
Except , perhaps , for people whose feet are too big .
My father has never offended anyone , but he loved this song .
He talked too much , but the neglected garden gave him a false sense of security .
Nothing could overcome the soundproofing of the giant cabbage-like leaves .
Ailinn still not understood .
Why did your father would love such a thing ?
He wanted to say that it was a Jux , however , hesitated to show again in its present two fingers to their lips .
You already thought that it was a little odd .
`` It was funny , '' he said instead .
She shook her head in disbelief and impeded Keverns view .
There was nothing else in the whole world to see as their ungekämmtes pitch black hair .
There was nothing that he wanted to see otherwise .
`` If you say '' it , they believe , without conviction .
But that still does not explain why you vorsingst it myself .
She seemed genuinely concerned .
My feet are too big ?
He looked again .
Your feet are not so directly .
Perhaps your ankles , a little bit ...
And you say that you hate me because my ankles are too thick ?
But hate ?
Of course , I do not hate you .
This is just a silly song .
He could have said `` I love you , '' but it was still too early for that .
`` Your thick ankles are exactly the reason why you think '' me , he tried it instead .
I am a bit perverse .
That was not right .
It was supposed to be funny .
When he tried to be funny , he was often in trouble because he did not like his father about the soothing charm needed to bezähmen the inherent cruelty in jokes .
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel .
Perhaps he , Kevern , wanted to be .
Despite his kind eyes .
Ailinn Solo Mons was red and rose from her deck chair , threw the console and buried the wine they were drinking .
Elder flowers , wine , drunkenness was no excuse for him .
In her excitement , she seemed to tremble , like palm fronds in the storm .
`` And your thick head is exactly the reason why I am drawn to office , '' you feel , she said .
Except that I am not even that .
She was tired of him , both because of the unnecessary unfriendliness of his words and the fear that was in their eyes when they rebelled against him .
They dachte , that he would beat them ?
She had not told him about the life on the cold northern archipelago , where she was raised , but he had no doubt that it was essentially just like here .
The same vast and icy ocean broke here and there on the shore .
The same confused men with even thicker skin and verdrießlicher after THIS WAS GESCHEHEN ship as it were their ancestors as smugglers and wreckers , moved from pub to pub , always willing to raise a hand against a woman who refused them or derided .
Thick head ?
It would have shown her a big fist , if not farewells .
She only kissing - kissing the most-used word for an erotic attraction between men and women , an antidote to the vacuous love ballads from the console - they were only kissing and then beat .
After Keverns believes this was an unnecessary refinement , because kissing was itself an act of violence .
Ailinn Solo Mons gave him to go through her body .
He arose from the deck chair , like an old man .
They also felt bleiern , but the impact of his grief surprised them .
That was not the end of the world .
They barely knew each other .
She watched him as he departed , as from a room on the upper floor of their companion was watching him - a man , complaining of what he himself had created .
Adam leaves the garden , she thought .
She felt a sudden pain for him , and men in general , although some have raised their hands against it .
A man turned away from her , his back bent , embarrassed , defeated without fighting spirit - why this was a sight that she seemed to know when she could not remember a single occasion on which she had seen something in the present day ?
When she was alone again , Ailinn Solo Mons looked at their feet .
Several years before the events just told working ESME Nussbaum , an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow , non-legislative oversight body for the public mood , with a short talk about the continued violence at low and intermediate level in exactly the areas where the reduction , if not elimination , most likely to be expected , given the money and energy into eradicating such violence had been invested .
`` A lot has been done , and a lot still needs to be done , '' she wrote , `` in order to appease the innate aggressiveness of a people that a thousand wars waged and won most of them , especially in the remote areas and valleys of the country in which the sweet breath of human kindness has been historically felt despite the towering spires of the hedges .
But , it turns out , some properties of erroneous belief .
The higher the tower , it seems , the lower the passion he arouses .
The people crying when listening to sentimentaler ballads , enthralled by stories about overcome difficulties and claims to believe strongly in the virtues of marriage and family life , but not only the former rudeness maintains the rural communities as well as our urban fabric in the hand , but there is also evidence for the emergence of a new and devious argument looks at home , in the workplace , on the streets and even on the playing fields .
`` They have an unfortunate tendency to exaggeration , her mentor meant when he had read the entire report .
I suggest that you read more novels .
ESME Nussbaum lowered its head .
I also have to ask : You are an atheist ?
`` I believe that I have to say no , '' ESME Nussbaum replied .
Are you lesbian ?
Again , ESME invoked their right to privacy and refusal of the statement .
Feminist ? .
Again silence .
`` I do n't ask that , '' Luther Rabinowitz said finally , `` because I would be against atheism , Lesbentum or feminism .
This here is a prejudice-free workplace .
We serve a prejudice-free society .
But certain types of hyper-sensitivity that are perfectly acceptable and commendable , can occasionally results , as you have presented it to distort .
You yourself seem to have prejudices against the church , and those things you describe as `` sneaky '' and `` raw '' could be interpreted by others as well as an expression of a natural strength and vitality .
If you continue to beat down on this , WHAT IS GESCHEHEN IF IT IS GESCHEHEN , as if it , if it would have happened would have happened yesterday means to deprive the country of its essential vitality .
For ESME Nussbaum felt , while Rabinowitz said .
Behind his head , repeated an LED sticker in flamingo pink , the advice , the country in the last quarter-century Ofnow or longer .
You Lächeln to their neighbours , you value your partner , you hear ballads go , musicals , you use your phone , you talk , you say that you listen , you agree that you apologize .
Speaking is better than silence , the song is better than the written , but nothing is better than love .
`` I understand completely what you want , ESME Nussbaum replied , '' with a quiet voice when she was sure that her boss had spoken to the end , `` and I say nothing other than that we are not yet healed as effective as we are deluding ourselves .
My concern is that we may find ourselves without warning about how we repeat the mistakes in THIS WHAT IS GESCHEHEN IF IT IS GESCHEHEN .
This time , however , it is not the other where we miss our anger and our mistrust .
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with the hands .
In order to indicate a patience .
`` You go too far , '' he said , `` if you describe acts as a '' mistake `` that perhaps our grandparents or not .
You also go too far when you say that they had their `` anger '' and their `` suspicion '' to `` other '' left out .
It should not be necessary to remind someone in your position , that we talk about the understanding of the past , such as in the protection of the present , not `` us '' and `` other . ''
There was no `` us '' and there were no `` other . ''
It was a time of disorder , which is all we know .
`` From the daring , if we are honest with ourselves , '' ESME smash , `` no part of society can claim to have behaved well .
I accuse no one .
Whether it was done badly or well , what is done is done .
That was then .
Nothing more needs to be said - and here we agree .
And like any blame must be assigned , so no debt must be repaid if such repayment would be appropriate , and if there was a way to wipe them out .
But what about the past , if we do not learn from it -
The past is that we forget about them .
If I may say something about this
Luther Rabinowitz did not coincide his pyramid .
`` I will consider their report , he said , '' and dismissed them .
The next day , when she went to work as usual , she was run over by a motorcycle driver who described how passers-by , in a sort of `` brutal rage '' on the footpath .
There are coincidences .

Matthies says : Time for large networking
Given the galloping technological progress which our cosy homes in high-tech threatens to transform switching centers , our columnist Bernd Matthies console themselves with a very familiar electronic accessories .
As I write this , my eye falls on the spiral cable that connects the listener on the phone , and I think : Boah , how retro is that ?
But there is a thought behind it : If the cable is not all listeners , would fly around in a short time , unlike in the House , and that would still be significantly more retro .
In any case applies to the disgust ( `` disgust '' ?
No , typo : Electronic ) sector bought the rule that the world today is the electrical waste of tomorrow - out of date .

Why is this ?
Because it reminds us of the Ifa Andrängen on radio tower this week our absolute incompetence in matters of electronics .

Yes , it 's ?
What is there to talk with people who seem to spread such Quark voluntarily ?
In fact , it is for about 20 years , above all , that we should always connect our house .
To make the yogurt even after being ordered to fire alarm tells us on holiday to the Maldives that it burns grad in the work room .
And it would be wonderful if the air conditioning from the office to our early arrival ... ?
Yes , but this requires an air-conditioning .
But certainly a dream will soon come true : We raise our watch , telling her `` sucking ! '' - and home of the vacuum cleaning robot drives off .
Misleading .
It all amounts to nothing less than a revolution : `` The boundaries between white and brown goods blurring '' raunt an industry expert , you can connect the washing machine with a pair of headphones , the steam sends nao the weather forecast and the glasses will show how long the pizza in the oven needs , what is not , however , because we are in a traffic jam .
From the day-to-day practice , we also know that if a cutting-edge device is really urgently needed once the battery is guaranteed .
But another reason is that the spiral cable will survive on the phone the next radio shows .

In a statement to the press , it contradicts statements by the CEO Peer Medau and attesting that , `` as a commander , '' to pose .
The style of the university , it is not , according to the statement .
For example , the family was already `` in mid-June , Medau informed orally on the request of the university .
The statement that the plans were first announced in July , are `` definitely untrue , Pötzl 's bodypaintings .
At the same time , he points out that it is not in the plans `` Vorfestlegungen or decisions , '' but `` preferences '' would be it .
Also , the need for the expansion of the narrow road to the castle would be less dramatic than feared by Medaus .
From a nine-metre-wide road and not talk .
It comes after current state of 5.50 metres , a metre wider than before , `` explains Pötzl .
The argument of Medau-operators that their free and own parking spaces in the future will only be used by students of the university , do not want to accept Pötzl .
It is not at all with parks , because that , like other public car parks now intelligently Resolve .
Residents to think
The crèche mountain dwarf , which is located on the site and on its doorstep , the approach would lead to the parking deck along , will be affected , according to the university president , `` no . ''
Instead , he has to remember that `` this is not just about the nursery , but also for the residents at the Friedrich-Streib Street and the 800 pupils of the nearby secondary school .
So it is about much more than special interests , Medau , `` Pötzl 's bodypaintings .
Whether the criticism of the parent advisory council of the nursery , with the expansion of the road would be a `` lost the few natural spots Coburgs was '' justified , `` the reader can decide for themselves . ''

Last week Peer Medau had informed the parents of the children 's nursery on the plans of the university .
Therefore , the approach for the new parking deck instead of the campus and the Friedrich-Streib Street , but about the Medau mountain .
That should narrow road at about one kilometre in length which has to be developed .

Smart ways to save on university textbooks
Since the cost of uni-textbooks for many students more than $ 1,000 per year will be considered a fast second semester student Matt Schroeder , a clever idea of austerity .
He invented a surrogate system for books by students of higher semesters and a nominal compensation offered to delay the sale .
`` My maths book usually costs $ 180 , but I got it for $ 10 for a semester and a Chick-fil-A-biscuit , '' said Schroeder , 19 , of the Covenant College in Georgia .
The books needed for the last semester would have cost $ 430 , he said .
He spent $ 120 .
The College Board said that on average , the students spend more than $ 1,200 a year on textbooks and study materials for students , however , there are various options for cost containment .
Online stores and creative approaches , such as the Schroeders are becoming the solution of choice for students .
Renting textbooks will be more popular , and so students can use a book for a semester , often at a considerably lower price than at the time of purchase .
Neebo Inc , which operates more than 250 university bookstores , said that the hiring of textbooks have doubled since 2011 .
In industry surveys show that about a quarter of the books in the college bookstores last spring semester was hired , said Vice-President Neebos Tevor Meyer .
Less than half of all the textbooks will , according to the trade association , National Association of College Stores in campus bookstores .
Here is the ABC for the best deals .
Buy online
Several new books online cost only a third of the price for which they are in the campus bookstore .
The ninth edition of `` Calculus '' vno Ron Larwon , Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $ 290 , but can be purchased in a specialised retailer Chegg.com textbook for $ 239,99 .
Buy used
If one of the notes of others or normal usage tracks , used books are a good option .
`` Calculus '' is used to having Chegg.com for 93,49 $ .
Matte Casaday , 25 , a graduate student at Brigham Young University , says that he has spent on Amazon.com 42 cents for a used copy of `` Strategic Media Decisions : Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business . ''
The book was sold for $ 48 .
Academics like Ingrid Bracey , head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls advised students to check with their professors , whether previous editions are admissible .
Sometimes the updates are not relevant for the seminar work .
In such cases , older issues can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest edition .
In addition to Chegg and Amazon also helped .com by eBay Inc is a popular alternative for used books .
Renting
The hiring of textbooks is worth considering if you treat them fairly well , remember to return it , and you keep the books after completion of the course .
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased books .
For example , a student might `` Calculus '' for the duration of a term rent for about $ 20 .
Find out about the rules of the business where you rent , even beyond the criminal charges that may be incurred for writing , or usage tracks .
Renters beware : If you do not return the book to the criminal charges , even the price of a new book .
E-books
Even e-books , rather than traditional textbooks are an option .
Sometimes , these books are actually rented by an electronic license is provided for a certain period of major retailers such as Amazon.com , Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc .
At Chegg `` Calculus '' for 6 months rent for about $ 61 .
Bracey says that students often find in literature courses , the best deals , because these days many classics can be downloaded for free scientific and engineering science textbooks , can be very expensive .
Look around in any case .
Joe Gault , 29 , who will soon visit the pepper Dine Law School , recommends the ISBN number for price determination for books , because you can be so sure , finding the right textbook .
And in an online order , you should verify , Gault , whether the book is actually available .
He learned this lesson the hard way .
He bought a book for four weeks and eventually paid the full price in the college bookstore .

Delayed diagnosis and a lack of access to the best treatments lead to higher death rates from ovarian cancer in rural areas .
Angelina Jolie and her brother , James made a video tribute to her mother , who died of ovarian cancer in 2007 .
For women in rural areas of Australia , there is a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than for women in cities .
Researchers analyzed the medical records of more than 1100 Australians , when ovarian cancer was diagnosed in 2005 , and found that only 25 percent of five years after diagnosis were still alive .
Research Director Susan Jordan from QIMR Mountain Hofer Medical Research Institute , said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state , the mortality risk during the study by 20 % higher than for those in urban areas .
Kleine STUDY : New drugs may slow lung and ovarian cancer .
The researchers examined the medical care of women over seven years .
Dr Jordan said that a woman 's age at diagnosis , type of ovarian cancer , the previous illnesses , as well as the social and economic status also influenced the chances of survival .
For older women and those whose cancer was already advanced further at the time of diagnosis , the survival rate is the lowest .
For those living in rural and remote regions of the state , the mortality risk during the study by 20 % higher than for those in urban areas .
Although the study examined why women living outside the city , more likely to die of ovarian cancer , Dr. Jordan suggests a delayed diagnosis and the lack of access to the best treatment centres as possible factors .
`` This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists , and these are mostly to be found in larger towns , '' she said .
Despite the improvement of medical services to counter the distances a bit , she suggested , as a possible remedy , a reinforcement of the service by doctors flown to give professionals the opportunity to provide women denser at the place of residence , as well as treatment programs for people outside of their region .
Dr Jordan said that the study found regardless of geographic status of a poor long-term survival rate for women with ovarian cancer and stressed the need for better treatment and prevention strategies .

China refuses to allow Hong Kong the right to elect government , protesters swear vengeance
On Sunday , the Chinese Parliament decided , despite the increased calls for democratic reforms against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 election of Hong Kong 's electorate .
This approach probably fired the long-announced protests in Hong Kong 's business district , while militants initiated the planning and mobilization on this within a few hours after the announcement .
The decision of the Chinese People 's Congress basically allows the Communist leaders did not reject all candidates loyal to Beijing .
`` This is not unexpected , but it makes us angry , '' legal expert Emily Lau , leader of the Democratic Party said .
That is not what Beijing had promised .
They have lied to the people of Hong Kong .
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime .
In his defense of the Chinese decision , Li Fei , deputy secretary-general of the Standing Committee of the National People 's Congress , said that the approval of public nominations for the election of Hong Kong 's government `` would be chaotic . ''
Since Cuba 's control over Hong Kong in 1997 , when Britain , the Chinese , Beijing has promised to let the people elect their government , in 2017 .
The Chinese government on Sunday presented the decision as a democratic breakthrough , because it gives the people of Hong Kong a direct electoral law , but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese government maintains the flow through a nomination committee tightly controlled by Beijing .
After a new clause only candidate `` with a love for country and love for Hong Kong '' should also be permitted .
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most effective public protests in Hong Kong have taken place for many years .
Behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong , the movement , Occupy Central With Love and Peace , whose organizers have threatened to seal off the financial district unless Beijing allows no genuine universal suffrage .
On Sunday evening , were within a few hours after the announcement , hundreds of Occupy-Central-supporters in the rain in front of the government headquarters in Hong Kong .
During the demonstration , the organizers said that their movement has reached a new phase of civil disobedience , and they mounted waves of protests in the coming weeks .
However , they made no details on this , apparently to avoid problems with the authorities .
In an online statement shared with the organisers that the movement `` the occupation of the central district , only as a last resort to , an action that is to be held only when all dialogue opportunities are exhausted , and there is no other choice .
We are sorry to have to say that all dialogue possibilities have been exhausted and the occupation of the central district will definitely take place .
The authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for days for the announcement of Beijing , and it was on the Sunday before the government building tighter security measures , including police and barricades .
The unrest is aggravated by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they slowly lose control over their city .
The influx of people from the mainland increases the competition for products and services .
In addition , the fear is that Hong Kong 's values , such as democracy and freedom of speech are beginning to crumble under the growing pressure from Beijing .
Some criticised the demonstrations by the Occupy Central movement because they are a business - the lifeblood of Hong Kong - is eroding .
`` The protests , which they say could cause serious economic damage , depending on how many are involved and how long it continues said , '' legal expert regime Ip , who has long criticized the move .
We do n't want to stoke fears that Hong Kong gets out of control .
This impression is bad for investment .
China 's state-controlled media also reported recently on democracy activists in Hong Kong as a subversive agents controlled by Western powers .
This summer , activists organized an unofficial referendum on electoral rights on which discussion was attended by people - more than one-fifth of the voters in Hong Kong .
In July , tens of thousands of people in one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations took part in the history of the region .

Putin demands from Kiev , the inclusion of `` state-talks '' with eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin , according to Russian media reports , demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop fighting against the separatists in the east of the country and immediately begins with negotiations on the `` statehood '' of the breakaway region .
His spokesman Dimitri Peskow clarified later that Putin had not meant that they are under the control of the separatist regions of eastern Ukraine will be a part of Russia , but that his status needs to be redefined to Ukraine to give the Russian-speaking region , the power to represent their rights and interests .
Putin 's call for the Kiev government to negotiate on an equal footing with the pro-Russian insurgents , however , fits into his since the beginning of the riots five months ago , apparently persecuted strategy : Aid for the separatists during the adoption of areas and pressure on the Ukrainian government to the newly proclaimed region Novo Rossija de facto independence for an alliance with Russia instead of the West .
In an interview with the state-owned TV station Channel One , Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recapture the areas held by separatists in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions , which were taken in March and April , after Moscow had annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18 .
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently described the area as `` Novo-Rossija collected '' or `` New Russia , '' a term that recalls the revolutionary heyday of the Russian empire .
Putin pointed out that all those Ukrainian politicians during the campaigns for the elections on 26 Okt . and government groups of civilian communities in the areas held by separatists hope to attack early peace talks `` are caught '' in their illusions , told Itar-Tass .
`` We need to immediately begin detailed discussions , '' not only technical issues but also on the political organization of society and the state status of the south-eastern Ukraine to protect the interests of the people who live there , he said .
Peskow said that Putin 's reference to the statehood must be seen in the context of the greater autonomy that has been discussed for months by the Kiev leadership to allay fears in Russian-speaking areas , that their cultural and linguistic rights have been compromised .
Only the Ukrainian government can give the necessary autonomy to the eastern regions , Peskow said .
We are not talking about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia , Peskow said , `` because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine , but '' an internal conflict in Ukraine .
The clarification of the Kremlin spokesman for correcting the `` misinterpretation '' of Putin 's remarks underscored the leadership of Russia in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east , in contrast to the direct Annektion Crimea , where the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians .
Moscow would have far greater difficulties to annex the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine , since most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and polls from before the conflict showed a large majority of the remaining in Ukraine .
The autonomy , which was raised by Russian diplomats at international forums , would give the regional governments in Ukraine authority to negotiate your own trade agreements and foreign relations , and about the Kremlin 's de facto control over an area that connects the Russian territory of Crimea .
The absorbed five months ago in the Black Sea peninsula is also the home port for the bulk of the Russian navy , as well as an important trading port and historic coastal region .
The regions between the Rostov region in Russia and Crimea is also rich in mines , factories and foundries , who make key components for the Russian military .
The Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed in his speech at the inauguration on 7 June that the Ukrainian legislation - after fresh elections - should consider amendments to the constitution that allow greater control will be given to the respective areas of their finances and the status of the languages .
But his idea of autonomy seems to stand in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels , which Moscow is accused of arming and incitement .
Putin 's recent call on Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders on an equal footing , followed by another invasion by the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks across the previously peaceful region along the Sea of Azov has invaded the eastern Ukraine .
The Russian-backed separatists took over in the coup , according to Ukrainian security official fears is the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea , the control of Nowoasowsk .
For this reason , massive civilian and military preparations are under way to fortify Mariupol , a steel industry port with 500,000 inhabitants , which lies between Nowoasowsk and the narrow access to the Crimea .
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels and asked for urgent action to create a further Russian aggression against Ukraine , a former Soviet republic that is independent for 23 years .
`` We are nearing the point of no return , '' warned Poroshenko .
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine .
The EU summit agreed no concrete action , the leaders called for the drafting of further sanctions against Russia , which Ukraine unspezifizierten escalation in a crisis is to enter into force .
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk , after two Russian armored columns and 1,000 soldiers broke into the Donetsk region last week to support the beleaguered separatists , Colonel Andriy Lysenko , spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council report said in Kiev on Saturday .
Probably the first 63 Ukrainian soldiers who were trapped by the Russian invasion in Ilowajsk were exchanged on Sunday against 10 Russian paratroopers who had been taken a week ago on Ukrainian territory , Lysenko said on Sunday .

The hellish year tenth of the survivors of Beslan : Ten years have passed since the horrific siege of the school as the children caught up in it today .
Ten years ago , more than 1,000 people were taken by Chechen militants at a school in Beslan in southern Russia as hostages .
More than 330 people , more than half of them children , were killed in the three-day ordeal that shocked the world .
We have returned to Beslan to identify some of the victims who had escaped death in the bestiality in the classroom .
Exactly a decade after the horrific siege of the school in Beslan in which 334 people were killed , including 186 children , warned the heroic survivors last night before a new apocalypse in Ukraine .
As a fanatical Islamist terrorists , children and parents on 1 September 2004 , the beginning of a new school year , captured and killed , that seemed like the evil means .
The tragedy united West and East in disgust , and then turned in surprisingly action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery .
Ten years later , we have returned to Beslan to identify some of the victims who had escaped death in the bestiality in the classroom .
We found surprising young people who have overcome the odds , though the memory of these terrorist hell will follow them forever .
Their best hope ?
The fact that the war ravaging Ukraine now - and where children die like them - now an end .

Both were thought to be dead , but she survived .
`` One woman told me that I should run for my life , but I could n't , '' Aida said .
My legs were blood flows .
I stood up and climbed again to look for my mother .
A soldier brought them in safety .
After a series of operations , they considered themselves to be completely cured , but said yesterday : `` Three months ago , the pain returned .
I am afraid that I have to be operated on again .
Some shrapnel shards are still in my knee .
Their aim is now to be a dentist to help people as she was helped by doctors .
`` This tragedy has changed my life , but it has not broken to me , '' she says fighting fun .
`` This happened to me , and this can not be changed .
Once a year , I always go to the gym to remind me of those who have stayed there .
My friends and I try to talk about it on other days .
The pain is too big .
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there .
We played together when we were small , and dreamed of going to school together .
`` I do not want to get married until I finish my studies and start my career .
I think to a family later .
She says that the siege will always remain a part of it , although the memory is weak , something every year .
I am pleased that many people in the world still recall with horror , and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in the UK and everywhere .
When I see the pictures of me online , I zurückklettere in school , I think that a lot of people see it for the first time , to understand our disaster and help to ensure that this does not happen again .
The boy , who fled through the bullets , in the view that his mother was dead
It was his first day of school ( Russians go to school with 7 years ) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother , Tamara .
After seven years , he said : `` Mom told me that I should come to me if there was an explosion , and hold their hand . ''
After an explosion , he thought she would die .
She said to him : `` Run . ''
Full of fear , they could be dead , he fled , and saw on the way a wine of infant , took it by the hand and fled with bullets .
His father , Vladimir , who concluded his son outside , said : `` Damir told me that his mother has died .
He said : `` I could not save them . ''
In fact , according to Tamara had stumbled outside and with leg injuries in the hospital , on the assumption that their son had died .
After its reunification , she said : `` I wept with joy .
I could not believe it .
He ran in and hugged me .
Damir was later flown to London ( now dissolved ) from the newspaper News of the World to obtain by the then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie , the title of a Barnardo 's Children 's Champion .
`` This horror is watching you every day , but I wish I could stop with the reminder , '' he said yesterday .
But I can say that in my memory it will be fainter .
I know that I immediately after man ever threw away all my toy guns .
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes and that is not a problem for me .
`` I am not afraid to go back to the gym , but I do not think me about .
I remember these kids with whom I played in the yard , and who did not .
We never say that they have been killed or dead .
We say that they are in the sports hall .
I remember very well my trip to London , particularly in the toy shop , where I could choose what I wanted , and the ride in an open top car .
But now he has caused anxiety around places like Ukraine , where wars , the kind of accident that he and his friends suffered .
This horror haunts you every day , but I wish I could stop to remember .
`` I am so sorry for all those who are suffering under the atrocities , '' said Damir , who worked as a volunteer last week in a monastery .
So I want to help .
One day , I want to go to the police and hope that they take me next year at the training academy .
His mother , Tamara , 48 , said : `` Thirty-seven children were killed from our neighbourhood , you can imagine it ?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege , there was simply no children who were able to set up and run around , and this silence lasted for many months .
She remembers vividly of her trip to London with Damir .
The people of London cried when I told our story .
At the time , I understood how people can understand on the other side of the world , our feelings and show their support .
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the price and the opportunity to travel to London in the autumn of 2004 .
I wish I could talk to Cherie and tell her just that 10 years have passed , but I still like to meet her and her husband to me in London , and how that Damir and has helped me .
I remember how Damir wanted to eat borscht and phoning them all local Russian restaurants .
I remember how he played with waiters in a restaurant , Damir shot with his water pistol at them and they ran away and played with him .
And that was just a month after the horror .
I was surprised that the British are so readily shared our pain and support us .
She said : `` I always think that this world is not in these 10 years , become better .
In Ukraine , the war continues , and people are dying every day , and I believe that many children have been killed and killed .
These are just such children as ours .
I think that for many , the war is a part of the messages they hear when they are bored or busy with something else .
I know what these people feel , the whole horror .
And I ca n't stop to feel that .
Nothing has changed , the people still want to kill themselves and that is so sad .
Damir was and is a very gentle and quiet boy , he is not at all aggressive or angry .
He is not looking for revenge , for example , he is not overwhelmed by the past atrocities .
I know he does n't like it , but he has six close friends from the class , and they sometimes go into the gym and light candles there .
When he was small he suffered , including - I remember how he was sometimes on the sofa , the face turned from us for hours on end .
Not sleeping , his eyes were open .
I remember how he threw all of his weapons and other military toys . Damir is now 17 , handsome , bigger than me , intelligent and healthy .
I can hardly believe that several hours I was so sure that he was dead and I would never see him again .
When I recovered myself after the explosion and saw the legs I came to me , and the hell looked around me , with body parts lying around .
I was absolutely sure that my little boy could have survived in this hell .
`` I remember that I called him , '' Damir , according to go on , `` but I was so sure that he had not heard me .
But he has heard it , and he ran away .
And so life goes on , unlike that of many others , for us .

The boy , whose terrible picture after the siege became a symbol of the horrors of Beslan
Comfort : The Beslan-survivors ( Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege in 2004 , an image of Georgy today
His face was scarred by blutüberströmtes fear when he ran for his life , while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates .
His image was one of the most shocking images of the barbarity of Beslan .
His mother , Fatima , 54 , a doctor , had dropped him for his first day of school , before she rushed off to get their older son , Vladimir .
`` I left the court for about two minutes before the terrorists stormed it and my little boy stayed there for three terrible days alone , '' she remembers .
Not quite alone , there was a whole family of relatives from us , but all of them were killed .
Only my Georgy managed to survive .
The closer the date comes , the more difficult it is to remember and to talk about it .
There is not a single day that we do not remember this tragedy .
We do not think that it was a long time ago , I think it would have happened yesterday , some scenes from those days have me constantly .
No one will ever forget that , I promise you .
Eindringlich : The image of Georgy ( left ) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized in a statue ( right ) .
I remember that on that day ( so wanted to go to school , and he said he wanted to embrace his teacher .
I only knew that he was alive when I saw him on television .
And now there is even a statue of a weeping born in San Marino .
Georgy sees the image , and it 's hidden at home on the bookshelf .
I understand that , but I also think that the people around the world feel our pain , thanks to this image .
Georgy says today : `` It is important that such a thing can never happen again .
`` I doubt that we will ever know the truth .
People always look at such tragedies and never know the truth .
And now they are examining the crash of the Boeing in Ukraine .
Will we ever know what caused it ?
This world is becoming something awful .
`` I can not understand how this is possible , because if you ask the people , nobody wants a war , so how is this happening ?
Ten years of nothing in such pain .
We need dozens of years to forget it a little bit .
It has attacked my health and I still feel it .
About three or four years I have had a few nightmares because of the siege , but then it was better .
Later , I went back to school in 2004 and was afraid every day .
I thought of my friends and classmates who were killed .
That is why I always go to the gym when the moves closer to 1 September .
I would like to pay my tribute to my old childhood friends .
It is hard for me to go to the gym , but I have to do it .
I am not a victim , this story is now a part of my past .
I will not forget it , but I am not bemitleide .
My life goes on .
I have concluded this year , the school and visit a medical college in Vladikavkaz .
I am going to be a heart surgeon .
My first choice was an education in the army .
I wanted to be a soldier , but my health has not allowed it .
I wanted to fight for my country , but this will not happen .
Georgi Fanijew ,
The boy , who survived , though he was imprisoned at the feet of a murderous terrorists
A miracle : Georgy Fanijew was during the siege at the feet of a murderous terrorist , but he managed to survive .
During the siege , he was caught in the gym and sat next to the bomb , which was mounted at the foot of a murderous terrorist .
It really is a miracle that he was not killed .
`` We feel it , as if it were yesterday , '' Georgy , who wanted to go to the FSB , the intelligence officer says , but this could do for his health damage due to the siege .
It 's still with me , there is nothing that I have left behind me .
I am now older and people say that children can easily cope with bad experiences - I have to say that this is not true .
`` In 2006 I worked with psychologists and I actually felt a little better after that , but I can not forget it .
And I would like to forget .
2005 - a year later - was the first and only time that I went back to the gym .
I lost consciousness .
I will never go back there again and ask me not to show you where I have sat in this famous image .
Survivor : Georgy Fanijew today , with a photo of himself in a hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is enormous and I carry him with me every day .
My friends know that I do not think like them or talk about it and they never asked me after school .
Physically , I feel good .
I should be careful with my injured knee , but now I can run well .
But because of my health , I was unable to study at the FSB secret service academy in St Petersburg , as I wanted to .
I have my documents , including those submitted medical and she responded that it was not possible .
My second passion were the animals , so I went to the veterinary institute .
I have been there two years behind me .
He learns the treatment of all animals `` from cats to cows . ''
He said : `` I knew that I would never tell my children from my experiences .
Children should know nothing about it and they should not suffer it too , of course .
His mother , Marina , 42 , said : `` The pain never leaves me .
He is in my soul , worse when the anniversary approaches .
I will go to the celebrations for the memory .
I know that Georgy will not go .
There needs to be much more violent for him , because he was there , and I do not .
I waited for him at home and could not help .
I am so grateful to God that he has been returned to me , here in Beslan are all drawn from it .
It remains in us .
Georgy is now an adult , but the horror is still in him .
It is difficult to accept that , if something happens to one so Unfaires .
He is a boy , he loves sports , but he could not attend because of his knee .
He was operated on several times , he can run , but no sport .
I would say that he has overcome the horror to 50 % , but you can never completely overcome and forget it .
This terrible experience will haunt us forever .
Many friends and neighbours were killed during the siege , and that only reinforces my pain .
I have lost a lot of people who I knew well and who were dear to me .
My son is with me , and that is the greatest gift that God could use me , but my heart cries for the killing .
I know of families where the children were born , but also by widows who have never married .
It is hard to accept that there is life , even if you do not want that .
I shall never forget how my heart jumped on me when I saw him in the hospital .
And now I , what is going on in the world - wars in other regions .
What are these people ?
Why do they kill each other ?
The war is now very close to our country and I can hardly believe it .
We used to be a friendly country , how can it be that we are fighting now ?
People and children are suffering , I am sure that many children have been killed in Ukraine already , and many are killed .
If we just take all these rebels and could throw - as far away as possible .

While he struggled with the flu-like symptoms , he noted that he made his wife Juliet impatient accusations .
`` I want it all now rather than later , '' he noted .
When Juliet for a week on a business trip , Lawson felt quite unusually , and worried for no reason .
Was something in the air .
He asked a colleague to carry out an X-ray examination of his chest .
Just two weeks ago , he had been skiing in the French Alps .
The result of the X-ray examination before .
He suffered from mesothelioma , an incurable cancer of the breast skin , the lungs via the skin .
As with most cancers , the exact trigger is often difficult to determine .
While some smokers suffering from lung cancer , for example , have not been all lung cancer before smoking .
But mesothelioma is different .
In almost all cases , the underlying cause is an asbestos exposure - contact with the fibrous material , which was once seen as a `` wonder material '' but now recognized as lethal .
For most of us , mesothelioma is a disease that can ignore as easy .
Asbestos is a product of the past .
The most dangerous Asbesttyp has been used in Britain since the 1960s , when the industry committed voluntarily to use them .
Even where he was employed , only people in certain sectors were working directly with the fabric - plumbers , builders , carpenters and shipyard workers , for example .
As an industrial hazardous material from a different time , he now seems to be little concern .
But this complacency is misplaced .
Britain , it seems , is the culmination of a Mesoltheliom-epidemic .
There are more deaths from be mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world .
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year , so many people to this disease than die in road accidents .
The annual numbers of Mesotheliomtodesfälle since 1980 and estimated future deaths in Britain
The reason why we are now witnessing the deadly effects , although asbestos is illegal for years ( all types of asbestos were banned in 1999 ) , is that an be mesothelioma develops only after decades .
And the scourge of be mesothelioma is not limited to former workers of the construction industry .
Asbestos was , and still is , in the houses in which we live , the offices where we work , the schools where we learn and the shops where we shop .
And therefore be mesothelioma knows no class barriers , financial limitations , profession or age .
The privileged bastions of the elegant department stores in London to private schools , are not a protected space .
The Parliament buildings are asbestos contaminated .
Even in the hospitals , in which we are supposed to be healthy , have already been identified as a result of this deadly Karzinogens herd .
Andrew Lawson was not old .
He was not a plumber .
It was difficult for him to imagine where he could possibly have come in contact with asbestos .
Then he found it .
`` It looks as if it was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy 's Hospital , where I completed six years of my education , '' he wrote .
All of them - students , nurses , doctors and doorman - use the tunnels .
One wonders how many of my contemporaries will suffer from the same disease ?
Unfortunately , he was unable to answer that question , at least in part .
`` Of the four doctors who have been trained at Guy 's Hospital '' and that `` in the last five years suffering from mesothelioma , in 2010 , he wrote in a letter , '' I am the last one who still lives. ``
How many of us are still ill ?
Andrew Lawson be mesothelioma at the age of 48 years has been diagnosed .
When he died on 17 February of this year , he was 55 .
It was an unusually long time for survival .
Fifty percent of all Mesotheliomerkrankten die within 8 months after diagnosis .
The disease is always fatal .
We can therefore only repeat Lawson 's question : `` How many of us will fall ill ? ''
The UK 's leading expert on mesothelioma , Professor Julian Peto , assumes that between 1870 and 2050 if the asbestos epidemic is expected to arrive in the UK to a standstill , a total of 90,000 of the disease have fallen victim .
Most of them have no idea at the moment that they are going to die .

A quick look at the files of the courts to which the victims are often due to damages , shows how far the scourge of Mesothelioms is already widespread .
In June of this year , Marks & Spencer , for example , admitted to have exposed asbestos Janice Allen negligent way .
She worked for the chain for nine years , from 1978 to 1987 , and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of the flagship store in Oxford Street .
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old than when she began her work in M & S .
Now she has two children in their twenties .
They `` Before this thing , '' says , `` I had never heard of mesothelioma , I really did n't do anything about asbestos .
I never thought that this would affect me .
There are few people who know a lot about asbestos .
The fact is that the notion of asbestos is not a substance , but a group of six minerals .
The name stems from the word `` Asbestiform '' , a description of the fibre structure , which makes the polymer tough and flexible .
Three of the six were used in the construction industry .
Chrysotile asbestos , also known as white asbestos , is by far the most commonly found asbestos in buildings .
It has been used for roof tiles , floor tiles , pipe insulations , boiler insulation , even for brake pads in cars .
It is less deadly than other forms of asbestos , but nonetheless by the EU and the WHO considered `` high health risk '' with possible fatal outcome .
The more dangerous brown asbestos ( Amosit ) and the blue asbestos ( Krokydolith ) .
Britain was once the world 's largest importer of brown asbestos , and experts suspect that there is a `` clear but indirect evidence that this was a major reason for the uniquely high Mesotheliomraten . ''

Janice Allen has perhaps not seen as a typical Mesotheliomopfer , but the work of Julian Peto suggests that her story is not unusual .
He has presented a study of those concerned , given that a significant proportion of Mesotheliome without known suspension through work or in the home `` was probably caused by asbestos exposure in the environment . ''
A large proportion of these contacts , according to his statement is based on the `` normal use and aging '' of our buildings .
It looks as though no one could expect to be safe .
A report by Goddard Consulting , which studied the palace of Westminster , shows how people could be at the heart of the government , unknowingly have been exposed to the substance .
Goddard in 2009 reported that the service shafts and pipes behind the committee rooms of the House were contaminated with asbestos , the lethal fibers could be created by something as harmless as `` strong air movements . ''
MPs are often accused of having to look after their own interests , but in this case it looks as if the opposite is true .
While the management of the Parliamentary Work Service insisted that the Westminster Palace , a `` clean health certificate '' have received , it is now undisputed that cost £1 billion to be spent over several years , to renovate the Parliament , to modernize the electrical installations and to remove the asbestos , and that after the 2015 general election , the MEPs are more likely in the nearby QE2-conference meetings will be on the green benches at Westminster .
The Goddard report also pointed out that `` the presence of asbestos is not handled in accordance with the relevant provisions . ''
No one can know whether this mismanagement will cost lives .
All we can do now is wait. ``
A person who could never determine the contact with asbestos exactly Graham Abbott , a general practitioner .
As Andrew Lawson suggested the 50-year-old Abbott , who during his work in hospitals was exposed to the asbestos .
`` I worked in a hospital where asbestos lawsuits were decided positively , '' he says , `` but I can not prove it in my case .
It is so difficult to remember all the places where they have worked , and to the data .
What he remembers of the day is still just at the beginning of December 2009 , when he received a kind of Fieber .
He was 45 , and conducted an operation just late in the evening .
Suddenly , I had chills .
It came suddenly .
I felt horrible .
I thought the ride home not to create more .
As a doctor , Abbott knew the pain come from the breast skin , the skin around his lungs .
But , like Janice Allen , he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma .
He was not a month to work .
Doctors made verwunderte x-rays of his chest and anchor Pleurakathether , in order to remove fluid from the lungs and test in the laboratory .
His complaints , however , remained without a diagnosis .
His health stabilized slowly , and he returned to his job .
From time to time , however , the symptoms returned , often after physical activity and heavy breathing .
In 2011 , Abbott 's a patient with similar symptoms in his practice , and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma .
But even now , Abbott combined this with his own case .
After all , his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with asbestos .
The connection was clear in this case .
In September 2011 , Abbotts condition again deteriorated and his doctor brought his CT scans and X-ray pictures to a group of experts .
In December 2011 , exactly two years after Abbott had felt ill for the first time , a probe equipped with a camera was inserted into the cavity between the decor of ribs and chest fur .
I am an optimist .
I am mostly just go , `` he says .
To be honest , I had not even made me so many worries .
But Rachel , my wife was worried .
The result of the biopsy was in the week between Christmas and New Year : `` They told me that it was mesothelioma . ''
Graham Abbott : Mesothelioma diagnosis
Suddenly , Abbott had appointments with Macmillan nurses , one of whom advised him to get a lawyer .
Only now , he realised the extent of the epidemic .
`` It turned out that asbestos was very widespread , '' particularly in large public buildings , where pipes were insulated with asbestos , he said .
The people who were exposed to the asbestos in these buildings are now .
And so now be mesothelioma strikes younger people who have not worked in the traditional professions .
The most dangerous pipes with asbestos insulation layer beneath the earth in hospitals , so patients were more likely to not exposed to the substance .
But many people who ate in pedestrian tunnels changed from one building to another ( such as Andrew Lawson ) or in underground restaurants ( such as Graham Abbott often did ) , most likely to come in contact with toxic substances .
It turns out that the patients for several decades after the war hospitals were potentially lifesaving , but life-threatening for the doctors .
He is still .
Students from their Bunsenbrenner on asbestos mats .
And it is not only hospitals .
Asbestos was due to its fabulous insulating and flame properties often used in offices , shops , libraries and town halls .
Even schools .
In fact , many people have probably had the first contact with asbestos in the classroom .
Across the country , thousands of chemistry lessons , pupils have parked their Bunsenbrenner on asbestos mats .
On the issue of asbestos sites is now often mentioned in schools .
And while innocent objects in our houses , such as floor plates or shingle roofs are included by default as asbestos .
`` It 's an industrial poison that is contained in large parts of our properties , '' Andrew Morgan , said the lawyer , who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial of Guy 's Hospital .
In one case , the only contact , who imagined an affected woman , was the demolition of a Gartenschuppens in the 1970s .
So you , as you continue your garden shed .
The effects of the diagnosis , and the knowledge that the disease is incurable , is immense .
`` It takes a while to process it , Mr Abbott says .
I went back to work and tried to continue , but I realized that I could not concentrate on what I was doing .
Two weeks ago I was in practice .
Then I knew that I go and had to concern myself with myself .
Well , I will not see another Christmas .
The biggest difficulty with the perspective of the position of a doctor to a patient .
Like countless patients before him , he remembers how he was overwhelmed by all the information with which he had to come .
`` It was very difficult to absorb all this , '' he says .
`` I asked my doctor how long I have ? ''
And it gave me about 12 months .
I remember that I thought , `` Oh well , I will not see another Christmas .
That 's `` then . ''
Mesothelioma is particularly insidious because it is our life-support mechanism - breathing itself that caused the deadly cancer is .
Most cases of mesothelioma caused by asbestos exposure .
Asbestos is composed of tiny fibres .
If the asbestos is infamous and resound to the fibers , they can look at the breast skin , the skin around the lungs set around .
Asbestos fibres irritate the breast skin and can cause cell mutations .
`` The problem is with the inhalierten needle-shaped asbestos fibers , '' says Professor Tom Treasure , a heart/thorax doctor who in 2001 to Guy 's Hospital .
The hospital , by Andrew Lawson claimed that it has exposed him to asbestos , ironically , is now a leading centre for the treatment of mesothelioma .
Treasure knew Lawson and treated several others who were also likely to face during their training at the hospital of the asbestos .
Once the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue , Treasure says , `` they are pushed by the breathing process , where the skin is .
By nature , it is invasive from the beginning .
The usual options for other cancers do n't work so well for mesothelioma .
For example , the effectiveness of an operation is hotly contested .
Some say that it is worth a try .
Treasure denies .
`` It is not the breast skin '' cut out , he says .
They do not come around with a knife .
Meanwhile , the cancer is `` not very well to chemotherapy , '' which shows the `` impact , '' but not cure .
`` Sometimes there are long-term survivors , '' says Treasure .
But in the end , they all die .
Fortunately , some patients actually live a long time , much longer than expected .
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis .
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis , Graham Abbott still struggling .
After he had contacted mesothelioma , Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson , who , four years after his diagnosis , a one-man support and consulting office for Mitbetroffene .
`` Hello , cancer center , '' he imagined happily on calls .
`` He was '' very positive , `` Abbott says .
He had received his diagnosis four years earlier and was still very active .
Originally , Abbott had been offered six cycles of chemotherapy , which would last four months and is expected to extend its life by only a month .
`` I was desperate , '' he says .
I wanted to give up .
Lawson , however , managed to make things in a slightly more positive light. ``
Following the advice of several doctors decided Abbott , his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski , cardiac-thoracic specialist at Guy 's .
`` We had an advantage by the fact that I had to be referred , I called and got an appointment , '' admits Graham .
A normal patient would have to receive a referral and wait for the approval of the treatment .
Money is crucial to-be mesothelioma sufferers , the best available therapies to exercise .
But if those treatments fail , eventually , inevitably , many people are of a different financial concern - the future of the families that they left behind .
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation .
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher water House LLP .
`` It 's been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous for the health , '' says Morgan .
But what changed in the 1960s , it was realized that even a very low burden posed a health risk .
And here the negligence of the companies began to play a role .
Andrew Lawson and Guy 's Hospital finally put their case , but it was not what Morgan calls a `` full compensation '' because Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his contact was a mesothelioma asbestos on the guy 's back .
After the investigation into his death , a spokesman for the guy 's , however , confirmed that the asbestos fibres were removed from the basement area in the 1990s. ``
It was too late for Andrew Lawson .
How can be removed asbestos
In fact , it is to-be mesothelioma sufferers who are seeking compensation , a huge problem , the deadly asbestos exposure to a company or a job , usually decades after the incidents .
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed .
Insurance documents can be lost .
And those who oppose claims to know that the time is for them , but certainly not with the prosecutor .
In response , there have been significant new legislation earlier this year that it makes for easier Mesotheliom-victims to claim compensation , even though their former employers are no longer detectable .
The law has established a fund sponsored by the insurance industry by £350 million for those diagnosed after July 2012 , show a contact , but will be able to sue anyone .
In these cases , the plaintiffs will receive 80 percent of what a court in a normal compensation process would appeal to them - about £120,000 .
About 300 successful applications to the program are expected per year .
Andrew Morgan thinks like so many Mesotheliom-affected that £350 million a `` very good job '' of the insurance industry .
`` This is a deal from insurers for insurers , '' he says , and indicates that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have to pay if the time had not gone away and mesothelioma patients-businesses find and normally they could sue .
Even Mike Penning , former work and pensions minister , admitted that the bill was `` not perfect . ''
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that rapid action was given seven deaths a day .
`` The people are suffering so much and need help now , '' said Penning during the second hearing of the mesothelioma Act in December of last year .
At that point , Graham Abbott for 19 months in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski .
After their first meeting Lazdunski Lang-recommended an operation from which he , unlike Tom Treasure expects a positive effect .
This was from a radiation therapy and chemotherapy followed - a triple therapy , with Lang-Lazdunski a survival rate over five years by up to 40 percent can present .
Abbott felt strengthened .
`` This is , of course , the most important thing , Abbott says .
We see that time and time again in patients .
There is something that you can go on .
If you place , you very quickly .
Graham Abbott underwent the surgery in March 2012 .
At the end of August , he was the last of the six cycles of chemotherapy .
After scans showed no sign of the disease .
Then I had a scan in March 2014 .
There were several spots around my breast cancer .
I was 50 .
This is not life-threatening .
This is lebensbeendend .
Again Abbott underwent six cycles of chemotherapy .
Now , no trace of the tumours is more visible .
But the process is physically and mentally very tiring .
You need to think about practical things - about money , when I am no longer , for example , or my wife , show how the boiler time setting .
If you receive bad news , you will be negative .
You have to look forward .
As the father of Ellie , 16 , and Tamsin , 14 , that is not always easy .
`` It is difficult for parents , '' he says .
It is hard to know what to say and how much .
When I received my first diagnosis , I said to my girls that I had a disease with which I would not be old .
They reacted very differently .
Tamsin is very sociable and candies .
They told their friends , and it soon , we got a lot of calls .
Ellie was more restrained .
She said not much .
Such talks are something that all cancer patients have to go through .
But for Mesotheliomerkrankte such talks are not of hope , not a trace of hope of survival .
The disease causes ( such as for Stephen Jay Gould ) , a grim security .
As Andrew Morgan says , `` mesothelioma is not life-threatening .

A health and safety executive in Britain requires all companies that work with asbestos , for licensing .
The import and use of blue and brown asbestos are prohibited by law in the UK .
Any use of asbestos has been banned in the UK .
The Mesotheliom law is adopted in Britain .
A compensation package of £350 million will be announced .
Asbestos is banned in more than 50 countries , white asbestos is still used in many countries of the world as a cheap building materials .

Leonidas asked in the gladiatorial arena
Not just the gladiators were ankle deep in the mud at the first Rhine Bacher Römertag in the amusement park .
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract more than 1,000 visitors yesterday , which caused the rain showers and braved the cold autumn and inspired by the historical spectacle .
There was a colorful series of presentations , performances , games , exhibits and information about the time of the Romans and their importance for the Rhineland .
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the bellicose fighter force of the gladiatorial school `` Amor Mortis , '' which used a rain break to demonstrate in the arena with soft sand prepared their robust martial art .
Gladiators owner `` Leonidas '' turned out to be a humorous and knowledgeable Präsentator and successively sent his men into the ring to the heroic two gladiators fight in different genera .
First , the `` Provocatoren '' in line with original and short sword and leg rail on the left leg and Armschiene on the right arm .
The `` Essedarii '' with breastplate , sword and spear throwing and iron gladiator helmet , leg muscles and Armguard .
The appearance of the `` RETIARIUS '' who stood with casting nets , tridents and daggers against `` SECUTOR '' and after a short struggle , the lad was pushed to the ground .
It expects each metal swords , shields and throwing lances schepperten surrend flew through the arena that could be a fear and worry about the health of the gladiators .
But on the impressive `` summa Rudi 's , '' the muscular referee , an ever-attentive eye .
`` We wanted to revive the Roman daily life and make the culture of the Roman times to life , '' Lorenz Euskirchen , chairman of the organizers `` friends Romans channel '' explained the intention behind the spectacle .
After two years of preparation time a `` Roman '' oppidum , a Roman city was out of the park for a day , as Deputy Mayor Claus Wehage said in his speech .
After all , the Romans brought war and conquest , not only in our region but also the Roman culture and a lot of buildings that we admire today .
The remains were the Römertag to admire about `` aqueduct-marble '' from eleven meters high and 1400 metre long Roman canal bridge , which once stood at Lüftelberg .
The Frontinus company once was the water and energy supply , and now , and managing director Petra Fricke did : `` We still take advantage of the knowledge of that time . ''
It also confirms a graduate surveyor Ralph saint from the `` engineering team two '' from Rheinbach , surveying instruments such as the Romans Chorobat , Groma or Dioptra .
The Roman villa in bare home presented sketches and models of the excavations in 1894 and bricks from the original Hypokauste , hot-air heating , once the Roman villa frying .
Inspiring the footprints , which were left behind by wolf and fox two millennia in the foot steps of sound before burning them .
In 2011 , the office for land preservation in the state Rhineland had exhumed the remains of a Roman villa in the industrial park north of the Rhine river .
It found boundary walls of a commercial building with a Darre for drying grain and Mälzen .
The building was probably belongs to a Villa Rustica , an agricultural commodity , the archaeologist Dr Jennifer Morscheiser explained .
A number of findings from these excavations presented them in a glass cabinet , including a large plate , several fine glass vessels , as well as parts of a dainty necklace .
Villa did not exist from the first to the fourth century A.D. , the Roman invasion of the Germanic tribes in Rhineland , Morscheiser suspects .
When her children were also with the Roman windmills game , similar to the current mill game or they wrote as the Roman students their names with Metallgriffeln on wax tablets .
At the booth of the Roman thermal baths , the children were allowed to place Zülpich mosaics , tinker at the booth of the glass museum Rheinbach glass mosaics and operate at the booth of the Nature Centre Eifel nice homes a serious wheat mill stone around the flour for the flat bread or cereal to grind .
With the two Kaltblütern drawn faithfully reconstructed Roman cars drove the visitors through the park and killing the impressive stand of the Municipal Gymnasium , which are the results of their `` Roman project weeks '' presented .
With a week of Romans from 13 to 21 September , the municipality Wachtberg , too , will contribute to the Rhineland far off Roman 2014 to remember the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago .
Together with the home and local associations , as well as the guards Berger walking club , the club and the amateur game circle Oberbachem will , among other things , thematic tours , lectures , cooking evenings as well as guided tours for school classes and to remember the Roman past guards Steinberg .
A Roman legionnaire , for example , will tell of his work on the windswept Wachtberg , introduced plants as living monuments of the Roman and performed a funny lesson in understanding between a group of guards Berger `` Germanic '' and two Romans .
The Aden Dorfer Elementary School is within the framework of a project of the Roman theme week .
With the Romans the other week , but more often at first sight visible traces of the Romans in Wachtberg are to be made again .
The town hall is a small presentation will recall the discovery of Berkumer Matronenheiligtums in 1879 .

Israeli children are returning after the war in Gaza in their schools back
Thousands of Israeli children from areas in the vicinity of the Gaza Strip returned to the school on Monday , after a summer spent in shelters , while rocket and mortar shelling of their towns during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas went down and schools remained closed in Gaza , while the area recovered by the fighting .
The school brought the start of rocket firing holes no battered communities in southern Israel , a feeling of joy and expectation , but the signs of the battles are still fresh .
In the southern city of Ashdod employees `` Pashosh '' -Kindergartens , who was hit by a rocket away , before the arrival of the students shrapnel shards from the walls and glass walls .
`` We have a bit of anxiety , but are excited , '' Ronit beard , someone who lives on in the Kibbutz Saad and the English teacher said .
Many children from our region urgently need a return to a routine .
Their 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it felt `` a little strange '' to suddenly to go back to school .
`` These were difficult times , and we are not going out of the house , '' she said .
Johns Hopkins President Rivlin visited the caves near the border with Gaza to offer his support .
Until a cease-fire in the war last week , thousands of residents of border communities such as Saad in their homes or left their homes to move into safer areas further away from Gaza and the rocket and mortar fire .
Many residents of : Oz , a village near the border with Gaza , in which a 4-year-old boy killed by a Palestinian mortar grenade was still hesitate to return .
The Ministry of Education , about a dozen families have still not returned .
Their children were temporarily housed in other schools .
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot , a border town with Gaza , which has drawn heavily from the Palestinian fire .
He urged the children to learn a lot and said `` we will make sure that your knowledge erwerbt and offer you security . ''
Israel and Hamas agreed last Tuesday to an open-ended `` cease-fire .
The ceasefire provided for an immediate end to the fighting , but important issues remain unresolved , including Hamas 's demand for a lifting of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of air and sea ports in Gaza .
Israel calls for the disarming of Hamas and the handover of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting .
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin later this month in Egypt .
The war killed more than 2,100 Palestinians , three-quarters of them civilians , and at least 494 children according to estimates by the Palestinians and the UN .
Israel disputes these figures and estimates that there are at least half of those killed by militants , but this presented no concrete evidence for information .
On the Israeli side , 66 soldiers and six civilians , including a Thai worker were killed .
Hamas and other militants in Gaza fired rockets and mortar shells from 4.591 during the fighting on Israeli towns , most in the south of the country .
Meanwhile , the Israeli military conducted more than 5,000 air and other attacks .
The Israeli attacks that damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza area and about 250,000 people were looking into more than 100 UN schools , which have been converted into temporary shelters .
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the shelters and continue the fighting , the education authorities last week postponed the beginning of the school year .
`` I hope that the school will be open again soon , so that we can continue to learn , just like the children in the world and the Jewish children , '' said Mohammad Amara , a 13-year-old boy , who is currently in a school in Gaza City .

Feminists criticise race and police behavior in Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed earlier this month by a police officer in Ferguson , Mon .
The participants raised their hands high in the air and chanting `` hands up , do n't shoot '' while they waited for the funeral .
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson , Mo. , over the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown the Bloggerin Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists .
After her experience , white feminist commentators put the sex before the race when it comes to reproductive rights and income inequality .
While the tensions , however , rose in the Midwest and throughout the country have received attention , Perez saw the responses of white women focused 100 % on the race .
Compared with the responses of black women shortly after the shots on 9 August , the personal essays with titles like `` thoughts on Ferguson came from a white woman '' and `` feminism is not just about the oppression of women '' relatively late .
But for Perez that meant an important change .
`` I do not think that you will find many people in feminism , '' the white and speak about his privileges in such a high-class type , she said .
People felt forced to say something about the incidents .
It is characteristic of the crisis in which we find ourselves , and because the situation in Ferguson is ethnisiert so that they have to express that .
For English professor Koritha Mitchell from the Ohio State University , Ferguson brought to light problems that black Americans are exposed to every day , but which are not considered `` women 's issues '' in the cultural space .
`` I can make something funny on Facebook about me and my partner and I get '' 150 Likes from anywhere , `` Mitchell said .
If I post something about how people of color are under siege in their own country , the silence is deafening .
`` How can it be safe for women to talk openly about a relationship , but not about safety in the public space ? '' She asked .
For black women , like Mitchell , race , gender and sexuality studies in the history of the United States , there is no dichotomy between race and gender issues .
For them , black women have not had the luxury to separate the issues of clean ; they live every day in the combined reality .
While white women now connect the issues of race and gender in the mainstream feminist circles , Angela Hattery , professor of women and gender studies at the George Mason University says that its predecessors did the opposite .
`` Between 1865 and 1890 , at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the explanatory statement was almost always '' the rape of a white woman , Hattery said .
White women had to be involved in the story to justify the murder of Lynch .
For Hattery was the split between white and black women to the point where white fighters for women 's suffrage , such as Susan B. Anthony for the country in the late years of the 19th century , analyzed and stated that the battle could be the right to vote only for one group : Women or blacks .
`` They made the decision to fight for women 's suffrage and the right to vote '' for blacks should come later , Hattery said .
When one remembers such things , one with power , why not trust white women , colored women .
We have not done our job well .
We have never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons .
Even after women were given the right to vote in 1920 , it took a decade until white women against Lynchen in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching organized themselves .
The group was established almost 40 years after the initial request for assistance from black women , Mitchell says .
For Mitchell , the flood of white feminist responses to the issues raised by Ferguson - police behavior , racial discrimination - a mirror of the age in which white feminists `` trapping '' played with the problems facing black women is set apart for generations .
`` Would it not be great if the activists , who include such traditional feminist platforms do a child 's right to education as seriously as they do with the right of conception control Mitchell asked ? . ''
The second generation feminists , who built their career on the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives , are now trying to understand what this means .
The famous white feminist activist Gloria Steinem came two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown on Facebook and published a pithy article by Rebecca Carroll , distribution of the Guardian , in which she calls for more protests by white Americans on the subject of racism .
`` I hope that women who have a different but parallel reason to understand the danger inherent in the body - and opinions on race that are significantly different in public opinion polls - will make the changes , '' Steinem wrote .
Although Steinem represents a more intersectional feminism , in which race and gender issues , are some of their comments on the racial issue in America , amazed .
Christina Summers , a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of `` Who stole Feminism ? '' To She The People said that young men are in the United States , especially young colored men , `` far more vulnerable than their sisters '' but Steinems comments about Ferguson are contrary to their earlier criticism .
There are now hundreds of specialized programs for girls and young women , but almost nothing for boys .
But when the White House is a small program , My Brother 's Keeper , worked to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men recently , there were irritating reactions from many feminists including Gloria Steinem .
The ratio of police to the black community is not the only problem that is at the forefront of mainstream feminism .
After the U.S. border police nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the south-western border of the country has taken up this year , the issue of immigration reform to the surface again - this time as a women 's issue .
Andrea Mercado , co-chairwoman of We Belong Together , an organization that mobilized women for immigration reform , said that for a reconsideration of the issue as an important women 's issue , they only publish the stories of immigrant women .
`` They speak for themselves , '' Mercado said .
If the vast majority of work visas go to male immigrants , women who accompany them , are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation .
`` These stories will find a reverberation in the women 's organisations , '' she said .

For the good cause .
The small muscle soreness , he can easily wegstecken there , given that the participation in the 8th chimneys have brought him to the Great Feldberg in favour of the association `` help for children with cancer '' ( Frankfurt ) personally a valuable insight .
A great thing .

As Thomas Studanski for the CDU city parliament sits in many of the 718 participants Oberurseler tortured , yesterday in the mountains and near Frühtau came to the exhaustion , but happy on the plateau .
Others , however , it became easier to overcome the best eleven kilometres long route between high mark and Feldberg .
For example , Norman Dießner .
The whole red or Green politician from the local authority - red dress , red bike - did something at the start of understatement ( `` Any amount of professionals , because the goal is arriving ! `` ) , but then turned on the mountain but as a semi-professional and went after 45 minutes without breathing .
It is also through the route in one go , like Nina Kuhn , press spokeswoman for the town of Oberursel , together with Frank green iron .
For the two triathletes was the `` Feldberg-cycling '' is not necessarily a sporting challenge : `` This is about charity , because we are happy with it - an exit anyway , we would have done today , '' said Kuhn .

He was with his 6.5-kilogram-racing 40 minutes setting .
A crazy event .
For this purpose , I am happy `` , Andreas Balzke said .
The muscular Mainzer says that he is an `` ambitious racing cyclists . ''
That must be it , because he was with the `` Fixie '' bikes , which are also racing bikes , but without the circuit ...
It was that even without a wheel loose upwards , not just the 20 hikers who climbed over the White Wall and the Fox dancing up to the summit , but also a Jogger , herzog on a cord of a car tyre with weights behind him showed .
Mountain Rescue-doctor Professor Volker Lischke , who , with his team , equipped with all-wheel-drive Bully and Quad , for security , said : `` '' I kenn from Frankfurt , who trains for a special sled trail , only that he prefers the sleigh containing himself . `` The man is , in a sense , his own sled dog .
The 718 participants - and hence so many were like never before - have been sent in groups in the morning on the track .
First the hikers at 9.30 a.m .
It followed the first cyclists and runners at 10 o'clock .
Five minutes later , the first mountain bikers off .
Bent Hansen , Chairman of the Association `` cycling on the Great Feldberg '' gave the starting squads and wished the participants a beautiful trip .
For next year , he hopes that it will be possible to block the route to the field up to the safety of the participants .

Amazon buys Twitch for $ 1.04 billion
Amazon has just confirmed that information was reported on Monday morning : The online retailer - and video producer , and a multitude of other things - buys the video streaming service for $ 1.04 billion Twitch ( US $ 970 million ) .
The announcement comes as a surprise , not because no one had expected a takeover of Twitch , but because it was widely assumed that the company would buy YouTube .
Three months ago , it looked as if the sale of Twitch on Google 's video service is determined for a cool billion , and cooperation , of course , also appeared .
Twitch , which only three years ago as Justin.tv , was started as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube .
Instead , it was rapidly becoming a platform for players who wanted their bravura pieces published in games , a `` YouTube for live games , '' says an insider .
The Twitch interface .
And `` let 's play , '' a genre in which the ( mainly ) older-better games give a veneer of science , are already very popular on YouTube .
It is simply the case that YouTube is often referred to , if you want to describe Twitch , included the news that YouTube wanted to buy Twitch , a bit bored , a textbook example of an established technology company that buys a potential competitor .
It is a mystery why the deal did not materialise with YouTube , since the company was reportedly willing to pay as much as Amazon .
Everything we know about it at the moment , this statement by Emmet Shear , president of Twitch : `` We opted for Amazon , because they believe in our community , they share our values and long-term vision , and they want to help us to go faster . ''
Another secret is , frankly , the incredible success of Twitch .
For snobs like me who declare that they would rather drive than watching sport , it is hard to understand the attraction that assumes to watch others playing rather than even the control console .
It is one thing to see a friend at 3 a.m. on the shoulder while she sneaks through Resident Evil , and quite another to watch a nutcase , he was shot 20 times in a row in Call of Duty in the head .
All of these games you could see now .
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games , can watch without their own control over the prospect of facing a really good recipe for headaches .
I admit that the fast runs , the Roger Bannisters undergo in our electronic age whole games in record time , entertaining .
But unless a game or humour virtuoso , is his Twitch-channel probably not so very interesting .
But what sceptics like me already know about ?
Twitch called from 55 million different visitors a month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic .
And how exactly Amazon wants to make money from it ?
It is hard to imagine that Twitch is integrated so elegantly in Amazon Instant Video , YouTube Twitch can easily swallow .
But has Twitch something any company would like : Thousands of young men , who are being courted by advertisers .
As the chairman of Twitch , Shear said , Amazon and Twitch `` both believe in the future of gaming '' and the media shows no signs of contraction , or even - Schluck - as a spectator sport .

Genetic disorder often diagnosed wrong

Rodgers said that they saw at the age of 13 years after several operations to relieve their Achilles se and stretching their legs , their medical records , when her doctor had left the room and read that she suffered from FA .
`` I felt guilty because I was curious , so I 've told anyone this , but I went home , looked after the illness in the library and wrote to the FA 's company , '' she said .
When I received a reply , I was shocked and terribly ran in panic .
I thought that I would be in a wheelchair , with 18 and 25 , and in the meantime would slowly lose all my skills .
I did it all alone with me and planned my own funeral .
She said when she was 17 , it was clear that their skills had not been as strong as they had imagined and consulted her doctor .
He got up and hugged me and said , `` my love , I do not think that you have it , otherwise you 're now in a wheelchair . ''
I think you 've something far less life-threatening .
After a number of genetic tests on her CMT has been identified .
`` When he told me what it was CMT I felt like when I was a winner , '' she said .
UK Charity CMT has a CMT Awareness month started to draw attention to this disease .

Persistent concerns from the CDU against the car toll have increasingly forth the CSU .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel after sustained resistance from her CDU makes a word for the introduction of a car toll .

Merkel stressed that Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble ( CDU ) rise to constructively in the deliberations on a bill .
He also talked over the issue with Dobrindt also about further ways to enable more private capital for investment in infrastructure , such as broadband .
`` There is nothing special about '' Schäuble said on Sunday a `` mirror '' -Bericht unkommentiert left his house to verify its own approach to motorway to reward investors with toll revenues - after the election in 2017 .

Why `` Guardians of the Galaxy '' was a blockbuster
`` The Expendables 3 '' by Sylvester Stallone played a less than 30 million dollars of his $ 90 million budget in the United States , while `` Sin City : A Dame to Kill For '' recorded only 12 million dollars in its budget of 70 million dollars .
Cameron Diaz in the movie `` Sex Tape '' tailored , played on an opening weekend just 14.6 million dollars , children 's films such as `` Dragon 2 '' made slightly tame while also disappointed on revenue .
An article by the Telegraph 's film critic Robbie Collin indicates that the children 's films , the lack of quality in the films themselves may be the reason .
Collin described 2014 as `` the worst year '' for children 's films so far and described `` Dragon 2 '' tame easily made as purely `` functional '' fantasy sequel .
In movies there for a slightly older audience , however , it seems as if the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem .
In July , Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore- and Meta Critic rating for every summer movie release , between the American Memorial Day and July 20 , 2013 , and in the current year to at least 2,000 screens .
The results are based on the opinions of film-goers and film critics and indicate that this year 's movie hits are equivalent to those of last year .
Some commentators argue that the trend to changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of Web-streaming services such as Netflix .
Director Jon Favreau , who is currently appearing in Disney 's Jungle Book film soon , works on the website Hollywood Reporter , said : `` I think the times are changing . ''
We have to accept that and not try to chase after the past .
In contrast to the currently weak box-office results of the Hollywood productions recently reached Netflix Streaming content with sales of $ 1.2 billion , almost twice as much as last year , in which the turnover stood at 837 million dollars .
Last summer , the director Steven Spielberg criticized the movie studios that they concentrated too much on series of comics and predicted a `` meltdown '' of Hollywood .
Seen in the light of the current downturn , some commentators argue that his grim prophecy could well contain a true core .
In the summer of 2015 , due to the expected potential blockbuster , including disorder : Age of Ultron , Minions and Jurassic World , other representatives of the film industry , however , are more optimistic .
The producer of X-Men , Simon Kinberg , described the decline in box office results recently simply as `` cyclical '' and told the Hollywood Reporter : `` The next summer will be the biggest summer ever at the cinema box office , and no one will worry more about the business . ''

Under this view Ruh prevails

Vital is the natural monument , it extends over the other trees in the area and remembers with a circumference of more than eight meters to an American sequoia .
A small Buddha on a tree stump suggests that there is a spiritual or mystical place .
But despite intensive research , there were only hints of the name of origin .
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider asked the extra Bischofsheimer archive consulted and elderly people from among white , to learn what it did with the Geißruheiche Bewandtnis .
The result of his research was the rather sober explanation for the name .
So the goat herders are up about 80 years ago drove their animals under white straight from the laboriously cleared of stones and liberated meadows .
At the foot of the tree , the exhausted animal keepers from the rise should have rested .
In the meantime , the area has won back its significance , because goats graze in the meadows , in fact .
The area has also been declared to the core zone of the Biosphere Reserve , Schneider has found .
Upon entering the stone collections , one should be careful , however , because the sun heated basalt for Cross otters is a popular haunt .
A hiking trail leads from under white straight to the tree , which is somewhat hidden .
Other routes are signposted to climb the high mountains and invite to a long hike .
Where is the water castle ?

4 tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you want to take photos or videos under water , there is a range of devices .
The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot , like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action-Cam as the GoPro Hero3 + Silver Edition , both for about $ 300 .
I took these photos in a family party with several cameras , all of which are available at a price of less than $ 350 .
Regardless of the equipment , there are a few rules for the best results .
Check your equipment twice .
Even if you have a waterproof camera , make sure the battery compartment and other subjects are tightly closed .
Put your camera on the photos or videos that you want to include .
Some cameras and camcorders feature scenes and recording modes by which the exposure time is optimized for dämmrigen underwater conditions .
And before you jump into it , you check your equipment is operational in the depth .
Some cameras are permitted only for up to 5 feet , others up to 50 or 60 feet .
Search in our shopping guides and reviews of digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models .
Make multiple shots - because many of them will not work .
Point-and-shoot cameras are equipped with an LCD , with which you can compose images , not usually action-cams .
Even if you have an LCD , it is difficult to see under water , and the right image is a matter of luck .
So you are making a lot of shots .
If your camera has a series mode , with a series of shots with different exposure settings are made , you use it .
Stay close to the surface .
The light is dramatically worse , the further you move away from the surface .
If possible , you remain close to the surface , if you make shots in a pool , a lake or the sea .
As a result , you can also get more colour into your photos ; the deeper you go , the less you 'll see color .
Go to the objects .
This is also a good advice on land , but underwater , it is even more important because of the poor lighting conditions .
It is particularly important when you work with an action-cam : These devices often have a fixed wide-angle lens , which means that you have to get closer to their homes , if they are to complete the whole picture frame .

Perry of Texas says that derogatory tweet was not authorized
A tweet from the official account of the Republican governor of Texas , Rick Perry , on Sunday included a disparaging remark about Democratic county prosecutor , which is at the heart of a criminal charge against him for misuse of authority .
The tweet was later deleted and replaced with another of Perry 's account of the previous abstritt .
Just a tweet was sent from my account , which was not authorised by me .
`` I do not approve of the tweet and have deleted '' for him , it was said in the message .
Employees of Perry did not immediately responded to requests for comment .
Although the tweets of Perry 's official account , it was not clear who actually uses the feed .
In an earlier tweet an unfavourable image of the district prosecutor of Travis County , Rosemary Clay , who was sentenced in April 2013 due to drink-driving .
Perry vetoed the funding of her office when she refused to step down , which could result in a charge against Perry - the potential 2016 presidential candidate - before a grand jury this month in Austin .
The text of the tweets reads : `` I 'm not always drunk with the triple allowable alcohol ... but when I do I accuse , Governor Perry , if he ausplaudert it . ''
I am the betrunkenste Democrat in Texas .
Clay 's office was not entrusted with the leadership of the investigation of the grand jury against Perry .
This was led by Michael McCrum , the special prosecutor from San Antonio , who was selected by a Republican judge .
Perry pleads not guilty to and called the indictment a political ploy .
Its outstanding team of legal assistance requested by the judge entrusted with the case , rejecting the charges and argued that the law , which for the longest-serving governor in the history of the state of Texas , is vague in its wording .
Perry stopped $ 7.5 million in state funds to the state 's Public Integrity Unit , which is based in Travis County and in cases of public corruption in Texas - identified as a clay hill refused to resign .
This veto of a public complaint from a left-wing watchdog group .
Perry 's official account is updated frequently - and sometimes famous .
After the rallies in Iowa during his presidential candidacy had finished in fifth place in 2012 , Perry referred to speculation that he will stop when he posted a tweet of a photo of himself jogging near a lake , with the words `` South Carolina , we are coming ! ''

Berkeley says housing market for `` normal ''
One of the most prominent developers of London pointed out that the housing market in the south-east of England has returned back to normal levels. ``
Homes in the capital , hotly sought-after and subject to huge price increases , which prompted the Bank of England because of the widespread fear of a credit bubble were intended to put limits on mortgage loans in June .
Tony Pidgley , founder and CEO of first-class investment company Berkeley on Monday , said : `` Since the beginning of the current financial year , the market is back to normal levels of transaction since the 2013 peak back '' and added that it offers a `` stable operating environment . ''
The housing market in London was well established during the downturn , as foreign buyers piled into the capital .
According to information from the cadastral office prices in the city have increased in the past year alone by 18.5 percent , far more than the average rise in England and Wales as a whole .
The average selling price for private Berkeleys , cheap and student services rose by about a fifth last year and were at the end of April to £423.000 .
However , a stronger pound has made in recent months in London property less attractive to foreign buyers - some of them have also been deterred by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric about a possible `` tax '' before the general election next May .
The London estate agent Foxtons warned last week that the mortgage market report presented in April , where stricter lending rules would also in the second half of the year to lower market growth in both property sales and prices .
New data from the Bank of England on Monday show a decline in mortgage approval in July , which also points out that the real estate market cools .
Hamptions International , another real estate agency , revised its forecast for the increase in property prices in London for 2015 , down to 3 percent , on the basis of an already-weakening house price consciousness .
The transaction volume in the most expensive areas of London , such as Chelsea , Mayfair and Kensington , meanwhile fell by a quarter year on year , the real estate agent WA Ellis .
However , the desire for a home in the capital city of Berkeley is a blessing , since the sums due to forward sales amounting to more than £2.2 billion .
Mr Pidgley added : `` The demand for a proper , well-planned product remained stable in the best locations and as a result the futures sales have remained stable . ''
In June , the company reported that it had sold 3.742 new homes in the year to the end of April - almost a third more than the pre-crisis peak in 2007 .
The annual pre-tax profit rose by 40 per cent annually to £280 million , sales by 18 % to £1.6 billion .
On Monday , in a statement before the annual meeting of the company Mr Pidgley said that revenues in the current year for Berkeley would be expected to match the current market expectations .
Many of the analysts estimate the annual pre-tax earnings to £450 million .
Berkeley shares were trading in the afternoon at the London firm at £23,96 .

Lenny Henry : My father never took me by the arm .
Has never said `` I love you ''
Henry was one of seven children of a family jamaikanischer immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958 .
His father , who died when Henry , 19 , worked in a factory , and their relationship was limited .
Henry is rehearsing for a comedy that 's Rudy 's Rare Records , which is based partly on an imaginary conversation with his father , and from the series on Radio 4 .
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap , with lively melodies .
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments .
He visited `` many '' therapies after the death of his mother , and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father .
It was hard to know him .
We never saw his face , hear his voice : `` Hearing on the crash .
Keep your sister in peace .
Beweg you !
I want to watch cricket .
My older brothers , Seymour and Hilton - who were already grown up when I was a child , went to the pub with him and talked about things such as the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of cricket .
I never had such a conversation with him .
A large part of my life , he was a serious guy in the corner , reading the newspaper .
Recently , Henry opened a foundry in Dudley , and even though the conditions are better than at the time of his father , he won , but an insight into how life may have been for him .
It is a little brighter now , but they are dark , quite smoky , deep stygische maze with flames and smoke and a lot of soot .
My father was always in the tub and then you could hear him slowly , as he began to sing , because he was able to wash the foundry .
When I went there , it was clear to me that he had done this for many years to get the food on the table , and my respect for him has been greater .
However , Henry grew up as a child without his parents `` love .
My father never hugged me , he never said `` I love you . ''
Only when it came to my mother at the end of her life , we started badly , `` I love you , I love you , I love you '' to say .
By his own daughter Billie , with Dawn French , he could share the love that he had missed as a child .
But with the `` I love you '' stop ?
But on hearing to embrace me !
Papa , I 'm 22 !
With Dawn French .
Why should we not be friends ?
She is a great mother .
It is still a French friend , with whom he had been married for 25 years .
Dawn is a good man .
Why should we not be friends ?
She is a great mother .
Henry 's own mother was diabetic .
That contributed to her death .
So when I became very , very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes , my doctor said , `` You need to be radical .
So I got this fitness thing and also had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms .
It is very difficult .
And it is tiring .
No one likes to eat carrots .
Henry 's career change is reflected in his elegant , short-trimmed beard .
Since he was praised by the critics for his Othello , he is captured by the theatre .
It 's the comedy of errors , and then fences by August Wilson .
This is a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that have filled his busy work life .
He started with only 16 years ago , when he worked in a factory .
A DJ discovered him on stage when he wrote to imitierte and New Faces on him .
His television career began in the mid-1970s . `` I was for a very long time , the only black impersonator/comedian on TV . ''
He learned in the profession .
I was not only in the eyes of the public at large , but also learn from 1975 to 1985 , as I tell jokes and an efficient machine , while I was a television star , and that was really difficult .
Lenny New Faces in 1975 ,
As his manager , the stage right at the Black and White Minstrel Show , had a light entertainment program in which people `` '' anmalten Black , Henry on his comedy about five years .
In my family it was very unpleasant .
Somehow , I wish that it had never happened , but I do not regret that I did it .
It was a strange , awkward position for me , but I worked on big projects and learned how to deal with a large audience .
But this `` years of award-winning light pillar of British television '' was also a `` grotesque parody of black people . ''
The introduction of characters that the British black culture both celebrated and scorned , , Henry worked in the 1980s for an alternative comedy circuit .
The first series of the Lenny Henry Show went on air in 1984 , and in the 1990s , he was known among other things as the chef Gareth Black Lock in the comedy series boss ! .
Commercials , documentaries , TV series and film roles were his next decade , but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv 2008 he thought : `` What are you doing next , Len because everything feels when you 're just about the time or play a little on the spot . ''
Then , a documentary series for Radio 4 , entitled What 's So Great About ... ?
The first episode revolved around Shakespeare .
On Shakespeare , I was allergic .
I had never really learned in school about it , and it kept him mostly for the domain of the middle class , whites in tights and a cabbage .
So I had a great fear .
All those we interviewed for the show , Peter Hall , Trevor Nunn , Adrian Lester , Judi Dench said `` you should try it .
It was not a bad thing , if you do not know what are you talking about .
Nimm a few of the words in his mouth , and then you 'll understand why we all love Shakespeare .
Henry led 20 lines from Othellos last speech for the documentary , and he was thrilled .
I had the feeling that I could do it .
It was almost as if someone had my head finally right .
`` That is the issue , it is a serious thing , take it seriously , learning your text recherchiere a bit .
The samples were brutal , and I read this piece for months before we made it .
And it was a success .
They seemed to expect a car accident , and this simply not happened .
And soon he appeared in the comedy of errors .
Suddenly , I was at the National Theatre , and I could hardly believe it .
There was a moment when I thought , `` Oh , you 've changed you . '' ``
There was a technical error , and Henry instinctively felt that he had to entertain the audience .
`` A little voice said to me '' you must now bridge 10 minutes while they repair the computer. `` ''
Instead , the stage director , announced that the show would go on , once the problem is resolved .
I went from the stage and something in me said , `` Oh , thank God . ''
I am not responsible for this .
I can leave it to someone else .
`` You play in a play , i.e . blowing in your role . ''
Henry in fences at the Duchess Theatre
To learn the text for fences was demanding .
Panic is very good , which strengthens the tendons .
That was good , so it 's like a big sign of the gods who tell me `` This is your purpose here . '' ``
He says that , of course , with a thundering voice .
So I stay here .
I really love it .
I love to be in a rehearsal room .
But Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation of humorous outbursts , while he imitates people again .
I have decided to stand-up comedy , because I think that this kind of instant gratification in a room full of strangers is somehow dangerous .
If you are looking for that constantly , so you go in front of a wall .
I am sometimes live at the Apollo when I have fun , but overall , there is not as much as before .
I ask him if he ever returned to a stand-up comedy tour .
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps a beginning to form a middle section and the end of a journey - I do not believe that I would ever lose again .
So this is his new incarnation here ?
I think .
I am quite an actor .
It 's fun .
It always tells a story , and that is great .
I love stories .
People love stories .

Manufacturing in the eurozone at a 13-month-low
The increase in production in the euro zone slowed in August to the lowest point in the last 13 months , a closely watched survey .
The final Markit purchasing managers index ( PMI ) for the manufacturing sector fell to 50,7 in August , after a stand of 51.8 in July .
A number above 50 indicates an expansion .
New orders fell and factory experienced declines in a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine .
The numbers arrive before the meeting of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) on Thursday .
The markets expect the bank a clear plan for dealing with a hesitant recovery in the eurozone and the threat of deflation with an inflation rate of only 0.3 % .
There is speculation that the head of the ECB , Mario Draghi , could make further information during the course of this week , if he pulls a quantitative easing in the eurozone , according to those who were from Britain and the United States during the financial crisis .
`` Although a small growth is better than no growth , the deterrent effect of the growing economic and geopolitical uncertainties have become clearer for the manufacturers , '' Rob Dobson , senior economist at Markit , said .
The factory-PMI for Germany , the largest trading partner of Russia within the EU , fell to the lowest level in 11 months with 51.4 .
In the meantime , the bloc and France , the PMI fell to the second-largest economy on 46,9 .
France remains a concern , as well as the descent of Italy by a solid expansion to stagnation .
Evidence that growth incentives in key industrial mechanism , Germany as well as in Spain and the Netherlands are no longer are not reassuring , `` said Mr Dobson .
The decline of the industry probably feeds the fire of the analysts , who expect further monetary or fiscal stimulus .
The positive news came from the Republic of Ireland , where the PMI rose to 57.3 , its highest level since the end of 1999 .
Howard Archer , chief economist at IHS Global Insight , said : `` The best that can be said for the purchasing managers index of manufacturing in the euro zone in August , is that the sector will continue to grow after that . ''
He added : `` In the euro area producers will find life very difficult at the moment , obviously , since the current heightened geopolitical tensions increase - particularly in relation to Russia and Ukraine - uncertainty over the continuing difficult conditions in many countries .
This increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular , and consumer confidence , and will probably mean that some jobs will be delayed or even cancelled , particularly large-scale orders .
He said that it was `` increasingly likely '' that the ECB will eventually have to take a kind of QE , `` although we suspect that this will be limited . ''

Megan Dunn , vice president of the NUS for higher education , said : `` this offer seems completely separated from the lives of the majority of students .
Many students who begin this month with the study , face a cost of living crisis , because the available financial aid in the form of loans and grants with soaring bills for the simplest of livelihoods , before they are even thinking of spending thousands of pounds for something as simple as the arrival of a hostel .

The Höllenjahrzehnt of survivors of Beslan : ten years have passed since the horrific siege of the school , as the tide of children still suffer .
Ten years ago , were taken hostage more than 1000 people from Chechen militants at a school in Beslan in southern Russia .
More than 330 people , more than half of them children , were killed in the three-day ordeal that shocked the world .
We have returned to Beslan to find some of the victims , who were unaware of the death of bestiality in the classroom .
Exactly a decade after the horrific siege of the school in Beslan , in which 334 people were killed , including 186 children , warned the heroic survivors last night before a new apocalypse in Ukraine .
As a fanatical Islamist terrorists , children and parents on 1 September 2004 , the start of a new school year , captured and killed , it seemed like the Böseste of evil .
The tragedy united the West and East in disgust , and then turned surprisingly in action and hope for the future in the middle of the worst misery .
Ten years later we have returned to Beslan to find some of the victims , who were unaware of the death of bestiality in the classroom .
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance , although the memory of these terrorist hell will haunt them forever .
Their best hope ?
The war , the Ukraine is now - and the children as they die - now comes to an end .
The girl who was shot in the attempt , in the zerschossene school sports hall zurückzuklettern
She was photographed by the Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakow and famous when she was only in her underwear tried in the zerschossene school sports hall zurückzuklettern after a mine exploded .
Totally confused Aida was looking after her mother Larissa , now 40 years old .
Both were left for dead , but they survived .
`` One woman told me that I should run for my life , but I could not , '' Aida said .
My legs were overrun .
I stood up and climbed back in again to look for my mother .
A soldier brought them to safety .
After a series of operations , she was completely healed , but yesterday said : `` three months ago , the pain returned .
I am afraid that I must be performed again .
Some Granatsplitter are still in my knee .
Their goal is now to become a dentist to help people , as it has been helped by doctors .
`` This tragedy changed my life , but I was not broken , '' says tear .
`` That is what happened to me , and it is not going to change .
Once a year , I am always in the gym , to remember those who have stayed there .
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days .
The pain is too great .
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there .
We played together when we were small , and dreamed of going to school together .
`` I do not want to marry until I finish my studies and started my career .
To have a family , I am thinking later .
She says that the siege will always remain a part of it , although the memory of every year is a bit weak .
I am glad that many people around the world to remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in Britain and everywhere .
When I see online the photo of me , as I see in the school zurückklettere , I think that many people , it is the first time to understand our disaster and help ensure that this does not happen again .
The boy , who fled the bullets , believing that his mother was dead
It was his first day of school ( Russians go to the school ) for 7 years and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother , Tamara .
As a seven-year-old , he said , `` mama told me that I should lie down , if there was an explosion , and hold their hand . ''
After an explosion , he thought she would die .
She said to him : `` run . ''
Full of fear , she could be dead , he fled and was on the way a toddler wines , it took in the hand and fled through a hail of bullets .
His father , Vladimir , his son outside in the arms , said , `` Damir told me that his mother had died .
He said : `` I could not save them . ''
In fact , was Tamara stumbled outside and with leg injuries in the hospital , in the belief that her son died .
After its reunification , she said : `` I wept with joy .
I could not believe it .
He ran in and hugged me .
Damir was later flown to London ( from the now disbanded newspaper News of the World ) to get the title of Barnardo 's , Children 's Champion by the then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife , Cherie .
`` This horror you every day , but I wish I could stop with the memory , '' he said yesterday .
But I can say that it is in my memory .
I remember that I am directly after all my toy guns wegwarf .
But now I can play computer games with shot scenes , and that is no problem for me .
`` I am not afraid to go back into the gym , but I do not think about myself .
I remember these children , with whom I have played in the yard , and they have not managed to get out .
We never say that they were killed or are dead .
We are saying that they remained in the sports hall .
I remember very well my trip to London , particularly in the toy shop , where I could choose what I wanted , and the ride in an open car .
But now he has suffered anxiety to place such as Ukraine , where wars cause the kind of accident that he and his friends .
You followed this horror every day , but I wish I could stop reminding me .
`` I am so sorry for all those who suffer the atrocities , '' said Damir , who last week worked as a volunteer in a monastery .
I am so happy to help .
One day I will go to the police and hope that they will take me next year at the training academy .
His mother , Tamara , 48 , said : `` 37 children from our neighbourhood were killed , can you imagine that ?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege , there were simply no children , and run around , and the silence lasted for many months .
She can still vividly recall their trip to London with Damir .
The people of London , when I told our story .
At the time , I understood how people understand our feelings on the other side of the world , and to show their support .
It was Cherie Blair and her foundation grateful for the price and the ability to travel to London in the autumn of 2004 .
I wish I could ring Cherie and simply say that 10 years have passed , but I still remember the meeting me , her and her husband in London , and how the Damir and helped me .
I remember when Damir wanted to eat borscht and phoning them all of the local Russian restaurants .
I remember when he played with waiters in a restaurant , Damir shot with his water gun on her and she ran away and played with him .
And that was just a month after the horror .
I was surprised that the British are so willing to share our pain and supported us .
She said : `` I always think that the world has not improved in those 10 years .
In Ukraine , there is a war now , and every day people are dying , and I believe that many children have been killed and still be killed .
These are precisely such as our children .
I think that for many of the war , some of the messages they hear when they are bored or busy with something else .
I know just what these people feel , all the horror .
And I ca n't stop it .
Nothing has changed , people still want to kill each other and that is so sad .
Damir was great and is a very gentle and quiet boy , he is not aggressive or angry .
For example , he is not looking for revenge , he is not overwhelmed by the past atrocities .
I know that he does not like to remember , but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go to the gym and light candles .
When he was small , he suffered - I remember , as he sometimes put on the sofa , his face away from us , for hours .
Not asleep , his eyes were open .
I also remember how he threw all of its weapons and other military toys , Damir is now 17 , bigger than me , good-looking , intelligent and healthy .
I can hardly believe that I was a few hours so sure that he is dead and that I would never see him again .
When I recovered after the explosion and was on its feet , I looked around and saw the hell around me , with around the body parts .
I was absolutely sure that my little boy could possibly have survived in this hell .
`` I remember that I shouted at him , `` Damir , Run , Run away , `` but I was so sure that he had not heard me .
But he has heard it and he ran away .
And so is the life , unlike that of many others , for us .
Georgy Ilyin , 17
The boy , whose terrible image after the siege , the symbol of the horrors of Beslan was
Consolation : the Beslan survivors Georgy Lyin with his mother , Fatima , after the siege in 2004 , right , a picture of Georgy today
His blutüberströmtes face was scarred by fear when he ran for his life , while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates .
His image was one of the most shocking symbols for the barbarity of Beslan .
His mother , Fatima , 54 , a doctor , had sacked him for his first day of school before she ran in her older son Vladimir to the university .
`` I left the court about two minutes before the terrorists stormed it , and then my little boy remained there for three terrible days alone , '' she remembers .
Not all alone , there was a whole family of relatives , but they were all killed .
My Georgy only managed to survive .
As the date draws nearer , the harder it is to remember and talk about it .
There is no single day when we do not remember this tragedy .
We do not think that it is a long time ago , I think it would have happened yesterday , some scenes from those days myself .
No one will ever forget it , I promise you that .
Urgent : the image of Georgy ( left ) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized ( right ) as the statue .
I remember that Georgy on that day was so keen to go to school , he said that he wanted to hug his trainer .
I only knew that he was alive , when I saw him on television .
And now there is even this statue of a weeping Georgy in San Marino .
Georgy does not like the picture , and it is hidden at home in the bookshelf .
I understand that , but I also think that people around the world to feel our pain , thanks to this image .
Georgy said today : `` it is important that such a thing can never happen again .
`` I doubt that we will ever know the truth .
Investigate the people keep such tragedies and never know the truth .
And now they investigate the crash of the Boeing in Ukraine .
Will we ever know what caused it ?
This world is becoming a little horror .
`` I can not understand how this is possible , because if you ask people , nobody wants a war , so how is this happening ?
Ten years is nothing with such pain .
We need dozens of years to forget it a little bit .
It has attacked my health and I feel it still .
About three or four years I had a few nightmares because of the siege , but by then it was better .
I went back later in the year 2004 to school and I had every day fear .
I thought of my friends and classmates who were slain .
That is why I am always in the sports hall when the 1 September gets closer .
I want to pay tribute to my my old childhood friends .
It is hard for me to go to the gym , but I have to do it .
I am not a victim , this story is now a part of my past .
I am not going to forget it , but I am not bemitleide .
My life goes on .
I have completed this year , the school and visit a medical college in Vladikavkaz .
I am going to be a heart surgeon .
My first choice was an education in the army .
I wanted to be a soldier , but my health did not allow this to happen .
I wanted to fight for my country , but it is not going to happen .
Georgy Fanijew , 20
The boy , who survived , although he was caught at the foot of a murderous terrorists
A miracle : Georgy Fanijew was trapped during the siege at the feet of a murderous terrorist , but he managed to survive .
During the siege , he was caught in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb that was attached to the foot of a murderous terrorists .
It is really a miracle that he was not killed .
`` We feel as if it were yesterday , '' says Georgy , who wanted to go to the FSB , the intelligence officer , but could do so because of his health damage due to the siege .
It is still with me , it is nothing that I have left behind me .
Now I am older and people say that children can easily cope with bad experiences - I must say that that is not true .
`` In 2006 I worked with psychologists and then felt something better , but I ca n't forget it .
And I would like to forget .
2005 - a year later , was the first and only time I went back into the sports hall .
I lost consciousness .
I will never return , and please do not ask me to show you where I have sat in this famous picture .
Survivor : Georgy Fanijew today , with a photo of himself in hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is enormous and I wear it every day with me .
My friends know that I do not like to think or talk about it and they never asked me about the school .
Physically I am fine .
I should be careful with my injured knee , but now I can run well .
But because of my health , I could not study at the secret service , the FSB Academy in St. Petersburg , as I wanted .
I have my documents , including the medical and they replied that it was not possible .
My second passion were the animals , so I went to the veterinary institute .
I have already two years behind me .
He has been studying the treatment of all animals `` from cats to cows . ''
He said : `` I knew that I would never tell my children about my experiences .
Children should not know about it and they should not suffer , of course .
His mother , Marina , 42 , said : `` the pain never leaves me .
He is in my soul , worse when the anniversary is approaching .
I will go to the celebrations of the commemoration .
I know that Georgy will not go .
There is much more violent for him because he was there and I do not .
I waited at home for him and could not help .
I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me , all of them are painted in Beslan .
It is in us .
Georgy is now an adult , but the horror is still in it .
It is hard to accept that if something is so Unfaires happened to her .
He is a boy , he loves sports , but he can not attend because of his knee .
He was operated on several times , he can run , but not to participate in sport .
I would say that he has overcome the horror to 50 % , but you can never be entirely overcome that and forget .
This terrible experience will haunt us forever .
Many friends and neighbors were killed in the siege and this only reinforces my pain .
I have lost many of the people I knew well and who were dear to me .
My son is with me , and that is the greatest gift that God gave me , but my heart cries for the killing .
I know of families where children were born , but also of widows who have never married again .
It is hard to accept that life goes on , even if you do not want that .
I will never forget how my heart jumped into me when I saw him in the hospital .
And now I see what is happening in the world - wars in other regions .
What these people are fighting for ?
Why they kill each other ?
The war is now very close to our country and I can hardly believe it .
We used to be a friendly country , how can it be that we are fighting now ?
People are suffering and children , I am sure that many children have been killed in Ukraine have been killed and many more .
If we could only throw all these rebels and - as far away as possible .
Aljona Tskajewa , 10
The baby that was so bluntly by a Special Operations Command in security
Rescued : Aljona Tskajewa is brought to safety by a Russian special-ops commando ( left ) .
It is now ten ( right ) and remembers nothing of the atrocities
The world held its breath in 2004 , when the baby Aljona was carried in the arms of a Russian policeman from the siege of Beslan .
The terrorists did they go , but kept their 30-year-old mother , the 10-year-old sister , Kristina and her brother Makhar in their cruelty in the school sports hall .
Makhar , then three years old , escaped , but Aljonas mother and sister died in the murderous carnage .
Her father , Ruslan has since married again and with his new wife Svetlana , a little girl that he had called after his lost daughter Kristina .
Aljona , now ten years old , does not remember the siege and has grown to be an intelligent and happy girl , say neighbours .
`` Now they are a big happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great kids , '' says a close friend .
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to spare them all the memories with the tenth anniversary .
You will understand why .

An exclusive extract from Howard Jacob 's hochgelobtem new novel about love and the letter `` J '' .
They zerflossen , it could be the best way to describe it , they have faded away slowly , like a cardboard , standing in the rain .
Occasionally , he told a woman that he is too serious , demanding , intense , aloof and perhaps kratzbürstig .
And then shook his hand .
Kratzbürstig knew he did .
He was stachelig , like hedgehogs , yes .
The last victim of this Stacheligkeit was a nascent affair , which had been promising for alleviating the lonely tedium of his life , and he may even have brought a degree of satisfaction .
Ailinn solo Mons was trembling a delicate beauty with untamed hair and a flapping heart from a village on the North Island , which was even more remote and hostile than Port Reuben .
She had come with an older accompaniment to the south , the Kevern for her aunt , who had inherited a plot in a damp but paradise Valley with the aptly named Paradise Valley .
For several years , no one had ever lived in the house .
The pipes were taking in the bathrooms were still spiders , slugs have left their mark on all windows and believed them to belong to all of this , and the garden was overgrown with weeds that looked like giant cabbage .
It was like the house of a children 's story , both threatening as tempting , a garden full of secrets .
Portrait of the author : Howard Jacobson , whose novel `` J '' is on the long list for the Man Booker Prize 2014 .
The shortlist will be announced next week .
Kevern had sat with Ailinn holding hands on the broken deck chairs in the high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon , and both were absent in the spirit of the console , which supplied the country with soothing music and soothing news than the sight of her crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song of a long-forgotten black entertainer , which his father had listened with closed blinds in the house .
Your feet are too big .
Because of their very own aggressiveness songs of this kind were no longer played on the console .
Not banned - nothing was forbidden - just not played .
It has been successfully obsolesziert , just as the word obsoleszieren .
The general taste , which had never managed decrees and regulations , and how the people in books choose From-dishwasher-to-millionaire-memoirs , cookery books and love novels , they chose the music of the ballads .
In the euphoria of the day began Kevern an imaginary piano to play and sing in a gross-weird Serenade Ailinns big feet .
Ailinn did not understand that .
`` It was a well-known song , a jazz pianist called fats Waller , '' he told her and automatically put two fingers to his lips .
His father had always done to stop the letter J , before he came out of his mouth .
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was still small .
His father had played it with his own father , he was told .
If you start off with a word with a J , without two finger over your lips , it will cost you a penny .
It was not a very fun game , and it was not very funny .
He knew that this was expected of him , that was all .
It had to explain what jazz was .
Ailinn had never heard any .
Jazz was , even though he was not directly , not banned .
The improvisation was no longer fashionable .
There was only room for one `` if '' in life .
The people wanted to be sure where they would end up at the beginning of a melody .
Also the mind .
His unpredictability made people nervous .
And jazz was musically ausgedrückter mind .
Although he was 10 years old , without having heard from Sammy Davis Junior , knew Kevern something about jazz in the semi-secret collection of old CDs of his father .
But at least he had to explain Ailinn , fats Waller was black .
At her age she probably could not recall a time when pop singers were not black .
Again , no laws or constraints .
A compliant society meant that every element of this society grateful agreed to the principle of group talent - grateful as spared by fate .
People with Afro-Caribbean origin were suited by temperament and physique for entertainment and sports , sang them and ran .
People who were originally from the Indian subcontinent , were blessed by nature with electronic talent and were cared for with the task of ensuring that no family left without a functioning telephone service .
What was left of the Polish community took care of the sewage system ; what was left of the Greeks was .
Those from the Gulf states and the Levant , whose large parents were not quickly leave the country as SHE GESCHEHEN WAR , WHEN ES GESCHEHEN WAR-happened out of fear , to be indicted for fire , stirring up , out of fear , even , that the flames would consume them as the next - were Labneh and shisha pipe-opened restaurants , kept in mind and were depressed by the inaction .
From each according to his abilities .
Since they had only heard ballads , it fell to Ailinn hard to understand how the offensive words Kevern she had just vorgesungen could be set to music .
Music was an expression of love .
`` That is not really offensive , '' said Kevern .
Except perhaps for people whose feet are too big .
My father has never offended anyone , but he loved this song .
He talked too much , but the neglected garden gave him a deceptive sense of security .
Nothing could overcome the sound insulation of the giant cabbage-like leaves .
Ailinn understood still is not .
Why would something like love your dad ?
He wanted to say that it was a jest , however , was reluctant to give two fingers to their lips in their presence .
They already thought he was a little odd .
`` It was funny , '' he said instead .
She shook her head in disbelief and locked Keverns view .
There have been around the world to see , nothing other than their ungekämmtes raven black hair .
There was nothing to what he would want to see otherwise .
`` If you say , '' I do it without conviction .
But that still does not explain why you do it to me vorsingst .
She seemed genuinely concerned .
My feet are too big ?
He looked again .
So your feet do not directly .
Perhaps your ankles , a little bit ...
And you say , you hate me because my ankles are too thick ?
You just hate it ?
Of course , I do not hate you .
This is only the stupid song .
He could have said `` I love you '' , but it was still too early .
`` Your thick ankles are exactly the reason why you find me gefällst , '' he tried it instead .
I am being a bit perverse .
This is not right .
It was supposed to be funny .
If he was trying to be funny , he was often in trouble because he , like his father did not have the soothing charm that you needed to tame the cruelty inherent in jokes .
Perhaps his father wanted to be cruel .
Perhaps he wanted to be , Kevern .
Despite its friendly eyes .
Ailinn solo Mons was red and arose from her deck chair , threw the console and buried the wine they were drinking .
Holunderblütenwein , drunkenness was no excuse for him .
In her excitement , she seemed to tremble as palms in the storm .
`` And your thick head is exactly the reason why I feel perversely drawn to you , '' she said ... .
Except that I am not that .
She was tired of him , both because of the unnecessary unfriendliness of his words and the fear that was demonstrated in their eyes , when they revolted against him .
She thought that he would beat them ?
She had not told him about life in the cold northern archipelago , where she was raised , but he had no doubt that it was essentially as here .
The same vast and icy Ocean broke here and there on the shore .
The same confused men , with even thicker skin and verdrießlicher to DEM WHAT WAR GESCHEHEN than were their ancestors as smugglers and wreckers , from pub to pub , always ready to raise a hand against a woman they refused or derided .
Dick head ?
It would have shown a big bat if they took care not !
They knutschen - Knutschen was the most-used word for an erotic attraction between men and women , an antidote to the vacuous love ballads from the console - it knutschen and then beat .
It was an unnecessary refinement to Keverns view , since the Knutschen itself was an act of violence .
Ailinn solo Mons gave him going through her body .
He rose from the deck chair , like an old man .
It was also bleiern , but she was surprised by the ferocity of his grief .
It was not the end of the world .
They hardly knew .
She saw him , as he is distant - as from a room on the upper floor of her companion looked on him - a man complained , something he himself had summoned .
Adam leaves the garden , she thought .
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general , although some had their hands against them .
A man turned on her , bowed to his back , embarrassed , defeated without fighting spirit - and why it was a sight seemed to know them well when they could not remember a single occasion on which she had ever seen before today , something like this ?
When she was alone again , looked Ailinn solo Mons on her feet .
Several years ago worked just told incidents Esme Nussbaum , an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow , the non-legislative monitoring body for the public mood , in a short speech about the continued violence on low and middle-level in the parts of the country , in which the reduction , if not abolish , most likely to have been expected , given the money and energy , which were invested in the eradication of this violence .
`` It is a great deal has been done , and much remains to be done , `` she wrote , `` in order to appease the innate aggressiveness of a people that has won a thousand wars and most of them , especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country , where the sweet breath of human kindness , historically , despite the towering spires rarely felt between the hedges .
But some properties stand out as an ineradicable .
The higher the tower , it seems , the less the passion he arouses .
The people crying when listening to sentimentaler ballads , intoxicated with stories of overcome difficulties and claims to believe in the virtues of marriage and family life , but even so , not only the former rudeness rural communities as well as our urban fabric firmly in hand , but there is also evidence for the emergence of a new and devious dispute at home , at work , on the streets and even on the playing fields .
`` You have an unfortunate tendency to exaggeration , '' said her mentor , when he had read the whole report .
I suggest that you read less novels .
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head .
I must also ask : are you an atheist ?
`` I think that I do not have to say , '' said Esme walnut .
Are you a lesbian ?
Again , Esme invoked their right to privacy and remain silent .
Feminist ?
Again , silence .
`` I do not ask this , `` said Luther Rabinowitz , finally , `` because I would be against atheism , Lesbentum or feminism .
This is a prejudice-free workplace .
We serve a prejudice-free society .
But certain types of hypersensitivity , which in themselves are perfectly acceptable and laudable , occasionally can distort results , as you have presented to them .
You yourself obviously prejudice against the church , and those things that you describe as `` sneaky '' and `` raw , '' could be interpreted by others as well as an expression of , of course , vigour and vitality .
If you continue on rides , WHAT GESCHEHEN IST , WHEN ES GESCHEHEN IS , as if it were , if it had happened yesterday , means the country of its essential vitality .
Esme Nussbaum felt , while Rabinowitz said .
Behind his head , had repeated a LED sticker in Flamingorosa the advice Ofnow the country in the last quarter of a century or more .
Smile your neighbors , you appreciate your partner , you will hear ballads , visit musicals , you use your phone , you talk , you say , listen , you agree to apologise .
Talk is better than silence , sung word is better than the written , but nothing is better than love .
`` I completely understand what you are driving , `` said Esme walnut with a quiet voice , when she was sure that her boss had spoken to the end , `` and I say nothing other than that we are not yet effectively cured , as we are deluding ourselves into thinking .
My concern is that without warning , we may find , as we repeat the mistakes that led only to WHAT GESCHEHEN IST , WHEN ES GESCHEHEN IST .
This time , however , it is not the other , we miss our anger and distrust .
Luther Rabinowitz moulded by the hands of a pyramid .
In order to indicate a patience .
`` They go too far , `` he said , `` if you call acts as a `` mistake `` our grandparents may or may not have committed .
They also go too far when you say that they have their `` anger '' and `` mistrust '' of `` other '' omitted .
It should not really be necessary , someone in your position to remind us that we are in understanding of the past , such as the protection of the present , not in terms of ' us ' and ' other ' .
There was no `` us '' and there was no `` other '' .
It was a time of disorder , that is all we know .
`` If we are honest with ourselves , `` Esme dared to post `` no part of the society can claim to have behaved well .
I would accuse anyone .
Whether it has been done badly or well , what has happened has happened .
That was then .
Nothing more needs to be said - we are all agreed on that .
And , just as it must be assigned no blame , no guilt has to be repaid , if such a repayment would be appropriate , and if there is a way to repay them .
But what is the past , if we do not learn from this -
The past is that we forget about them .

Garden centres regret homeowners falling numbers
The decline , along with a greater decline in the number of homeowners under the age of 35 could lead to garden centres , tens of thousands of pounds a year if today 's young consumers , according to a study by the HTA , as reported in the Financial Times , the `` core age group for garden products . ''
The report says that tenants spend an average of 55 percent of the amount that people spend on housing for their garden .
The rise of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens , the popular procedure , bitumen gardens for park purposes and the declining garden size are other factors that threaten the industry in the estimated £ 5 billion a year in sales .
In the urban area of London , in which over a period of six years , the proportion of homeowners has fallen from 61 to 43 percent , the lowest spending on garden products per household reported .
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society , indicate that housing for rent or small gardens can not mean that people are not plants .
Guy barter , chief garden adviser for the RHS , said : `` container gardeners , for example , is very popular with tenants because they can take their plants in a move . ''
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the `` golden age '' of the garden retail due to rising homeowners figures and economic prosperity of the late 1980s until the mid-1990s .
He also predicted for this year , an improved market situation because of better weather for unfriendly weather in March and April last year .

The tax burden of business people in the Washington area is rising with economic recovery
A recovery of the economy means more customers and more sales and new jobs .
It also means higher taxes .
State and local tax rulings for companies in the country rose slightly last year , while the accelerated economic recovery , a new study published last week , and the companies in the Washington area were no exception .
Companies in the region District , Maryland and Virginia , jointly paid $ 27.6 billion in state and local authorities in the financial year 2013 , an increase of 3.8 percent over the 2012 revenue of $ 26.6 billion .
The state and local tax burden of the company rose by 4.3 percent last year to $ 671 billion , compared with 3.9 percent in the previous year , and it was the third consecutive year of growth after several years of declining Opinions in 2009 and 2010 .
State taxes rose to more than the local taxes by 4.3 percent , according to the study , which was conducted by the Center for National tax , a tax policy group of the Services agency Ernst & amp ; Young .
More than half the tax revenues of the District , 56 percent , comes from corporate taxes , while 36 percent of the revenue of Maryland from companies .
Virginia , with 28 percent , the lowest tax revenue from companies .
A large part of the increase in tax revenues is in a recovery of the real-estate values of the companies , say the researchers , which led to an increase in real estate taxes by 3.7 percent this year after three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent .
While a large proportion of these profits from large states like California , New York and Texas , the process seems to be for the Washington area .
Companies in the District , Maryland and Virginia together paid more than $ 10 billion in state and local property taxes last year , compared to $ 9.6 billion in 2012 - an increase in the course of a year by 4.2 percent .
But the apparent recovery in the real-estate values is not as effective in improving state and local tax revenue in Maryland , as the real estate taxes to barely more than a fifth of the amount of tax decisions of companies .
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of property taxes .
`` In Maryland is the following : a large proportion of the property , especially in the tax area around D.C. , is either owned by the government or non-profit organizations that do not pay property taxes , '' said Douglas Lindholm , Managing Director of the Center on State Taxation .
Maryland is therefore forced to rely , for example , more on income taxes , in order to offer the same services that other countries .
The recent recovery in tax revenues from companies can not be attributed solely to the recovery of the real estate market
Corporate earnings also appear to recover , the data .
Companies in the region reported income taxes for state organisations from $ 2.3 billion , compared with 2.1 billion in 2012 .
Maryland took a $ 1 billion in corporate income taxes , the highest amount in the region .
While the trend is heading in the same direction , rising evenly to the local tax burden on companies is not at all three locations .
The Anstiegsrate in the District was at 4.3 percent of the national average , while the rise in Maryland was significantly higher , 4.9 percent .
Only Virginia , reported a unterdurchschnittliches tax revenue of 4.1 percent .
Virginia , with 6 percent in all three areas of the lowest corporate income taxes ( in all three there are fixed corporate tax rates ) .
The corporate tax rate in Maryland stands at 8.25 percent and in the District at relatively high 9.975 percent .
A similar study by the US Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that in Virginia lower state and local corporate taxes and generally a better tax climate than in Maryland .
In the study of the District was not investigated .
Despite the advantages of Virginia , is under pressure from its southern neighbors .
North Carolina has passed laws to reduce its corporate tax rates in this year of 6.9 percent to 6 percent , the same sentence as Virginia , and the rate will fall to 5 percent next year .
If the state continues its revenue targets in the coming year , this law could reduce the corporate income tax rate of the state of up to 3 % by 2017 .
In the meantime , it seems better to go to small businesses in the Washington area , and so they pay more state and local taxes , so the recent study .
Corporate taxes paid by small business and personal income taxes - a transitional structure , organized according to the most small businesses - in the District , Maryland and Virginia rose last year by 20 percent to $ 2.4 billion , a sharp faster growth rate than the corporate taxes as a whole .
The researchers say that the trend and the increase in corporate taxes in the country are likely to persist this year , with an increase in the general VAT revenues for the state and local governments by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 , compared with the same period of the previous year .
However , the region could lag behind Washington , if the spending cut in the federal government has an impact on the labour market in the region .

Genetic disorder is often misdiagnosed
A British woman says she thought as a result of a misdiagnosis for many years that she would die .
Karin Rodgers lived almost all her youth in the belief that she had only a few years to live after being diagnosed with another illness .
They really suffered from the Charcot-Marie-tooth disease ( CMT ) - a group ererbter disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and the spinal cord .
Charity CMT UK said that the misdiagnosis is a common problem in humans with CMT , because so little is known about the disease .
Some 23000 people in Britain probably suffering from CMT , which can lead to motor disorders , such as muscle weakness , an insecure and curved toes .
Ill also suffer from feelings of industrial or pain , the disease is incurable and progressive , meaning that the symptoms become worse over time .
When Rodgers was 13 , she believed that they suffer from Fried rich-ataxia ( FA ) - a disease with very poor chances of survival .
Rodgers thought she would sit in a wheelchair , before they were 18 , and die before her 30th birthday .
The mother of two children , who is now 51 years old , said : `` as a child , I knew I could not do the same as the others .
I fell backwards and everything took longer for me .
I could never go with the other children roller skaters or skateboard and was often in school because of my way to go and to run gehänselt .
Rodgers said that she realised at the age of 13 years after several operations to discharge her Achilles and stretching their legs , their medical records , when her doctor had left the room and read that she suffered from FA .
`` I felt guilty , because I was curious , so I have told anyone , but I went home , looked after the disease in the library and wrote to the FA , '' she said .
When I received reply , I was shocked and dreadfully in panic .
I thought that I would be in a wheelchair with 18 and 25 die , and would slowly lose all my skills .
I did it all alone with me and planned my own funeral .
She said that when she was 17 , she realized that their skills had not declined as much as they had imagined and inquired of her doctor .
He just stood up and hugged me and said , `` my love , I do not think that you have it , otherwise you were already in a wheelchair . ''
I think you have something far less life-threatening .
After some genetic tests , she was diagnosed with CMT .
`` When he told me what was CMT , I felt as if I have a winner , '' she said .
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT Awareness month to draw attention to the disease .

Putin calls for the inclusion of Kiev `` statehood talks '' with the eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded , according to Russian media reports on Sunday that the Ukrainian government to stop the fighting against the separatists in the east of the country and directly to negotiations on the `` statehood '' of the breakaway region .
His spokesman Dimitri Peskow later made it clear that Putin had not meant that the territory under the control of the separatists in eastern Ukraine will be part of Russia , but that his status to Ukraine should be redefined to give the Russian-speaking region of the power of representation of its rights and interests .
Putin 's appeal to the Kiev government to negotiate on an equal footing with the pro-Russian insurgents , fits the strategy pursued by him since the start of the riots five months ago , apparently : aid for the separatists in the adoption of territories and pressure on the Ukrainian government to allow the newly proclaimed region of Novo Rossija de facto independence for an alliance with Russia with the West .
In an interview with the state television station Channel One , Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recapture areas held by separatists in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk , which were taken in March and April , after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18 .
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently taken the territory known as the `` Novo Rossija '' or `` Neurussland '' , a term reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary heyday of the Russian empire .
Putin pointed out that all those who , in the wake of the Ukrainian politicians , campaigns for the elections on 26 Okt . and while government groups to attack civilian communities in the rebel-held areas are hoping for early peace talks `` are caught in their illusions , '' Itar-Tass reported .
`` We must immediately enter into detailed discussions , not only on technical issues , but also to the political organisation of society and the state status of the South-East of Ukraine , in order to safeguard the interests of the people living there , '' he said .
Peskow said that Putin 's reference to the statehood should be seen in the context of the wider autonomy , which has been discussed for months by the Kiev leadership , in order to allay fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are threatened .
Only the Ukrainian government can give the necessary autonomy to the eastern areas , said Peskow .
We are not talking about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia , said Peskow , `` because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine , but an internal conflict in Ukraine . ''
The clarification of the Kremlin 's spokesman on the correction of the `` misinterpretation '' of Putin 's remarks underscored the leadership of Russia in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east , in contrast to the direct Annektion of Crimea , where the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians .
Moscow would have far more difficulty to annex the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine , as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and surveys before the conflict , a broad majority in favour of remaining in Ukraine .
The autonomy , which has been raised by Russian diplomats at international forums , the regional governments in Ukraine authority to negotiate trade agreements and foreign relations , and the Kremlin has de facto control of a territory that connects the Russian territory of Crimea .
The peninsula annexed five months ago in the Black Sea is the home port for the bulk of the Russian navy , and an important trading port and historic coastal region .
The regions between the Rostov region in Russia and the Crimea is also rich in mines , factories and foundries , the major components for the Russian military .
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko suggested in his speech at the inauguration on June 7 that the Ukrainian legislation - for new elections , amendments to the Constitution should bear in mind that the respective areas will be given greater control over their finances and the status of languages .
But his idea of autonomy seems to stand in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and separatist rebels , arming and Moscow is accused of incitement .
Putin 's last call on Kiev to negotiate on an equal footing with the separatist leaders , followed after another invasion by the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks on the previously peaceful region invaded the eastern Ukraine along the Sea of Azov .
The Russian-backed separatists took over in the coup , according to the fears of Ukrainian security officials , the first step in a campaign for the takeover of the strategic coastal region to the Crimea , the control of Nowoasowsk .
For this reason , massive civil and military preparations under way to fortify Mariupol , a steel industry port with 500000 inhabitants , which lies between Nowoasowsk and a narrow access to the Crimean peninsula .
Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels on Saturday and asked for urgent action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine , a former Soviet republic , which has been independent for 23 years .
`` We are now at a point where there is a point of no return , '' warned Poroshenko .
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine .
The EU summit decided to any concrete actions , the leaders demanded the draft further sanctions against Russia , which will come into force in a unspezifizierten escalation of Ukraine crisis .
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk after two Russian columns of tanks and 1000 soldiers invaded last week in the Donetsk region , in order to support the beleaguered separatists , said Colonel Andriy Lysenko , spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council reports on Saturday in Kiev .
The first probably 63 Ukrainian soldiers , who were delivered by the Russian invasion of Ilowajsk included , were exchanged on Sunday against 10 Russian paratroopers on Ukrainian territory captured a week ago , Lysenko said on Sunday .

One of the most prominent developers of London pointed out that the housing market is in the south-east of England returned to `` normal levels '' .
Homes in the capital , were seized upon and subject to huge price increases , which led to the Bank of England due to the widespread fear of a credit bubble to set limits on mortgage loans in June .
Tony Pidgley , founder and CEO of the high-class Bauunternehmens Berkeley said on Monday : `` since the beginning of the current financial year , the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the peak in 2013 , '' adding that this was a `` stable environment '' to act .

The average selling prices of Berkeleys private , affordable and student offers rose by about a fifth last year and the end of April to £ 423000 .
A stronger pound has , however , in recent months , property in London less attractive to foreign buyers , some of them have also been deterred by the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric about a possible `` villas '' tax before the general election next May .

The transaction volume in the most expensive areas of London like Chelsea , Mayfair and Kensington has become every year has fallen by a quarter , so the agent WA Ellis .
However , the desire for a home in the capital , a boon for Berkeley , because the amounts due date for sales to more than £ 2.2 billion .
Mr Pidgley added : `` the demand for the right , well-planned product in the best locations remained stable and as a result , the futures sales remained stable . ''
In June , the company reported that it had sold 3742 new homes in the year to the end of April - almost a third more than the peak in 2007 before the crisis .
The annual pre-tax earnings rose at an annual rate of 40 per cent to £ 280 million , sales fell by 18 % to £ 1.6 billion .
In a statement on Monday before the annual meeting of the company , Mr Pidgley said that revenue for Berkeley in the current year were expected to meet current market expectations .
The analysts estimate consistent annual pre-tax earnings to £ 450 million .
Berkeley shares stood firm in the afternoon in London trading at 23.96 pounds .

Perry says that Texas was not authorised derogatory tweet
A tweet from the official account of the Republican Governor of Texas , Rick Perry , on Sunday featured a disparaging remark about the democratic district prosecutor , which lies at the heart of a criminal indictment against him for misuse of power .
The tweet was later deleted and replaced by another of Perry 's account of the previous abstritt .
A tweet was sent from my account , which was not authorised by me .
`` I do not agree with the tweet , and I have deleted it , '' it said in the message .
Employees of Perry responded immediately to requests for comments .
Although the tweets of Perry 's official account , was not clear who actually used the feed .
In the earlier tweet was an unfavourable image of the district prosecutor in Travis County , Rosemary mud mountain , was sentenced for drunken driving in April 2013 .
Perry put a veto on the financing of their offices when she refused to resign , which could be an indictment of Perry - perhaps 2016 presidential candidate - before a grand jury in Austin this month .
The text of the tweets reads : `` I do not always drunk with the triple allowable alcohol ... but if I do , I would accuse Governor Perry , if he ausplaudert . ''
I am the betrunkenste Democrat in Texas .
Clay 's office was not entrusted with the leadership of the investigation by the grand jury against Perry .
This was led by Michael McCrum , a special prosecutor from San Antonio , who was selected by a Republican judge .
Perry pleads not guilty and called the indictment a political ploy .
His top-class team of defence lawyers requested the judge tasked with the case , rejecting the charges and argued that the law , which is the longest-serving governor in the history of the state of Texas , unverfassungsgemäß diffuse .
Perry stopped $ 7.5 million in state money to the Public Integrity Unit of the state - which is based in Travis County and in cases of state corruption in Texas - as mud mountain refused to resign .
This veto provided a public complaint by a left-wing watchdog group .
Perry 's official account is updated frequently - and sometimes famous .
After he had finished with the rallies in Iowa during his presidential candidacy in 2012 as a fifth , Perry went to speculation that he will stop , when he posted a tweet of a photo of himself jogging near a lake , with the words `` South Carolina , we come ! ''

Andrew Lawson was a man of the sort , whose character things changed , even in such a huge organisation like the NHS .
As an advisory Anästhesiearzt devoted his career to save the health of both the agony of the disease , as well as the agony of the treatment .
Among his patients , his wife recalled , was an MI6 staff , who had to live with the devastating effects of torture .
Lawson knew that the doctors are important in the diagnosis and disease , while the cases are mostly occupied with something quite different : pain .
One day in 2007 , but he was the one whose ordeal began .
`` I have not felt , '' he wrote in May of this year .
I had to take our stuff .
While he fought with the flu like symptoms , he noted that he made his wife Juliet impatient accusations .
`` I want everything immediately , rather than later , '' he quoted .
As Juliet for a week was on a business trip , Lawson felt quite unusually , worried and without reason .
Something was in the air .
He asked a colleague to carry out an X-ray examination of his chest .
Just two weeks ago , he was skiing in the French Alps .
The result was the X-ray examination .
He suffered from mesothelioma , an incurable cancer of the breast skin , the lungs überziehende skin .
As with most cancers , the exact cause is usually difficult to determine .
For example , some smokers with lung disease , have not been previously all lung cancer sufferers are smokers .
But mesothelioma is different .
In almost all cases the trigger is an asbestos - contact with the fiber construction , which was once seen as a `` miracle material '' but has now been recognized as lethal .
For most of us mesothelioma is a disease that can easily ignore .
Asbestos is a product of the past .
The most dangerous use has not been used in Britain since the 1960s , when the industry voluntarily to use it .
Even where it was used , only people working in certain sectors directly with the substance , plumbers , builders , carpenters and shipyard workers , for example .
As an industrial hazardous substance from another time , he seems to be little concern .
But such complacency is misplaced .
Britain , it seems , is enjoying the culmination of a Mesoltheliom epidemic .
There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world .
With a total of 2500 deaths per year , twice as many people die from the disease than in road accidents .
Annual figures of mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and estimated future deaths in Britain
The reason why we now see the deadly effects , although asbestos is illegal for years ( 1999 , banned all types of asbestos ) , is that a mesothelioma emerged only after decades .
And the scourge of mesothelioma is not limited to former workers of the construction industry .
Asbestos was , and is often still exist in the houses , in which we live , the offices in which we work , the schools where we learn and the shops where we buy .
And therefore , mesothelioma knows no class barriers , financial limits , professions and age .
The privileged bastions , from the elegant department stores in London to private schools , are not a protected area .
The Parliament buildings are asbestos-contaminated .
Also in the hospitals , in which we are supposed to be healthy , have already been identified as the starting spots in this deadly Karzinogens .
Andrew Lawson was not old .
He was also not a plumber .
It was indeed hard to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos .
Then he found out .
`` It looks as if , in the tunnels at Guy 's Hospital , where I was six years of my education , a lot of asbestos . '' He wrote .
Everyone - students , nurses , doctors and guard - use the tunnel .
One wonders how many of my contemporaries suffer from the same disease ?
Unfortunately , he was able to answer this question , at least in part .
`` From the four doctors who were trained at Guy 's Hospital , and the diseased in mesothelioma in the last five years , '' he wrote in a letter in 2010 , `` I am the last one is still alive . ''
How many of us will fall ill ?
With Andrew Lawson mesothelioma was diagnosed at the age of 48 years .
When he died on February 17 this year , he was 55 .
It was an unusually long survival time .
Fifty percent of mesothelioma sufferers die within 8 months after diagnosis .
The disease is always fatal .
We can therefore only repeat Lawson 's question : `` how many of us are ill ? ''
Britain 's leading expert on mesothelioma , Professor Julian Peto , assumes that between 1870 and 2050 , when the asbestos epidemic in Britain is expected to be stalling , 90000 of the disease will be a victim .
Most of them at the moment have no idea that they are going to die .
An asbestos mine in Quebec , Canada , Alamy
A quick look at the files of the courts , which are often the victims for damages , shows how widespread the scourge of Mesothelioms already is .
In June this year , Marks & amp ; Spencer , for example , Janice Allen negligently exposed to asbestos .
She worked for nine years for the chain , from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible on the clothing department at two locations - one of the flagship store in Oxford Street .
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years when she began her career at M & amp ; S .
Now she has two children in their twenties .
`` Before this , `` she says , `` I had never heard of mesothelioma , I did not even really about asbestos .
I never thought that I would get this .
There are few people who know a lot about asbestos .
The fact is that the term asbestos is not a substance , but a group of six minerals .
The name comes from the word `` Asbestiform '' , a description of the fibre structure that makes the fabric resistant and flexible .
Three of the six were used in construction .
Chrysotile asbestos , also known as white asbestos is now by far the most commonly found asbestos in buildings .
It has been used for roof panels , floor plates , Rohrisolationen , boilers , insulation , even for brake pads in cars .
It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos , but the EU and the WHO as a `` great health risk '' with potential casualties .
However , more dangerous is the brown asbestos ( Amosit ) and the blue asbestos ( Krokydolith ) .
Britain was once the world 's biggest importer of brown asbestos , and experts suspect that `` there are clear but indirect evidence that this was a major reason for the unique high rates of mesothelioma . ''

Janice Allen has perhaps not seen as a typical mesothelioma victims , but the work of Julian Peto suggests that her story is not unusual .
He has presented a study of the stakeholders in the argument that `` a significant proportion of the Mesotheliome without known suspension was caused by work or in the home , presumably by asbestos contact in the environment . ''
Most of these contacts , his words , based on the `` normal use and aging '' of our building .
It appears that no one could expect to be safe .
A report by Goddard Consulting , which studied the palace of Westminster , shows how people in the heart of the government , have been unwittingly exposed to the substance might be .
Goddard , 2009 reported that the service shafts and pipelines were contaminated with asbestos behind the committee rooms of the Parliament , whose lethal fibres could be something as harmless as `` strong air movements '' .
Parliament members are often accused of looking after their own interests , but here it seems that the opposite is true .
While the principals of the Parliamentary work Service insisted that the Westminster Palace received a `` clean health certificate , '' it is now clear that £ 1 billion of work has to be paid over several years to renovate Parliament to modernise the electrical installations , and to remove the asbestos , and that the MPs after the general election in 2015 will take rather in nearby QE2 Conference Centre on the green benches at Westminster .
The Goddard report also pointed out that `` the presence of asbestos has not been handled in accordance with the relevant regulations . ''
No one can know whether this mismanagement will cost lives .
Everything you can do now is wait .
A person who could never determine contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott , a general practitioner .
As Andrew Lawson believed the 50-year-old Abbott , that he was during his work in hospitals exposed to asbestos .
`` I have worked in a hospital , where asbestos claims have been decidedly positive , `` he says , `` but I ca n't prove it in my case .
It is so difficult to remember all the places where they worked and the data .
What he remembers distinctly the day at the beginning of December 2009 , in which he was a kind of fever .
He was 45 , and was leading late in the evening by surgery .
Suddenly , I had chills .
It came suddenly .
I felt terrible .
I thought , no longer to create the trip home .
As a doctor , Abbott knew that the pain from the chest skin , the skin around his lungs .
But as Janice Allen , he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma .
He went a month not to work .
Verwunderte doctors made X-ray pictures of his chest and put Pleurakathether to remove fluid from the lungs and test in the lab .
His complaints , however , remained without a diagnosis .
His health has slowly improved , and he returned to his job .
From time to time , the symptoms returned , however , often after physical activity and heavy breathing .
In 2011 , Abbott 's was a patient with similar symptoms in his practice , and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma .
But even now , Abbott is not with his own case .
Finally , his patient was several decades older , and had worked directly with asbestos .
The connection in the case was clear .
In September 2011 , Abbott 's deteriorated state and his family doctor brought his CT scans and X-ray photographs of a group of experts .
In December 2011 , two years after Abbott was ill for the first time , a probe equipped with a camera was inserted into the cavity between the ribs and chest fur .
I am an optimist .
I usually just go , `` he says .
To be honest , I had not much to worry about .
But Rachel , my wife was worried .
The result of the biopsy was the week between Christmas and New Year : `` I was told that it was mesothelioma . ''
Graham Abbott : mesothelioma diagnosis
Suddenly , Abbott appointments with Macmillan nurses , one of whom advised him to take a lawyer .
Only now he realised the extent of the epidemic .
`` It turned out that asbestos was widely used , particularly in large public buildings , where pipes were often insulated with asbestos , '' he says .
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now ill .
And so mesothelioma is younger people who have not worked in the typical occupations .
The most dangerous pipes with asbestos insulation in hospitals under the earth , so patients were probably not exposed to the substance .
But many employees who came in pedestrian tunnels from one building to another alternated ( such as Andrew Lawson ) or in underground canteens ate ( as Graham Abbott often did ) , most likely in contact with the toxic substances .
It shows that over several decades after the war hospitals were potentially lifesaving for patients , but life-threatening for the treating doctors .
He is still today .
Students displayed their bunsenburner on asbestos mats .
And it is not just hospitals .
Asbestos was used due to its fabulous insulating and flame retard often in offices , shops , libraries and city halls .
It also applies to schools .
Indeed , many people have probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom .
Across the country , thousands of hours of Chemistry , pupils have their bunsenburner parked on asbestos mats .
On websites frequently raised the issue of asbestos in schools now .
And meanwhile have so innocent objects in our homes as floor plates or shingle roofs by default contain asbestos .
`` It is an industrial poison that in large parts of our property , '' commented Andrew Morgan , the lawyer , Andrew Lawson in his trial of Guy 's Hospital .
In one case , the only contact was a woman , the demolition of a Gartenschuppens in the 1970s .
So beware how you tear off your garden shed .
The effects of the diagnosis , and the knowledge that the disease is incurable , is immense .
`` It takes a while to process it , '' says Graham Abbott .
I went back to work and tried to move on , but I realized that I could not concentrate on what I was doing .
I was two weeks ago in practice .
Then I knew that I could go and I had to take care of myself .
Well , I will not see another Christmas .
With the greatest difficulty was the fresh approach from the position of a doctor to that of a patient .
As countless patients before him , he remembers how he was overwhelmed by all the information , with whom he has had to cope .
`` It was very difficult to absorb it all , '' he says .
`` `` I asked my doctor how long I have ? ``
And you gave me about 12 months .
I remember that I thought , ' Well , I will not see another Christmas .
It was then. `` ''
Mesothelioma is a particularly insidious because it is our life-support mechanism - breathing itself - that is causing the deadly cancer .
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by exposure to asbestos .
Asbestos consists of smallest fibers .
If the tremors of asbestos and the fibres are inhaled , they can fix the breast skin , the skin around the lungs .
Asbestos fibres irritate the breast skin cells and can cause mutations .
`` The problem arises with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibers , '' says Professor Tom Treasure , a heart-thorax-doctor moved in 2001 to Guy 's Hospital .
It is the hospital of the Andrew Lawson believed that it was exposed to asbestos , it is now , ironically , a leading centre for the treatment of mesothelioma .
Treasure knew Lawson and treated several others who were also likely during their training in hospital exposed to asbestos .
Once the asbestos needles the lung tissue , says Treasure , `` they will be pushed to the edge of the breathing process , where the skin is .
Inherently it is invasive right from the start .
The usual options for other cancers do not work so well for mesothelioma .
The effectiveness of the operation , for example , is hotly disputed .
Some say that it was worth a try .
The Treasure said no .
`` You ca n't cut out the chest hairs , '' he says .
They are not concerned with the knife .
Meanwhile , the cancer `` is not very well to chemotherapy , '' the `` effect '' , but not cures .
`` Sometimes there are long-term survivors , '' says Treasure .
But in the end they all die .
Fortunately , some patients actually live long , much longer than expected .
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis .
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis Graham Abbott still fighting .
After he had mesothelioma contacted Abbott came in contact with Andrew Lawson , four years after his diagnosis was a one-man support and consultancy for Mitbetroffene .
`` Hello , cancer , '' he was merrily on calls .
`` He was very positive , '' says Abbott .
He had received his diagnosis four years earlier and was still very active .
Abbott originally been offered to six cycles of chemotherapy , which would take four months and extend his life expected just a month .
`` I was desperate , '' he says .
I wanted to give up .
Lawson , however , was `` to make things in a more positive light . ''
Following the advice of several doctors Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski , cardio-thoracic specialist at Guy 's .
`` We had an advantage that I had to be referred , I phoned up and got an appointment , '' admits Graham .
A normal patient would have to receive a referral and must wait for the approval of the treatment .
Money is crucial for mesothelioma-sufferers to be able to play the best available therapies .
But if these treatments eventually inevitably fail , there are many people from another financial concern - about the future of the families they leave behind .
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation .
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP .
`` It has been known since 1898 , that asbestos is extremely dangerous for health , '' says Morgan .
But what has changed in the 1960s that it was realized that even a very low burden posed a health risk .
And here the negligence of the companies began to play a role .
Andrew Lawson and Guy 's Hospital , and in their case , but it was not what Morgan calls `` full compensation '' as Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to an asbestos contact at Guy 's .
After the investigation , confirmed his death , a spokesman of the Guy 's , however , that `` the asbestos fibres were removed in the 1990s in the basement . ''
It was too late for Andrew Lawson .
How asbestos can be removed
In fact , it is for mesothelioma-sufferers , seeking compensation , it is a huge problem , the deadly asbestos contact a company or a job , usually decades after the incidents .
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed .
Insurance documents can be lost .
And those who resist claims to know that it is time for them , but certainly not in line with the prosecutor .
In response , there were major new laws , it is easier for mesothelioma-affected , compensation for this , even if their former employers are no longer detectable in this year .
The law has a fund sponsored by the insurance industry £ 350 million for all those diagnosed after July 2012 , can prove a contact , but no one can sue .
In these cases , the plaintiffs will receive 80 percent of what a court in a normal compensation process them could grant - about £ 120000 .
About 300 successful applications for the program are expected per year .
Andrew Morgan thinks like so many mesothelioma-affected that £ 350 million is a `` very good work '' of the insurance industry .
`` This is a deal of insurers for insurers , '' he says , and suggests that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have to pay when the time would not have been able to overcome it and mesothelioma-PLD companies and they could sue .
Also , Mike Penning , the former work and pensions minister , admitted that the law was `` not perfect '' .
But both Penning as Morgan acknowledged that rapid action was necessary in the face of seven deaths a day .
`` The people are suffering so much and now need help , '' said Penning during the second hearing of mesothelioma Act in December of last year .
At this point was Graham Abbott for 19 months in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski .
After her first consultation recommended long-Lazdunski surgery , which he expects a positive effect , unlike Tom Treasure .
This has been accompanied by a radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy , with a survival rate of long-Lazdunski over five years by up to 40 percent .
Abbott felt strengthened .
`` This is , of course , with the most important thing , '' says Abbott .
This is apparent in patients .
There is something that you can move on .
If you aufgibst , you very quickly deteriorate .
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012 .
At the end of August , he had the last of six cycles of chemotherapy .
Follow-up scans showed no signs of the disease .
Then I had in March 2014 a scan .
There were several cancer spots around my chest .
I was just 50 .
This is not life-threatening .
That is life , stumbling along .
Abbott again underwent six cycles of chemotherapy .
Now there is no trace of the tumors is more visible .
But the process is both physically and mentally very demanding .
They need to think about practical things - on the money when I am not , for example , or how the Boiler time setting my wife works .
If you receive bad news , you will be negative .
You have to look forward to .
As the father of Ellie , 16 , and Tamsin , 14 , that is not always easy .
`` For parents , it is difficult , '' he says .
It is hard to know what to say and how much .
When I received my first diagnosis , I told my girls that I have a disease , I would not be old .
They were very different .
Tamsin is very sociable and unpredictable .
They told their friends , and soon we got many calls .
Ellie was more circumspect .
She said not much .
Such talks are going through something that all cancer patients .
But for ill mesothelioma such talks are not of hope , not a shred of hope for survival .
The disease ( as is ultimately for Stephen Jay Gould ) , a grim security .
As Andrew Morgan says , `` mesothelioma is not life-threatening .

In a statement to the New press , he contradicted statements of CEO peer Medau and certifies this to pose `` as a commander . ''
The style of the university , this is not stated in the communication .
The family was already `` Medau orally in mid-June had been informed about the request of the university .
The statement that the plans were first announced in July , are definitely wrong , `` says Pötzl 's bodypaintings .
At the same time , he points out that the plans are not `` Vorfestlegungen or decisions , '' but there are `` preferences '' .
Also necessary for the entrance of the narrow road up to the castle is less dramatic than the Medaus feared .
A nine-meter wide road and there is no question .
It is to stand at 5.50 meters , it is a metre wider than before , `` explains Pötzl 's bodypaintings .
The argument of Medau operators that their free and school own parklands will in future only be used by students of the university , Pötzl 's bodypaintings will not accept .
Zugeparkt is not at all , because it can be solved , as in other public parking become intelligent .
Think of the residents
The nursery Bergwichtel , located on the site and the entrance to the parking deck along in their backyard , would not be affected , according to the university president. ``
In fact , he said that `` it is not just about the nursery , but also to the residents at the junction of Friedrich-Streib street and 800 students of the neighbouring secondary school .
So it is about much more than about vested interests of Mr Medau , `` says Pötzl 's bodypaintings .
Whether the criticism of the parents of the children 's nursery with the expansion of the road would be a `` of the few natural spots Coburgs are lost , '' `` the reader can decide for themselves . ''
In early October to inform Pötzl 's bodypaintings , together with the State Bauamt Bamberg the councillors on the development of the university by 2020 `` and in this context , to raise the importance of the new development . ''
Peer Medau had last week informed the parents of the children 's nursery on the plans of the university .
Therefore , the access road to the new parking deck is on the campus and the Friedrich-Streib-road , but on the Medau-mountain .
The narrow road should be approximately 1 km in length zweispurig .
According to projections from the Medaus would increase traffic in the park of Castle High rock .
There is talk of about 2000 vehicles a day .
On the part of the city , there has been no comment on the project .

The castle clubs soon buddies again ?
Finally , there has been disagreement between the two wolf Council Hauser castle .
Now the executives to think about a possible cooperation .
As a model for the reconstruction of the wolf Council Hauser castle , the late Richard Dimbath , former chairman of the Council of Wolf Hauser castle friends , the project in the French Guédelon .
A year ago , there was not a good climate between the castle and the castle of Wolfratshausen friends .
Seemed very different positions so far , as with the history of the wolf council houses and a possible reconstruction .
Now the two sides together : it should soon be held talks on a common approach .
This confirms the club executive Torsten Sjöberg ( Castle ) and Herbert Piffl ( friends ) to demand of our newspaper .
`` I have phoned Mr Piffl and suggested that we could sit down together again , '' says Sjöberg .
In his view , all members of both clubs could pull together in the future .
So are quicker to visible results .
While the castle for the suddenly deceased Richard Dimbath until the end of a reconstruction of the castle in the mountain forest in the eye , stands for the Association for Sjöberg ' unlocking and Erlebbarmachung `` of the site .
Herbert Piffl , second chairman of the castle of friends , was very pleased by its own account of the call .
He is the castle of friends since Dimbaths death .
A new chairman is to be found in a general meeting in mid-September .
Currently , the association , according to the 74-year-olds around 40 members .
`` After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath , we have the first association activities out of respect . '' This `` theory '' was needed to `` consider how we might proceed . ''
According to Piffl is the new chairman will be in the conversation with the club .
Meanwhile , the castle of friends could also make a current mood within their group .
A candidate for the presidency , there is not yet , says Piffl .
`` But I am confident that someone will find '' and he will not run because he has his residence in Bad Toelz .
The new chairman should be a wolf council houses .
The Tölz wants to continue to participate in the project `` but very happy . ''
The different points of view in terms of reconstruction in the eyes of Piffls seems to be in the near future .
He praises Dimbath as `` missionary '' who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle .
Two similar , already far advanced projects in Austria and France , would show that this idea is not a pipe dream .
By a large number of the people , and volunteers from all over the world , they are a tourist magnet .
Piffl : `` I was skeptical at the beginning .
Over time , but I am more and more convinced that it makes sense to move the project forward. `` It could be a `` USP `` for the Flößerstadt .
Here , there is nothing else .
In addition , the project by EU grants , coupons and potential sponsors would be financeable , believes Piffl .
`` The idea of reconstruction , I personally do not throw away . '' He hoped that the castle club might move on this point .
Their goal is to document the story first , `` is important and good . ''
Then we could see further .

Ebola : the epidemic in West Africa economies
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a major blow to the economy .
Markets are orphaned - and international companies at bay .
The devastating Ebola epidemic in West Africa , a severe blow to the economy .
The crops rotting in the fields , the mines are left orphaned and the markets - the virus has added to the region .
Some international companies are already at a distance .
`` The Ebola epidemic is not just a medical crisis , but also an economic one , '' the chief judge of the African Development Bank , Donald Kaberuka .
Liberia is the hardest hit
`` It is a total disaster , we are losing a lot of money , '' says Alhaji Bamogo , clothing sold in the second-largest market in Liberia 's capital Monrovia .
Now on the market , only those who want to buy food or something to disinfection against Ebola .
Liberia is the hardest hit by the virus alone , the fever of more than 600 people fell victim .
Recently , the health authorities declared that the disease had penetrated into every corner of the country .
In Guinea , Sierra Leone and Nigeria , the virus has spread .
Overall , died more than 1500 people , thousands more stuck up .
Foreign firms attract employees
Everywhere in the resource-rich countries of their companies .
Foreign companies , such as the steel company ArcelorMittal withdraw their employees from several international airlines fly to the affected regions .
Also , the local traders and farmers react : only a few merchants leave their homes to buy supplies .
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia , the rot in quarantine , among other things , important for the export of cocoa and coffee beans in the fields .
The farmers do not dare to leave their home for the harvest .
Food is scarce
`` People will travel less and less , '' says Phillipe De Vreyer , Paris expert on the economy of West Africa .
The man , for example , which is normally on the market and sold vegetables , prefer to remain at home .
The population directly , therefore the consequences of the epidemic and urgent : food is scarce .
In the markets is dwindling stocks of staples such as rice .
At the same time threatens the region heavily dependent on international companies a reputational damage - with far-reaching consequences .
The biggest danger is that international companies to avoid the area for a long time , basically , says Philippe Hugon of the French think tank Iris .
What is decisive is how far and how long will still spread the virus .
For investors , could give the impression that `` it is dangerous to live in Guinea , Sierra Leone and Liberia , and thus also to invest , '' warns Hugon .
The disease also interferes with the strained state budgets in the states
The disease also burdened the already strained state budgets of the Member States concerned .
The credit rating agency Moody 's is concerned that their budgets are under severe strain from high spending on the health care system and by the deteriorating economy .
The African Development Bank have already promised to help the health systems of the countries concerned with 60 million dollars ( 45 million euros ) .
The effects are already in Nigeria , where so far only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed .
While the oil-rich region in the southern Niger Delta region has not been affected .
But elsewhere , many people remain at home for fear of contagion .
Reservations at hotels are dwindling .

Amazon buys Twitch for $ 1.04 billion
Amazon has just confirmed what information had reported on Monday morning : the online retailer - and video producer , and a host of other things - buys the video streaming service Twitch for $ 1.04 billion ( US $ 970 million ) .
The announcement is a surprise , not because nobody had expected an acquisition of Twitch , but because it was widely believed that YouTube would acquire the company .
Three months ago , it looked as though the sale of Twitch to the video service of Google decided for a cool billion , and the cooperation was also , of course .
Twitch , which was founded just three years ago as Justin.tv was started as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube .
Instead , it quickly became a platform for players who wanted their bravura pieces published in games , `` a YouTube for live games , '' says an insider .
The Twitch interface .
And `` let us play , '' a video genre , a painting of secret science theatre in salving the ( usually older ) games , are already very popular on YouTube .
The fact is that YouTube is often called , if you want to describe Twitch , so was the news that YouTube would buy Twitch , a bit bored , a textbook example of an established technology company that buys a potential competitor .
It is a mystery as to why the deal with YouTube was not derailed , because the company is reportedly willing to pay as much as Amazon .
Everything we know about at the moment , this statement is Emmet Shear , president of Twitch : `` we chose Amazon because they believe in our community , they share our values and long-term vision and they want to help us get there faster . ''
Another secret is , frankly , the incredible success of Twitch .
Am going to like me , who say that they prefer to play sports as a watch , it is hard to understand the attraction , which assumes that watching other games to even the control console .
It is one thing , a friend at 3.00 a.m. to look over the shoulder , while it creeps through Resident Evil , and quite another to a spinner poke it 20 times in succession in Call of Duty is shot in the head .
You could just look at all these games .
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games , so it can be to watch it without its own control over the prospect of a good recipe for headaches .
I admit that the quick passes , the Roger Bannisters in our electronic age whole games in record time , entertaining .
But as long as not a game or humor virtuoso is his Twitch channel is probably not as interesting .
But what skeptics know as I have of it ?
Twitch is called 55 million different visitors a month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic .
And how exactly will Amazon make money from it ?
It is hard to imagine that Twitch so elegantly in Amazon Instant Video is integrated , such as YouTube , Twitch would have simply swallow .
But Twitch has something any company would like : thousands of young men who are courted as advertisers .
As the chairman of Twitch , Shear said that Amazon and Twitch `` both believe in the future of gaming , '' and the medium shows no sign of a contraction , not yet - schluck - as a spectator sport .

4 tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you would like to make photos or videos under water , there are a variety of devices .
The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot , like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or action-cam as the GoPro Hero3 + Silver Edition , both for about $ 300 .
I have these photos in a family with several cameras , which are all available at a price of less than $ 350 .
Regardless of the equipment , there are a few rules for the best results .
Check your equipment twice .
Even if you have a waterproof camera , make sure that the battery pack and other subjects are locked .
Put your camera on the photos or videos that you want to take .
Some cameras and camcorders have scenes and recording modes , which optimizes exposure for the twilight these quickly underwater conditions .
And before you jump into it , you look up in the depth of your equipment is functional .
Some cameras are only permitted for up to 5 feet , others up to 50 or 60 feet .
Are you looking for in our shopping guides and reviews for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models .
Take multiple shots - because many of them will not work .
Point-and-shoot cameras have LCD , with which you can compose images , action-Cams normally does not .
Even if you have an LCD , it is difficult to see under water , and the correct attitude is a matter of luck .
So you make many shots .
If your camera has a terraced mode , with a series of recordings with slightly different exposure settings , you use it .
Stay near the surface .
The light will be dramatically worse , the further you move away from the surface .
If possible , you remain so close to the surface , when you make shots in a pool , a lake or the sea .
You can also be more color in your photos ; the deeper you go , the less you see color .
Go close to the objects .
It is also a good advice on land , but it is all the more important because of the bad lighting conditions .
It is especially important if you are working with an action-cam : these devices often have a fixed wide-angle lens , which means that you have dense to your objects , if they are to fill the entire picture .

Going back to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
The congressmen , Keith Ellison and John Lewis have tabled a legislative proposal to establish the organisation of trade unions as a civil right .
`` As trade unions , die , die , the middle-class jobs , '' said Ellison , a Democrat from Minnesota , and vice-chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress .
I am so proud , together with the civil rights icon John Lewis , the employee Ermächtigungsgesetz .
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal possibilities in discrimination because of the organization of trade unions - as with other forms of discrimination , and stops as anti-trade union-minded forces .
The supplement to the national labour law in order to create an opportunity for discriminating against NHS workers to organize a union representation to sue in a civil court for justice , and to obtain damages or criminal money - is a useful and necessary initiative .
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards .
In fact , the best way to understanding what Ellison , Lewis and the other sponsors of their bill , the connection back to a very American idea .
Despite the setbacks , which have been subjected to the unions in recent years - in Wisconsin , Michigan and other states throughout the country , Americans have encouraged countries all over the world to recognise labour rights , and to expand .
There was a time in which millions of Americans still remember when this country was called democracy , freedom of speech , freedom of the press and freedom of association in the same breath .
When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War , General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff the country to adopt a constitution that would ensure that the militarised autocracy Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy .
In full awareness that the workers and their unions took a role in the creation of a new Japan , they used a language that explicitly recognized that `` workers ' rights of association and collective bargaining and action are guaranteed . ''
When the United States after World War II Germany occupy pushed General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff , the Germans , to write a constitution that would ensure that the fascism of Adolf Hitler would be replaced by a strong democracy .
In recognition of the fact that the workers would have to organize , and should raise their voice in the new nation , the Germans have a clause that explicitly testified : `` the right to form associations in order to safeguard and improve the health and economic conditions will be guaranteed to each individual and each profession or business .
Agreements that restrict this right or seek to diminish it is null and void ; seeks to measures are illegal .
As the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was the Chair of the International Commission on Human Rights , drafted by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , which was adopted in 1948 by the United Nations as a global agreement , Roosevelt and the other authors of a guarantee that `` everyone has the right to form unions to protect their interests , or to join them . ''
For generations , Americans accept the basic premise that labour rights are human rights .
When this country consulted other countries how to forge civil and democratic societies , told Americans that the right to the establishment of a trade union - and protected - that this union will take part in collective bargaining as an equal partner with businesses and government agencies should be allowed .
Once these rights in America came under fire , it is actually very wise , the American ideal of that working people must have the right to unite and to be heard in a free and open society .
As pastor , Martin Luther King Jr. , 50 years ago said :
The story is a great teacher .
All now know that the labour movement is not restricted to the strength of the nation but enlarged it .
By raising the living standards of millions of people work miraculously created a market for the industry and raised the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production .
Those who attack the work , forget these simple truths , but history is preserved .
History remembers , and we should do the same .
The formal recognition of the work rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of the rights of citizens as a protection against discrimination in the creation of workers ' representatives - is long overdue .
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that America made in the past , and the promises of democracy .

Why ' Guardians of the Galaxy `` was a box office hit
`` The Expendables 3 '' played by Sylvester Stallone , less than $ 30 million of his $ 90 million budget in the US , while `` sin City : a Dame to Kill For '' album only 12 million dollars of its budget of $ 70 million .
The tailored to Cameron Diaz film `` sex Tape '' played on the opening weekend , only $ 14.6 million , while children 's films like `` tame dragon made easy 2 '' also disappoint in revenue .
An article in the Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that children 's films , the lack of quality in the films themselves could be the reason .
Collin described 2014 as `` the worst year '' for children 's films and described `` tame dragons made easy 2 '' as a purely `` functional '' fantasy sequel .
In films for a slightly older audience , however , it appears as if the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem .
In July , Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaS core and Metacritic rating for each summer film start between the American Memorial Day and the 20th of July 2013 , and in the current year to at least 2000 screens .
The results are based on the opinion of the film-goers and film critics and indicate that this year 's film hits equivalent to those of last year .
Some commentators believe that the development of changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of Web-streaming services like Netflix .
Director Jon Favreau , who is currently working on Disney 's upcoming Jungle Book film , said to the website Hollywood Reporter : `` I think the times are changing . ''
We must accept that and not try to chase after the past .
In contrast to the currently weak cash results of Hollywood productions generated revenues Netflix recently with the streaming content to the tune of $ 1.2 billion , almost twice as much as last year , the turnover was $ 837 million .
Last summer , the director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios is that it is too much focused on film versions of comics , and predicted a `` meltdown '' in Hollywood .
Seen in the light of the current downturn , some commentators argue that his gloomy prophecy could indeed contain a kernel of truth .
In view of the expected in the summer of 2015 , a potential blockbuster , including Aven Gers : age of Ultron , Minions and Jurassic World , however , are more optimistic , the other representatives of the film industry .
The producer of X-Men , Simon Kinberg , recently described the decline in the cash results than simply `` cyclical '' and said to the Hollywood Reporter : `` the next summer will be the biggest summer at the cinema box office , and no one will worry more about the business . ''

Production in the euro zone on a 13-month low
The increase in production in the eurozone slowed in August to its lowest point in the last 13 months , a closely watched study .
The final Markit manufacturing purchasing managers index ( PMI ) fell in August to 50.7 , after a stand of 51.8 in July .
A figure over 50 indicates an expansion .
New orders have fallen and factories experienced declines in a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine .
The figures prior to the meeting of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) on Thursday .
The markets expect the Bank to a clear plan for dealing with a hesitant recovery in the eurozone and the threat of deflation with an inflation rate of only 0.3 % .
There is speculation that the head of the ECB , Mario Draghi , during this week could provide such information , whether it is a quantitative easing for the eurozone , according to those who have been made by the United Kingdom and the United States during the financial crisis .
`` Although a small growth is better than no growth , are the deterrent impact of the growing economic and geopolitical uncertainties have become clearer for the manufacturers , '' said Rob Dobson , senior economist at Markit .
The factory PMI for Germany , the largest trading partner of Russia in the EU , fell to the lowest level in 11 months , with 51.4 .
In the meantime , fell in the bloc 's second-largest economy , France , the PMI to 46.9 .
France remains a concern , as well as the descent of Italy of a solid expansion to stagnation .
Evidence that incentives for growth in the key industrial mechanism in Germany and in Spain and the Netherlands are no longer are also not reassuring , `` said Mr Dobson .
The decline in the industry is fueling the fire of the analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal stimulus .
Good news came from the Republic of Ireland , where the PMI rose to 57.3 , the highest level since the end of 1999 .
Howard Archer , chief economist at IHS Global Insight , said : `` the best thing you can say for the purchasing managers index of manufacturing in the eurozone in August , is that the sector continues to grow . ''
He added : `` producers in the eurozone 's life are obviously very difficult , because the current heightened geopolitical tensions , particularly in relation to Russia and Ukraine , uncertainties in the continued difficult conditions in many countries .
This increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy , in particular , and consumer confidence , and probably means that some orders are being delayed or even cancelled , particularly large orders .
He said that it was `` increasingly likely '' that the ECB will eventually launch a kind of QE , `` although we suspect that this will be limited . ''

Twin town : German beer for Guangzhou
Hops and malt - also a popular combination in China .
German beer has an excellent reputation in China .
Frankfurt 's sister city in China now wants a brewery and also hopes for a flight direct connection between the two cities .
German beer , brewed in Frankfurt 's partner city Guangzhou - that is the urgent wish of officials in China .

`` It would be worth '' , were convinced the local politicians .
`` The business connections between our two cities increasingly . ''

Also , the administration of Guangdong province , whose capital is Guangzhou , hopes for the flight .
The vice-governor of the province , Chen Yunxian , this wish during his meeting with the Social Democrats .
`` This is a very good idea , '' said Shepherd-Gümbel - Chinese Vice-Minister Li Jinjun , an intimate knowledge of Germany , nodded approvingly .
Neat partnership

Li Yiwei , was already on Main , but not yet in office .
He only came to office this year after his predecessor had been promoted from office on corruption charges .

The new leaders , Li Yiwei had worked against his party career for an American company , which is highly unusual in the Chinese Communist Party .
Before he took office in Guangzhou , he was a top official in Fujian , where the automakers VW built a magnum opus .

Angelina Jolie and her brother James have put online a video tribute to her mother , who died of ovarian cancer in 2007 .
For women in rural areas of Australia , there is a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than for women in cities .
Researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1100 Australians where 2005 ovarian cancer was found , and found that only 25 percent five years after diagnosis were still alive .
The research director Susan Jordan from QIMR mountain Hofer Medical Research Institute , said that for those who lived in rural and remote regions of the state , the mortality risk during the study , 20 percent higher than those in urban areas .
KLEINE 's STUDIE : new drugs can slow lung cancer and ovarian cancer
The researchers examined the medical care of women over seven years .
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in the diagnosis , the type of ovarian cancer , existing previous illnesses and the social and economic status also influenced the chances of survival .
For older women and those whose cancer diagnosis was more advanced , the survival rate was the lowest .
For those who lived in rural and remote regions of the state , was the mortality risk during the study , 20 percent higher than those in urban areas .

Clever ways to save for university textbooks
As the cost of university textbooks for many students more than $ 1000 per year , pondered the fast second-semester student Matt Schroeder , a clever idea of austerity .
He invented a surrogate system for books by students of higher semester and offered a nominal compensation to delay the re-sale .
`` My maths book normally costs $ 180 , but I got it for $ 10 for a semester and a Chick-fil-A-biscuit , '' said Schroeder , 19 , who visited the Covenant College in Georgia .
The books needed for the last semester had cost him $ 430 , he said .
He gave $ 120 .
The college management told the students , on average , more than $ 1200 per year for textbooks and study material that there were , however , various costs options for students .
Online stores and creative approaches as the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of choice for the students .
The hiring of textbooks is popular , and so students can use a book a semester long , often at a much lower price than buying .
Neebo Inc , which operates more than 250 university bookstores , said that the hiring of text books have doubled since 2011 .
Polls in the industry , show that about one-quarter of the books in the college bookstores was hired last spring semester , said Neebos Vice President Tevor Meyer .
Less than half of all books bought in campus bookstores , according to the trade association , National Association of College Stores .
Here is the ABC for the best deals .
Buy online
Some new books online cost only one-third of the price for which they are in the campus bookstore .
The ninth edition of `` Calculus '' I will just describe how Ron Larwon , Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $ 290 , but can be obtained at the specialized textbook retailers Chegg.com for 239.99 dollars .
Buy used
If one of the notes or other normal tracks , used books are a good option .
`` Calculus '' is needed on Chegg.com for 93.49 dollars .
Matt Casaday , 25 , a student at Brigham Young University , says that he has spent on Amazon.com 42 cents for a secondhand edition of ' Strategic Media Decisions : understanding The End Of The Business Advertising Business. ``
The book was sold for $ 48 .
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey , head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls advised students to ask their professors , whether previous spending is permissible .
Sometimes the updates for the seminar papers are not relevant .
In such cases , older issues often can be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest edition .
Besides Chegg and Amazon is Half.com by eBay Inc , a popular alternative for used books .
Rent
The hiring of textbooks is worth considering if you treat them reasonably well , remember to give them back and you do not want to keep the books after completing the course .
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book .
A student could , for example , `` Calculus '' during one semester rent for around $ 20 .
Inform yourself about the terms of the transaction , where you rent , also about the criminal charges , if applicable , for writing , underlined or tracks .
Renters beware : if you do not return the book , the criminal charges may even exceed the price of a new book .
E-books
Also , e-books instead of traditional textbooks are an option .
Sometimes these books are de facto rented by an electronic license is available for a certain period of time of major retailers such as Amazon.com , Chegg and Barnes & amp ; Noble Inc .
At Chegg `` Calculus '' for 6 months rent for about $ 61 .
Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best offers , because many classics nowadays can be downloaded free of charge , while scientific and engineering science textbooks can be very expensive .
Look around in any case .
Joe Gault , 29 , who will soon visit the Pepper Dine Law School , recommends the ISBN number for calculating the price for books , because you can be sure to find the right textbook .
And in an online order should be considered Gault whether the book is actually available .
He learned this lesson the hard way .
He bought a book for four weeks , and eventually paid the full price in the college bookstore .

Israeli children are returning after the war in Gaza in their schools
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas in the vicinity of the Gaza Strip on Monday , returned to the schools , after they had spent the summer in air shelters , while rockets and mortar shells on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas went down , and the schools in Gaza remained closed , while the area recovered from the fighting .
The school brought the launch of rocket no bullet holes drawn communities in the south of Israel , a sense of joy and expectation , but the signs of the battles are still fresh .
In the southern city of Ashdod remote staff `` Pashosh '' kindergarten , which was hit by a missile , before the arrival of the students Granatsplitter from the walls and sliding walls .
`` We have a little bit scared , but excited , '' said Ronit beard , someone who lives on the Kibbutz Saad and local English teacher .
Many children from our area urgently need a return to a routine .
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it felt `` a bit weird '' to suddenly go back to school .
`` These were difficult times , and we are not out of the house , '' she said .
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near the border with Gaza to offer his support .
Until a ceasefire to the war last week , remained cut off to thousands of residents of border communities such as Saad in their homes or left their homes to escape to safer areas further away from Gaza and the rocket and mortar fire .
Many residents of Nahal Oz , a village near the border with Gaza , in which a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar grenade , still hesitating to return .
The Ministry of Education , said that about a dozen families had not yet returned .
Their children were housed temporarily in other schools .
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot , a border town to Gaza , which is heavily scarred from the Palestinian fire .
He urged the children to learn a lot and said , `` we will ensure that bought their knowledge and offer security . ''
Israel and Hamas agreed last Tuesday to a unbefristeteten cease-fire .
The ceasefire provided for an immediate end to the fighting ; important issues remain unresolved , such as the demand of Hamas after the lifting of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of air and sea ports in Gaza .
Israel calls for the disarming of Hamas and the handover of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting .
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin later this month in Egypt .
In the war , more than 2100 Palestinians were killed , three-quarters of them civilians , and at least 494 children , according to estimates by the Palestinians and the UN .
Israel denies those claims and estimates that at least half of those killed are militants , but no concrete evidence for this information .

The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza area and some 250000 people sought refuge , which has been converted into temporary refuges in more than 100 UN schools .
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the shelters and the fight continues , the education authorities last week delayed the start of the school year .
`` I hope the school will soon be reopened , so that we can learn , as the children in the world and the Jewish children , '' said Mohammad Amara , a 13-year-old boy , who currently lives in a school in Gaza City .

Hong Kong , China denied the right to choose government protesters swear vengeance
On Sunday , the Chinese parliament , despite the increased calls for democratic reforms against the nomination of candidates for the elections by 2017 , the Hong Kong electorate .
This approach probably fired long announced protests in Hong Kong 's business district , while activists planning and mobilization to within a few hours after the announcement began .
The decision of the Chinese People 's Congress allows basically Communist leaders reject all candidates loyal to Beijing .
`` It is not unexpected , but it makes us angry , '' said legal expert Emily Lau , leader of the Democratic Party .
That is not what Beijing had promised .
They have lied to the people of Hong Kong .
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime .
In his defense of the Chinese decision , said Li Fei , Vice Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People 's Congress that the approval of public nominations for the elections for the Hong Kong government to `` chaotic '' .
Since 1997 , when Britain created the control over Hong Kong , the Chinese , Beijing has promised that the inhabitants in 2017 to choose the presidency of government .
The Chinese leadership 's decision on Sunday as a democratic breakthrough , because it is the citizens of Hong Kong a direct electoral law , but the decision also demonstrates that the Chinese leadership , the process by a nomination committee tightly controlled by Beijing firmly in the hands .
After a new clause should be allowed to be the only candidate `` with a love of country and love Hong Kong '' .
The decision follows a summer in which some of the biggest and most efficient public protests in Hong Kong took place for a number of years .
Behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong , the movement , Occupy Central With Love and Peace , whose organizers have threatened to seal off the financial district , if Beijing allows no genuine universal suffrage .
On Sunday evening had gathered within a few hours after the announcement , hundreds of Occupy Central 's supporters in the rain outside the government headquarters in Hong Kong .
During the demonstration , the organizers said that their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience and protest planned in the coming weeks .
They did not give details , however , apparently to avoid problems with the authorities .
In an online statement , the organizers disclosed that the movement has `` the occupation of the central district of only as a last resort taken into account , an action which would only take place if all dialogue opportunities have been exhausted and there is no other choice .
We are sorry to have to say today that all dialogue opportunities have been exhausted and the occupation of the central district will definitely take place .
The authorities in Hong Kong have been prepared for the announcement of Beijing for days , and were on the Sunday before the government building tighter security measures , including police and barricades .
The riots are strengthened by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they slowly lose control of their city .
The influx of people from the mainland increased the competition for products and services .
Moreover , there is growing fear that the values of Hong Kong as democracy and freedom of speech to crumble under the growing pressure of Beijing .
Some criticized the demonstrations of the Occupy Central movement , because it threatens the business - the lifeblood of Hong Kong .
`` The protests , which they could talk to a lot of economic harm , depending on how many are involved and how long they continue , '' said legal expert Regine Ip , which has long been critical of the movement .
We do not want to stoke fears that Hong Kong is getting out of control .
This impression is bad for investment .
China 's state-controlled media also reported recently on democracy activists in Hong Kong as a subversive agents controlled by Western powers .
This summer , activists organised an unofficial referendum on the voting rights , which was attended by 780000 people - more than a fifth of the voters in Hong Kong .
In July , tens of thousands in one of the largest democracy demonstrations took part in the history of the region .

Feminists criticising race and police conduct after Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed earlier this month of a police officer in Ferguson , Mon genau .
The participants raised their hands in the air and chanting , `` hands high , do not shoot , '' while they waited before the funeral .
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson , Mo , because of the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown noticed the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez , a change in the online discussions of white feminists .
After their experience , white feminist commentators sex before the race , when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income inequality .
But while the increased tensions in the Midwest and received nationwide attention , saw Perez that the responses of white women revolved around the race to 100 % .
Compared with the responses of black women shortly after the shots came from 9 August , the personal essays with titles like `` thoughts on Ferguson by a white woman '' and `` feminism is not just about the oppression of women '' relatively late .
But Perez was an important change .
`` I do not think that feminism is many people who talk about the white and privileges on such high-class way , '' she said .
People were urged to express something about the incidents .
It is characteristic of the crisis we are facing and because the situation in Ferguson is ethnicized is that they need to express it .
The Ohio State University English professor Koritha Mitchell Ferguson problems brought to light by black American women every day , but they are not regarded as `` women 's issues '' in the cultural area .
`` I can publish something funny on Facebook about me and my partner and I get 150 likes will from anywhere , '' said Mitchell .
If I post something about how colours in their own country are under siege , the silence is deafening .
`` How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship , but not on safety in public spaces ? '' She asked .
For black women like Mitchell , race , gender and sexuality in the history of the USA , there is no dichotomy between racial and gender issues .
For them , black women have not had the luxury of separating the issues of clean ; they live every day in the combined reality .
While white women now connect the issues of race and gender in the feminist mainstream circles , says Angela Hattery , a professor of women 's and Gender Studies at the George Mason University that their predecessors did the opposite .
`` Between 1865 and 1890 were lynched at least 10000 black men and the justification was almost always the rape of a white woman , '' said Hattery .
White women have had to be involved in the story to justify the Lynch murder .
For Hattery came the chasm between white and black women could be at the point where white fighters for women 's suffrage as Susan B. Anthony , the country in the late years of the 19th century , analyzed and discovered that the fight for the right to vote only for one group : women or blacks .
`` They took the decision to campaign for women 's suffrage and the right to vote for blacks should come later , '' said Hattery .
When you think of such things , is a white women do not trust with power aware why coloured women .
We have not done our job well .
We have never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons .
Even after women the right to vote in 1920 , it took a decade for white women against the Lynchen in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching organised .
The group was established nearly 40 years after the original request for help from black women , says Mitchell .
For Mitchell , the flood of white feminist responses to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behaviour , racial discrimination - a reflection of the time , in which white feminists `` catch '' with the problems , with black women for generations .
`` Would n't it be great if the activists with such traditional feminist platforms , the right to education of a child as seriously as they do with the right to birth control ? '' Asked Mitchell .
Feminists of the second generation , which built their careers on the battle for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives , and try to understand what that means .
The famous white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown on Facebook and published a pithy article by Rebecca Carroll , the Guardian pundit , in which she calls for more protests by white Americans on the issue of racism .
`` I hope that women who have a different , but parallel to understand a danger inherent in the body - and opinions on the race , which are different in public opinion polls - the changes , '' Steinem wrote .
Although Steinem stands for a more intersectional feminism , racial and gender issues , some are puzzled by their comments on the racial issue in America .
Christina summer , researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of Who Stole Feminism ? `` Said to She The People that young men in the United States , especially young colored men , `` are far more vulnerable than their sisters , `` but Steinems comments on Ferguson are in contrast to their earlier criticism .
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women , but almost nothing for boys .
But as the White House recently , a small program , My Brother 's Keeper , worked to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men , there were infuriating reactions from many feminists , including Gloria Steinem .
The ratio of police to the black community is not the only problem is that in the forefront of mainstream feminism .
After the US border police has almost 63000 unaccompanied minors on the southwest border of the country this year , is also the issue of immigration reform back to the surface - this time as a women 's issue .
Andrea Mercado , co-chairman of We Belong Together , an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform , said that for a reconsideration of the issue as an important issue for women only , they should publish the stories of immigrant women .
`` These speak for themselves , '' said Mercado .
If the vast majority of the work visas of male immigrants , are the women who accompany them in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation .
`` These stories find echoes in the women 's organisations , '' she said .

While I am writing this , my view of the Spiralkabel that connects the phone to the phone , and I think : Boah , how retro is that ?
But behind it there is a thought : if the cable would not be flying in the shortest time of all listeners herrenlos in the house , and that would be significantly more retro .
Already applies in the ekeltronischen ( ekeltronischen ?
No , typos : electronic ) sector , the rule is that the world premiere of today is the electronic waste of tomorrow , bought - outdated .
And who still has a tube TV in the living room , for example , it simply says that he categorically refused television .
Why is this thinking ?
Because the Andrängen of Ifa on radio tower this week our absolute incompetence in electronics .
The layman , previously a washing machine and CD players dominated blind today do not even understand the purpose of the devices , which are spread with incredible eitlem experts speaking before him : `` Connected Home , Wearables , Healthcare and Urban Technologies '' promises the press office .
Yes , it is yet ?
What should we talk to people who voluntarily apparently such Quark spread ?
In fact , it is for some 20 years , above all , that we should let our house .
So even reordered the yoghurt so that tells us the fire alarm on holiday in the Maldives that burns in the office .
And would it not be wonderful if we in the office of the air conditioning in our early arrival ... ?
Yes it does , however , an air-conditioning .
But a dream will certainly soon be true : we will save our watch , say loudly `` suck ! '' - and at home , the Staubsaugroboter .
Misleading .
All amounts to nothing less than a revolution : `` the boundaries between white and brown goods blur , '' raunt an industry insiders , you can connect the washing machine with headphones , the Dampfgarer sends the weather report and data glasses indicates how long does the pizza in the oven , but what is pointless , because we are in a traffic jam .
From the daily practice , we also know that if a neumodisches device really is urgently needed , the battery is guaranteed to be empty .
Which is another reason why the Spiralkabel will survive the next radio shows on the phone .

Because before that might well have been able to write to the guests .
`` Thank goodness we have had a bit of luck today , '' noted also Schrammel , alluded to the divergence of performance and result in the last few weeks : `` the results have not voted , but the Spielerische was always good , '' compared to last year .
Barisic was even that `` in many games better than today '' - `` against '' the strongest team that played in this stadium this season .
The first Dreipunkter since 26 July have therefore proved that the team structure intact despite setbacks : `` today , my team has shown that it has '' character .
No less enjoyable for him : `` we finally played to zero . ''
A lot of work while countries break Even the fact that Brian Behrendt , Mario Pavelic , Christopher Dibon , Deni alar and Michael Schimpelsberger several failures , and Srdjan Grahovac , Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schob Berger gave their Startelfdebüts , make the victory even more valuable .

In recent weeks , we have not played as bad as it has been portrayed .
But we must not think that now it is all good .

The stick at certain stages in me , `` said Hofmann .
Grödig coach Michael Baur had little to reproach himself and his team .
He regretted the quick counter-hits `` from the category Zaubertor '' , as well as the regular gate of farm in the 40th minute by referee Kollegger wrongly denied .

Judge temporarily halts law that all abortion clinics in Louisiana could force closure
A US federal judge temporarily stopped on Sunday , the implementation of a law in Louisiana , which lawyers say that it probably would have led to the closure of all five abortion clinics in the state .
This measure , which was raised by Bobby Jindal , the governor of Louisiana , in June , on the law and will enter into force on 1 Sep , doctors who perform abortions , force to acquire a patient admission in a hospital within a radius of 30 miles of their practice .
The decision of the judge , however , means that doctors can temporarily still legal abortions , while they apply for such a right .
The law , `` the plaintiffs can continue , while trying to obtain these rights , '' Federal Judge John deGravelles wrote in his ruling .
Within a month , scheduled a hearing for the judge to a more permanent decision on the law .
Abortion advocates welcomed the decision , the latest in a series of rulings against similar measures , and said that doctors win more time to gain hospital admission rights .
`` Today 's decision means that women want to avoid a devious law in Louisiana , their health and their rights , '' said Nancy Northup , president and chairman of the Center for reproductive rights , which had sued on behalf of three of the five clinics in the state to stop the law .
It was not immediately clear whether the judgment to the doctors from the two clinics , which are not connected to the lawsuit , and also had applied for admission rights .
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have enacted similar laws , but courts have recently declared such measures in Alabama and Mississippi to be unconstitutional .
Key points of a law in Texas , the majority of the remaining clinics in the state have been forced to close , were stopped by a federal judge on Friday .

If all other doctors in the state to be forced to perform any abortions , this doctor would no longer carry out of fear for his safety , the operation , the group said .

Children need roots and wings
He was 44 years at the school , including 23 as head teacher .
This time , Manfred Richter knows many hardend Petershausener and Kollbacher from their time as students .
His methods were sometimes unconventional , but always driven by his desire to see the students to the people .
The Sn is the most famous mountain in the Giant Mountains .
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the theme from his home .
Richter was born in 1930 in Trautenau/North Bohemia , today .
Even with 14 he became interested after four years of high school for the teaching profession .
A year later we were deprived of the Sudeten Germans .
Within half an hour , the family had to leave her home .

After two months , Manfred Richter in a Red Cross shelter in Bamberg , a bed , along with up to 15 classmates in a dormitory .
In 1951 , he was the first in 1954 and , after three years of teaching candidates the second state exam .
Since Oberfranken had no free teacher for him , he applied to Upper Bavaria and went to the school on 1 November 1954 Kollbach .
`` The Miss-room '' was his first `` home '' in the schoolhouse .
In 1958 , he was in the new buildings teachers house next to the school , a three-room-service housing .
This house , Manfred Richter bought in 1980 , after the school had been dissolved in Kollbach in 1968 .
Until then , there were hosted in Kollbach in school association Peter Kollbach three classes and five in Peter .
From the school year 1968/69 they were summarized in today 's City Hall in Peter .
When the school association was founded in Indian village , only remained the primary school in the village .
In order to avoid demotion in the smaller school , the rector George Sigl after Karl field - and Manfred Richter was his successor .
But Peter grew , and so were the children and their teachers from September 1982 to today 's building , which was extended to judge 's retirement in 1997 .
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of then-mayor Ludwig Götz , which build on municipal costs in addition to a workroom and enlargement cellars in 1997 , although that was not eligible according to the guidelines for school buildings .
`` Mayor Götz was very friendly '' school , remembered grateful judges .
Throughout his career , Manfred Richter has never forgotten the speech of a government representative , who had responded to a unit of a council of Law and Justice : `` one must never forget the love . '' Manfred judge for what he had heard as a young teacher .
`` You have to give to the children of two things : roots and wings , '' says the now 84-year-old .
And he had to know : `` that is not always possible . '' As to whether he thinks his students or just his own six children , is not entirely clear .
In any case , a judge was sometimes unconventional actions .
If students were prügelten , they got from him , not a criminal work , and not the Nachsitzen were ordered .
Judges had two pairs of Boxhandschuhe acquired at the expense of the community and the two contractors compete against each other , even if it should even be a violet .
For the good of the school used as judges have a good relationship with the then-mayor Ludwig Götz ( CSU ) .
This moved the partyless judge after his retirement , at least in 1996 , the last on the CSU list to stand for the council .
But judge was selected at number six and joined the CSU .

With Rona Fair Head , the BBC has found perhaps the great director , she needs .
It is a proud Ruhmesschleppe from the banking world , the media management , and the inner circle of the Tory Party .
And it has its own front line experience .
Her career began at the global management consulting firm Bain and Co. , as she moved to Morgan Stanley , Bombadier , ICI , and the media world of Pearson 's .
She was chairman of the Financial Times for seven years and came back when the top post of the parent company Pearson 's went to a younger male colleagues .
Their compensation amounted to almost £ 1 million last year .
Their political ranking is also solid .
It was David Cameron by Lord Browne , the former chairman of BP recommended when he was looking for more private-sector expertise in Whitehall : it was the adviser of the cabinet .
Her husband is a former Tory councillor .
In May , I described the job of the chairman with a poisoned chalice .
Not only is the BBC as a vast and complex entity in the heart of public life , but there is also an internal paradox in its structure .
The trust works in two directions : inward to the first Guard 's own management hierarchy at the BBC , but also externally as the voice of public concern and unrest , if things go wrong .
This makes for an almost unsustainable duopoly , which requires a full comprehensive reform .
But the new incoming chairman would risk , to everything and an institution , which is as complex as a Chinese dynasty , while he himself perhaps brings to his job .
It is a difficult task .
And as if that were not enough , are also still many interested to see the BBC reduced overtaken - power , money and status .
While the competition approaches and new technologies threaten the old , comfortable certainties , the forthcoming negotiations of license fees for the BBC with special dangers .
For the modest sum of 145.50 pounds per year , is buying the British public in certainly the world 's largest media company .
The BBC tells a good story : she says that she achieved 96 percent of all households , and each of them costs only 40 pence per day .
And apparently the BBC is rising again on the popularity scale upwards : 53 percent support them today , compared to 31 percent 10 years ago .
The impaired vision and usage habits for the BBC have changed : I get today news headlines on my mobile and I see missed programs later on my iPlayer .
But it remains a very popular and important institution .
She needs a considerable chairman - I hope she has found him .

On the bouncy castle at the castle garden , had a lot on Saturday .
The concept of the organisers .
Despite the strong Regengusses on Saturday evening , an estimated 1200 music fans to the open-air festival in the castle garden .
At times had to be stopped at all .
`` It was annoying , '' said Ron Sem , one of the organizers .
Salzwedel l light and fun .
Two Spanish words Maxim Sachraj and Ron Shem , the name of Amula .
Because the Open Air in the Salzwedeler castle garden brightness radiate through various shows during the day and evening .
Oh , and the fun comes from anyway .
This became evident early on Saturday , when the first visitors to the open air journeys .
A feast for all generations , the organizers had promised .
And they have done it .
It had Salzwedeler , but also guests from their immediate surroundings relaxing around the supply levels at the castle garden lawn .
They watched the first live performances , wippten with one foot to the beat , enjoyed cool drinks - in short : pure relaxation and enjoyment .
And across the generations .
While the one on blankets on the extra angekarrten white sand at the beach bar lümmelten , others raged at a quarter of wine in the wine labten , the young on the bouncy castle , which was a great attraction for the smaller guests .
But even in the crafts of the volunteers had their hands full in the truest sense of the word , to the onslaught of spells and imaginative creations in the little faces .
Adults took the Kickertische or took part in a skateboard workshop that the Good Foot-crew from Salzwedel .
Until the big rain came .
Shortly before 5 : 30.00 p.m. prasselte down to the visitors , especially families sought the vastness and dry .
But the attraction of the festival did not diminish .
`` There were more people than expected , '' said Ron Sem , who spoke of a `` success across the board . ''
Therefore am a repeat of the major party in the coming year .
Although the event is still working on the content and size , Sem , in a first assessment on Sunday with the popular vote , made it clear .
He described as annoying that the admission had to be stopped .
Obviously , the security company has been booked with too little staff .
The result : some people who had already paid , were no longer on the site .
The response has been very good .
In a first tentative estimate said the Salzwedeler participates in about 1200 visitors who once thronged in the castle garden .
There have been problems in the marriage .
The Salzwedeler hip-hop band blocks'n'Rox broke their appearance so unnerved .
The technicians were not able to create a semi-reasonable tone .
The planned shisha lounges could not be built because the tents are not due to a puncture could be transferred to Salzwedel .
`` Next year , but they will be , '' according to the organizers .
The premiere of the Amula Open Airs was more than achieved by the number of visitors .
And in bad weather .
However , the organizers have made some mistakes , for the first time , but must be eliminated at the second edition .
Also on the social network Facebook organizers criticism .
`` Sorry , but for 12 euros you just expected more , '' says Melanie Meier on the event page .
`` You have unfortunately taken a bit , '' says Ele Zimmermann at the same place .
Others see the teething problems are not quite so closely .
I think it is very good that some chat is not only stupid , but also to really try to put something on the floor .
Hats off ! `` , writes Stephanie Jenß to Amula .
Now the organizers this time next year to address these criticisms .

And he also explained his pacifism , his critique of society , its political commitment - and also how it has shaped not only the music ( the opera lover became the soul and rock musician ) , but also his prison stay .
The latter has the living man Konstantin alarm is also closer to the ascetic monk , `` created by subtraction , '' as he says , `` by saying '' everything Unnötige saves .

Leonidas asked into the gladiator arena
Not only the gladiators stood ankle in the slush at the first Rhine wild boar Roman day in the recreational park .
Nevertheless the attraction of the event was strong enough in order to attract far more than 1000 visitors yesterday that defied the rain showers and the autumnal cold and be completely enthusiastic from the historical racket let .
There was a colored round of representations , performances , games , exhibits and information about the time of the Romans and their importance for the Rhineland .
The martial fighter troop of the gladiator school of `` Amor Mortis '' , who used every rain pause for demonstrating their robust combat art in the arena preserved with soft sand , was main attraction of the day beyond doubt
Gladiator owner `` Leonidas '' proved to be humorous and competent presenter and sent his men after each other to the ring for the heroic duel in different gladiator types .
First it was up to the `` Provocatoren '' with rectangular shield and Kurzschwert as well as football pad at the left leg and splint at the right arm .
The `` Essedarii '' with breast-plate , short sword and throw lance as well as iron gladiator helmet , leg and arm protection , followed .
The appearance of the `` Retiarius '' who competed with the `` Secutor '' with casting net , trident and dagger and pushed the lad to ground after short fight was especially impressive .
There the swords cracked metallically at each other , the shields schepperten and the throw lances flew humming through the arena , that one fear and bangs could become around the health of the gladiators .
However onto those ones the imposing `` Summa Rudis '' , the muscular referee an always attentive eye , had .
`` We wanted to make the roman everyday life revive again and make the culture of the Roman time erlebbar '' , explained the intention to Lorenz Euskirchen , chairperson of the organizer `` Circle of friends Römerkanal '' , behind the racket .
After two years of preparation time an `` Oppidum Romanum '' , a roman city , became from the recreational park for a day as Vizebürgermeister Claus Wehage found in his greeting word .
Finally the Romans did not bring only war and conquest in our region but also the roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today .
Remains of that were to be marveled at also at the Roman day , about instance `` aqueduct marble '' of the Roman channel bridge eleven meters high and 1400 meters long that some day stood at Lüftelberg .
The Frontinus-society compared the water and energy supply once and now , and manageress Petra Fricke knew : `` We profit today still from the knowledge from then '' .
That confirms also diploma surveyor Ralph Heiliger of the `` IngenieurteamZwei '' from Rhine creek the measurement instruments ' of the Romans as Chorobat , Groma or Dioptra imagined .
The Roman villa into rough drafts presented to Blankenheim and models of the excavations anno 1894 as well as bricks from the Original-Hypokauste , the hot air heating which once warmed up the Roman villa .
Impressing also the footprints that had been left behind by wolf and fox two millennia ago in the kicks of clay before one burned these .
In 2011 the office had dug up the remains of a roman villa for ground care of monuments with the case of the Rhineland country association in the trade park north in Rheinbach .
One found encirclement walls of a building for farming for industry for trade building building with a drying kiln for the drying of grain and for the malting .
The building probably belonged to a villa Rustica , an agricultural good explained the archeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser .
She introduced a series of find pieces from these excavations in a glass showcase cabinet , under that a big plate , several fine glass envelopes as well as parts of a dainty necklace .
The villa existed presumably from the first up to the fourth century according to Christ , up to the idea of the Germans in the then roman Rhineland , Morscheiser presumes .
With it the children occupied themselves furthermore with the roman windmill game , similar to the present nine men 's morris , or they wrote their names with metal styluses as once the roman pupils on guard boards
At the state of the Roman thermal springs Zülpich the children mosaics themselves were allowed to put , make glass mosaics at the state of the glass museum Rhine creek and help themselves Nettersheim at the state of the Eifel natural center a heavy wheat mill of stone in order to mill the flour for a pancake bread or a muesli
With the faithfully reproduced roman touring car pulled by two cold-blooded animals the visitors went through the recreational park and got in this case also past the impressive state of the Urban grammar school that `` presented '' the results of their `` Roman project weeks '' here .
With a Roman week of the 13th to 21st September also the municipality guard mountain into that brings in Rhineland-wide called out Roman year 2014 , that is supposed to remind Augustus of the death of emperor 2000 years ago .
Together with the home and history associations as well as the Wachtberger wandering-association , the partnership association and the amateur play circle Oberbachem among other things thematic excursions become , a lecture , cook evenings as well as leaderships for classes demanded and of the roman past Wachtbergs remind .
In this case for example a roman legionnaire will tell about his work on the drafty guard mountain , plants than living monument introduced from the Roman time and a witty teaching-hour as regards nation communication between a group presented to Wachtberger `` Germans '' and consulted Romans .
The Adendorfer elementary school dedicates itself within the framework of a project week to the Roman topic .
With the Roman week the numerous ones are supposed to be done frequently but no more at first sight visible tracks of the Romans in guard mountain in an again learnable way .
In the Wachtberger city hall a small presentation will remind of the find of the Berkumer matron sanctuary in the year 1879 .

Merkel speaks command : Toll will come `` very clearly ''
Now the chancellor stands up once again clearly for that .
A charter for all complicated details is not it , however .
Stubborn objections from the CDU against the car-toll angered the CSU rapidly .
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke a command to continuous resistances from their CDU for the introduction of a car-toll .
`` In order to say it very clearly : It stands in the coalition contract , and it will come '' , said the party leader on Monday after meetings of the CDU top committees in Berlin .
Merkel did not commit himself to a detailed model for the time being , however .
In the black-red government program `` certain parameters '' are mentioned .
Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt ( CSU ) `` did a proposal and that is `` weitergearbeitet '' at now '' .
The NRW-CDU insists , however , on their refusal of a toll now on all streets .
Merkel stressed , also Minister of Finance Wolfgang Schäuble ( CDU ) brings in constructively into the consultations for a bill .
Beyond the topic he talked with Dobrindt also about further possibilities to activate more private capital for investments in infrastructure about instance also during the broadband expansion .
`` There nothing special is at all `` at that '' . Schäuble had let on Sunday a `` mirror '' report uncommentedly , his house examines an own draft in order to compensate highway investors with toll gains - after the choice 2017 .
CSU leader thicket Seehofer warned then before developing in the cabinet toll draft against the responsible minister .
CDU-Bundesvize Armin Laschet confirmed his objections .
`` The coalition contract never came from that , all circular and federal streets too bemauten '' , the North Rhine-Westphalian CDU country chairperson said .
In this respect it is an important signal that Seehofer announced now to talk about the topic once again .
Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate comes to resistance to the plans also from the CDU country associations
Apprehensions are background , that a toll influences the small border traffic to neighboring states .
Seehofer had demanded coalition faith because of the toll criticism from rows of the CDU .
The left winger regards the plans as failed faced with the quarrel in the union .
`` The fiddling-toll is dead '' , said party leader Bernd Riexinger of the `` Neuen Osnabrücker newspaper '' ( Monday ) .
`` The minister fails with the toll '' . Dobrindt wants to introduce a vignette duty on all German streets which is supposed to start in 2016 .
Domestic car owners must not be burdened according to coalition contract , however , besides addition .
Therefore they are supposed to receive a full compensation for the toll about the car-tax .
The model must not put foreign drivers at a disadvantage , however , according to EU right because of their nationality .

Feminists criticize according to racial issue and police behaviors Ferguson
The unarmed teenager became beginning this month of a police officer in Ferguson , Mo . killed .
The participants lifted their hands into the air and sang , `` Hands high , not fire '' while they were waiting before the funeral .
After two week long protests in Ferguson , Mo , because of the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists .
After their experience white feminist commentators put the sex before the race if it is a question of speaking to reproduction right and income inequalities
While the tensions were going up in the Middle west , however , and receiving country observation as a whole , Perez saw that the answers were about the race from white women to 100 % .
In comparison with the answers of black women shortly to the shots of the 9th August the personal essays with titles as `` Thoughts '' came `` of a white woman '' to Ferguson '' and `` Feminism does not turn only around the suppression from women '' relatively late .
But for Perez that meant an important change .
`` I do not believe that one finds many people in the feminism that be about the white and speak privileges in so highly class way she said .
The people felt for this purpose pressed into squeezing out something for the incidents .
It is characteristic for the crisis , in which we are and because the situation is so ethnisiert in Ferguson that they must squeeze that out .
For English professor Koritha Mitchell of the Ohio state University Ferguson problems onto the light to whom black Americans that , however , are considered not as `` Woman topics '' in the cultural room are abandoned every day brought .
`` I can publish something merry on Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 Likes here from everywhere '' , said Mitchell .
If I post something over how colors stand in their own country under siege , the silence is deafening .
`` How it can be for women secure to talk about a relationship in public , however , not about security in the public room she asked .
For black women as Mitchell who studied race , sex and sexuality in the history of the USA there is not any dichotomy between race and sex problems .
For them black women did not have the luxury , to separate the topics cleanly ; they live every day in the combined reality .
While white women are combining the topics now race and sex in the feminist main stream circles Angela Hattery , professor for women and sex research at the George Mason University , says that their predecessors did the opposite .
`` In between 1865 and 1890 at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the reason was almost always the rape of a white woman '' , said Hattery .
White women had to be participated in the history in order to justify the lynching-murder .
For Hattery the split came between white and black women at the point at which white fighters analyzed the country for the woman right to vote as Susan B. Anthony in the late years of the 19th century and stated that the fight could be successful for the right to vote only for in each case a group : Women or blacks .
`` You made the decision to support the woman right to vote and the right to vote for blacks should come later '' , said Hattery .
If one remembers such things , it becomes conscious to one with power why colored women do not trust white women .
We did not make our job good .
We never helped black women with protecting their husbands and sons .
Also after women received the right to vote in 1920 , it lasted another decade until white women organized themselves against the lynching in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching .
The group arose almost 40 years according to the initial request around help on the part of black women , says Mitchell .
For Mitchell the flood of white feminist reactions to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behavior , race discrimination - is a mirror of the time , in which white feminists `` call tracing call holds '' played with the problems with which black women sat down from each other since generations .
`` It would not be fabulous , when the activists , the feminist platforms traditional over such decree the right to education of a child so seriously would take as they put that with the right onto conception control '' '' ? Mitchell asked .
Feminists of the second generation that based their career on the fight for reproduction rights and the access to contraceptive means attempt to understand now what means that .
The known white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went two weeks after the shooting from Michael Brown on Facebook and published a pointed article of Rebecca Carroll , columnist of the guerrilla warfare in which it demands more protests from white Americans on the topic racism .
`` I hope for women who have an other , but parallel reason for understanding a danger being inherent in the body - and opinion on the race which are clearly different in public inquiries - mentioning the changes '' , wrote Steinem .
Although Steinem stands for a rather intersektionalen feminism , in which Rassen- in the same way as sex topics are spoken to , some of their comments on the race topic are nevertheless amazed in America .
Christina summer , researcher at the American one of Enterprise of institutes and authoress of `` Who Stole Feminism ? '' said opposite She The People , that young men in the United States , in particular young colored men , `` are far more vulnerable than their sisters , however , '' Steinems remarks on Ferguson conflict too their former criticism
There are now hundreds of specific programs for girls and young women , however almost nothing for boys .
But as the White House recently a small program , My Brother 's Keeper , put on in order to help vulnerable young black and hispanischen men there were annoyed reactions of many feminists , under that Gloria Steinem .
The relation of the police to the the black Community is not the only problem , that into the foreground of the main stream feminism pushes .
After the US border police picked up almost 63,000 unaccompanied capella minors at the southwest border of the country this year , also the topic of the immigration reform goes again onto the surface - this time as a woman topic .
Andrea Mercado , co-chairperson of We Belong Together , of an organization which mobilizes women for the immigration reform said that for a new consideration of the topic as an essential woman topic she must publish only the histories of the immigrant women .
`` These speak for themselves , '' Mercado said .
If the great majority of the work visas goes onto masculine immigrants , the women who accompany it are in a position in which they are sensitive to domestic power and exploitation .
`` Find these histories a reverberation in the woman organizations '' , she said .

Amazon buys Twitch for 1.04 billion $
AMAZON confirmed just what information had told on Monday morning : The online-retailer - and video producer , and a great number of other things - buys the Videostreamingdienst Twitch for 1.04 billion $ ( 970 million US- $ ) .
The announcement comes surprisingly , not because nobody had expected a takeover of Twitch , but because it was presumed to a large extent that YouTube would gain the enterprise .
Three months ago it looked like this , as if the sale of Twitch were onto the video service of Google for one cool billion thing decided on , and the cooperation appeared also natural
Twitch that only three years ago as Justin.tv was founded had started as general Streamingdienst - a live version of YouTube .
Instead of this that it wanted to publish their acts of daring a platform quickly for players in games , a `` YouTube for live games '' , such an insider .
The Twitch-interface .
And give `` let 's play '' , a video genre , to the ( mostly older ) games in the smart aleck one painting of paint of hermetism theater , are on YouTube already very much popular .
It is now like this that YouTube is often named if one wants to describe Twitch , therefore it became the information that YouTube Twitch wanted to buy , something boredly picked up , a textbook example of an established technique enterprise that buys up a potential competitor .
It is a puzzle why deal with YouTube was not achieved to that one since the enterprise was ready to pay so much as Amazon according to reports .
All that we know at the moment about that is this statement of Emmet Shear , president of Twitch : `` We decided for Amazon because they believe in our Community they split up our values and long-term visions and they want to help us with reaching there more quickly . ''
A further secret is , honestly said , the incredible success of Twitch .
For snobs as me that declare that they do sport more gladly than to watch during that , is to watch it to others during the playing heavily to understand the attraction that comes from that instead of taking even the control console into the hand .
It is a thing to look to a friend at 3 o'clock in the morning over the shoulder while she is creeping through resident Evil and something very else , to watch to a silkworm moth during how it is fired into the head 20 times after each other in call of Duty .
All these games could now just look at you .
Another problem lies in many of the most popular games being ego-games today , therefore the watching without own control of the look perspective can be a correctly good prescription for headaches .
I add , that the quickness flows into which the Roger Bannisters of our electronics age complete whole games in record time , entertaining are .
But as long as a game or humor virtuoso is not in this case , his Twitch-channel is not presumably so very much interesting .
But what sceptics know as I already of that ?
Twitch is called of 55 million different visitors monthly and the fourth-biggest source of internet traffic peaks is .
And as exactly Amazon wants to make money from that ?
It is heavy to introduce oneself that Twitch is integrated so elegantly in Amazon Instant Video as YouTube Twitch could simply have swallowed .
But Twitch has something which would have every enterprise gladly : Thousands of young men who are umworben as advertising-customers .
How the chairperson of Twitch , Shear , did not say yet Amazon and Twitch `` believe both at the future of the Gaming '' , '' and the medium does not show any signs of a shrinkage once - swallow - as spectator sport .

When some years ago the 2nd table tennis district class was deleted for the purpose of tensioning of the league-division , that was a step into the correct direction .
Now the German Table Tennis Federal Government took an additional 3rd Federal League into the program .
The consequence : Who did not climb up descended .
So Göttingens class-highest team torpedo avoided indeed the descent in the Second League Relegation , plays in the coming season , however , only still fifth class .
Fourth-Class ladies have torpedoes , in spite of their overwhelming passage into the regional league .
The boys and girls of torpedo start in the Lower Saxony league , in the same way as the boys of the SC Weende .
Upon the SG Lenglern and the torpedo reserve enter in the new association league , in the country league no Göttinger clubs are more represented .
With the ladies the TTV Geismar in the association league , the torpedo-second in the country league , plays .
What of the composition looks like a better district class is now the new district Second League south .
Here Hammenstedt , Bovender SV , Langenholtensen , the FC of Weser and the TTC at , step torpedo III , Geismar , Einbeck , to TSV Seulingen , VfB Lödingsen .
In the district league Dransfeld and the SC Weende allude as regional representatives , in which district class of the TTC II , red white , the Bovender SV II and the teams of the TTV Geismar II and III . The district Second League of the ladies begins at least in establishment .
Güntersen , the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are here with of the lot .
In the district league start torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen run .
With each nine teams
The SC Weende sends his girls to the small district league .
Also the district league relay of the SCW-boys - there torpedo II still sets off - is not complete .
In a district class Geismar , Tuspo Weende and the Bovender SV go into the season .
The two Göttinger circular leagues with each nine teams compete in the first season of the again based region association
In the west-relay torpedo IV and V , MTV Grone , Dransfelder SC II , Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II , are the red-white II , Bovender SV III , lukewarm creek II .
In the east-relay Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen , Santa Claus mountain and Landolfshausen play among other things .
The lady circular league consists of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen II , Bilshausen , Hemeln , Seulingen II , Tuspo Weende and the SG Rhume .
That is still better than in the circle Osterode , where there are not any lady-teams anymore at all on circular level .
Becoming noticeable , that none of the six 2.Kreisklassen reaches establishment , here the innovative and umtriebige circular executive board will have to be concerned already once .

In a comment onto the New Press it contradicts statements of the manager Peer Medau and certifies this to pose `` as a commander '' .
The style of the college is not this , it is said in the communication
So the family Medau is already `` verbal '' To `` Middle June about the unreasonable request of the college informed .
The statement that the plans became known only in July , are definitively wrong so Pötzl .
Simultaneously he refers to it not being a question of `` Vorfestlegungen or decisions at all '' with the case of the plans , however , there being `` preferences '' .
Also the expansion of the narrow street , necessary for the access up to the castle is less dramatic than feared by the Medaus .
From a nine meters wide street was and it is not talked .
It is a question to present state of 5.50 meters , that is '' a meter more widely than up to now , '' declared Pötzl .
The argument of the Medau-operators that their parking areas clear of all charges and school-own in future are used then only still by students of the college wants to make not be meant for Pötzl .
Zugeparkt does not become at all because that can be dissolved as at other public parking places in the meantime intelligently .
Think of the residents
The creche Bergwichtel that is on the ground and before whose entry door would lead along the access to the parking deck is not supposed to be influenced according to the university education president .
Rather it gives to consider `` that it is not a question only of the creche here but also around the residents at the emptying to the Friedrich Streib street and the 800 pupils of the adjacent secondary school .
It is a question therefore of a lot more than of individual interests of the gentlemen Medau '' , so Pötzl .
Whether the criticism of the parent advisory board of the creche , with the expansion of the street would `` disappear '' to one of `` the few natural spots Coburgs '' entitled is , `` the reader itself can decide '' .
At the beginning of October Pötzl wants to inform the town councils councillors together with the State Construction Office Bamberg of the structural development of the college to 2020 `` and speak to the importance of the new development in this connection

Richter stops law temporarily , that all abortion clinics could force in Louisiana for the closing
A US federal judge stopped on Sunday the conversion of a law into Louisiana , from which attorneys say that it would presumably have led to the closing of all five abortion clinics of the state , temporarily .
This measure which was raised by Bobby Jindal , governor of Louisiana , in June for the law and is supposed to come into force on 1st Sept. would force doctors who carry out abortions to gaining a reception admission right near a hospital within a radius of 30 miles around their practice .
The decision of the judge means , however , that the doctors keep on being able to carry on abortions legally temporarily while they are applying for such right .
`` The complainants can weiterarbeiten law-consistently while they '' are `` making '' an effort for the attainment of these rights , wrote federal judge John deGravelles in his judgment .
Within a month a hearing is scheduled for the judge in order to cause a lasting decision for the law .
Abortion proponents welcomed the decision , the youngest one in a series of judgments against similar measures and said that doctors would win so more time in order to attain hospital installation rights .
`` Meant `` the present decision that the women escape '' in Louisiana '' `` an insidious law that wants to take their health and their rights from them '' , Nancy Northup , president and chairperson of the center for reproduction rights that had complained on behalf of three of the five clinics of the state in order to stop the law , said .
It was not immediately clear whether the judgment applied also to the doctors from the two clinics which had not followed the complaint and applied also installation rights at it .
Louisiana is to one of 11 states that enacted similar laws at which courts have declared recently such measures in Alabama and Mississippi for not constitution
Key places of a law in Texas , which would have forced most of the clinics remained in the state for the closing , were stopped by a federal judge on Friday .
Abortion proponent and the American college of Ostretricians and Gynecologists as well as the American Medical Association say matchingly that installation rights require unnecessary restrictions from doctors .
Abortion opponents object that that the measures are used for the protection of the health of the women although some welcomed also the effects of a closing of clinics .
Only a doctor that carries out abortions in Louisiana , proceeded above Patienteineinweiserechte , informed of the center for reproduction rights .
If all remaining doctors are forced in the state not to carry out any abortions anymore , this doctor would not carry out the operation anymore for fear around his security said the group .
During their argumentation against the judgment representatives of the Louisiana state said that they would not punish any doctors because of the realization of abortions during whom requests for Patienteneinweiserechte would still be pendant .

China refuses right to government choice Hong Kong , demonstrators swear retaliation
On Sunday the Chinese parliament decided in spite of the increasing calls after democratic reforms against the nomination of candidates for the choices in 2017 through the electorate from Hong Kong .
This procedure inspires presumably the long announced protests in Hong Kong 's business district while activists were leading the planning and mobilization for this purpose within less hours according to the announcement into the ways .
The decision of the Chinese nation congress to reject all candidates not Peking-loyal allows it to the communist leaders fundamentally .
`` That does not come unexpectedly , but nevertheless it makes us furious '' , said right expert Emily Lau , chairperson of the Democratic Party .
That is not what Peking had promised .
One lay to the inhabitants from Hong Kong .
And it is clear that we have to do it with an authoritarian regime .
In his defense of the Chinese decision Li Fei , vicesecretary-general of the Constant Committee of the National Nation Congress , said that the admission of public nominations would be too `` chaotic '' at the choices for the government from Hong Kong .
Since 1997 , when Great Britain returned the control of Hong Kong to the Chinese , Peking promised to make the inhabitants from 2017 choose the government chairmanship .
The Chinese leadership presented the decision of the Sunday as a democratic breakthrough because there is a direct right to vote to the citizens of Hong Kong , but the decision makes also clearly that the Chinese leadership keeps the course firmly through a nomination committee closely controlled by Peking in the hand .
According to a new stipulation only candidates `` with love of the country and love of Hong Kong '' are in addition supposed to be admitted .
The decision follows a summer in which some of the greatest and most public-effective protests were occurring in Hong Kong for many years .
Behind the prodemocratic campaign in Hong Kong the movement Occupy Central With Love and Peace stands that organizers threatened with cutting off the finance district if Peking does not approve any real general right to vote
At the Sunday evening hundreds of Occupy-Central-supporters had met within few hours according to the announcement in the rain before the government headquarters in Hong Kong .
During the demonstration the organizers said that their movement reached a new stage of civilian disobedience and they planned protest waves in the coming weeks .
You did not give any nearer information to apparently avoiding around problems with the authorities , however .
In an online communication the organizers informed , that the movement `` the occupation of the central district only when last means took into account , an action that only then is supposed to occur if all dialog chances are exploited and no other choice withstands .
We are sorry about having to say that all dialog chances were exploited today and the occupation of the central district will occur definitively .
The authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing themselves for the announcement of Peking for days , and intensified security measures measures were valid on Sunday before the government building including police forces and barricades .
The riots are supported by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they lose the control of their city slowly .
The Zuzug of people of the mainland intensifies the competition around products and services .
In addition the fear increases , that the Worth Hong Kong 's as democracy and freedom of speech under the wachsenden pressure of Peking begin to crumble .
Some criticized the demonstrations of the Occupy-Central-movement since it endangers the business concern - the lifeline of Hong Kong .
`` The protests which they speak of could cause great economical damage , depending on whether , how many are participated in that and how long they last '' , right expert Regine Ip said that criticizes the movement for a long time .
We do not want to stir up any apprehensions , that Hong Kong gets out of control .
This impression is bad at investments .
The from a government viewpoint controlled media of China reported also recently about the democracy activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled from western powers .
In this summer activists organized an unofficial referendum for the choice rights which 780,000 people participated in - more than one fifth of the voters in Hong Kong .
In July tens of thousands participated in one of the greatest democracy demonstrations in the history of the region

Children need roots and wings
44 years it was in the teaching profession , of that 23 as headmasters .
From this time Manfred Richter knows many stood Petershausener and Kollbacher from their time as pupils .
His methods were sometimes unconventional , however , always taken from his aspiration to see the human being in the pupil .
The Schneekoppe is the best known mountain of the giant mountains .
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motive from his home .
Richter was born in 1930 in Trautenau/north Bohemias , today Trutnov .
Already with 14 he was interested in the teacher profession after four years of high school .
A year after that the Sudeten German ones were expropriated .
Within half an hour the family had to leave their house .
After some months in a warehouse it went in 1946 to Bavaria - in the good freight car carriage .
So it brought judges into the upper-Franconian depression village .
The teacher education occurred in Bamberg .
For this purpose Manfred Richter six times weekly had to run ten kilometers to the next railway station , go going with the railways according to Bamberg , there three kilometers crossways through the whole city to the school and in the evening back .
After two months Manfred Richter got a sleep occasion in a red-cross-home in Bamberg : together with up to 15 schoolmates in a sleep hall .
In 1951 it did teaching position candidate the first and in 1954 after three years the second state examination .
Since Oberfranken did not have any free teacher place for it he applied after upper Bavarians and came on 1st November 1954 onto the school in Kollbach .
The `` young woman room '' was his first `` official residence '' in the school building .
In 1958 he got a three room official residence in the again built teacher house next to the school .
Manfred Richter bought this house in 1980 after the school had been solved in Kollbach 1968 .
Until then there were three classes in Kollbach in the school association Petershausen-Kollbach and in Peter beluga five .
From the school year 1968/69 these were summarized in Peter beluga in the present city hall .
When the school association Indian village was based , only still the elementary school stayed in the place .
In order to escape a moving-graduation in the now smaller school , the former rector Georg Sigl changed according to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor .
However , Peter beluga increased , and so the children and their teachers from September 1982 could get the present construction which was expanded in 1997 after Richters superannuation .
Manfred Richter praises the simple generosity of the former mayor Ludwig Götz , that additional on municipality costs a craft room and build 1997 cellar rooms during the enlargement made although that was not subsidy-capable to the guidelines for school constructions
`` Mayor Götz was very school-friendly '' , remembered judge thankfully .
In his whole career Manfred Richter has never forgotten the speech contribution of a government representative which had answered a paper of a school council on right and justice : `` One must never forget the love '' . Manfred Richter transformed , what it had belonged to there as a young teacher .
`` One must give the children two kinds : Roots and wings '' , the today 84-year long one says .
And he had to find out : `` That does always not succeed '' . Whether it means only his pupils or just the same his own six children there is not very clear .
Always Richters actions were sometimes unconventional .
If pupils fought , they did not get a punishment work from it and did not become either the Nachsitzen verdonnert .
At the expense of the municipality Richter had made buy two pairs of boxing gloves and made the two opponents be lined up against each other even if there should be once in this case a violet .
For the welfare of the school Richter maintained a good relation to the former mayor Ludwig Götz ( CSU ) as a rector .
This convinced the independent judge of that after his superannuation , 1996 at least than last to run for the district council on the CSU list .
However Richter was dialed on place six and the CSU joined .

Matthies means : Highest time for the great cross-linking
Faced with the galloping technical progress that it threatens to change our comfortable into High-Tech control rooms home our columnist Bernd Matthies with some extremely familiar electronic accessories comforts himself .
While I am writing that here , my look falls onto the coiled cord which unites the listener with the telephone , and I think : Boah , as retro that is then ?
But a consideration is behind that : If the cable was not , all listeners would fly around in shortest time in an abandoned way in the house , and that would be still significantly more retro .
Anyhow is valid on the ekeltronischen ( ekeltronischen ?
No , typographical error : electronic ) sector the rule , that the world novelty is the electroscrap from today from tomorrow , bought - goes out of date .
And who has a tube television set for example today still in the living room , that one only says in this way that he refuses television fundamentally .
Why these considerations ?
Because the pushing of the Ifa makes our absolute incompetence to us clear again at the radio tower in this week in questions of the electronics .
The layman who mastered formerly washing machine and CD Player blindly does not understand today even the purpose of the devices which are spread with incomprehensibly vain Expertensprech in front of it `` Connected Home , Wearables , Health Care and Urban Technologies '' promise us the press office .
It still works ?
Over what one is supposed to talk to people , the apparently voluntary such curd expand ?
Basically it is a question for about 20 years particularly of our being supposed to cross-link our house most pleasingly .
So that the yogurt itself reorders itself so that the fire detector on vacation informs us on the Maldives that it burns in the study grad .
And it would not be wonderful , when we from the office the air-conditioning onto our quick arrival ... ?
Yes , however , an air-conditioning presupposes that .
But a dream is completely determined soon true : We lift our wristwatch say to her according to `` Sucking ! '' - and at home the vacuum-cleaning-robot sets off .
Mad people .
Everything does not come to anything smaller than a revolution does : `` The borders between white and brown product become blurred '' , a branch expert whispers , one can connect the washing machine with some headphones , who sends to steam the weather report and the data glasses indicate how long the pizza still needs in the oven , what , however , does not use anything because we stand in the jam .
From the daily practice we in addition know : If a fashionable device is once really needed urgently , is guaranteed the accumulator empty
What a further reason for that is that the coiled cord will survive also the next radio shows at the telephone .

Tax burden of businessmen in the Washington room increases with the economical recovery
A recovery of the economy means more customers , more sales and new jobs .
It means also higher taxes .
State and local notices of assessment assessment notices bills demands levies for enterprises in the country went up in the last year easily while the economical recovery was speeding up , such an again published study in the last week , and the companies in the Washington room did not form any exception .
Enterprises in the room District , Maryland and Virginia paid together 27.6 billion $ to state and local places in the finance year 2013 , a rise , around 3.8 percent opposite the gains of 2012 at the level of 26.6 billion $ .
The state and local tax burden of the enterprises went up in the last year about 4.3 percent onto 671 billion $ , in comparison with 3.9 percent per year before , and it was the third growth year in consequence after the several years of sinking answers 2009 and 2010 .
State taxes went up more strongly than the local deliveries about 4.3 percent , so the study , that of the service agency seriousness & Young with the center for State Taxation was carried on , a fiscal policy group .
More than half of the tax yields of the District , 56 percent , comes from enterprise taxes while 36 percent of the gains Marylands are coming from enterprises .
Virginia achieves the least tax yields with 28 percent from enterprises .
A majority of the rise with the case of the tax yields is reasonable in a recovery of the real property values of the enterprises , say the researchers , which led to a rise of the real property taxes around 3.7 percent this year after the three successive years with growth rates from less than 1 percent .
While a big part of these profits was coming from big states as California , New York and Texas , the course seems to apply also to the Washington room
Enterprises in the District , Maryland and Virginia paid together more than 10 billion $ at state and local real property taxes in the last year , in comparison with 9.6 billion $ 2012 - a rise during a year around 4.2 percent .
But the apparent recovery with the case of the real property values is not so effective in Maryland during the rise of state and local tax yields since the real property taxes amount to just more than one fifth of the notices of assessment assessment notices bills demands levies of enterprises here .
Enterprise in Virginia and D.C. almost half of their state and local taxes pay in the form of real property taxes .
`` In Maryland following happens : a big part of the real properties , in particular in the tax field around D.C. , is either in the possession of the government or of non-profit-organizations that '' do not `` pay '' any real property taxes , said Douglas to Lindholm , manager of the center on State Taxation .
Maryland is therefore forced to rely on the income taxes for example much more in order to be able to offer the same services which other states offer .
The recent recovery with the case of the tax yields through enterprises can not be assigned only to the recovery of the property market
Seem also to recover to enterprise gains , so the data .
Enterprises in the region reported about income taxes with the case of state organizations of 2.3 billion $ in comparison with 2.1 billion in the year 2012 .
Maryland took 1 billion $ in enterprise income taxes , the highest amount of the region
While the trend is going into the same direction , the local tax burden does not go up for enterprises at all three places evenly
The rise rate in the District corresponded to the national average with 4.3 percent while the rise was being clearly higher in Maryland , 4.9 percent .
Only Virginia announced a lower-average tax amount of 4.1 percent .
Virginia has the clearly least enterprise income taxes ( in all three there are fixed enterprise tax rates ) with 6 percent in all three areas of competence .
The enterprise tax rate in Maryland is enclosed at 8.25 percent and in the District relatively high 9.975 percent .
A comparable study of the US chamber of commerce at the beginning of this year showed , that in Virginia smaller state and local enterprise taxes are demanded and there is in total a better tax climate than in Maryland .
In the study the District was not examined .
In spite of the advantages Virginia is under pressure through his southern neighbor .
North Carolina passed laws for the lowering of his enterprise tax rates this year of 6.9 percent on 6 percent , the same sentence as Virginia , and the sentence will sink in the coming year onto 5 percent .
If the state keeps on reaching his income objectives in the coming year , this law could reduce the enterprise income tax sentence of the state to 2017 apart from 3 percent .
Going in the meantime seems better to the small firms in the Washington room and they pay therefore more state and local taxes , so the recent study .
Enterprise taxes that are paid as personal income taxes through small businessmen - a temporary structure according to which most small enterprises are organized - in the District , Maryland and Virginia went up in the last year about 20 percent on 2.4 billion $ , a clear faster growth rate as the enterprise taxes in total .
The researchers say that the trend and the rise near the enterprise steering wheels as a whole will presumably stop country this year with a rise of the general increase dam tax yields for the state and the local governments about 6.2 percent in the first three quarters 2014 in comparison with the same period of the previous year .
Nevertheless the Washington room could hinterherhinken if the edition shortening of the Federal Government affects the labor market in the region

The socialists in France should `` keep quiet and tidy up France '' , the most important ally of Francois Hollande said .
The deeply fissured left winger appealed to Mr Valls for showing `` their love '' for the controversial socialist president whose cabinet reshuffle bumped onto disapproval with the great majority of the French .

Otherwise the situation keeps on being able to worsen .

Genetic trouble often wrongly diagnosed
A Briton says she considered as a consequence of a wrong diagnosis over many years that she would die .
Karin Rodgers lived almost their entire youth in the belief that it has to live only still few years after its having been diagnosed with another illness .
She suffered in fact from the Charcot Marie Tooth illness ( CMT ) - a group of inherited troubles that damage the nerves outside of the brain and the spinal cord .
Charity CMT UK informed that wrong diagnoses are a frequent problem with people with CMT because so little is known about this illness .
About 23,000 people in Great Britain suffer presumably from CMT which can lead to motor troubles as muscle weakness , an unsure walk and curved toes .
Ills suffer also from deafness feelings or pains . The illness is incurable and increasing , which means that the symptoms with the time become worse .
When Rodgers 13 was , she believed that she suffers from Friedreich-Ataxie ( FA ) - an illness with very bad survival chances .
Rodgers thought she would be in the rotation chair they 18 would become , and before their 30th birthday die .
The mother of two children said that today is 51 years old : `` As a child I knew that I could not do the same thing as the others .
I fell constantly there and everything lasted with me longer .
I could never drive roller skate or skateboard with the other children and was often teased in the school because of my kind to go and to walk .
Rodgers said that she saw their sick person acts in the age of 13 years after several operations in defence of their Achilles tendons and lamination of their feet , had left the room as their doctor and read that she suffered from FA .
`` I felt guilty because I had been curious therefore I did not tell that to anybody , but I went home , searched for the illness in the library and wrote to the CO society '' , she said .
When I received answer I was shocked and panicked frightfully .
I thought that I would be in the rotation chair with 18 and would die with 25 , and would lose all my abilities slowly between that .
I defined that all alone with me and planned my own funeral .
She said , als sie 17 became , she realized that their abilities had not taken off so strongly as she had imagined it and consulted their doctor .
He simply got up , and embraced me and said , `` my love , I do not believe that you have that otherwise you would be now already in the rotation chair . ''
I believe , you have something by far less life-alarming .
After some genetic tests CMT was found with it
`` When it declared me what CMT was , I felt myself as if I were a winner '' , she would say .
Charity CMT UK started a CMT-Awareness-Monat in order to make attentive onto this illness .

We must not believe , however , either that everything is good now .

Nevertheless those ones stop themselves in certain phases at me '' Hofmann said .
Grödig-coach Michael Baur had to reproach itself and his team for little .
He regretted the fast Gegentreffer `` from the category charm gate '' , as well as the regular gate of user in the 40th minute that had been deprived of by referee Kollegger incorrectly .

Production in the euro zone on a 13-month-depression
The rise during the production in the euro zone slowed itself down in August onto the lowest point of the last 13 months , such an exactly observed study with .
The final Markit Einkaufsmanagerindex of the producing trade ( PMI ) fell in August on 50.7 in , to a state of 51.8 in in July .
A specification over 50 indicates an expansion .
New tasks went back and factories experienced burglaries of tensions increasing in a time between the EU and Russia about Ukraine .
The numbers occur before the meeting of the European central bank ( EZB ) on Thursday .
The markets expect a clear plan from the bank only of 0.3 % for the contact with a hesitating recovery of the euro zone as well as deflation threatening for that one with the case of an inflation rate .
It gives to speculations to the conductor of the EZB , Mario Draghi , being able to give further information during this week whether it takes a quantitative relief into account for the euro zone according to that one which were carried out by Great Britain and the USA during the financial crisis .
`` Although a small growth is better than no growth at all , the effects of the increasing economical and geopolitical insecurities for the manufacturers slowing down became clearer '' , said Rob Dobson , leading economist , at Markit .
The Fabrik-PMI for Germany , the tallest trading partner of Russia in the EU , fell onto the deepest state in 11 months with 51.4 .
In the meantime the PMI fell on 46.9 in the second-largest economic nation of the block , France .
France remains a worry child , as also the descent of Italy from a sound expansion to the stagnation .
Tips on growth stimuli not gripping in the key industry mechanism Germany as well as in Spain and the Netherlands anymore are also not calming '' , said Mr Dobson .
The drop of the industry stirs up presumably the fire of the analysts who expect further monetary or fiskale stimuli .
A positive information came from the republic of Ireland , where the PMI went up on 57.3 , the highest level since end 1999 .
Howard Archer , chief economic expert at IHS Global Insight , said : `` The best thing that one can say for the purchase manager index of the producing trade in the euro zone of August is that after that the sector keeps on increasing . ''
He added : `` Producers in the euro zone find the life quite difficult currently obviously , there the current increased geopolitical tensions - especially with respect to Russia and Ukraine - insecurities into that one furthermore difficult conditions in many countries increase .
These increased insecurities influenced the economy very clear - in particular , and the confidence of the consumers , and results presumably in some tasks delaying or even being canceled in particular major tasks .
He said that it becomes `` increasingly more probable '' that finally the EZB must introduce a kind of the QE `` although we presume that this will be restricted . ''

Do the castle associations pull soon at a rope again ?
Last there was again and again quarrel between the two Wolfratshauser castle associations .
Now the executive boards think about a possible cooperation .
As a model for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser castle the late Richard Dimbath , former chairperson of the Wolfratshauser castle friends , mentioned the project in the French Guédelon .
A year ago yet no good climate existed between the castle association and the castle friends wolf council beluga .
The points of view seemed distinctly different up to now as the history of the Wolfratshauser castle and a possible reconstruction are supposed to be dealt with .
Now the two warehouses on each other move too : Conversations are supposed to be led already soon about a common procedure .
The association executive boards confirm to Torsten Sjöberg ( Castle association ) and to Herbert Piffl ( Castle friends ) on demand of our newspaper that .
`` I called Mr Piffl and suggested that we could get together once '' , tells Sjöberg .
According to his opinion all members of both associations could pull in the future again at a rope .
So more quickly visible successes are to be noted .
While the castle friends were having a reconstruction of the castle around the suddenly late Richard Dimbath till the end at the mountain wood in mind , stands for the castle association around Sjöberg the `` development and Erlebbarmachung '' of the ground at most front place .
Herbert Piffl , Second chairperson of the castle friends , was very pleased with the call according to own information
Since Dimbaths death he presides over the castle friends .
A new chairperson is supposed to be found in the middle of September in a general meeting .
Currently the association counts according to the 74-year long one about 40 members .
`` After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath we made the association activities out of respect rest first of all '' . This `` thinking-phase '' was necessary in order to `` consider how it could go on '' .
According to Piffl the new chairperson is supposed to go then into the conversation with the castle association .
Until then the castle friends could make themselves also a current atmosphere picture within their grouping .
There is currently yet not a candidate for the chairmanship , says Piffl .
`` But I am confident , that somebody will find himself He himself does not want to present himself because he has his residence in bath Tölz .
The new chairperson should be a Wolfratshauser .
The Tölzer keeps on wanting `` to cooperate '' in the project `` however very gladly .
The different points of view as regards reconstruction will presumably consist in the eyes Piffls in next time stay .
He acknowledges Dimbath as a `` missionary '' who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle .
Two similar , already far advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not a pipe dream .
Through a high participation of the population as well as through voluntary helpers from all world it is a tourist magnet .
Piffl : `` Also I was at the beginning sceptical .
However , with time I was convinced more and more that it is reasonable to drive forward the project '' . An `` alone position feature '' can be created for the raftsman city .
Here there is not really otherwise anything .
Furthermore the project would be financeable through EU subsidies , visitor tickets and potential sponsors , Piffl believes .
`` I personally do not want to fling the idea of the reconstruction simply overboard therefore '' . He hopes for the castle association moving in this point maybe a little .
Their aim of documenting the history first of all `` is important and good '' .
After that one could see .

Clever ways for the saving at uni-textbooks
Since the costs are for uni-textbooks for many students more than 1,000 $ per annum , the Fast-Zweitsemesterstudent considered check mate Schroeder a clever saving-idea .
He invented a lending-system for books of students of higher semesters and offered a nominal compensation in order to delay the moving-sale .
`` My mathematics book usually costs 180 $ , but I got it for 10 $ for a semester and a Chick-fil-A-cookie '' , said Schroeder , 19 , who goes to the Covenant College in Georgia .
The books needed for the last semester would have cost it 430 $ , he said .
He spent 120 $ .
The college management informed , that students distribute on average more than 1,200 $ annual for textbooks and study material , that there would be different curbing cost expansion options for the students , however .
Online-shops and creative Herangehensweisen as the Schroeders are the solution of the choice for the students increasingly .
The renting of textbooks is liked , and so students can use a book for a semester , frequently too a clearly more favorable price than during the purchase .
Neebo Inc , who practices more than 250 university book stores , informed that the renting of librettos has doubled since 2011 .
Vice-president Tevor Meyer said to Neebos to show inquiries in the branch that about instance a quarter of the books was rented in the college book stores in the last spring semester .
Less than half of all textbooks stores curtains are bought according to statement for the National Association of College commercial union in campus book stores .
Here the multiplication table is for the best deals .
Buy Online
Some new books cost in an online way only a third of the price , for which to have it in the campus book store are .
The ninth edition of `` Calculus '' vno Ron Larwon , Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost 290 $ , can be gotten , however , with the specialized textbook retailer Chegg.com for 239.99 $ .
Needed buy
When one the memos of others or normal use tracks nothing form , needed books are a good option .
`` Calculus '' is needed on Chegg.com for 93.49 $ have .
Matt Casaday , 25 , end student at the Brigham Young University , it says that he spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a needed edition of `` Strategic Media Decisions : Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business . ''
The book was sold again for 48 $ .
Academic as Ingrid Bracey , head of the University of Massachusetts at the Amherst College Without Walls recommended students to ask their professors whether former editions are permissible .
Sometimes the updates are not relevant for the seminar papers .
In such cases older editions can be acquired often for one fraction of the costs for the newest edition
Except for Chegg and Amazon also Half.com of eBay Inc is a popular alternative for needed books .
Rents
The renting of textbooks is a consideration worth , if you handle it quite well , think of that , to return it and not kept you the books on completion of the course would like .
You can save more than 80 percent of the costs of an again bought book .
A student could rent for example `` Calculus '' for the duration of a semester for about 20 $ .
You inform yourself of the regulations of the business at that you rent , also about the punishment fees that accumulate where appropriate for the writing of memos , underlinings or use tracks
Tenant looked out : If you do not return the book , the punishment fees can even exceed the price of a new book .
E-books
Also e-books instead of traditional textbooks are an option .
Sometimes these books de facto are rented , when an electronic license for a certain period of wholesalers as Amazon.com , Chegg as well as Barnes & Noble Inc. is provided .
At Chegg one can rent `` Calculus '' for 6 months for about 61 $ .
Bracey says that students find the best offers frequently in literature courses since many classics can be downloaded nowadays freely while scientific and engineer-scientific textbooks are can be very expensive .
Umschauen in any case .
The ISBN-number recommends for the pricing at books Joe Gault , 29 , who soon will go to the Pepperdine Law School , since one can be so secure to find the correct textbook .
And before an online-order one should check , according to Gault , whether in fact the book is in stock .
He learned this lesson onto the hard tour .
He bought a book , that delivery time had and paid four weeks finally the full price in the college book store .

On the hopping-castle during the castle garden party some was on Saturday rid .
The draft of the organizers was right .
In spite of the strong downpour at the Saturday evening approximately 1200 music fans came to the Open-Air-celebration in the castle garden .
Temporarily the admission had to be stopped .
`` That was annoyed '' , said Ron Sem , one of the organizers .
Salt whisk l light and fun .
Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem formed the name Amula from two Spanish words .
Because the Open Air in the Salzwedeler castle garden is supposed to radiate brightness through various shows on day and at the evening .
Na , and the fun comes in any case of alone .
That was proved already on the early Saturday , when the first visitors to the Open Air prepared themselves .
The organizers had promised a celebration for all generations .
And they succeeded in that .
Around the supply states on the castle garden meadow Salzwedeler , but also guests from the nearer and wider surroundings had made themselves cosy
You followed the first live appearances , bobbed with the foot in time , enjoyed cool drinks - shortly : Relaxation pure and was pleasure announced .
And that right through the generations .
While ones were lolling about onto covers on the extra carted white sand at the beach bar , other at a quarter of wine in the Vinothek refreshed , the junior staff raged on the hopping-castle that was a big attraction of attraction for the smaller guests .
But also at the the voluntary helpers had to do all hands to child makeups fully in the truest sense of the word in order to become gentleman to the crush and to conjure imaginative creations into the small faces .
The larger ones used the football player tables or participated in a skateboard-workshop which the Goodfoot-crew adjusted from Salzwedel .
Until the big rain came .
Shortly before 17.30 o'clock it beat down onto the visitors , particularly families searched the Wide and Dry one .
This did not do any breaking off to nevertheless the attractivity of the celebration .
`` More people came than expected , '' would say Ron Sem , who spoke of a `` success on the whole line '' .
Therefore nothing is opposed to a repetition of the great party in the coming year .
Although at contents and size of the events must be worked still , Sem made clear in a first balance on Sunday opposite the nation voice
He designated as annoyed , that meanwhile the admission had to be stopped .
The security company was obvious with for few strengths booked .
The consequence : Some that already had paid did not come anymore to the ground .
The resonance was very good .
In a first cautious estimate the Salzwedeler co-organizer spoke of about 1200 visitors who romped in the castle garden .
There were problems with the case of the audio engineering .
The Salzwedeler Hip-Hop-band Blocks'n'Rox aborted their appearance therefore in an enervated way .
The technicians were not in the situation to create a to some extent reasonable Sound .
The planned Shisha-Lounges could not be built up because the tents could not be brought to salt whisk because of a puncture .
`` In the next year they '' will `` be '' , however , in this case '' , according to the organizer .
The premiere night of the Amula-Open-Airs was from the numbers of visitors more than succeeded .
And that with the case of bad weather .
However , the organizers committed some errors which are still forgiven with the case of the first time , but were eliminated have had them with the case of the second edition .
Also in the social network Facebook the organizers must take criticism
`` Sorry , however for twelve euros one simply `` expected '' more '' , Melanie Meier is expressed on the event page
`` You overstrained yourselves unfortunately a little '' , thinks Ele Zimmermann at same place .
Others do not see the initial problems very so narrow .
I find it very good , that not natter some only stupidly , but attempt also really to put something on the legs .
Guard off '' ! Stephanie Jenß to the Amula writes .
Now the organizers have a year of time in order to stop these criticism points .

Delayed diagnoses and lacking access to the best treatment possibilities lead to higher death rates through ovary cancer in rural fields .
Angelina Jolie and their brother James set a Videohommage for their mother who passed away in 2007 at ovary cancer in an online way .
For women in the rural fields of Australia a higher risk exists , to die of ovary cancer , than for women in cities .
Researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1100 Australians with whom in 2005 ovary cancer was found , and stated that only 25 percent were still at the life five years according to the diagnosis .
The chief research officer Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research institutes said , that for those ones that lived in rural and remote regions of the state the mortality risk during the study lay about 20 percent higher than for those ones in town areas .
SMALL STUDY : New drugs could slow down pulmonary and ovary cancer
The researchers examined the medical care of the women more than seven years .
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman with the case of the diagnosis , the type of the ovary cancer , existing Vorerkrankungen as well as the social and economical status influenced also the survival chances .
For older woman and that one whose cancer had continued to the diagnosis time already further the survival rate was lowest .
For those ones that lived in rural and remote regions of the state the mortality risk lay during the study about 20 percent higher than for those ones in town areas .
Although the study did not examine , why outside of the city living women with higher probability at ovary cancer died , Dr. Jordan presumes a late diagnosis and the lacking access to the best treatment centers as possible factors for that .
`` This illness is handled best by gynecological oncologists , and these are to be found mostly in bigger cities '' , she said .
In spite of the improvement of the telemedizinischen services in order to counter the distances with something she suggested a strengthening of the service of doctors flown in as possible remedy in order to give specialists the possibility to look after women more thickly at their place of residence as well as treatment programs for people outside of their region
Dr. Jordan said , that the study showed a bad long-term survival rate independently of the geographical status with women in the ovary cancer and underlined it the need for better treatment and provision strategies .
The study financed by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia .
In March 2013 Elisha Neave , a young mother of 33 years of the gold coast , found out that she had an aggressive form of ovary cancer .

Twin town : German beer for Guangzhou
Hop and malt - also in China a popular combination .
German beer enjoys in China an excellent call
Frankfurt 's twin town in China wants now a brewing and in addition hopes for a flight direct connection between the the two cities .
German beer , brewed in Frankfurt 's twin town Guangzhou - so the urgent wish of the official ones in China says .
`` We would be very pleased if a German brewing sat down in our city '' , said the vice-Parteisekretär of the south-Chinese metropolis , Li Yiwei , in this week during the visit of a SPD-delegation in his city .
Again and again the official of the ruling Communist party of China in the course of the conversation came back to this request of the twelve-million-metropolis .
Guangzhou that is mentioned also canton in Germany is one of the richest cities of China , Li recruited .
Therefore the people would have also the purchasing power , to be able to afford German beer .
The Hessian SPD-chairperson Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel who led the German politician delegation accepted to the host , he will hear himself in Germany after a possible partner for the project .
`` For beer does not need it a lot : he matched `` good water , grain and high spirits , '' during the lunch with the party-upper one in Guangzhou .
Mr Li already radiates this high spirits , it flattered the host .
Then the official drank a toast to Guangzhou with Schäfer-Gümbel - however with red wine that was served to the food .
The Chinese brand Tsingtao goes back to German brewing-art .
Tsingtao-beer is brewed according to the German purity commandment .
More businesses
A second wish of the Chinese hosts would be a flight direct connection between Frankfurt and Guangzhou , said vice-Parteichef Li .
The Lufthansa had offered the flight formerly , but had deleted it in the year 2012 from economical reasons .
`` It would be worthwhile again '' , the local politician showed convinces .
`` The businesses between our two cities take always further too '' .
Currently travellers would have to take the detour over Changsha in the province Hunan , Li complained .
Also the administration of the province Guangdong whose capital is Guangzhou hopes for the air connections
The vice-governor of the province , Chen Yunxian , put this wish into the foreground at his conversation with the social democrats .
`` That is a very good idea '' , Schäfer-Gümbel answered - the Chinese Vizeminister Li Jinjun , an intimate expert of Germany , nodded in agreement .
Well-kept partnership
The affable vice-Parteichef of Guangzhou hopes for his being able to go to Frankfurt in the next year for a partnership meeting .
Li Yiwei was already indeed at the Main , but not yet in this function .
It came only this year into the office after his predecessor had been carried from the office because of corruption reproaches .
Also the local party leader Wan Qinglian had to go .
The procedure against the officials from Guangzhou is part of a national campaign against the corruption in party and administration which is put through by head of state Xi Jinping with hardness .
The new top politician Li Yiwei had worked before his party career for an American enterprise , which is highly unusual in the Communist Party of China .
Before his assumption of office in Guangzhou , where the VW car builder establishes a big work it was active in Fujian as a top official .
Frankfurt accepted officially more than one dozen of city partnerships .
The connection to the 9000 kilometers remote Guangzhou belongs to those which are maintained from both pages for instance with a pupil exchange
In the last year the 25-year existing of the Sino-German connection was celebrated .
Hessen is the south-Chinese metropolis at the pearl river almost as strongly as completely in this case with their economic strength .
In the next year it wants to achieve a gross domestic product of 250 billion euros , told Li .

With Rona Fairhead the BBC found maybe the splendid director who she needs .
It arrives with a proud fame train from the bank world , the media management and the internal circle of the Tory-party .
And she has own front experience .
Your career began with the case of the worldwide management consulting company Bain and Co. , on which she changed ICI and the media world to Morgan Stanley , Bombadier , from Pearsons .
She was for seven years an executive board chairperson of the Financial Times and resigned when the uppermost post of the mother enterprise Pearsons went onto a younger masculine colleague .
Your compensation was supposedly almost 1 million £ .
Also their political ranking is sound .
She was recommended David Cameron of lord Browne to the former chairperson of bp than this searched for more private-economical knowledge in Whitehall : she became the adviser of the cabinet .
Your husband is a former Tory councilor .
Already in May I described the task of the chairperson with a poisoned cup .
Only the BBC does not stand as a gigantic and complex unit in the heart of the public life , but there is also an internal paradox in his structure .
The confidence works in two directions : towards inside onto the first guard of the own management hierarchy in the BBC , however also to the outside as a voice of public concern and noise if the things work wrongly .
That guarantees for an almost untenable Duopol that demands after a complete comprehensive reform .
But which again incoming chairperson would risk to line up , to hit everything and to take apart an institution which is as complex as a Chinese dynasty while even maybe he is depriving himself of his job in this case .
It is a difficult task .
And as if that were not already enough , also still many are at that interested - power , money and status overtakes .
While the competition is coming closer and new technologies are threatening old , comfortable securities the pending negotiations of the royalties are joined with special dangers for the BBC .
For the modest sum of 145.50 £ per annum the British public buys into the certainly largest media enterprise of the world .
The BBC tells a good history she says that it reaches 96 percent of all budgets and costs only 40 pence to each of them per day .
And apparently the BBC climbs on the popularity scale up again : 53 percent support her today , in comparison with 31 percent 10 years ago .
The seeing and use habits for the BBC changed : I get nowadays information headlines on my mobile and see missed programs later on my iPlayer .
But it remains a very loved and considerable institution .
She needs a considerable chairperson - I hope , she found it

Lenny Henry : My father has never taken me into the arm .
Has said never `` I love you ''
Henry was one thing of seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in the year 1958 .
His father that died when henry 19 was worked in a factory and their relation was restricted .
Henry rehearses for a comedy , Rudy 's Rare Records , the partial one is based on an imaginary conversation with his father and arose from the series on radio 4 .
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap , with lively melodies .
But henry had to plow through some difficult childhood moments .
He visited `` many '' therapies after the death of his mother , and henry is thoughtful about his relationship to his father .
It was heavy to know it
One never saw his face , heard only his voice Stop with the crash .
Leave your sister in peace .
Move !
I want to look cricket .
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - that were already grown-up when I was a child - went with it into the pub and talked about things , as the form of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket stroke .
I never had such a conversation with it
A majority of my life it this serious type in the corner that read the newspaper was .
Recently henry opened a foundry in Dudley , and although the conditions are better than at times of his father , nevertheless he gained an insight in how the life liked to have been for it
It is now a little brighter , but they are dark , verraucht , deep stygische labyrinths with flame punches and smoke and a lot of soot .
My father simply lay down formerly into the tub and then one could hear it slowly how he started singing because it could wash the foundry of themselves .
When I walked around there , I realized that he had done that for years in order to bring the food to the table , and my respect for it became greater .
Nevertheless Henry grew up as a child without love evidence of his parents .
My father never embraced me , he never said `` I love you '' .
Only when my mother was feeling bad by the end of their life , we began , `` I love you , I love you , I love '' to say `` you '' .
Through his own daughter Billie , with Dawn French , he could split up the love which he had missed as a child .
You could stop once with that `` I love you '' ?
Nevertheless stop embracing me !
Daddy , I am 22 !
with Dawn French .
Why should we not be friends ?
It is a splendid mother .
It is gotten used still with French with which it was married 25 years .
Dawn is a good human being .
Why should we not be friends ?
It is a splendid mother .
Henries ' own mother was a diabetic .
That contributed to their death .
When I therefore very much , very became overweight and symptoms of diabetes showed , my doctor said `` You must be radical .
Therefore I pulled through this fitness thing and also a drastic diet had to do in order to reverse the symptoms .
It is very heavy .
And it is hard .
Nobody eats carrots gladly .
Maybe henries ' career change is proved in his elegant , briefly cut beard .
Since it was praised by the critics for his Othello , it is vereinnahmt from the theater .
It The comedy of the errors , and then Fences of August Wilson followed .
That is another experience than the Sitcoms and comedies which filled his busy working life .
He began only with 16 years , when it worked in a factory .
A DJ discovered it on the stage , than he imitated persons and wrote to New Faces about it
His TV career began in the middle of the seventies . `` I was the only black imitator/comedian on televison for a quite long time . ''
He learned in the profession .
I did not have to become tall only before the eyes of the public , but learn also from 1975 to 1985 how I could become an efficient Witze-Erzähl-Maschine while I was being a star through the television and that was really difficult .
Lenny 1975 with New Faces
There his manager the stage right at the Black and White Minstrel Show had , a light conversation program in which the people painted themselves black henry performed his Comedy there more than five years .
That was very unpleasant to my family .
I wanted somehow that it would never have happened , however , I do not regret that I did it .
It was a strange , unpleasant position for me , but I cooperated in giant projects and learned how one deals with a large public .
But this `` prize-winning light column of the British watching television lasting for years was also a `` grotesque parody of black people . ''
Through the introduction of figures , that the British black culture both mocked as celebrated , Henry worked in the eighties on an alternative Comedykreis .
The first row of the Lenny Henry Show went in 1984 on the air , and in the nineties it was among other things in the Comedyserie Chef as the chef de cuisine Gareth Blacklock ! known .
Advertising documentaries , TV-series and reels of film shaped his next decade , but according to his BBC-series LennyHenry.tv 2008 he thought himself : `` What you do as next , Len , because it feels so everything when you bring only the time for that or kick a little on the place . ''
After that a documentary series came for radio 4 with the title What 's So Great About ... ?
The first consequence turned around Shakespeare .
On Shakespeare I was downright allergic .
I had never learned something about it correctly in the school and mainly held it for a domain of the middle class , whiteness , in tights and a cabbage in front in that .
Therefore I had great fear of that .
All that we interviewed for the show , Peter Hall , Trevor Nunn , Adrian Lester , Judi Dench said `` You should try it once .
Do not make it bad if you do not know which you talk about .
Take a few of the words into the mouth , and then you will understand , why we all Shakespeare so dear .
Henry listed 20 lines from Othellos of last speech for the documentary and it was enthusiastic .
I had the feeling that I could create that .
It was almost as if somebody would have put me on the head correctly at last
`` For that it works , it is a serious thing , take it seriously , learn your text , investigates a little .
The tests were brutal , and I read this piece for months before we did it .
And it was a success .
You splint a car accident expect , and that did simply not happen .
And soon it occurred in the comedy of the errors .
I was sudden in the national theater and I could hardly believe it .
Over there there was a moment when I thought `` Oh , you changed . ''
There were a technical error and henry felt instinctively , that he must maintain the public .
`` A small voice said to me `` You must bridge 10 minutes now , while they are repairing the computer . ''
Instead of this the stage conductor announced that the idea would go on as soon as the problem is solved .
I went from the stage and something in me said `` Oh , thank God '' .
I am not responsible for that .
I can leave that to somebody else .
You play in a play , therefore bleib in your role . ''
Henry in Fences at the Duchess Theatre
To learn the text for Fences was pretentious .
Panic is very good , that starches the tendons
Also that arrived well , it is therefore as a big label of the gods , who say to me `` That is here your definition
He says this , natural with a THUNDERING voice
Therefore I persevere .
I really love that .
I love to be in a test room
Henry still has , however , the head of one comedian - our conversation is from humorous outbreaks pulled through , while he is imitating persons again and again .
I decided on not doing any Stand-up-Comedy because I think that this kind of the immediate satisfaction of a hall is somehow dangerous to full foreigner .
If one searches that continuously , one goes in this way before a wall .
I perform sometimes live in the Apollo if I fancy for this purpose , but in total it does not give to me so much as formerly .
I ask him whether it will ever do a Stand-up-Comedytour again .
The fun which I have in a room with a director which helps with shaping a beginning , a central part member and the end of a journey - I do not believe that I would ever like to give that up again .
Is that his new incarnation here therefore ?
I already think .
I am gladly an actor .
It does fun .
One always tells a history and that is splendid .
I love histories
The people love histories

President Reuven Rivlin went to the Kibbutz near the border to Gaza , in order to offer his support .
Until an armistice suspended the war last week thousands of inhabitants of the border municipalities as Saad in their houses stayed or their houses left in order to keep on moving into more secure areas away from Gaza and to escape the missile and mortar fire .
Many inhabitants of Nahal Oz , a municipality near the border to Gaza in which a 4-year old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar shell still hesitate with the return .
The Ministry of Education informed , about instance a dozen families is yet not returned .
Your children were placed temporarily in other schools .
A school in Sderot , a border town to Gaza , which is heavily drawn from the Palestinian bombardment visited prime minister Benjamin Netanjahu .
It appealed to the children , to learn a lot and said `` we will provide that , that you gain knowledge and offer you security
Israel and Hamas agreed on the last Tuesday on an unbefristeteten armistice .
The truce guaranteed for an immediate end of the fights ; important problems remain , however , unresolved , as the demand of the Hamas for a cancellation of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of the air and lake harbors in Gaza .
Israel demands a disarmament of the Hamas and the delivery of the corpses from two Israeli soldiers killed with the case of the fights .
A new round of indirect conversations will probably still begin in this month in Egypt .
In the war more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed , three quarters of them civilians , and at least 494 children after estimates of the Palestinians and the UN .
Israel denies these information and reckons that it is a question of fighters with the case of at least half of the killed ones did not present , however , any concrete proofs of these information .
On Israeli page 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed , a Thai worker .
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired off 4,591 missiles and mortar shells during the fights onto Israeli cities , most in the south of the country .
Meanwhile the Israeli military led more than 5,000 Air- and other attacks through .
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in the Gazagebiet and about 250,000 people searched refuge that preliminary shelters were altered into in more than 100 UN schools .
While tens of thousands are keeping on living from people in the shelters and the fights lasting , the education authorities postponed last week the beginning of the school year .
`` I hope , the school is soon again opened so that we keep on being able to learn so as the children in the world and the Jewish children '' , Mohammad Amara , a 13-year old boy that currently lives in a school in Gaza city , said .

Moving-recollection of the very American ideal the industrial law as human rights
The congress representatives Keith Ellison and John Lewis brought in a law proposal in order to establish the organization of trade unions as some civil rights .
`` So as trade unions die , die also the middle class jobs '' , Ellison said , a democrat from Minnesota and deputy chairperson of the Progressive Caucus in the congress .
Therefore I present proudly the employee authorization law together with the civil rights icon John Lewis .
This epoch-making law gives workers the same legal possibilities in the case of discrimination because of the organization of trade unions as with the case of other forms of the discrimination - and stops strengths in a so antiunion-related way stopped .
The supplement of the national industrial law law , around a possibility for exposed to a discrimination workers to the organization of a trade union representation to create , in order to complain before a civil court around justice - and in order to receive compensation or punishment money - a reasonable and necessary initiative is .
But it is not a radical initiative with security - anyway not according to American standards .
In fact the best kind and manner for the sense of what Ellison , Lewis and the further sponsors of their bill suggest is the connection back for a very American idea .
In spite of the setbacks to whom the trade unions were misfired in the last years - in Wisconsin , Michigan and other states in the whole country - Americans encouraged once countries in all world to acknowledging stretching and stopping industrial law .
There was a time which millions of Americans still remember , when this country mentioned democracy , freedom of speech , freedom of the press and the union right in a breath .
When Japan filled the United States after the Second World War , general Douglas Mac Arthur and his stick encouraged the country to adopting a constitution which is supposed to guarantee that the militarized autocracy Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy .
In full consciousness of that , that the workers and their trade unions during the creation of a new Japan took a role , they used a language that acknowledged explicitly that `` the rights of the workers to union and common negotiating and action are guaranteed . ''
When the United States fill after the Second World War Germany , general Dwight David Eisenhower and his stick pushed the Germans , to write a constitution that would provide that that the fascism Adolf Hitlers would be replaced by a strong democracy .
In recognition of the fact , that the workers would have to organize , and should rise their voice in the new nation , the Germans inserted a stipulation that testified explicitly : `` The right to base unions around which Work and economical conditions to safeguard and to improve is guaranteed to every individual and every profession or trade .
To curtail it agreements that restrict this right or are aimed at that are zero and vain ; measures being aimed at that are unlawful .
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt held the chairmanship about the International Human Rights Commission from which the General declaration of the human rights was projected as it was taken over in 1948 of the United Nations as a worldwide agreement Roosevelt and the other authors inserted a guarantee that `` everyone has the right to form trade unions to the protection of his interests or to join them . ''
Since generations Americans accept the basic premise , that industrial law human rights are .
As this country other countries in this case advised as one can shape civilian and democratic societies Americans declared that the right to the foundation of a trade union must be protected - and on this trade union may participate in collective negotiations as an equivalent significant partner with enterprises and government places then .
After these rights is turned out into America under bombardment it in fact very points , to make clear the American ideal again , accordingly the working population the must be right , to unite and hearing to be provided with in a free and open society
How pastor Martin Luther King said Jr ones fifty years ago :
A splendid instructor is the history
Now they all know that the labor movement did not restrict the strength of the nation , but extended it .
Through the increase of the standard of living of millions of people work created a market in wondrous way for the industry and raised the entire nation to inconceivable production levels .
Those ones who attack the work forget these simple truths , but the history preserves it
The history remembers , and we should also do that .
The formal recognition the industrial law as human rights - and the enlargement of the protection of the civil rights as protection against discrimination during the creation of employee representations - is for a long time overdue .
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals which made America big in the past and kept the promise of democracy .

Konstantin Weckers ruthlessly honest memoirs
It is actually more philosophical report than biography , which brought Konstantin Wecker , singer-songwriter , pacifist , into `` Monk and warrior '' political-surely activist , ex-prisoner , on 287 pages to paper .
Not chronologically , but more thought shred for thought shreds the inhabitant of Munich born on 1st June 1947 wrote down his memoirs , introduced every chapter through a suitable song text .
And it is in this case ruthlessly honest : From the onanism as a Gymnasiast up to the shoplifting and drug consumption he does not skip any human weakness .
Also , in order to show how he learned even tolerance in the contact with his fellow men .
Take wide room also abstract , however the more important concepts one : Love , soul , ego , the existence in the Jetzt , spirituality - attempted to that all it onto the reason to go , in very philosophical , but also very much personal way
And it explains also his pacifism , his social criticism , his political engagement - and also , as only the music did not shape him ( the opera lover became the Soul and skirt musician ) , but also his prison stay .
Latter familiarized also the ascetic monk that arises for `` through subtraction '' with the playboy Konstantin Wecker as he says `` when one leaves out everything unnecessary '' .
Between all the highly-intellectual opinions there are , however , also short anecdotes for the derivation : about instance about fights in a restaurant frequented by GIs or a crazy drive in the case of which he aimed for a tree frontally .
Also there it is ruthlessly honest .

Garden centers regret sinking house-owner numbers
The drop together with an increasing sinking of the number of the house-owners under 35 years could provide , that garden centers zehntausende pound per annum lose if the present young consumers reach the `` nuclear age-group for garden products '' according to a study of the HTA , told as in the Financial Times .
The report says that tenants spend on the average 55 percent of the amount which people with freehold dwelling spend for their garden .
To asphalt the rise of people that live in highly urbanisierten areas without gardens , the popular procedure , front gardens to park purposes and further factors that threaten the branch in which estimated 5 billion £ are transformed annually in the sale are the sinking garden size .
In the London greater area in which over a period from 6 years the part of houseowners fell of 61 on 43 percent the least expenditure on garden products per budget becomes vermeldet .
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society refer to living for the rent or small gardens not meaning that the people can not grow any plants .
Guy Barter , chief garden consultant for the RHS said : `` To container-gardeners is for example with tenants very popular because they can take along their plants at a move
The HTA-Bericht identified the period as the `` golden age '' of the garden retail trade due to increasing houseowner numbers and economical prosperity of the late 1980th ones up to the middle of the nineties in between 1997 and 2005 .
It in addition predicted for this year an improved market situation because of the better weather according to unfriendly weather conditions in March and April of last year .

Andrew Lawson was a man of the sort that character changes things even in a so gigantic organization as the NHS .
As a discussing anesthesia doctor he dedicated his career to the task of sparing the sick people both the death struggle of the illness and the pains of the treatment
Among his patients , so his wife remembers , a MI6 employee was that had to live from tortures with the disastrous effects .
Lawsone knew that the diagnoses and illnesses are important to the doctors while the handled ones are being occupied with something very else mainly : Pain .
One day in the year 2007 he was , however , that one whose ordeal began .
`` I did not feel myself '' , he wrote in May this year .
I had picked myself up difficulties .
While he was fighting with the flu-similar symptoms , he noticed that it did his wife Juliet reproaches impatiently .
`` I want everything more gladly immediately than later '' , he noted down .
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week , lawsone completely felt ungewöhnlicherweise and without reason worries .
Something lay in the air .
He asked a colleague for carrying out a X-ray examination of his breast .
Only two weeks ago it had been in the French alps for the skiing .
There was the result of the X-ray examination
He suffered from Mesotheliom , an incurable cancer , that the pleura attacks , therefore the skin cladding the lungs .
As with the case of most cancer illnesses the exact trigger is to be determined mostly heavily .
While for example some smokers are falling with lung cancer ill , all Lungenkrebserkrankten were not formerly smokers .
But Mesotheliom is different .
In almost all cases the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fibre material that once was regarded as `` Miracle material but meanwhile was recognized as fatal
For most of us Mesotheliom is an illness that can ignore as easily .
Finally asbestos is a product of the past .
The most dangerous asbestos type was not used in Great Britain since the 1960th years more than the industry committed itself voluntarily to not using this anymore .
Also , where it was still used , only people worked in certain branches directly with the material - plumbers , building workers , carpenters and dockers for example .
As an industrial dangerous material from another time it today hardly yet seems to be alarming .
But this complacency is inappropriate .
Great Britain , it seems like this , experiences today the climax of a Mesoltheliom epidemic .
There are more deaths through Mesotheliom here than in every other country of the world .
With in total 2,500 deaths per annum so many people die twice of this illness than at road accidents .
Annual numbers of the Mesotheliomtodesfälle since 1980 and probable future deaths in Great Britain
The reason why we experience the fatal effects now although asbestos for years is illegal ( In 1999 all asbestos types were forbidden ) that one is that a Mesotheliom develops first after decades .
And the scourge of the Mesotheliom is not open former worker of the construction branch restricts .
Asbestos was , and is frequent still , in the houses available , in which we live , the offices in which we work , the schools , in which we learn and the businesses in which we shop .
And therefore Mesotheliom knows no class bars financial borders professions or age .
The privileged bastions , of the elegant department stores in London up to private schools , are not a shelter .
The Parliament Buildings are asbestos-hot .
Also in the hospitals in which nevertheless we are supposed to become healthy were defined already as initial stoves of this fatal carcinogen .
Andrew Lawson was not old .
He was not also a plumber .
It was difficult for him in fact to imagine where it could have come possibly with asbestos in contact .
Then he found it out .
`` It looks as if in the tunnels at the Guy 's an amount of asbestos were available to hospital , where I completed my training for six years . '' he wrote .
All - Students , nurses , doctors and gatekeepers - use the tunnels .
One wonders how many will stand my contemporaries at the same illness ?
It could answer this question unfortunately at least in part .
`` From the four doctors that were trained at the Guy 's hospital , and that fell with Mesotheliom ill in the last five years '' he wrote in 2010 in a letter , `` I am the last one that still lives . ''
How many of us will fall ill still ?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with Mesotheliom in the age of 48 years .
When he died on 17th February of this year , he was 55 .
That was an unusually long survival time .
Fifty percent of all Mesotheliomerkrankten die within 8 months according to the diagnosis .
The illness ends always fatally
We can repeat therefore only lawsones question : `` How much of us will fall ill still '' ?
The leading expert of Great Britain to Mesotheliom , professor Julian Peto , accepts that in between 1870 and 2050 in total 90,000 will have fallen victim to the illness if the asbestos epidemic will probably come into Great Britain for the succumbing .
Most of them do not have any presentiment at the moment yet , that they will die so .

A short look onto the files of the courts which the concerned persons turn to frequently because of claims for compensation shows how far the scourge of the Mesothelioms is already spread .
In June this year 's Marks & Spencer gave for example too , to have stopped Janice of All fahrlässigerweise asbestos .
It worked for nine years for the chain , of 1978 to 1987 and was responsible above the clothing department at two locations - one of them of the Flagshipstore in the Oxford Street .
Mrs. Only 18 years was to all than when she began their activity at M & S .
Now she has two children in the twenties .
`` Before this thing , she says , `` I had heard by Mesotheliom never yet I did once really not know something over asbestos yet .
I would never have thought that that affected me once .
There are only few people who know a lot over asbestos .
Fact is , that the concept asbestos refers not a substance , but a group of six minerals .
The name stems from the word `` Asbestiform '' , a description of the fibre structure that makes the material resistantly and flexibly .
Three of the six of them were used in the building trade .
Chrysotil , also than white known to asbestos , the asbestos found today by far most frequent is in buildings .
It was used for roof plates , slabs , tube isolations , storage water heater isolations , even for brake linings in cars .
It is less fatal than other asbestos forms are , nevertheless is regarded , however , as `` a great health risk '' with possible death consequence by the EU and the WHO .
More dangerous is , however , the brown asbestos ( Amosite ) and that blue asbestos ( Cape asbestos ) .
Great Britain was once the world-largest importer of brown asbestos , and experts presume , that `` it clear , however indirect tips for this being a main reason for the uniquely high Mesotheliomraten gives
An employee of Marks & Spencer was stopped asbestos in the Flagshipstore in the Oxford Street , London , Alamy
Maybe Janice of All Of It did not see himself as typical Mesotheliomopfer , but the work of Julian Peto indicates that their history is not unusual under any circumstances .
He presented a study of the concerned persons in which it is represented that `` an essential part of the Mesotheliome without known suspension through work or in the house was presumably caused by asbestos contact in the environment . ''
A majority of these contacts is based according to his statement on the `` normal use and aging '' of our buildings .
It looks as if nobody can assume to be secure
A report by Goddard Consulting , who examined the palace of Westminster , shows , as people also in the heart of the government , unknowingly the material would be stopped could
In 2009 Goddard told that the service shafts and pipelines behind the committee rooms of the parliament with asbestos whose fatal fibres could be swirled up by something so harmless as `` strong air movements '' were contaminated .
Parliament members are accused frequent to see to their own interests , however , here it looks as if the opposite would affect to .
While the management office of the Parliamentary Work Service was insisting on the Westminsterpalast receiving a `` clean health certificate '' , meanwhile it is undisputed that 1 billion £ of amount of work must be found over several years in order to renovate the parliament to modernize the electrical installations and that asbestos remove , and that according to the general elections in 2015 the representatives will presumably rather meet in the QE2 conference center seemed likely than on the green banks in Westminster .
The Goddard-report referred also to `` the existence of asbestos not being handled according to the respective regulations . ''
Nobody can know whether this Missmanagement will taste lives .
All that one can do now is wait .
A person , that the contact with asbestos never exactly is been able to determine Graham Abbott , a general physician .
As Andrew Lawson the 50-year old Abbott presumes , that it was stopped during his work in hospitals the asbestos .
`` I worked in a hospital in which asbestos complaints were decided on positively '' , he says , `` however I can not prove it in my case .
It is so difficult to remember all places which one worked on and onto the data .
At which it still exactly remembered is the day at the beginning of December 2009 at which he got such kind of fevers .
He was 45 , and an operation just carried on late in the evening .
Suddenly I had joggling-frost .
It came very suddenly .
I felt terrible .
I believed not to get the journey anymore home .
As a doctor Abbott knew , that the pains of the pleura came , the skin around his lungs around .
But as Janice of All Of It he did not have any reason to presume a Mesotheliom .
It did not go a month to work
Amazed doctors made X-rays of his breast and apply Pleurakathether in order to take liquid from the lungs and to test in the lab .
His complaints remained , however , without diagnosis .
His health improved slowly , and it returned onto his job .
From time to time the symptoms returned , however , frequent after sporting activity and vehement buckling .
In 2011 a patient Abbotts with similar symptoms came in his practice and was diagnosed later with Mesotheliom .
But also now Abbott did not combine this with his own case .
Finally his patient was some decades older and had worked directly with asbestos .
The connection in the case was clear .
In September 2011 Abbotts state worsened again and his family doctor brought his CT-Scans and X-rays to an expert group .
In December 2011 , exact two years after Abbott for the first time had felt sick , a probe equipped with a camera into the cave became between the Rib- and the pleura introduced .
I am an optimist .
I continue mostly one-times '' , he says .
Honestly said , I had not made myself as many worries at all .
But Rachel , my wife , was worried .
There was the result of the biopsy weekdays between Christmas and New Year : `` One said to me that it was Mesotheliom . ''
Graham Abbott : Diagnose Mesotheliom
Suddenly Abbott had appointments with Macmillan-nurses from whom one recommended him to take an attorney .
Only now he understood the extent of the epidemic .
`` It turned out that asbestos was very widespread especially in big public buildings in which tubes were often isolated with asbestos '' , he says .
The people , that the asbestos in these buildings were stopped , fall ill now .
And so Mesotheliom hits now younger people who did not work in the typical professions .
The most dangerous tubes with asbestos isolations in hospitals lay under the earth , therefore patients were rather not stopped presumably the material
But many employees , that changed into pedestrian tunneling from a building into the other one ( as Andrew Lawson ) or ate in underground canteens ( as it often did to Graham Abbott ) , came with greatest probability into contact with the poisonous substances .
It it proves that over several decades after the war hospitals for the patients possibly life-saving were , however , life-alarmingly for the handling doctors .
It is removed also today still .
Pupils geared their bunsen burners to asbestos mats .
And it only hospital does not affect .
Asbestos was used due to his fabulous isolating and flammhemmenden properties frequently in offices , businesses libraries and municipal halls .
Also schools .
In fact many people had presumably the first asbestos contact in the classroom .
Everywhere in the country , in thousands of chemistry hours , pupils geared their bunsen burners to asbestos mats .
The topic asbestos is spoken about web pages now frequently in schools .
And meanwhile so innocent objects in our houses as slabs or scale roofs contained asbestos as a default .
`` It is an industry poison that in big parts of our real properties contained is '' , notices Andrew Morgan , the lawyer that Andrew Lawson represented Hospital in his process against Guy 's .
In a case the only contact which an affected woman remembered was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970ern .
Therefore you look out as you tear down your garden shed .
The effects of the diagnosis , and the knowledge , that the illness is incurable , is immense .
A while regrets to process that '' , Graham Abbott says .
I went again to the work and attempted to make wider , however I noticed that I could not concentrate on what I did .
I was two weeks in the practice .
Then I knew that I had to go and take care of myself myself .
Na yes , I will not experience any further Christmas .
With the greatest difficulty was the perspective change of the position of a doctor to that of a patient .
As countless patients in front of it he remembers how overwhelmed it was from all the information with which he rakes had to come .
`` It was very heavy to record that all '' , he says .
`` I asked to my doctor `` how long has I still '' ?
And one gave me still about 12 months .
I remember , that I thought , `` Na yes , I will not experience any further Christmas .
That was it then . ''
Mesotheliom is especially insidious because it is our life preservation mechanism - the buckling itself - that the fatal cancer causes .
Most cases of Mesotheliom are caused by asbestos contact .
Asbestos consists of smallest fibres .
If the asbestos is swirled up and the fibres are inhaled , can they in the pleura , the skin around the lungs around , set .
Asbestos fibers irritate the pleura and can activate cell mutations .
`` The problem arises with the inhaled acerose asbestos fibers '' , so professor Tom Treasure , a heart thorax doctor that changed Hospital in 2001 onto the Guy 's .
Exactly the hospital , presumed by the Andrew Lawson , that it has stopped it the asbestos , is now ironischerweise , a leading center during the treatment of Mesotheliom .
Treasure knew lawsone and handled some others , that presumably also during their training in the hospital the asbestos were stopped .
As soon as the asbestos needles reach the pulmonary fabric Treasure says `` where the skin is , if they are pressed from the breath process onto the edge .
By nature it is from the beginning invasive .
The usual options with the case of other cancer illnesses do not function at Mesotheliom so well .
The effectiveness of an operation is for example hotly controversial .
Some mean , that they is an attempt worth .
Treasure denies that .
`` One can not cut out the pleura '' , he says .
You do not avoid that with the knife
Meanwhile the cancer does not respond to chemotherapy very well the `` effect shows '' , however , `` not cures .
`` Sometimes there are long-term survivors , says Treasure .
However , at the end they all die .
Fortunately some patients long live in fact , much longer than expects .
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years according to the diagnosis .
Two and a half years according to his own diagnosis Graham Abbott still fights .
After he had contacted Mesotheliom , Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson , who had become a one-man support and consultation office four years according to his diagnosis for coaffected ones .
He imagined `` Hallo , cancer headquarters , '' cheerfully in the case of calls .
`` It was very positive '' , says Abbott .
He had received his diagnosis 4 years before and was still very much active
Initially Abbott had been offered to six chemotherapy cycles which would last four months and probably prolong his life only around a month .
`` I had despaired '' , he says .
I wanted to give up .
Lawsone managed `` to make `` appear '' it , however , `` the things in an a little more positive light . ''
After the consultation of several doctors Abbott , his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski , decided on continuing heart-thorax-specialist at the Guy 's .
`` We had an advantage through my not having to be referred , I simply called and I got an appointment admits Graham .
A normal patient would have to receive a transfer and to have to wait for the permission of the treatment
Money is decisive for Mesotheliom-ills in order to be able to perceive the best available therapies .
But if finally these treatments fail unavoidably , many concerned persons of another financial worry stand - over the future of the families that leave it behind .
And so they are directed to the courts in the hope for compensation .
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP .
`` It is since 1898 known that asbestos is extreme dangerously for the health '' , says Morgan .
But what is changed , that one recognized that also a very small load represented a health risk .
And here the negligence of the enterprises began to play a role .
Finally Andrew Lawson and Guy 's hospital settled their case , but it was not what Morgan mentions a `` genuine compensation '' since lawsone could not prove with absolute security that his Mesotheliom was to be put down to an asbestos contact at the Guy 's .
After the investigation for his death a speaker of the Guy 's confirmed , however , that `` the asbestos fibers in the affected cellar field in the 1990ern were removed . ''
That was too late for Andrew Lawson .
How asbestos can be removed
It is actual for Mesotheliom ills that make an effort for compensation , an enormous problem to assign the fatal asbestos contact to a company or a job - usually decades after the incidents .
Many of their former employers are sold or closed .
Insurance documents can disappear .
And definitely those ones that defend themselves against claims do not know that the time is for them , however , with the complainants
As reaction to that there were this year clear new legislations that it makes more simply for Mesotheliom concerned persons to demand a compensation even if their former employers are not to be discovered anymore .
The law established a fund of 350 million £ for all that were diagnosed after July 2012 supported by the insurance industry be able to prove a contact , but not be able to sue anybody .
In these cases the complainants receive 80 percent of what a court could have awarded to them in a normal compensation process - about 120,000 £ .
About 300 successful requests with the case of the program are expected per annum .
Andrew Morgan thinks as so many Mesotheliom concerned persons , that 350 million £ represented one `` very good work of the insurance branch .
`` That is a deal of insurers for insurers '' , he says , and points out that it is a question of a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay with the case of this sum if the time had not passed over that and Mesotheliom ills find the enterprises and they could sue normal .
Also Mike Penning , former work and retirement minister , admitted that the law is not `` perfect '' .
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that faced with seven deaths a fast action is necessary daily .
`` The people suffer so very much and need help today '' , said Penning during the second hearing of the Mesotheliom-law in December of the last year .
To this time Graham Abbott was for 19 months in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski .
After their first consultations Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation which he expects a positive effect of unlike Tom Treasure .
This was accompanied from a radiotherapy and a chemotherapy - a triple therapy with which Lang-Lazdunski can present a survival rate more than five years of up to 40 percent .
Abbott felt fortified
`` That is natural with the most important thing , Abbott says .
One sees that again and again with patients .
There is over there something which makes you continue .
If you give up , you are feeling very quickly more bad .

Ten years ago more than 1,000 people were taken into Beslan by tschetschenischen militias in a school in south Russia as hostages .
More than 330 people , more than half of them children , became in the three day long martyrdom , that the world shocked , killed .
We returned according to Beslan in order to find some of the victims which had escaped the death with the case of the atrocity in the classroom .
Exactly a decade after the horrible siege of the school of Beslan at which 334 people died under that 186 children , the heroic survivors warned last night in front of a new apocalypse in Ukraine .
Caught to Kinder and to parents on 1st September 2004 , the beginning of a new school year , as fanatic Islamic terrorists took and killed , that as the worst thing of the evil shone .
The tragedy united west and east in disgust , and changed then surprisingly into action and hope for the future right in the worst misery .
Ten years later we returned according to Beslan in order to find some of the victims which had escaped the death with the case of the atrocity in the classroom .
We found surprising young people who overcame resistances although she will hunt the memory of this terrorist hell forever .

I got up and climbed again in in order to search for my mother .
A soldier saved it

My friends and I attempt not to talk about that on other days .
The pain is too great .

`` I do not want to get married until I end my study and begin my career .
I think of a family later .
She says that the siege will always remain a part of it although the memory becomes every year a little weak .
I am glad , that many people still remember our terrors on the world and we are so thankful for the help that we received from people in Great Britain and everywhere here .
If I in an online way see the photo from myself as I climb back into the school , I think that many people see it for the first time , understand our disaster and contribute to something like that not happening again .
The boy who fled through the ball hail in the opinion his mother is dead
It was his first school day ( Russians go with 7 years into the school ) and survived the three day long siege in the arms his mother Tamara .
As seven year long one he said : `` Mama said to me I am supposed to lie down if there was an explosion , and hold their hand . ''
After an explosion he thought she would die .
She said with regard to it `` Race
Full fear it can be dead , he fled and a crying small child saw on the way , it took with the case of the hand and fled through a ball hail .
His father Wladimir , that his son outside into the arms closed , said : `` Damir said to me that his mother died .
He said : `` I could not save it
In reality had stumbled according to Tamara outside and with leg injuries in the hospital , for her part their part in the assumption that their son died .
After their reunion she said : `` I cried with joy .
I could not believe it .
He ran in and embraced me .
Damir was flown to London later ( of the meanwhile dissolved newspaper news of the World ) , in order to keep from the former prime minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie the title of a Barnardo 's Children 's champion .
`` This horror pursues you every day , however I wanted I could `` stop '' with the remembering '' , he said yesterday .
But I can say that it becomes paler in my memory .
I still know that I threw away all my toy pistols directly after that .
However , now I can play computer games with shot scenes and that is not a problem for me .
`` I am not afraid of going back to the gym , but I do not think about myself myself .
I remember these children with whom I played in the yard and who did not get it towards outside .
We never say that they were killed or are dead .
We say that they stayed in the gym .
I remember very well my journey to London , especially at the game product cases , where I could select myself all which I wanted , and the journey in an above open car .
However , now he is afraid around place as Ukraine , where wars cause the kind of misfortune which it and his friends suffered .
This horror follows you every day , but I wanted I could stop remembering that .
`` I am sorry about it so around all those ones that suffer from the Greueln '' , said Damir that last week worked as a volunteer in a cloister .
I want to help so gladly .
I want to go one day to the police and hope for their taking me next year at the training academy .
His mother Tamara , 48 , said : `` 37 children from our neighborhood were killed , you can imagine that ?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege , there were simply not any children who could call and walk around , and this silence lasted many months .
She remembers lively their journey to London with Damir .
The people in London cried when I told our history
I understood then how people on the other hand of the world can understand our feelings , and show their support .
It was thankful for the price and the possibility to travel to London in the fall 2004 to Cherie Blair and to their foundation
I wanted I could call Cherie and simply say to her that 10 years went by , however , myself I me still onto the meeting me it and her husband in London remember , and as the Damir and me has helped .
I still remember as Damir wanted to eat Borschtsch gladly and they called all local Russian restaurants .
I remember as he played with waiters in a restaurant . Damir fired with his water pistol onto them and they ran away and they played with it
And that was only a month according to the horror .
I was surprised , that the Britons in a so inclined way divided our pain and supported us .
She said : `` I always think that this world did not become better during these 10 years .
In Ukraine the war goes on now , and every day people die , and I believe that many children were killed and are still killed .
Those ones are exactly such children as ours .
I think that for many the war is a part of the news which they hear if they are bored or occupied with something else .
I simply know what these people feel the whole horror .
And I can not stop with feeling that .
Nothing changed , the people want to kill themselves still mutually and that is so sad .
Damir became big and is a very gentle and quiet boy , it is not aggressive or furious at all .
He does not search for example for revenge it is not overwhelmed by the last Greueln .
I know that he does not remember that gladly , but he has six narrow friends from the class and they go sometimes into the gym and they light candles there .
When it was smaller , he suffered from that - I remember as he laid onto the sofa sometimes , turned away the face from us , for hours .
Not sleeping , his eyes were open .
I also still remember , as it all his arms and other military toys away flung . Damir is now 17 , larger than I , good-looking , intelligent and healthy .
I can hardly believe that I was so secure for some hours that it is dead and I would never again see it
When I recovered after the explosion and came to the legs , I looked around , and the hell looked around me around , with parts of the body lying around everywhere .
I was completely secure that my small boy could have survived in this hell impossibly .
`` I remember , that I called out to him , `` Damir , run , run away '' , however I was also so secure that he had not heard me .
But he heard it and he ran away .
And so the life , different than that of many others , for us goes wider .
Georgij Ilyin , 17
The boy whose terrible picture after the siege for the symbol that one became horror of Beslan
Comfort : The Beslan survivor Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege 2004 , to the right a picture of Georgij today
His face covered with blood was drawn from fear when he ran around his life while tschetschenische terrorists were shooting down his classmates .
His picture was one of the schockierendsten symbols for the barbarism of Beslan .
His mother Fatima , 54 , a doctor , had dropped it off for his first school day before she hurried loosely in order to bring their older son Wladimir to the university .
`` I left the yard about two minutes before the terrorists stormed it , and so my small boy remained alone there for three terrible days '' , she remembers .
Not very alone , there was a whole family of relatives of us , but they were killed all .
Only my Georgij created it , survive .
The nearer this date moves , the heavier it is , to think of that and to talk about that .
There is not any single day , at which we do not remember this tragedy .
We do not think that it is long here , I think it would have happened yesterday , some scenes from these days follow me continuously .
Nobody will ever forget that , I promise that to you .
Insistent : The picture of Georgij ( to the left ) was one of the schockierendsten of the attack and was immortalized as a statue ( to the right ) .
I remember , that Georgij wanted to go so gladly on this day to the school . He said he wants to embrace his teacher .
I knew first that it was at the life when I saw it on televison .
And now there is even this statue of the crying Georgij in San Marino .
Georgij does not see the picture gladly , and it is hidden with us at home in the bookshelf .
I understand that , but I also mean , that the people in all world thanks to this picture our pain feel .
Georgij says today : `` It is important , that something like that can never again happen .
`` I doubt that we ever find out the truth .
The people examine such tragedies again and again and never find out the truth .
And now they examine the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine .
Will we find out ever what caused it ?
This world becomes something terrible .
`` I can not understand as that is possible , because if you ask to the people , nobody wants a war , therefore as happens that ?
Ten years are not anything at all with the case of such pain .
We need dozens of years , around it one to forget little in a small way .
It attacked my health and I still feel it .
For about three or four years I had a few nightmares because of the siege , but then it became better .
I went later again in the year 2004 to the school and had every day of fear .
I thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed .
For that I always go into the gym when the 1st September comes closer .
I want to mean my old childhood friends toll express .
It is heavy for me to go into the gym , but I must do it .
I do not feel as a victim this history is now a part of my past .
I will not forget it , but I do not pity myself .
My life goes on .
I finished this year the school and go to a medical college in Wladikawkaz .
I will become heart surgeon .
My first choice was a training in the army .
I wanted to become a soldier , but my health did not approve that .
I wanted to fight for my country , but that will not happen .
Georgij Fanijew , 20
The boy who survived who being caught to feet of a murderous terrorist
A miracle : Georgij Fanijew was during the siege caught to feet of a murderous terrorist , but it managed to survive .
During the siege it was caught in the gym and was next to the bomb which was attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist .
It is really a miracle that it was not killed .
`` We feel it as if it have been yesterday '' , says Georgij that wanted to go to the FSB as a secret service officer , but could not do this because of his sanitary damages due to the siege .
It is still with me , it is not anything which I have let behind myself .
I am now older and the people say that children can deal with bad experiences easily - I must say that is not right .
`` In 2006 I worked with psychologists and felt after that a little better in fact , however I can not forget it .
And I would be forgotten gladly .
In 2005 - in the year after that - was the first and only times , that I went again into the gym .
I lost the consciousness .
I will return never again there and you do not ask to me please , to show you where I was in this famous picture .
Survivors ' : Georgij Fanijew today , with a photo of themselves in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is enormous and I carry it every day with me .
My friends know , that I do not think of that gladly or talk about that and they did not ask me ever for the school .
Physically I am fine .
I should be cautious with my hurt knee , but I can walk now well .
But because of my health I could not study at the secret service academy of the FSB in St. Petersburg as I wanted .
I have my documents also the medical ones sent in and they answered , that it is not possible .
The animals were my second passion , therefore I went onto the veterinary institute .
I have two years there already behind myself .
He learns the treatment of all animals `` of cats up to cows '' .
He said : `` I knew that I would never report my children about my experiences .
About that children should not know anything and they should not suffer it as a matter of course either .
His mother Marina , 42 , said : `` This pain leaves me never .
It is in my soul , worse , if the anniversary comes closer .
I will go for the ceremonies for the memory .
I know that Georgij will not go .
It must be still much more vehement for it because it was there and I not .
I waited at home for it and could not help .
I am God so thankful that it was returned to me . Here in Beslan all of them are drawn
It remains in us .
Georgij is now an adult , but this horror is still in it
It is heavy to accept that when something so Unfair happens to one .
He is a boy , he likes sport , but he can not participate because of his knee .
It was operated on multiple , he can not run , but not do any sport .
I would say that he overcame the horror to 50 % , but one can completely never overcome that and forget that .
This terrible experience will always follow us .
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the siege and that intensifies only my pain .
I lost many people who I knew well and who were expensive to me .
My son is with me , and that is the biggest present that God could do to me , however , my heart cries around the killed ones .
I know about families in which new children were born , but also about Witwen who never again got married .
It is heavy to accept that the life goes on even if one does not want that .
I will never forget how my heart jumped in me when I saw it in the hospital .
And now I see what in the world goes on - wars in other regions
What do these people fight for ?
Why do they kill themselves mutually
The war is now very much near to our country and I can almost not believe that .
We were formerly a friendly country , as it can be that we fight now ?
People and children suffer , I am secure that in Ukraine already many children were killed and still many are killed .
If we grasp and could throw out only all these rebels - as far away as only possibly .
Aljona Tskajewa , 10
The baby who was borne movingly so by a special task force out of danger
Saved : Aljona Tskajewa is saved by a Russian special task force ( to the left ) .
It is to now ten ( to the right ) and does not remember the cruelties at all
The world stopped in 2004 the breath when the baby Aljona was taken into the pauper of a Russian policeman by Beslan from the siege .
The terrorists made her go , but they held up their 30-year old mother , the 10-year old sister Kristina and their brother Makhar in the school gym in their cruelty .
Makhar , then three years old , escaped , however Aljonas of mother and sister died in the murderous massacre
Your father Ruslan got married since then again and has a small girl with his new wife Swetlana , that he named after his lost daughter Kristina .
Aljona , today ten years old , does not remember the siege and grew up to an intelligent and happy girl , neighbors say .
`` You are now a large happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both splendid children '' , a narrow friend says .
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to spare them all the memories which approach with the tenth anniversary .
You will understand , why .

Distinguish students today in their expectations and claims very of the students 10 , 20 , 30 or 40 years ago - it is ever more important then to do a splendid first impression and with VIF can one exactly that .

Megan Dunn , vice-presidents of the NUS for higher education said : `` This offer shines completely separately from the life of the majority of the students .
Many students that begin with the study this month see themselves exposed to a crisis of the costs of living , since the available finance aids do not keep pace with the strongly increasing bills in the form of credits and scholarships for the simplest bases of life before they can think anyway daran to be issued thousands of pound for something simple as the arrival in the dormitory .

Putin demands the photo from Kiev from `` Staatlichkeitsgesprächen '' with east Ukraine
The Russian president Wladimir Putin demanded according to Russian media reports on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stops the fights against the separatists in the east of the country and incorporates them immediately with negotiations for the `` Staatlichkeit '' of the disloyal region
His speaker Dimitri Peskow explained later that Putin did not think in this way that the field of east Ukraine standing under the control of the separatists becomes a part of Russia , but that his status must be defined opposite Ukraine again in order to give the power to the representation of his rights and interests to the Russian-speaking region
Putins appeal to the Kiewer government to negotiations on eye level with the pro-Russian insurgents matches , however , the strategy since beginning of the outrages five months ago apparently hunted by him : Help for the separatists while taking from fields and pressure on the Ukrainian government , around the again proclaimed region Novorossija actual independence for an alliance with Russia instead of making possible with the west .
In an interview with the state television broadcast station channel One Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign for the moving-conquest of the fields held by separatists in the eastern regions Donezk and Luhansk , that in March and were taken April , after Moscow had annexed the Ukrainian peninsula Crimea on 18th March .
The Kremlin and the separatists referred in last time to the taken field as `` Novorossija '' or `` Neurussland '' , a concept that reminds of the vorrevolutionäre heyday of the Russian empire .
Putin referred , that all those ones , who in the course of the campaigns of Ukrainian politicians for the choices on 26th Oct. and while government groups are attacking civilian municipalities in the fields held by separatists hope for quick peace conversations `` in their illusions caught '' are , told Itar-Tass .
`` We must record detailed conversations immediately , not only to technical questions , but also to the political organization of the society and the state status of south-east Ukraine in order to protect the interests of the people living there '' he said .
It said to Peskow that Putins reference to the Staatlichkeit in the context with the greater autonomy which is discussed by the Kiewer leadership for months must be seen in order to dispel apprehensions in Russian-speaking fields that their cultural and linguistic rights are endangered .
Only the Ukrainian government can give the necessary autonomy to the eastern fields , said Peskow .
It is not a question here of negotiations between Ukraine and Russia , Peskow said `` because it is not a question of a conflict between Russia and Ukraine but around an internal conflict in Ukraine . ''
The clarification of the Kremlin speaker to the correction of the `` faulty interpretation '' of Putins remarks underlined the claim to leadership of Russia with the case of the contact with the separatistic rebellion in the east unlike the direct Annektion of the Crimea , on which the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians .
Moscow would have annexed far greater difficulties the regions Donezk and Luhansk in east Ukraine there most of the 6.5 million inhabitants no Russians are and turned out inquiries from the time in front of the conflict a wide majority for the whereabouts in Ukraine .
The autonomy which was spoken to by Russian diplomats on international forums would give the regional governments in Ukraine proxy to discuss own commercial agreements and exterior relationships , and give so the Kremlin de facto the control of a field which combines the Russian state field with the Crimea .
The home port for the majority of the Russian navy as well as an important commercial port and historical coast region is the five months ago annexed peninsula in the Black Sea .
The regions between the Rostowgebiet in Russia and the Crimea is in addition rich of mines , factories and foundries that manufacture important components for the Russian military .
The Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko suggested during his speech for the inauguration on 7th June that the Ukrainian legislation is supposed to consider - after new choices - additions to the constitution with which a greater control is empowered to the respective fields about their finances and the status of the languages .
But his idea of autonomy seems to support in sharp contrast those of the Kremlin and the separatistic rebels whose armament and Aufstachelung Moscow are reproached .
Putins last request at Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders on eye level followed after a further advance of the rebels in the last week after Russian troops and tanks about the before peaceful region along the Asowschen sea penetrated east Ukraine .
The separatists supported by Russia took control in the surprise attack which according to apprehensions of Ukrainian security guards the first step of a campaign for the takeover is to the strategic coast region up to the Crimea from Nowoasowsk .
For this reason massive civilian and military preparations started , around Mariupol , to fortify a steel industry harbor with 500,000 inhabitants that lies between Nowoasowsk and the narrow access to the Crimea peninsula .
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels and asked urgently a former Soviet republic which is independent for 23 years for actions in order to prevent a further Russian aggression against Ukraine .
`` We to stand shortly before a point at which there is not any back anymore '' warned Poroshenko .
There are thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks now on the territory of Ukraine .
The EU peak did not conclude any concrete actions , the leadership demanded the draft of further sanctions against Russia which are supposed to come into force with the case of an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis .
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk after two Russian tank columns and 1,000 soldiers penetrated the Donezkregion last week in order to support the besieged separatists , said colonel Andrij Lysenko , speaker of the Ukrainian of National Security and Defense Council reports on Saturday in Kiev .
The first presumably 63 Ukrainian soldiers to be included into Ilowajsk by the Russian idea were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers that a week ago had been taken caught on Ukrainian field , Lysenko informed on Sunday .

There is silence under this treetop
We showed a powerful tribe during our puzzle task of the summer series `` My piece of the Rhöner Glück '' on the last Friday .
There are still several of these giant trees in the rural district , the shown copy is the `` nanny-goat silence oak '' above Unterweißenbrunn .
A bumpy footpath leads up to the about 600 years old oak .
It goes past Koppeln , basalt stone heap and Basaltsteinmeeren .
A small piece below the quarry of the farmer mountain , a kilometer north of the street to wise creek there it stands
The natural monument looks energetic , it projects over the other trees of the surroundings and it reminds of an American mammoth tree with an extent of more than eight meters .
A small Buddha on a tree stump points at it being a question of a spiritual or mystic place .
However , in spite of intense investigations there were only references to the name origin .
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider consulted the Bischofsheimer archive extra and consulted older people from Unterweißenbrunn in order to find out which circumstance has it with the nanny-goat silence oak .
The result of his enquiries remained the quite sober declaration for the name .
Accordingly the goat herdsmen are supposed to have driven their animals until about 80 years ago onto the meadows arduously cleared and released from stones from Unterweißenbrunn .
At the foot of the tree the animal guardians exhausted from the rise are supposed to have taken a rest .
Meanwhile the field gained his importance back , because on the meadows goat herds graze in fact again .
The field was in addition declared as the nuclear zone of the biosphere reservation , if Schneider kept on finding the way out .
During the entrance of the stone crowds one should make however , caution prevail , because the basalt warmed up by the sun is some popular whereabouts also for common vipers .
A footpath leads from Unterweißenbrunn to the tree which , however , is a little hidden .
Further ways are signposted , climb up the direction Hochrhön and invite to an extensive excursion
Where does the water castle stand

Exclusive departure from new novel highly vowed to Howard Jacobsons about love and the letter `` J '' .
Run you , one could describe it best so , they dispersed slowly as a cardboard which one has in the rain leave .
Sometimes a woman told to him , it is too serious , hard , intense distanziert and maybe a little snappish .
And the hand shook to him then .
Snappishly he knew .
It was prickly , as in hedgehogs , yes .
The last victim of this Stacheligkeit was a just beginning affair which had been more promising for a relief of the secluded boredom of his life than else , and maybe would have brought him even a certain contentment .
Ailinn Solomons was a tremblingly tender beauty with uncurbed hairs and a fluttering heart from a village on the north island which was even even remoter and rougher than port Reuben .
It had come to south with an older company that held Kevern for their aunt , and that had inherited a plot in a moist but paradisiac valley with the apt name Paradise Valley .
Over several years nobody had lived in the house .
The tubes were leaky , in the baths spiders were still , slugs had left behind their tracks on all windows and believed , that all belongs to them , and the garden was with weed practiced grown-up , that looked like gigantic cabbages .
It was a garden of full secrets as the house from a child fairy tale , both alarming and enticing .
Portrait of the author : Howard Jacobson , whose novel `` J '' on the Longlist for that one stands One Booker price 2014 .
The short cunning is announced in the coming week .
Kevern had sat with Ailinn händchenhaltend on the broken beach chairs in the high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon . Both had latched themselves absentmindedly into the service console that supplied the country with calming music and calming news when the sight of their crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song of a for a long time forgotten black entertainer which his father had listened to gladly near closed rolling shutters in the house .
Your feet are too large .
Due to their ureigenen aggressivity songs of this kind were not played anymore on the console .
Not forbidden - nothingness was so correctly prohibited - not played simply .
It became successfully obsolesziert , so as the word obsoleszieren .
The general taste created , what decrees and rules would never have created , and choose the Vom plate scrubber zum-millionaire-memoirs , cookery books and love novels as the people at books , so they chose with the case of the music the ballads .
In the euphoria of the day began to play Kevern an imaginary piano and to record on large feet in a coarse-funny serenade Ailinns .
Ailinn did not understand that .
`` That was a known song of a jazz pianist by the name of Fats Waller '' , it declared her and laid automatically two fingers onto his lips .
His father had always done that in order to stop the letter J before his coming from his mouth .
It had begun as a game between it and his father when it was still small .
His father had played it with his own father , so it had told .
If you begin a word with a J without putting two fingers over your lips , it costs you a penny .
It had not been already a very merry game then , and it was not also now very merry .
He knew , which this was expected by him , that was everything .
It had to be declared what jazz was .
To which ones Ailinn had never yet belonged .
Jazz was not played even if it was not directly forbidden .
The improvising was not more modern .
It was only place for an only `` when '' in the life .
The people wanted to be sure at the beginning of a melody , where it would end .
In the same way the intelligence .
His Unvorhersehbarkeit made the people nervous .
And jazz was musically expressed intelligence .
Although he had become 10 years old without having heard about Sammy Davis junior , knew Kevern a little about jazz of that one half secret collection old CDs ' of his father .
However , at least it did not have to declare Ailinn that Fats Waller was black .
In their age she could not remember presumably a time in which pop singers were not black .
Again was valid , no laws or compulsions
A consistent society meant , that every element of this society agreed thankful the principle of the group talent - thankfully as the ones spared to from the fate .
People with afro-Caribbean origin were suitable through temperament and build for conversation and sport , therefore they sang and they ran .
People who came from the Indian subcontinent initially were blessed as of the nature with electronic talent and were looked after with the task of guaranteeing that no family without functioning engineer 's order wire unit telephone stayed .
What was still remaining from the Polish community cared around the canalization ; what was remaining from the Greeks smashed plates .
Those ones from the Gulf States and the Levante , whose grandparents had not left the country quickly than WHAT HAD HAPPENED , IF IT HAD HAPPENED happen- for fear , to be accused of fire poke , for fear even , that they would consume the flames as next - had held Labneh- and revealed to Shisha whistle restaurants , themselves considers and became with the idleness depressive .
Everyone according to his abilities
Since she had heard only ballads , it was difficult for Ailinn to understand how the offensive words could ever be vertont that had just vorgesungen her Kevern .
Music was expression of love .
`` Those ones are not really offensive '' , said to Kevern .
Except for maybe for people whose feet are too large .
My father has never offended somebody , but he loved this song .
He talked too much , but the neglected garden gave him the treacherous feeling of security
The sound absorption of the gigantic cabbage-like leaves could not overcome anything .
Ailinn did still not understand .
Why your father should have loved something like that ?
He wanted to say that it was a joke , hesitated , however , with laying two fingers again onto the lips in their present
She thought anyhow already that it was a little strange .
`` It appeared merry to him '' , he said instead of this .
It joggled unbelievingly their head and obstructed Keverns view
It did not admit anything else on the whole world see , as their uncombed raven hair .
There was not Anything which otherwise he would have wanted to see .
`` If you say it '' , she thinks without conviction .
But that does not declare why you vorsingst it to me yet .
It seemed honestly worried .
Are my feet too large ?
He looked once again there .
Your feet so directly not .
Maybe your ankles a little bit ...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick ?
Hate you ?
Of course I do not hate you .
Nevertheless that is only the stupid song .
It could have said `` I love you '' , but for that it was still too early .
`` Your thick ankles are exactly the reason why I like you '' , he attempted it instead of this .
I am a little perverted there .
That did not ring correctly .
It had been supposed to be funny .
If he attempted to be funny , he often in trouble killed himself , because it did not have as his father the calming Charm that one needed in order to control the cruelty inherent in jokes .
Maybe his father wanted to be also cruel .
Maybe he of Kevern wanted , that be .
In spite of his friendly eyes .
Ailinn Solomons became red and rose from their beach chair , overturned the console and spilled the wine which they had drunk .
Elder flower wine , therefore drunkenness was not an excuse for it
In their excitement it seemed to tremble , as palm fronds in the storm
`` And your stubborn person is exactly the reason why I feel perverted drawn to you '' , it said ...
Except for , that I am not that at all .
He was sorry about it both because of the unnecessary unfriendliness of his words as also the fear that was proved in their eyes when she revolted against it
Did she think that he would beat it
It had not told him about the life on the cold northern archipelago , where she had grown up , but he did not have any doubts that it was like this basically as here .
The same gigantic and icy-cold ocean broke to itself here as there at the shore
The same confused men , with even thicker skin and more peevish after THAT WHAT HAD HAPPENED than their ancestors had been as smugglers and beach robbers , drew from pub to pub , always ready to raise the hand against a woman , who refused them or verlachte .
Stubborn person ?
Those ones would have shown her a thick fist if she did not look out !
You first smooch - Smooching was the most frequently used word for an erotic attraction between men and women , an antidote for the meaningless love ballads from the console - with her first smooch and beat then .
According to Keverns opinion that was an unnecessary refinement since the smooching represented even already an act of the power
Ailinn Solomons admitted a sign to him through their body go .
It rose from the beach chair as an old man .
She felt also leaden , but the impact of his grief surprised her .
That was not the end of the world .
Nevertheless you hardly knew yourself .
She watched to him , as he left - so as from a room in the upper stick their companion watched him during that - a man , burdened by something that he himself had caused .
Adam leaves the garden , she thought .
She felt a sudden pain for it and men in general , although some their hands against them had risen .
A man turned away from it bent his back , abashed , conquer , without fighting spirit - why that was a sight that it seemed good to know , when they could remember nevertheless not onto an only time , at which she had seen something like that before the present day already once ?
When it was again alone , Ailinn Solomons looked at their feet .
Many years in front of the just told incidents Esme Nussbaum , an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year old researcher worked on a short lecture on the consecutive power in the task of Ofnow , the nonlegislative monitoring control for the public atmosphere , on low and middle level in exactly the regions , in which to expect their decrease , if not abolition , at the ehesten are been , in view of the money and energy that the extermination of this power had been invested in .
`` It was done already a lot , and a lot must still be done '' , she wrote `` in order to soothe the innate aggressivity of a nation that led a thousand wars and won most of them in particular in the remote corners and valleys of the country in which the sweet breath of human friendliness was verspürt seen historical in spite of the church towers rising highly between the rears rarely .
But some properties turn out as ineradicable .
The higher the church tower , it seems like this , the passion in a the smaller way that it keeps on waking .
The population cries during the hearing of sentimental ballads , intoxicates with histories about overcome difficulties and claimed to believe in the virtues of marriage and family lives firmly , however , nevertheless only the former brutality does not hold the rural municipalities just the same as our urban structures do in the hand , but there are also proofs for the origin of a new and insidious belligerence at home , at the job , on the streets and even on the grounds .
`` You have an unhappy tendency towards the exaggeration '' , thought their mentor when he had read the whole report .
I suggest that you read less novels .
Esme Nussbaum bowed their head .
I must also ask : are you an atheist ?
`` I believe , I do not have `` to say '' that , Esme Nussbaum answered .
Are you lesbian ?
Again Esme referred onto their right to privacy and refusal of the statement
Feminist ?
Again silence .
`` I do not ask that , '' finally Luther Rabinowitz said `` because I would be against atheism , Lesbentum or feminism .
That here an unprejudiced job is .
An unprejudiced society uses us .
However , specific kinds of hypersensitivity that are completely acceptable and praiseworthy at themselves can distort on the occasion of results as you introduced it
You yourself have prejudices obviously against the church , and these things which you refer to as `` insidious '' and `` raw '' strength and vitality could be interpreted by others just as well than expression of one of course .
When one rides out wider on the , WHAT HAPPENED IF IT HAS HAPPENED as if it would have happened yesterday if it had happened means , to take his essential vitality the country .
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz was speaking .
Repeated behind his head a LED lettering in flamingo pink the advice , that Ofnow the country in the last quarter century or longer had given .
You smile at their neighbor , wertschätzen you you visit their partner , you hear ballads , musicals , you use their telephone , speak you hear , you declare , you excusing too , you vote too , you .
Speaking is better than silence is , the sung word is better than the written one is , but nothing is better than love is .
`` I completely understand on what you want out '' , Esme Nussbaum with quiet voice answered , als sie secure was , that their superior to end had spoken , `` and I do not say anything else than that we did not cure as effectively as we show ourselves ourselves yet .
My concern lies in our recovering ourselves possibly without prior warning at how we repeat the errors that anyway first to THAT WHAT HAPPENED , IF IT HAS HAPPENED led .
This time the others at whom we skip our rage and our distrust are not it , however .
Luther Rabinowitz shaped a pyramid with the hands .
Around in this way a patience of Job point out .
`` You go too far '' , he said `` if you refer to actions '' as `` errors which our grandparents maybe or neither committed '' .
You go also too far if you speak of that that these their `` rage '' and their `` Distrusting '' at `` others '' would have let out .
It should not be actually necessary , somebody in your position at that remember , that we with the case of the sense of the past as with the case of the protection of the present not speak of `` us '' and `` others '' .
There was no `` we '' and there were not any `` else '' .
It was a time of the disorder that is all which we know .
`` Of that one if we are honest to ourselves ourselves '' dared to throw in Esme , `` to have behaved well , `` no part of the society can claim .
I do not accuse anybody .
Whether it badly or well what happened was done is happen .
That was then .
More does not have to be said with regard to that anything - there we agree agreed to ourselves .
And exactly as no fault has to be assigned , so also no fault has to be paid off if such deletion would be appropriate and if it would give a way to wipe it out .
But for what the past is used if we do not learn from that -
The past is used for our forgetting it
If I may say something with regard to that -
Luther Rabinowitz made his pyramid tumble down .
`` I will consider their report '' , he said and released her .
On the next day , when it went as usual to the work it was run over by a motorcyclist who had gone onto the footpath , described as passers-by , in a kind of `` brutal rage '' .
There are coincidences .

After tug-of-war lasting for weeks the nomination of his exterior minister Federica Mogherini put through week Italy 's prime minister and current EU chairperson , Matteo Renzi , last against strong conservative resistances on the EU special peak as a head of the EU foreign policy , she becomes successor of the Briton Catherine Ashton .
Renzi considers as a strengthening of the position of the social democrats and his own ones in the EU the appointment of his Mogherini being regarded as a favorite also in the government team as the government-near daily paper displays La Repubblica .
He expects also an impetus of that for his `` reform parcel in Italy .
Last but not least Renzi hopes for setting also the left party basis rebelling against it again and again in this way quietly because Mogherini becomes this - when also rather in moderate manner - assigned .
Opposite the conservative representatives with commission president Jean-Claude Juncker and the Pole Donald Tusk nominated as council presidents , so the predominating opinion in Rome is made in this way a political compensation
Because the chief diplomat of the EU becomes simultaneously deputy of the commission president Juncker .
The still outstanding approval of the EU parliament is regarded as secure
Otherwise President of the State Giorgio Napolitano would not have mentioned presumably hardly an `` important recognition '' of the role of Italy in the EU the nomination of the 41 year old politician of the ruling Democratic party ( PD ) .
La Repubblica spreads optimism , that the Mogherini proven for almost two decades in leading party offices and known to their ambition will show herself increased to the `` enormous challenges '' .
The native Roman is married and has two daughters .
The promovierte Politologin began your party career in 1996 in the youth organization of the former Democratici di Sinistra ( Link democrats ) who joined itself Margherita with the Catholic center party to the present social-democratic PD in 2008 .
In 1999 Mogherini became vice-president of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth ( European young socialists ) for three years .
With the choice 2001 into the party council of the link democrats she got into the high party politics , foreign policy whose head she soon became worked in the department .
She filled traditional emphases of Italian foreign policy as the Near East , became through studies the NATO insertion in Afghanistan , participated in the Italy with a troop contingent is , confessed maintained , the contacts to the social democrats in Europe and to the democrats in the USA .
Since 2008 she is a member of the chamber of deputies in which she is an expert for defense and European and international matters .
When Renzi became prime minister in February 2014 , he appointed Mogherini as his exterior minister .
If the PD has today again a better relation to the strong peace movement in the country that contributed to the more than 40 percent of voices of the party at the EU choices in May , Federica Mogherini has a part of that then how in PD-circles is noted down .
The reproaches in Brussels , the new EU exterior representative has too little diplomatic experience , substance is missing therefore , counters in the PD .
In Brussels , particularly from Poland and the Baltic members mistrustfully realistic accents of Mogherinis for the crisis are pursued in Ukraine and defamed as `` a Russia-friendly course '' .
She approves the pipeline South Stream practiced by the Russian Gasprom company above which Russian natural gas is supposed to be transported under avoidance of Ukraine directly according to Southern Europe , which is used also for the energy protection of Italy .
After Renzi had entered upon his term of office in July as a EU chairperson , Mogherini for their first state visit traveled to Moscow .
Photos that showed it with Putin at the Shake-hands were received in Brussels with indignation , in the same way , that they invited the Kremlin leader for October to one May countries economic peaks

Berkeley declares housing market as `` normal '' again
One of the most prominent building contractors of London referred to the housing market `` returning '' in the southeast of England again to normal level .
Freehold dwellings in the the capital were sought after hot and object of enormous price climbs , what persuaded the bank from England due to the widespread fear of a credit bubble to setting upper limits in June for mortgage credits .
To Tony Pidgley , to Gründer and to executive board chairperson of the highly class building contractor Berkeley said on Monday : `` Since beginning of the current finance year the market has returned again to normal transaction levels since the highest level 2013 '' and added that this offers some `` stable action surroundings
The property market in London was during the downturn well stationed since foreign buyers rushed towards the capital .
According to information of the land-registry the prices went up around 18.5 percent in the town area alone in the last year suddenly , far more than the average rise in England and Wales in total .
The average sale prices at Berkeleys private , economical and studentischen offers climbed around approximately a fifth in the lasted year and lay at the end of April around the 423,000 £ .
A stronger pound made however , real property property attractive in the last months in London for foreign buyers less - some of them were deterred also by the introduction of new real property taxes and political rhetoric around a possible `` Villensteuer '' in front of the general elections in coming May .
The London estate agent Foxtons warned in the last week against the mortgage market report leading also to smaller market growth for April in which sharper granting of credit regulations were presented in the second year half both with the case of the real property sale and with the case of the prices .
New data of the bank of England of the Monday show a drop during the mortgage approval in July , what indicates the property market also cooling off .
Hamptions International , another real property agency , corrected his prediction for the rise of the real property prices in London for 2015 down on 3 percent , on the basis of an already now schwächelnden house price consciousness .
The transaction volume in the most expensive areas of London as Chelsea , Mayfair and Kensington year went back in the meantime about a quarter for year , according to the broker WA Ellis .
Nevertheless the wish is a blessing to a freehold dwelling in the capital for Berkeley since the due amounts amount to more than 2.2 billion £ for appointment sales .
Mr Pidgley added : `` The demand for the correct , well planned product at the best locations remained stable and as a result also the appointment sales remained stable . ''
In June the enterprise told that it had sold 3,742 new freehold dwellings in the year until end of April - almost a third more than to the highest level 2007 in front of the crisis .
The annual input tax result changed annually 40 percent onto 280 million £ , the turnover about 18 percent on 1.6 billion £ .
In a communication on Monday in front of the year meeting of the enterprise Mr Pidgley said that the gains would probably comply with the present market expectations for Berkeley in the current year .
The analysts estimate matchingly the annual input tax result at 450 million £ .
Berkeley-stocks stood in the afternoon fixed in the London trade at 23.96 £ .

4 tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you liked to make photos or videos underwater gladly , there is a selection of devices .
The most economical option is a waterproof Point-and-Shoot , as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an Action-Cam as the GoPro Hero3+ Silver edition that to have both for about 300 $ are .
I received these photos at a family celebration with several cameras which are available all for a price of less than 350 $ .
Independently of the outfit there are a few rules for the best results .
Control your outfit twice .
Even if you have a waterproof camera , you assure , that the battery chamber and other compartments are thick locked up .
Put your camera also on the photos or videos which you want to receive .
Some cameras and camcorders have scene and photo modes with which the exposure time is optimized for the dim underwater conditions .
And before you jump in , you check until which depth your outfit is operative .
Some cameras are approved only for up to 5 feet , others to 50 or 60 feet .
Search for digital cameras in our purchase leader and the evaluations for traditional and waterproof models .
You do multiple photos - because many will not bang .
Point-and-Shoot cameras have a LCD , with which you can compose pictures , Action-Cams usually not .
Even if you have a LCD , it is difficult to notice this underwater , and the correct framing is a matter of luck .
Therefore you do many photos
If your camera has a row mode with which a series of photos with slightly changed illumination attitudes are done , you use it .
You remain near the surface .
The light becomes dramatically worse the wider you leave the surface .
If possible you stay therefore close to the surface if you do photos in a pool , a lake or the sea .
Through that you can bring also more color into your photos ; the deeper you go , the little color you become see .
Approach close to the objects .
That is a good council also ashore , but it is the more important underwater because of the bad lighting conditions .
It is completely especially important if you work with an Action-Cam : These devices have often a firm wide-angle coverage lens which means , that you thicker onto your objects must , if these are supposed to fill the entire picture frame .

Cyclists , joggers and hikers were there yesterday during the 8th cycling onto the Big Field Mountain and supported in this way the association `` Help for cancer-sick children '' .
The tour which was a torture for ones represented a slight training for the others .
In one they all agreed agreed to themselves , however : It did fun .
Thomas Studanski might have slept last night well .
Because for the first time in his life the head of the Oberurseler brewery went onto the field mountain yesterday with the wheel .
For the good purpose .
He can wegstecken the small muscle ache there easily , especially it the participation in the 8th cycling onto the Big field mountain for the benefit of the association `` Help for cancer-sick children '' ( Frankfurt ) also personally a valuable discovery has brought .
A fabulous thing .
`` I know now , that I that can - excellently ! ''
Small Päuschen on the way in the applause curve ?
Nee , if I had stopped once , wär 's from been ...
As Thomas Studanski , who is in the Oberurseler city parliament for the CDU , many of the 718 participants tormented themselves yesterday to shale in the morning dew and arrived the exhaustion near , but happily on the plateau .
Other on the other hand it fell easier , that to overcome eleven kilometers long stretch well between Hohemark and field mountain .
Norman Dießner for example .
The greens politician completely performing in reds from the kreis assembly - red dress , red Bike - did at the start still a little on understatement ( `` Every amount pros , there arriving is the objective proved then , however , at the mountain nevertheless as a half pro and went after 45 minutes without breathlessness through the objective
Also it drove the stretch in a slide , as also Nina Kuhn , press spokeswoman of the city of Oberursel that had made itself together with Frank Grüneisen onto the way .
For the two tri-athletes the `` field mountain cycling '' was absolutely not a sporting challenge : `` Here it is a question of Charity , there we are gladly with in this case - we '' would have `` done '' an exit '' today anyhow '' , according to Kuhn .
On the way they had hit Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg .
The boy ( 12 ) had gone down at the morning according to Oberursel in order to thrash about onto the height now on that again .
The inhabitant of Frankfurt Florian Zierz had vaulted into the saddle at the morning at 9 o'clock at home , two times `` did '' the field mountain in order to roll home then with fun .
Also `` Fritten-Toni '' had fun .
For the head of the Oberurseler cult kiosk bicycle tours simply belong over the field mountain for this purpose .
It had headed with his 6.5-kilo racing cycle for 40 minutes .
A mad event .
For this purpose - there I am gladly in this case , Andreas Balzke meant '' .
The trained inhabitant of Mainz it says from themselves that he is an `` ambitious running-cyclist '' .
It must be that also , because it was with the `` Fixie wheel '' on the way , those ones are indeed also racing cycles , however without switching
Not only the 20 hikers who climbed about the White Wall and the fox dance to the peak but also a jogger who dragged along a car tire with weights at a cord behind himself proved that it went loosely also without wheel up .
Mountain guard doctor professor Volker Lischke said that guaranteed for security with his team , equipped with space wheel Bully and Quad : `` The kenn '' I from Frankfurt , that trains for a specific Schlittentrail only that he simply pulls the sledge himself '' . The man is therefore in a way his own sledge dog .
The 718 participants - and in this way as many as still never - had been sent at the morning in groups onto the stretch
The hikers first at 9.30 o'clock .
The first cyclists and runners at 10 o'clock followed .
Five minutes later the first Mountainbiker started .
Bent Hansen , chairperson of the association `` Radeln onto the Big Field Mountain '' , gave the starting commands and wished the participants a beautiful excursion .
For next year he hopes for succeeding in blocking the stretch to the field mountain for the security the participant .

Berlin - According to CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl should find the running prohibition procedure 's against the NPD in front of the Federal Constitutional Court an end .
`` The NPD comes off worse than with the case of the last time '' , said Strobl that is also a CDU country leader in Baden-Württemberg , the `` Leipziger nation newspaper '' .
That is a pleasant development into the correct direction and a development that makes me rather come to the result that one combats the NPD politically and not before the constitution court
The NPD had failed during the vote on Sunday very just because of the five-percent-hurdle .
A first run for a prohibition of the right-extreme party had failed in 2003 because the intelligence service had informants then also in the NPD-top
In December 2013 the Federal Council submitted after long preparation a new request into Karlsruhe .
Federal Government and Bundestag did not connect themselves .

It goes thus into the international retirement with a balance from 167 international matches and 576 gates for Germany .
Because the throw-tremendous moving room player wants to go from Flensburg for the champion-League-winner still some years on gate hunt , it is not available now to the new coach of the national team Dagur Sigurdsson anymore .
With the Icelander who announces his cadre on Tuesday for the international matches against Switzerland Glandorf led a `` long and good conversation .
His ideas and approaches inspired me just the same as they will inspire also my long-standing other players and my successors .
But for my club I would like to be available healthily also in the next years , for that longer regeneration pauses which the current double load does not approve are necessary .
The left-hander had had to fear quite his career end in 2012 according to a heel infection .
Because of Achilles tendon problems it had been able to be handled by team doctors of the German handball Federal Government ( DHB ) with a cortisone syringe that later a strong inflammation had activated .
An emergency operation and two more interventions followed .
Then Glandorf had announced a complaint against the team doctor , the quarrel ended with a comparison .
Twelve years Pro- and eleven years of national team career do not go past any body without a trace .
I have some sanitary construction sites which I can not ignore anymore .
After the three infection-conditional foot operations that occurred in 2012 in short distances I have never gotten my blood pressure correctly into the grip .
To that some other wear-conditional complaints come .
Already at the beginning of the year I noticed that I can operate indeed my head , but '' not `` deceive '' my body , declared Glandorf the magazine `` Handball Time '' in the interview .
For a comeback it would be prepared only in the absolute emergency .
`` If all else fails , I am always conversation-ready '' , declared the twofold head of a family to the specialist magazine .
However , I can count the years in which I can still play handball at a hand .
I must also say that I became also quite humble after my long stay in hospital in 2012 , which affects my health .
According to my career I would at least quite just like to be able to go .
Next to the WM title 2007 and the profit of the champions League 2014 it got 2008 ( HSG north horn ) and 2010 ( TBV Lemgo ) the EHF cup .

The NS-regime had arranged in 1937 for the solution of the association .
Only in 1964 19 young men found themselves again , that have lifted on the 30th April in the inn Lukas the `` new '' shooter association `` fir wood '' Bern district from the baptism .
Karl März and Adolf Ried led the association through a difficult original time in which it was a question above all of finding an association restaurant and installing the firing-company as shooter masters

Why `` Guardians of the Galaxy '' did not become a cash box hit
`` The Expendables 3 '' of New Year 's Eve Stallone played less than 30 million dollars of his 90 million dollars of budgets in the USA one , during `` Sin town : A lady to Kill For '' only 12 million dollars of his budget of 70 million dollars played .
The film `` Sex Tape '' tailored to Cameron Diaz brought in at the opening weekend only 14.6 million dollars , during child films as `` Dragon-curbing slightly donely 2 also with the case of the gains disappoint .
An article of the telegraph film critic Robbie Collin points out that at the child films the lack could be the reason at quality at the films themselves .
Collin designated in 2014 as `` the worst year '' up to now for child films and described `` 2 `` Dragon-curbing slightly donely as a Fantasy continuation `` functional '' in that .
At films for an a little older target group it seems however , as if the quality of the films were absolutely not the problem .
In July Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore- and Metacritic evaluation for every summer film start , that between the American Memorial Day and the 20th July 2013 and in the current year on at least 2000 canvases was shown .
The results are based on the opinion of the cinemagoers and film critics and indicate that the this year 's film hits are equivalent significant to those of the last year .
Some commentators think that the development is to put down changing seeing-habits and the wachsende popularity to himself from web-Streaming-services as Netflix .
Director Jon Favreau who currently works onto jungle book film soon appearing to Disneys said reporters opposite the web page Hollywood : `` I believe , the times are changed . ''
We must accept that and not attempt to run after the past .
Unlike the currently weak cash box results of the Hollywood productions Netflix achieved in recent time turnovers with the Streaming contents at the level of 1.2 billion dollars , almost doppelt so viel as in the last year in which the turnover was 837 million dollars .
In the last summer the director Steven game mountain criticized the film studios , that they concentrated too very much on filmings adaptations of comics and a `` nuclear fusion '' Of Hollywood prophesied .
Seen in the light of the present downturn some commentators argue , that his gloomy prophecy can absolutely contain a true core
Due to the potential cash box hits to be expected in the summer 2015 , under that Avengers : Other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic to Age of Ultron , Minions and Jurassic World , however :
The producer of X-Men , Simon Kinberg , described the drop of the cash box results recently as simply `` cyclical '' and reporter said opposite Hollywood : `` The next summer will be the largest summer anyway at the cinema box office , and nobody will make himself for worries anymore around the business

Production in the eurozone on a 13-Monats-Tief
The increase in the production in the eurozone slowed in August to the lowest point in the past 13 months , according to a study that observed with .
The final Markit Einkaufsmanagerindex of manufacturing ( , ) fell in August at 50,7 in , after a stand of 51,8 in in July .
A claim over 50 there is an expansion .
New orders went back and factories have seen information in a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia over the Ukraine .
The figures come ahead of the meeting of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) on Thursday .
The markets expect the Bank to a clear plan for dealing with an ever-doubting of the recovery of the euro area , as well as for the threat of deflation , with an inflation rate of just 0.3 % .
There is speculation that the head of the ECB , Mario Draghi , additional information in the course of this week , if he could make a quantitative easing for the eurozone to take into account , in line with those of the United Kingdom and the United States have been made during the financial crisis .
`` although a small growth is better than no growth , are the bremsenden effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties for the manufacturers have become more pronounced '' , said Rob limbs , senior economist at Markit .
The Fabrik-PMI for Germany , the biggest trading partner of Russia in the EU , fell to the lowest level in 11 months with 51,4 .
In the meantime , fell in the second largest Wirtschaftsnation of the block , France , on the 46,9 .
France remains a child , as well as the decline in Italy of a solid expansion to stagnation .
Evidence that Wachstumsanreize Schlüsselindustriemechanismus in Germany as well as in Spain and the Netherlands no longer hold , are also not very reassuring , `` said Mr limbs .
The decline in the industry probably fuels the fire of the analysts , who expect further monetary or fiskale incentives .
A positive news came from the Republic of Ireland , where , on the 57,3 grew , the highest level since the end of 1999 .
Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight , Chefwirtschaftsexperte , said : `` the best thing for the Einkaufsmanagerindex of its manufacturing in the eurozone in August can say , is that then the sector will continue to grow '' .
He added : `` producers in the eurozone find that life is obviously very difficult , as the current heightened geopolitical tensions - particularly in relation to Russia and the Ukraine - uncertainties in the difficult conditions in many countries continues to increase .
These uncertainties have increased very clearly the economy - in particular , and of the confidence of the consumers , and , probably , is that some of the contracts has been delayed , or even cancelled , in particular contracts .
He said that it is `` increasingly likely '' that the ECB will , after all , a kind of QE should start , `` although we suspect that this will be limited '' .

Matthies says : it 's time for the big Vernetzen
In the light of technical progress , the galloping home in our stylish comfort High-Tech-Schaltzentralen threatens to transform our columnist Bernd Matthies with a very familiar electronic accessories .
As I write this , my view on the Spiralkabel , the audience connects with the phone , and I think : how retro Boah , is that it ?

Already is , of course , to the ekeltronischen ( ekeltronischen ?
No , typo : electronic ) sector is the rule that the novelty of the electronic waste of tomorrow is , bought - out of date .
And who , for example , still in the living room has a CRT , which says only that he rejects that , in principle , on television .
Which is why these considerations ?
Because we do the Ifa Andrängen radio tower , in this week of our absolute incompetence in questions of the electronics show .

`` I thought to myself , I am up all the frustration from Thursday and schnalzte it under the crossbar '' , said the 26-year old smiling .
As a Schrammel on 13 Novmember so far in 2010 , the last time in a Bundesligapartie had taken , it was for Ried .
The first in his Rapid-Dress Meisterschaftstreffer will remain in special memory .
`` for me , that is something quite special , I am from '' , said Schrammel Rapid-Nachwuchs .
Due to the short-term Becken-Blessur of Mario Pavelic ckte Schrammel from the left to the right and also made his Defensivseite thing very well .
He has enough experience to this position , he also is anonymous .
The goal he deserved , he has already done some assists this year , `` praised Barisic .
Team shows character Schrammel also supplied the cross for the 2 : 0 by Hofmann after an hour , that , in the end , the decision .
Because before that could have done with a scifi book guests .
`` thank God that today we have had a bit of luck '' , also noted that , of the Schrammel Auseinanderklaffen of performance and result , in the last few weeks : `` the results have not voted in favour of this , but the playing was always well compared to last year '' .
Even Barisic , that was `` in many games before '' , would have been better than today - against `` the strongest team that this season has played in this stadium '' .
The first Dreipunkter since 26 July , I therefore have proved that , despite the setbacks of the Mannschaftsgefüge intact : `` today , my team has shown that it is character '' .
No less pleasing for him : `` the fact that we finally have played back to zero '' .
A lot of work during the Länderspielpause Also the fact that with Brian Behrendt , Mario Pavelic , Dibon , Deni Alar , Christopher and Michael Schimpelsberger several breakdowns of victims , and Srdjan Grahovac , Stefan Stangl , as well as their Startelfdebüts Philipp Schobesberger Gudalquivir , make the victory even more valuable .
`` we must never forget that '' , warned Barisic , in the last three days with Behrendt and Pavelic players lost in the last time , `` very stable '' .

One , the break may be particularly , he is captain .
They are for the team , going through the pain of it .

It was high time now , `` said Hofmann .
He warned , however , to keep konzentriertem : `` we must not always black and white .
We have in the last few weeks , played not so bad , as it has been portrayed .
However , we must not believe that now , all is well .
The importance of his role for the team , he could not deny .
But it is a very young team , I can help at the moment .
The are in certain phases but to me , `` said Hofmann .
Grödig-Coach Michael Baur had little of himself and his team .
He regretted the `` from the category of Ivica Zaubertor '' , as well as the regular gate of demand in the 40th minute by referee , Kollegger wrongly disenfranchised .
The only criticism I can make of the team is that we are in the direction of Tor in some phases were not specific enough .
Because we have had too little in the way of qualifications .
Cannavaro Maximilian Karner was similar : `` it has been as bad , then we have found , but purely and even a score .

Return to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
The congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have tabled a legislative proposal , the organization of trade unions to establish as a citizen .
`` as trade unions are dying , the Mittelklassejobs also die '' , said Ellison , a Democrat from Minnesota and the deputy chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress .
That 's why I 'm proud to work together with the Bürgerrechtsikone John Lewis the Mitarbeiterermächtigungsgesetz .
This ground-breaking law gives workers the same legal opportunities for discrimination on the grounds of the organization of trade unions , as with other forms of discrimination - and stops so antigewerkschaftlich set forces .
The addition of the national Arbeitsrechtsgesetzes , a way for a discrimination abandoned workers to organize a Gewerkschaftsvertretung to create before a civil court to get justice to complain - and in order to get compensation or Strafgelder - is a useful and necessary initiative .
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards .
In fact , the best way to understanding what Ellison , Lewis and the other sponsors of the bill suggest the connection back to a very American idea .
Despite the setbacks , the trade unions , which have been subjected to in the last few years - in Wisconsin , Michigan and other states across the country - have Americans once countries all over the world , encouraged to recognise and comply with labour rights , expand .
There was a time , of the millions of Americans still remember , when this country democracy , freedom of speech , freedom of the press and the Vereinigungsrecht in one breath .
When the United States after the Second World War , Japan besetzte , encouraged General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff in the country to do so , to adopt a constitution , which should ensure that the militarised autocracy Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy .
In full awareness of the fact that the workers and their trade unions in the creation of a new Japan , took a role , they used a language that explicitly recognized that `` the rights of the workers to unite and joint negotiation and action are guaranteed '' .
When the United States after World War II , Germany , General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff the Germans , to write a constitution , which would ensure that the fascism of Adolf Hitler would be replaced by a strong democracy .
In recognition of the fact that the workers would need to organise themselves , and their voice in the new nation should speak up , added a clause to the Germans , the aussagte explicitly : `` the right to form associations , and to the working and economic conditions will improve , and to secure to each and every individual and every profession or industry .
The agreements , which restrict this right or aimed at it to belittle are null and void ; this is abzielende measures are illegal .
As the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt in the Chair of the International Commission on Human Rights , of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , as it was designed in 1948 by the United Nations as a global agreement , has been taken over by Roosevelt and the other authors of a guarantee that `` everyone has the right to protect its interests , trade unions to form or join them '' .
For generations , Americans accept the Grundprämisse that labour rights are human rights .
When this country , in other countries , such as one civilian and democratic societies , said Americans could form , that the law on the establishment of a trade union - and that this trade union collective bargaining , then as an equal partner with companies and government agencies must take part in - must be protected .
After these rights in America under attack , it is indeed very wise , the American ideal and , consequently , to the working population must have the right to unite and engage in a free and open society in which to speak .
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. fifty years ago said :
The history is a great teacher .
Now we all know that the labour movement is not restricted to the strength of the nation , but they grew .
By raising the living standards of millions of people in work has miraculously created a market for the industry and the whole of the nation to unimaginable levels increased .
Those who attack the work , forget these simple truths , but the history they keep .
The story reminds us , and that is something we should do .
The formal recognition of the labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of citizens ' rights as a protection against discrimination in the creation of employee - is long overdue .
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are renewing the ideals that made America great in the past , and the promise of democracy einlösten .

Putin demands of Kiev the inclusion of `` Staatlichkeitsgesprächen '' with the eastern Ukraine
The Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded , according to Russian media reports on Sunday that the Ukrainian government is fighting against the separatists in the east of the country and immediately with negotiations on the `` statehood '' of the breakaway region .
His spokesman , Dmitry Peskow made clear later that Putin does not have to mean that , under the control of the separatists in the area of eastern Ukraine will be a part of Russia , but that his status in relation to the Ukraine needs to be redefined , to the power of the Russian-speaking region to the representation of his rights and interests .
Putin 's call for the Kiev government to negotiate on equal footing with the pro-russischen fits to the insurgents , but from him since the beginning of the riots five months ago apparently pursued strategy : to provide support for the separatists in the Einnehmen of areas and put pressure on the Ukrainian government , to the newly proclaimed region Novorossija de facto independence for a alliance with Russia rather than with the West .
In an interview with the state-owned TV station Channel One , Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recapture areas held by the separatists in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions , which were taken in March and April , after Moscow , the Ukrainian peninsula annexed Crimea on March 18 .
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently adopted in the area as `` Novorossija '' or `` Yeni Dünya '' , a concept that goes to the heart of the pre-revolutionary to restore the Russian empire .
Putin pointed out that all of those who , in the course of the campaigns of Ukrainian politicians for the elections on 26 Okt . and while Regierungsgruppen civilian communities in the areas held by the separatists attack on an early peace talks hope `` in their illusions '' are caught , told Itar-Tass .
`` we need to immediately begin detailed discussions , not only to technical issues , but also to the political organization of society and the Staatsstatus the Südostukraine , in order to protect the interests of the people who live there '' , he said .
Peskow said that Putin 's reference to the statehood in the context of the greater autonomy , the need to be seen for months by the Kiev leadership is discussed , in Russian-speaking areas in order to allay fears that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk .
Only the Ukrainian government can the necessary autonomy to the eastern regions , said Peskow .
We are not talking about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia , said Peskow , `` because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine , but about an internal conflict in the Ukraine '' .
The clarification of the Kremlsprechers to correct the `` misinterpretation '' of Putin 's remarks underscored the leadership of Russia in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east , in contrast to the direct annexation of the Crimea , the majority of the 2 million residents are ethnic Russians .
Moscow would have far greater difficulties , the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine to annex , since most of the 6.5 million inhabitants , no Russians are , and surveys from the time before the conflict , a large majority for staying in the Ukraine .
The autonomy of the Russian diplomats on international forums has been raised , would the regional governments in the Ukraine , to give authority to negotiate their own trade agreements and foreign relations , and as the Kremlin 's de facto control of a territory , the Russian territory of Crimea .
Five months ago , annexed the peninsula in the Black Sea is the home base for the majority of the Russian navy , as well as an important commercial port and historic coastal region .
The regions between the Rostowgebiet in Russia and the Crimea is also rich in mines , factories and foundries , the important components for the Russian military .
The Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed in his speech to the inauguration on June 7 , before that the Ukrainian legislation , amendments to the constitution after the elections - should consider where the respective areas , with greater control over their finances and the status of the languages .
But his idea of autonomy , which seems to be in the Kremlin and the separatist rebels to stand , their weapons , and Moscow is accused of incitement .
Putin 's last call to Kiev , with the Separatistenführern to negotiate on equal footing , was followed by a further advance of the rebels in the past week , after Russian troops and tanks across the previously peaceful region along the Asowschen sea in the eastern Ukraine are entered .
Supported by Russia , the separatists took over 1519-1563 Sicherheitsbeamter according to the fears of the first step in a campaign to take on the strategic coastal region to the Crimea is , the control of Nowoasowsk .
For this reason , the massive civilian and military preparations are underway to Mariupol , a Stahlindustriehafen with 500,000 inhabitants , to fortify the between Nowoasowsk and the narrow access to the Crimea .
Poroshenko said on Saturday at a meeting of the EU-Führung in Brussels and asked for urgent actions in order to further Russian aggression against Ukraine , a former Soviet republic to prevent , the 23 years of independence .
`` we are on the eve of a point at which there is no turning back '' , warned Poroshenko .
Tens of thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine .
No , the EU summit decided to concrete actions , the leadership , the draft further sanctions against Russia , in an escalation of the Ukrainekrise unspezifizierten should come into force .
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk , after two Russian overpowering and 1,000 soldiers last week in the encroaching Donezkregion , in order to support the besieged separatists , said Colonel Andrij ruling , the spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defence General Reporten on Saturday in Kiev .
The first 63 Ukrainian soldiers , probably by the Russian invasion of Ilowajsk were included , were on Sunday against 10 Russian paratroopers , who replaced a week ago on Farska area had been taken prisoner on Sunday , said of the ruling .

And he had to learn : `` the not always possible '' . if he as only his students or just his own six children says that is not very clear .
In any case , the judge was doing sometimes unconventional .

Amazon buys to envisage for 1.04 billion $ $ $
Amazon has just confirmed , what information was reported on Monday morning : the online - and Videoproduzent , and a multitude of other things - buys the Videostreamingdienst envisage for $ 1.04 billion ( $ 970 million ) .
The announcement is not surprising , because no one had expected to envisage the adoption of , but because it was widely believed that YouTube would acquire the company .
Three months ago , it looked as if the sale of the envisage Videodienst of Google for a cool billion a done deal , and the cooperation , of course .
Twitch , which only three years ago as Justin.tv was founded , as a general Streamingdienst looks-ups - a Live-Version of YouTube .
Instead , it was fast becoming a platform for players who want to play games in their Bravourstücke published , `` a YouTube for live games '' , says one insider .
The Twitch-Schnittstelle .
And `` let 's play '' , in which a Videogenre knowing-better the ( usually older ) playing a Anstrich of Geheimwissenschaftstheater , are already very popular on YouTube .
It is simply the case that YouTube is often called to envisage , if you want to describe it , so was the news that YouTube wanted to buy , to envisage a bit bored , a textbook of an established Technikunternehmens , buying a potential competitors .
It 's a mystery why the deal with YouTube , came as the company , according to reports , was prepared to pay as much as Amazon .
All that we know about this at the moment , this is a statement of Emmet , President of belonging : `` we envisage for Amazon , because they believe in our community , they share our values and long-term vision , and they want to help us to get there faster '' .
Another secret is , to be honest , the incredible success of envisage .
For snobs , like me , who say that they would prefer to play sports as a watch , it is difficult to understand the attraction of the outcome , the other to the games and watch rather than even the Kontrollkonsole in the hand .
It 's one thing , a friend at 3 a.m. to look over his shoulder , while through the Resident Evil is a cure-all , and something quite different , a crank to watch it 20 times in succession in Call of Duty will be shot in the head .
All of these games you could see right now .
Another problem is that many of the most popular games are today , so the Ego-Spiele can look without its own control over the Blickperspektive a really good recipe for headaches .
I admit that the Schnelldurchläufe , in the the Bannisters Elektronikzeitalters Roger our entire games in a record time , entertaining .
But as long as not a play or Humorvirtuose is , is likely to be not so very interesting Twitch-Kanal .
But what know skeptics as I have of it ?
Twitch 's 55 million visitors per month , and is the fourth largest source of Internetverkehrsspitzen .
And exactly how Amazon wants to make money from it ?
It 's hard to imagine that envisage so elegant in Amazon Instant Video software , such as YouTube to envisage simply would have been able to swallow .
But something has to envisage what each company would have liked : thousands of young men , who , as advertisers are being courted .
As the chairman of belonging to envisage , envisage , Amazon said , and both `` believe in the future of gaming '' , and it shows no signs of contraction , not even - sip - as Zuschauersport .

4 tips for better Unterwasserfotos and videos
If you like photos or videos to make under water , there are a range of devices .
The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot position , such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 Action-Cam or a GoPro Hero3 + Silver as the edition , both for about 300 $ .
I have these photos at a family gathering with several cameras , all at a cost of under $ 350 , are available .
Regardless of the equipment , there are a few rules for the best results .
Check your equipment twice .
Even if you have a waterproof camera , make sure that the Batteriefach and other subjects have been closed down .
You can also put your camera on the photos or videos that you want to take .
Some cameras and HD camcorders feature Szenen- and Aufnahmemodi , with which the exposure time for the dämmrigen Unterwasserbedingungen www.o-atlas.de..
And before you jump in , check , in which up to a depth of your equipment is operational .
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet , others up to 50 or 60 .
Are you looking for in our accredited to digital cameras and the ratings for conventional and waterproof models .
Do you make Machines - because many do not work .
Point-and-Shoot-Kameras have a LCD , with which you can compose Action-Cams images , usually do not .
Even if you have an LCD display , it is difficult to see this under water , and the right screen size is a matter of chance .
You make so many shots .
If your camera has a Reihenmodus , with a series of shots with slightly modified exposure settings , please use it .
Will you stay close to the surface .
The light will be dramatically worse , the further you are removed from the surface .
If possible stay so close to the surface , if you are taking pictures in a swimming pool , a lake or the sea .
As a result , you can also get more colour in your photos ; the deeper you go , the less color you will see .
Are you close to the objects .
The country is also a good advice , but it is under water all the more important because of the bad conditions .
It 's particularly important if you work with a Action-Cam : these devices often have a fixed Weitwinkellinse , which means that you have to be thick to your objects to this , if the whole of the Bildrahmen to fill .

Feminists criticise Polizeiverhalten race and after Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was at the beginning of this month by a police officer in Ferguson , Mo . was killed .
The participants raised their hands in the air and sang , `` hands up , do n't shoot '' , while they were waiting for the funeral .
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson , Mo , because of the shooting of Michael Brown , the unarmed Teenagers www.dowwolffcellulosics.com blogger Miriam Zoila Perez , a change in the Onlinediskussionen white feminists .
After their experience white feminist commentators put the sex before the race , when it comes to Reproduktionsrecht and income .
While the tensions in the Midwest and across the country , however , increased attention was given to Perez that the responses of white women to 100 % of the german .
Compared with the responses of black women shortly after the shots came from the 9th of August the personal essays with titles like `` thoughts to Ferguson by a white woman '' and `` feminism is not just about the oppression of women '' relatively late .
But for Perez was an important change .
`` I do not believe that many people in the feminism , which is about the white and privileges and kind of talk about it '' , she said .
The people felt forced to express something about the incidents .
It 's a characteristic feature of the crisis in which we find ourselves and because the situation in Ferguson so ethnisiert is that they need to express .
For Englischprofessorin Koritha Mitchell of Ohio State University , Ferguson brought the problems to light , those black Amerikanerinnen are exposed to every day , but not as a `` women 's issues '' in the cultural space .
`` I can be a bit funny on Facebook about me and my partner and I get 150 likes from everywhere '' , said Mitchell .
If I was a little bit about poste , as people in their own country are under siege , the silence is deafening .
`` how can it be safe for women , to speak publicly about a relationship , but not about safety in the public space ? '' she asked .
For black women , such as Mitchell , the race , gender and sexuality in the history of the United States , there is no dichotomy between Rassen- and Geschlechterproblemen .
For they have not had the luxury of black women , the issues of clean to separate ; they live every day in the combined reality .
While white women are now the issues of race and gender in the feminist Mainstreamkreisen Banquetting , says Angela Hattery , professor of women and at the George Mason University , that their predecessors did the opposite .
`` between 1865 and Waldfeuer at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the justification was almost always the rape of a white woman '' , said Hattery .
White women in history have had to be involved , in order to justify the Lynchmord .
For Hattery came the split between white and black women to the point where white female fighters for the suffrage as Susan B. Anthony , the country in the late years of the 19th century analysed and stated that the fight for the right to vote only for a group could be successful : women or black people .
`` they made the decision to use for suffrage , and the right to vote for black people should come later '' , said Hattery .
If you look at such things , one with power , will be aware of why 5-color women white women do not trust .
We have our job not well done .
We have never helped black women , their husbands and sons to protect .
Even after women were given the right to vote in 1920 , it took a decade until white women against the Lynchen in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching organised .
The group was founded almost 40 years after the original plea for help from black women , says Mitchell .
For Mitchell is the flood of white feminist responses to the questions that have been raised by Ferguson - Polizeiverhalten , racial discrimination - a mirror of the time in which white feminists `` catch '' with the problems with black women , which has been set apart for generations .
`` would n't it be great if the activists , the more than such traditional feminist platforms have the right to education of a child so seriously nähmen as it with the right to Empfängniskontrolle do ? '' asked Mitchell .
Feminists of the second generation , their career on the fight for reproductive rights and their access to contraceptive methods , are now seeking to understand what that means .
The famous white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown on Facebook and published a pointierten article by Rebecca Carroll , Kolumnistin of the Guardian in which they more protests from white Americans on the subject of racism .
`` I hope that women who had a different , but parallel reason have an inherent risk of the body to understand - and opinions on race , in the public opinion polls are clearly very different - the changes to be '' , Steinem wrote .
Even though Steinem for a rather intersektionalen feminism is , as well as in the Rassen- Car-jackings Geschlechterthemen , are some of their comments on race in America but is truly amazing .
Christina summer , researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of `` Who stole Feminism ? '' said to She The People , that young men in the United States , in particular , young men , `` 5-color far are more vulnerable than their sisters '' , but Steinems to Ferguson 's comments are in contrast to its previous criticism .
There are now hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women , but almost nothing for boys .
But as the White House recently a small program , My Brother 's ' auflegte verletzlichen , to young black and Hispanic men , to help it was infuriating reactions of many feminists , including Gloria Steinem .
The relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem that is in the forefront of the Mainstreamfeminismus constraineth .
After the almost 76,000 US-Grenzpolizei CHEEZ-al-PEEN-o unaccompanied minors in the country this year , has taken on the issue of immigration is also returned to the surface - this time as an issue .
Andrea Islacom Co-Vorsitzende of We Belong Together , an organisation which women mobilised for the immigration , said that for a reassessment of the issue as a major issue , it merely needs to publish the stories of Einwandererfrauen .
`` these speak for themselves '' , said Mercado .
If the vast majority of Arbeitsvisa to male immigrants , are the women that accompany it , in a position in which they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation .
`` these stories will find a finish in the women 's organisations '' , she said .

Why `` harvesting challenge awaits of the Galaxy '' was not a box office
`` the Expendables 3 '' of Polite played less than 30 million dollar budget of $ 90 million in the United States , while `` Sin City : a Dame to Kill For '' only $ 12 million of its budget of $ 70 million albums .
Cameron Diaz for the film `` sex tape '' played on the opening only 14.6 million dollars , while the kids movies such as `` Drachenzähmen made easy 2 '' also on the revenue disappoint them .

Collin described 2014 as `` the worst year '' for kids movies and described `` Drachenzähmen made easy 2 '' purely as a `` functional '' Fantasy-Fortsetzung .

China denied the right to Hong Kong , demonstrators Regierungswahl swear revenge
On Sunday , the Chinese Parliament decided , despite the increased calls for democratic reforms against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 election of Hong Kong 's electorate .
This approach probably fueled the protests in Hong Kong , announced during the planning and mobilization to activists in the space of a few hours after the announcement was made in and out of the way .
The decision of the Chinese People 's Congress allows the communist leaders , do not , in principle , all pekingtreuen candidates rejected .
`` It 's not unexpected , but it makes us angry '' , said bastions of Emily Lau , chairman of the Democratic Party .
That is not what Beijing had promised .
It has taken advantage of the inhabitants of Hong Kong .
And it is clear that , with an authoritarian regime , we have to do .
In his defence of China 's decision , said Li Fei Vizegeneralsekretär of the Standing Committee of the National People 's Congress that the authorisation of public nominations in elections for Hong Kong 's government to `` chaotic '' would be .
Since 1997 , when Britain control of Hong Kong to the Chinese , Beijing has promised to the people in 2017 to choose the Regierungsvorsitz .
The Chinese leadership presented the decision from the Sunday as a democratic breakthrough , because it is the citizens of Hong Kong , there is a direct vote , but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership by the end of a closely controlled by Beijing Nominierungskomitee firmly in hand .
After a new clause should also only candidates `` with love for the country and love Hong Kong '' are allowed .
The decision follows a summer in which some of the biggest protests in Hong Kong and publikumswirksamsten took place for many years .
Behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the movement Occupy Central With Love and Peace , whose organizers have threatened the acupuncture , off , if Beijing allows no real universal suffrage .
On Sunday evening , in the space of a few hours after the announcement , hundreds of Occupy-Central-Anhängern in the rain before the Regierungshauptquartier gathered in Hong Kong .
During the demonstration , said the organizers , that their civil disobedience movement to a new level and they have reached the Protestwellen planned in the next few weeks .
They were , however , not to the data , apparently in order to avoid problems with the authorities .
In a Online-Mitteilung diadochs the organizers with the fact that the movement `` the occupation of the Zentralbezirks only as a last resort has taken into consideration , an action which is to be held only when all Dialogchancen have been exhausted and there is no other choice .
We are very sorry to have to say that today , all Dialogchancen options have been exhausted and the occupation of the Zentralbezirks definitely will take place .
The authorities in Hong Kong have since the days of the announcement , and we were prepared for Beijing on Sunday in front of the government buildings increased security measures , including police forces and barricades .
The riots will be provided by the feeling of many in Hong Kong , that she slowly lose control over their city .
The influx of people from the mainland increased the competition for products and services .
In addition , there is a growing fear that the values of Hong Kong as democracy and freedom of speech under the growing pressure from Beijing to begin to crumble .
Some criticised the demonstrations of the Occupy-Central-Bewegung , as they have the operation - the lifeline of Hong Kong - risk .
`` the protests , of which they speak , could be a lot of economic harm , depending on how many are involved and how long they last '' , said Regine bastions of Ip , who criticised the movement for a long time .
We do not want to stoke fears that Hong Kong spiralling out of control .
This impression is bad for investment .
The state-controlled media in China also reported recently on the Demokratieaktivisten in Hong Kong as a subversive agents controlled by Western powers .
This summer , in an unofficial referendum organized by activists to voting , which was attended by 780,000 people - more than a fifth of voters in Hong Kong .
In July , tens of thousands of people in one of the largest Demokratiedemonstrationen in the history of the region .

Lenny Henry : my father never took me in the arm .
Never said `` I love you ''
Henry was one of seven children of a family jamaikanischer immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958 .
His father , who died when Henry was 19 , he worked in a factory and their relationship was limited .
Henry Carioca for a comedy , Rudy 's Rare Records , the partly on an imaginary conversation with his father , and from the series is based on Radio 4 .
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap , with lively tunes .
But Henry has had to work through some difficult Kindheitsmomente .
He visited `` many '' therapies after the death of his mother , and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father .
It was hard to know him .
We never saw his face , only heard his voice : 'with the blowup .
Do n't let your sister in peace and quiet .
Provided you !
I want to look at the cricket .
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who were already grown up , when I was a child - went with him in the pub and talked about things , such as the shape of the Bierglases or the beauty of a Cricketschlags .
I have never had such a conversation with him .
A large part of my life , he was this serious guy in the corner , read the newspaper .
Henry recently opened a foundry in Dudley , and although the conditions are better than in the times of his father , he won but an insight into how life must have been like for him .
It 's a little brighter , but they are dark , smoky , deep stygische Flammenstößen maze with smoke and soot , and much more .
My father used to simply put in the bath and then you could hear him slowly , as he started to sing , because he was able to wash the foundry .
Irish as I was there , I was clear that he had done this for many years , in order to put food on the table , and my respect for him has been greater .
However , Henry as a child who grew up without his parents Liebesbezeugungen .
My father never embraced me , never , he said , `` I love you '' .
It was only when my mother at the end of her life was bad , we started to , `` I love you , I love you , I love you '' to say .
By his own daughter , Billie , with Dawn French , he was able to share the love as a child , he had gone missing .
Could you with the `` I love you '' stop ?
Listen to me , however , to hug ! ! !
Dad , I 'm 22 ! ! !
With Dawn French .
Why should we not be friends ?
She is a great mother .
It is still a French friend , with whom he was married for 25 years .
Dawn is a good man .
Why should we not be friends ?
She is a great mother .
Henrys own mother was diabetic .
This contributed to her death .
So when I was very , very , very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes , my doctor said `` you have to be radical .
So I moved this Fitnessding through and also had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms .
It 's very difficult .
And it is exhausting .
No one eats like carrots .
Henrys Karrierewechsel shows , perhaps , in his elegant , kurzgeschnittenen Bart .
Since he retired from the critics for his Othello was lauded by the theatre , he is captured .
It was followed by The comedy of errors , and then adhesive of August Wilson .
It 's a different experience than the comedies , such as `` the busy working life have to be filled out .
He started with just 16 years ago , when he worked in a factory .
A DJ discovered him on the stage , as he people imitierte and wrote to New Faces on him .
His Fernsehkarriere began in the 1970s . `` I was for a long time the only black impersonator / comedian on television '' .
He learned in the profession .
I had to not only before the eyes of the public , but will also learn from 1975 to 1985 , as I could be an efficient Witze-Erzähl-Maschine through the television , while I was a star , and that was really difficult .
Lenny on New Faces in 1975 .
As his manager the Bühnenrecht at the Black and White minstrel show Ganzenberg , a light entertainment programme , in which the `` black people '' , said Henry anmalten his comedy there about five years on .
My family was very unpleasant .
I wish somehow , it never would have happened , but I regret that I did not have .
It was a weird , unpleasant position for me , but I worked on Riesenprojekten with and learned how to deal with a large audience .
But this `` Wieloletnie award-winning light pillar of the British television '' was also a `` grotesque parody of black people '' .
Through the introduction of the figures , the British black culture both deride as SAMAVAYO Henry in the Eighties , he worked on an alternative Comedykreis .
The first series of the Lenny Henry Show went on show in 1984 , and in the 1990s , he was , among other things , as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the unmentionables , boss ! .
Advertising , documentaries , and TV and film is dominated by the next decade , but after his BBC-Serie LennyHenry.tv 2008 he thought : `` what are you doing next , Len , it is because they are all so feeling , when you have the time , or only around trittst a little on the spot '' .
Then came a documentary for Radio 4 , entitled What 's So Great About ... ?
The first episode was about Shakespeare .
I was virtually allergic to Shakespeare .
I was in the school never really learned something about him and kept him mostly for a preserve of the middle class , White in tights and a Kohlkopf WordReference front .
So I had a great fear .
To all the people we interviewed for the show , Peter Hall , Trevor Nunn , Adrian Lester , Judi Dench said `` you should give it a try .
Make it not bad , if you do not know what you are talking .
Pick a few of the words in your mouth , and you will understand why we are all so love Shakespeare .
Henry led 20 lines from Othellos last speech for the documentary , and he was so excited about it .
I had the feeling that I could do this .
It 's almost as if somebody gave me the head finally set up correctly .
`` that is what it is , it is a serious matter , take them seriously , get your text , a bit chaotic .
The samples were brutal , and I read this piece before we made it for months .
And it was a success .
They seemed to expect a car accident , and that is simply not happening .
And soon he appeared in the comedy of errors .
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre , and I could hardly believe it .
There was a moment when I thought , `` Oh , you 've changed '' . ``
There was a technical mistake and Henry felt instinctively that he needs to talk to the audience .
`` a little voice said to me '' you will have to bridge is now 10 minutes , while the computer reparieren. `` ''
Instead , he announced that the idea of the Bühnenleiter April , as soon as the problem was resolved .
I went from the stage and something in me said , `` Oh , thank God '' .
It 's not my responsibility .
I can leave it to someone else .
`` you 're playing in a play , so stay in your role '' .
Henry in adhesive on the Duchess Theatre
The text for the adhesive to learn was demanding .
Panic is very good , this reinforces the tendons .
Also this was good , so it is like a big sign of the gods , I say `` here is your destiny '' . ``
He says that , of course , with a thundering voice .
So I maintain .
I love the really .
I love it , to be in a Probenraum .
Henry , but still the head of a comedian - our conversation is of humorous outbreaks , while it is always people imitated .
I have decided to not to make Stand-up-Comedy , because I think that this kind of immediate satisfaction of a room full of strangers is somehow dangerous .
If you are looking for , one that swearing in front of a wall .
I am sometimes live at the Apollo on , if I want to have , but , overall , there is not as much as before .
I ask him whether he ever will again make a Stand-up-Comedytour .
The fun of it , I was in a room with a director , the help you have a beginning , a middle , and the end of a journey to form - I do not believe that I would like to give up ever again .
So here is the new incarnation ?
I think it is .
I am quite an actor .
It 's fun .
You can always tell a story , and this is great .
I love stories .
The people love stories .

The boy , who fled through the bullets , of the opinion that his mother is dead
It was his first day of school ( the Russians go with 7 years in the school ) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother , Tamara .
He said : `` as a Siebenjähriger mum has told me that I should I lie down , if there is an explosion , and hold their hand '' .
After an explosion , he thought they would die .
She said to him : `` run '' .
Full of fear , she could be dead , he fled and saw on the way a weinendes toddler , it took in the hand , and fled through a bullets .
His father , Vladimir , outside of his son in the arms , said : `` Damir told me that his mother died .
He said : `` I could not save them '' .
In fact , was Tamara outside stumbled with Beinverletzungen in hospital and , in turn , on the assumption that her son was killed .
After its reunification , she said : `` I wept with joy .
I could n't believe it .
He hurried in and embraced me .
Damir was later flown to London ( by the now dissolved newspaper the News of the World ) , from the then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie , the title of from 's Children 's Champion .
`` this horror being persecuted you each day , every day , but I wish that I could be with the '' stop , `` he said yesterday .
But I can say that in my mind will be fainter .
I know that I am right then all my pistols wegwarf .
But now I can play computer games with Schussszenen and this is not a problem for me .
`` I have no fear of it , in the gym , but I do not think about myself .
I remember these children , with whom I have played in the yard , and it is not out in the end .
We never say that they were killed or are dead .
We say that they are in the gym .
I remember very well my trip to London , especially on the Spielwarenladen everything , where I could choose what I wanted , and the ride in an open top car .
But now he has to place such as the Ukraine , where wars cause the kind of accident , which he and his friends .
This followed a horror you each day , every day , but I wish I could stop , to remind me .
`` I 'm so sorry to all those who suffer under the abominations '' , said Damir , who last week was working as a volunteer in a monastery .
I would so like to help .
One day I want to go to the police and hope that it will be me next year at the Schulungsakademie .
His mother , Tamara , 48 , said : `` 37 children in our neighborhood have been killed , you can see all of this ?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege , there was simply no children , and were able to call around , and this silence lasted for many months .
She remembers vividly her trip to London with Damir .
The people in London , wept when I told our story .
I understood at that time , as people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings , and show their support .
It was Cherie Blair and her foundation , grateful for the price , and the possibility , in the autumn of 2004 , travel to London .
I wish I could call her even Cherie and simply say that 10 years have passed , but I am still at the meeting me her and her husband in London , and how the Damir and helped me .
I still remember how Damir tortuosum borshch wanting to eat and they all local Russian restaurants anriefen .
I remember , as he played in a beautiful restaurant . Damir shot with his pistol at them and they ran away and played with him .
And that was just a month after the horror .
I was surprised that the British so willingly shared our pain and supported us .
She said : `` I always think that this world in these 10 years have not got better .
The war in the Ukraine is now , and people are dying every day , and I believe that many of the children were killed and are being killed .
These are the kind of children as well as our own .
I think that for many of the war a part of the news is that they listen to , if they get bored or busy with something else .
I know just what these people feel , all the horror .
And I ca n't stop , to feel that .
Nothing has changed , the people still want to kill each other and that is so sad .
Damir was great and is a very gentle and quiet boy , he is not at all aggressive or angry .
He is looking for , for example , not for revenge , he is not overwhelmed by the last abominations .
I know that he does not like to remember , but he has six close friends from the class and they go occasionally , in the sports hall and ignite candleligh there .
When he was small , he was among them - I remember , as he sometimes put on the sofa , the face of us away for hours .
Not asleep , his eyes were open .
I remember , as he has all of his weapons and other Militärspielzeuge Kalpavriksha Bergquartett . Damir is now 17 , more than I , handsome , intelligent and healthy .
I can hardly believe that , in a few hours , so I was sure that he was dead and I would never see him again .
As I am after the explosion , and on the legs , I looked around , and saw the hell around me , with herumliegenden body parts everywhere .
I was absolutely sure that my little boy in this hell impossible could have survived .
`` I remember that I shouted at him '' , Damir , lauf , lauf away `` , but I was also so I am not sure that he had heard .
But he has heard it and he ran away .
And this is the life , unlike that of many others , for us .

The boy , whose terrible picture after the siege of the symbol of the horrors of Beslan was
Comfort : the Beslan-Überlebende Georgy Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege in 2004 , right , a picture of Georgy today
His blutüberströmtes face was of fear , when he ran for his life , while his classmates niederschossen Chechen terrorists .
His image was one of the most shocking symbols for the barbarism of Beslan .
His mother , Fatima , 54 , a doctor , had sacked him for his first day of school , before they rushed to their older son Vladimir to get to university .
`` I left the court for about two minutes , before the terrorists stormed it , and so did my little boy for three terrible days alone '' , she remembers .
Not quite alone , there was a whole family of relatives from us , but they have all been killed .
Only my Georgy managed to survive .
The closer this date , the more difficult it is to think and talk about it .
There is not a single day that goes by when we do not remember this tragedy .
We do not think that it is a long time ago , I believe that it would happen yesterday , some scenes from these days I am addicted to follow .
No one will ever forget that , I promise you .
To : the image of Georgy ( left ) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as a statue ( right ) .
I remember that Georgy on this day , so you want to go to school , and he said he wanted to hug his teachers .
I knew only that he was alive when I saw him on TV .
And now there is even this statue of the weeping Georgy in San Marino .
Georgy sees the image will not be happy , and it is with us at home , hidden in the guide .
I understand that , but I also think that the people all over the world thanks to this picture , feel our pain .
Georgy said today : `` it 's important that something like this can never happen again .
`` I doubt that we will ever know the truth .
The people who investigate such tragedies , again and again and never learn the truth .
And now they investigate the crash of Boeing in Ukraine .
Will we ever know what has caused it ?
This world is becoming something of .
`` I can not understand how this is possible , because if you ask the people , nobody wants a war , so how is this happening ?
Ten years is nothing in such pain .
We need dozens of years to make it a little bit to forget .
It has attacked my health and I feel it still .
About three or four years I had a few nightmares because of the siege , but then it was better .
I went later in the year 2004 , and back to school every day .
I thought of my friends and classmates who were slain .
Therefore I go always in the gym , when the September 1 is approaching .
I want to pay tribute to my my old Kindheitsfreunden .
It is difficult for me to go , in the gym , but I have to do it .
I feel I am not as victims , this story is now a part of my past .
I will not forget it , but I am not sorry .
My life goes on .
I have this year and visit the school completed a medical college in Vladikavkaz .
I will be Herzchirurg .
My first choice was an education in the army .
I wanted to be a soldier , but my health is not allowed .
I wanted to fight for my country , but that will not happen .
Georgy Fanijew , 20
The boy , who survived , although he was a murderous terrorists caught wellfitted
A miracle : Georgy Fanijew was during the siege at the feet of a murderous terrorist , but he managed to survive .
During the siege , he was caught in the sports hall , sitting next to the bomb , which was attached to the foot of a murderous terrorists .
It really is a wonder that he was not killed .
`` we feel , as if it were yesterday , it would have been '' , says Georgy , who , as the FSB Geheimdienstoffizier wanted to go to , but this is because of his health damage due to the siege could not do .
It is still with me , it is not something that I have behind me .
I am now older and people say that children can cope easily with terrible experience - and I have to say , that is not true .
`` in 2006 I worked with psychologists and felt a bit better after that , actually , but I can not forget .
And I would like to forget .
In 2005 - the year after that - was the first and only time that I was back in the gym .
I lost consciousness .
I will never return , and please do not ask me to show you where I have sat in this famous image .
Survivor : Georgy Fanijew today , with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is enormous , and I wear it every day with me .
My friends know that I do not like to think or talk about it and they never asked me after school .
Physically , it is good for me .
I should be careful with my injured knees , but I can now well under way .
But because of my health , I could not participate in the Geheimdienstakademie of the FSB in St Petersburg , as I wanted to .
I have my documents , as well as the medical and they have said that it is not possible .
My second passion were the animals , so I went to the veterinary institute .
I have been there two years behind me .
He is learning the treatment of all animals `` from cats to cows '' .
He said : `` I knew that my children would never tell from my experience .
Children should know anything about it , of course , and they should not suffer .
His mother , Marina , 42 , said : `` the pain never leaves me .
He is in my soul , worse , when the anniversary is approaching .
I shall go to the commemoration ceremonies .
I know that Georgy not to go .
It must be for him to be much more violent , because he was there and I do not .
I was waiting for him at home and could not help .
God I am so grateful that it was returned to me in Beslan . here are all of them .
It is in us .
Georgy is now an adult , but this horror is still in him .
It is hard to accept that , if a Unfaires something so bad .
He is a boy , he loves sport , but he could not attend because of his knee .
He was operated on several times , he can run , but not a sport .
I would say that he has overcome a horror to 50 % , but it can be overcome and never forget .
This terrible experience will always follow us .
Many friends and neighbors have been killed in the siege , and the only reinforced my pain .
I have lost many people , who I knew well and I were too expensive .
My son is with me , and that is the greatest gift that God could make me , but my heart cries for the killed .
I know of families where children were born , but also of widows , who have never married again .
It is difficult to accept that life goes on , even if one does not want this .
I will never forget how , in me , my heart jumped when I saw him in the hospital .
And now , I do not see what is going on in the world - wars in other regions .
What are these people ?
Why do they kill each other ?
The war is now very close to our country , and I can almost do not believe .
We used to be a friendly country , how can it be that we are fighting ?
People and children are suffering , I am sure that , in Ukraine , many children have been killed and many more will be killed .
If we just throw all these rebels and could - so far away as only possible .

Not only were the gladiators in the mud at the first Rheinbacher knöcheltief Römertag in the park .
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract well over 1000 visitors yesterday , braving the cold showers and the autumn and the enthusiasm from the historical spectacle .
There was a colourful , of representations , Maffioli Ausstellungsstücken , games , and information about the time of the Romans and their importance for the Rhineland .
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martialische Kämpfertruppe Gladiatorenschule `` Amor Mortis '' , which each Regenpause used to , in the soft sand with their robust Kampfeskunst Sylt-Arena prepared to demonstrate .
Gladiatorenbesitzer `` Leonidas '' turned out to be humorous and Qualified bass ) and sent his men in the ring for the hero-ancestors duel in various Gladiatorengattungen .

It was followed by the `` Essedarii '' with the breastplate , as well as iron and Wurflanze Gladiatorenhelm , skeletal and Armguard .
Particularly impressive was the appearance of the `` RETIARIUS '' , with Wurfnetz Cecrops , and it took the `` SECUTOR '' and after a short struggle the boys came to the ground .
As the metallic krachten swords , shields , between each other and the Wurflanzen surrend flew through the arena , and a fear that the vibrations could be the health of the gladiators .
But on the had of the imposing `` Rudi '' Summa , the muscular referee , an always attentive eye .
`` we wanted to revive the Roman daily life and the culture of life in Roman times '' , explained Lorenz , P & G , chairman of the `` circle of friends '' WordML Römerkanal , the intention behind the spectacle .
After two years of preparation time was out of the park for a day a `` Roman '' Skály , a Roman city , such as Vizebürgermeister Claus Wehage stated in his will .
Finally , the Romans have not only war and conquest in our region , but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings , which we still see today .
The remains of which were also in the shop , for example , `` Römertag Aquädukt-Marmor '' of the 11 metres high and 1400 metres long , the escapades in Römerkanal-Brücke Lüftelberg .
The Frontinus-Gesellschaft , the water and power supply , the once and now , and Managing Director in 1987 Lesviots knew : `` today , we are still benefits from the knowledge from that time '' .
This was confirmed by Diplom-Vermessungsingenieur Ralph saint from the `` IngenieurteamZwei '' from the Vermessungsinstrumente Rheinbach , like the Romans , or Dioptra Chorobat Groma unit-tetrahedrons .
The Römervilla in Blankenheim presented sketches and models of the excavations in the 1894 and bricks from the Original-Hypokauste , the Warmluftheizung , once the Römervilla mixture .
Impressive , too , the footprints of the wolf and fox two millennia in the footsteps , had been left out of clay before they were burned .
In 2011 , the Office for the Youth Hostel Association Bodendenkmalpflege Westfalen- the remains of a Roman villa in the Industrial North in Rheinbach .
I had one with a Umfassungsmauern Wirtschaftsgebäudes Darre to the drying of grain and the Mälzen found .
The building is likely to have a villa , an agricultural commodity , is one of the prime , explained Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser .
A number of these Fundstücken KARABURUN placed it in a Glasvitrine before , including a large plate , several fine bowls , as well as parts of a delicate necklace .
The Villa did well from the first to the fourth century after Christ existed , until the invasion of the Germanic , suspected in the then Roman Westfalen- Morscheiser .
With her , the children were also with the Roman Windmühlenspiel , similar to the current Mühlespiel , or they like the Roman students once their name with Metallgriffeln on wax tablets .
At the booth of Römerthermen Zülpich mosaics were the children themselves , at the booth of the Glasmuseums Rheinbach Glasmosaiken tinker and on the state of the Eifel Naturzentrums Nettersheim Weizenmühle a heavy stone , to the flour for a flat bread or cereals to grind .

An exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobsons hochgelobtem new novel about love and the letter `` J '' .
You , so you could zerflossen best describe it , it 's like a cardboard-I , slowly on the one in the rain has let stand .
Occasionally , he said , a woman he is said to be too serious , intense , exhausting , and maybe something from kratzbürstig .
And then shook him by the hand .
Kratzbürstig knew it .
He was , as in hedgehog stachelig , yes .
The last victim of this Stacheligkeit was just starting an affair , the more promising for a lessening of the lonely , bored of his life than would otherwise have been , and maybe even a certain satisfaction .
Ailinn acquisition was a trembling zarte beauty with flapping of hair and a heart from a village on the North Island , which was even more isolated and rougher than Port Reuben .
It was with an older companion to the south , the Kevern for her aunt , and a plot of land in a damp but heavenly valley , appropriately called the Paradise Valley had inherited .
Over the course of several years , no one had lived in the house .
The pipes were leck , in the bathrooms , there were spiders , harvested my potatoes had left their mark on all windows and thought that they belong to all of this , and the garden was overgrown with weeds , such as huge Kohlköpfe looked .
It was like the house from a Kindermärchen , threatening both how tempting , a garden full of secrets .
Portrait of the author : Howard Jacobson , whose novel `` J '' on the Longlist for the Valesova booker prize 2014 .
The shorltist will be announced in the coming week .
Kevern and Ailinn händchenhaltend had broken on the sun loungers sat in the high grass and an unusually warm Frühlingsnachmittag . both had enjoyed the Dienstkonsole eingeklinkt geistesabwesend in the country , with soothing music and soothing news , than the sight of their brown legs crossed to him , an old song of a long forgotten black entertainer , was reminded of his father during the closed shutters in the home had .
Your feet are too big .
On the basis of their neat songs of this kind of aggression were not played more on the console .
Not banned - nothing was so right - simply not played .
It has been successful , as the word obsolesziert obsoleszieren .
The general flavour of what rules , edicts and never have done , and how the people in the books , and the erstwhile Vom-Tellerwäscher-zum-Millionär-Memoiren Liebesromane , so they choose the music the Balllades .
In the euphoria of the day began to play an imaginary piano Kevern and in a grob-komischen serenade Ailinns big feet to sing .
Ailinn is not understood .
`` this was a well known song of a Jazzpianisten Waller called anyplace '' , he told her , and put two fingers to his lips automatically .
That his father had always done to the letter J to stop , before he came out of his mouth .
It was a game between him and his father started , when he was still small .
His father had played it with his own father , as he was told .
If you have a word with a J , start without two fingers on your lips , it costs you a penny .
It was not a very fun game , and it was also not very funny .
He knew that this was expected of him , that was all .
It had to explain what jazz was .
Ailinn Antunovits had never heard .
Jazz was , even if he was not directly prohibited , not played .
The Improvisieren was not more modern .
There was only room for one `` if '' in life .
The people at the start of a melody to be quite sure , where it would end .
As well as the mind .
His unpredictability made people nervous .
And jazz was afrikanischer ausgedrückter mind .
Even though he was 10 years old , without of Sammy Davis Junior heard of Kevern , knew something about jazz of the half the secret collection of old CDs of his father .
But at least he had to explain that not anyplace Ailinn , Waller was black .
At their age , they probably could not remember a time , in the Popsänger were not black .
Again , no laws or constraints .
A guessed society meant that every element of this society based on the principle of the grateful Gruppenbegabung agreed - grateful as the fate spared .
People with afro-karibischer origin were by temperament and physique for entertainment and sport , so she sang and ran .
People who originally came from the Indian subcontinent , as well as by the nature of electronic means were blessed with talent and with the task , to ensure that no family without functioning Diensttelefon remained .
What was left of the Polish community , took care of the sewers ; what was left of the Greeks , zerschlug on-teller .
Those from the Gulf and the Levant , whose grandparents had not left the country quickly as Mahler GESCHEHEN WHAT IT TAKES GESCHEHEN geschah- Mahler , for fear of being accused of Feuerschürens , out of fear that the flames , and even they would be next as конкурсов Labneh- and Shisha-Pfeifen-Restaurants - had opened , and were given with the inaction depressed .
Each according to his abilities .
Because they had heard only Balllades Ailinn , it was difficult to understand how the offensive words , you just had the Kevern vorgesungen , could be set .
Music was an expression of love .
`` they are not really insulting '' , said Kevern .
Except perhaps for people whose feet are too great .
My father has never offended anyone , but he loved this song .
He talked too much , but the neglected garden gave him the false sense of security .
The acoustic insulation could not overcome the huge kohlartigen leaves .
Ailinn is still not understood .
Why would something like this should be your father love ?
He wanted to say that it was a Jux , hesitated , however , in their present two finger to the lips .
You already thought that he was a bit odd .
`` it seemed to him '' , he said , laughing .
She shook her head in disbelief and versperrte Keverns point of view .
There have been all over the world , nothing else to see , as their ungekämmtes rabenschwarzes hair .
There was nothing , what he would want to see .
`` if you can say '' , my it without conviction .
But this still does not explain why you want it to be me vorsingst .
You seemed to be worried , to be honest .
My feet are too big ?
He saw once again .
Your feet so directly .
Perhaps your ankles , a little bit ...
And you say , you hate me , because my ankles are too fat ?
You hate ?
Of course , I do not hate you .
That is , after all , only the stupid song .
He would have been able to say `` I love you '' , but it was still too early .
`` your thick ankles are exactly the reason why you give me gefällst '' , he tried it instead .
I am a bit perverse .
It is not correct .
It was supposed to be funny .
If he was trying to be funny , he was often in trouble , because he , like his father did not have the soothing charm , needed to overcome the inherent cruelty you have to ride .
Perhaps his father wanted to be cruel .
Perhaps he wanted to be , Kevern , .
In spite of its kind eyes .
Ailinn acquisition was red and arose from their deck chair , threw to the console and buried the wine that they had drunk .
Holunderblütenwein was drunkenness , so no excuse for him .
In their excitement , it seemed to tremble , as Palmwedel in the storm .
`` and your Dickkopf is exactly the reason why I am attracted to you feel perverted '' , she said .
Except that I am not .
You did him sorry , both because of the unnecessary for his words as well as the fear , which , in their eyes , as they showed against him auflehnte .
She thought that he would beat them ?
She had had him from life on the cold northern archipelago , where they grew up , but he had no doubt that it is , in essence , that was as here .
The same huge and eiskalte Ocean broke here , as there , on the shore .
The same confused men , with even the skin and body height verdrießlicher after THE WHAT GESCHEHEN Mahler than their ancestors as smugglers and wreckers , had been moved from pub to pub , always ready to shake the hand of a woman to speak out against them or verlachte refused .
Dickkopf ?
They should have shown a big fist , if they are not nice !
You only knutschen - Knutschen was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women , to the vacuous Gegengift Liebesballaden from the console - they only knutschen and then beat .
After Keverns view was the result of an unnecessary , since the aging Knutschen itself was an act of violence .
Ailinn acquisition gave him through her body , a sign to go .
He arose from the sun like an old man .
They also felt the brunt of his , but bleiern Caravan-raiding surprised them .
That was not the end of the world .
They barely knew each other .
She saw him , as he is distant - as in the upper floor of a room in their companion - a man was watching him , complaining through something that he himself had been summoned .
Adam from the Garden , they thought .
You felt a sudden pain for him and men in general , even though some of them had their hands raised .
A man turned away from her , bowed to his back , defeated , ashamed , without fighting spirit - and why was that a sight , they seemed to know well , if they are not at a single time , in which they could remember something like this before the day had already seen ?
When she was alone again , looked Ailinn acquisition on her feet .
Several years ago , had just told the trekmovie.com Esme Nussbaum , an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-jährige researcher on behalf of Ofnow , the non-legislative Überwachungsorgan for the public mood , on a short lecture about the continued violence on low and intermediate level in the same areas , in which the reduction , if not abolish , are most likely to have been expected , given the money and energy that the elimination of this violence had been invested .
`` a great deal has already been done , and a lot still needs to be done '' , she wrote , `` to the innate aggressiveness of a people to appease the thousands of wars , and most of them won , especially in the remote corners of the country , and in which the sweet breath of human kindness from a historical point of view , despite the Hogmanay Kirchtürme rarely feels between the hedges .
But some properties are as unausrottbar .
The higher the tower , it seems , the lower the passion that he still wakes up .
The people crying , when listening to sentimental Balllades shock stories about brings difficulties and claims , on the virtues of marriage and family life , but yet not only the former harshness , the rural communities as well as our urban fabric firmly in hand , but there is also evidence for the emergence of a new and devious Streitsucht at home , at work , on the roads and even on the green spaces .
`` you have an unfortunate tendency to exaggeration '' , said her mentor , as he had read the whole report .
I suggest that you read less pusztítás .
ESME Nussbaum lowered her head .
I must also ask : are you an atheist ?
`` I believe that I must not say '' , said Esme Nussbaum .
Are you her ?
Esme , again , on your right to privacy and the denial of the statement .
Feministin ?
Again silence .
`` I do not support this '' , said Luther Rabinowitz , finally , `` because I am against atheism , Lesbentum or feminism would be .
This is a vorurteilsfreier workplace .
We serve a vorurteilsfreien society .
But certain types of Hypersensibilität , which in itself is absolutely acceptable and lawful , can occasionally results , as you have presented , they distort .
You obviously have a prejudice against the church , and these things that you as a `` deceitful '' and `` raw '' described by others , could just as well of course as an expression of strength and vitality will be interpreted .
If we continue on the herumreitet , WHAT IT TAKES GESCHEHEN GESCHEHEN IS , IS , as if it would have happened , if it happened yesterday , means that the country would be essential to take his life .
ESME Nussbaum looked around , while Rabinowitz said .
Behind his head in a LED-Schriftzug wiederholte Flamingorosa Ofnow , the advice of the the country in the last quarter century or more had given .
Smile your neighbor , you value their partner , do you hear Balllades , visit musicals , use your phone , you are talking about , do you , listen to you , and I apologise .
Talk is better than silence , philosopher-clergyman word is better than the written , but nothing is better than love .
`` I completely understand what you want to , and beyond '' , said Esme walnut with a calm voice , as she was sure that her boss had spoken to the end , `` and I say nothing other than that , we are still not as effective as we are healed , even ourselves .
My concern is that we may find themselves without warning us here , as we repeat the mistakes in the first place , to DEM WHAT IT TAKES IS GESCHEHEN GESCHEHEN IS mannschaftbewerb .
This time , there are but not the other , in which we take our anger and our suspicion .
Luther Rabinowitz , a pyramid with the hands .
To suggest a Engelsgeduld .
`` you go too far '' , he said , `` if it acts as a '' mistake `` , our grandparents may or may not have committed .
You also go too far , if you speak about the fact that their `` anger '' and `` suspicion '' to `` other '' had been omitted .
It should not be necessary , someone in your position to remind you that we in the understanding of the past , such as the protection of the present , not of `` us '' and `` other '' .
There was no `` we '' and there were no `` other '' .
It was a time of the disorder , that is all we know .
`` if we are honest with ourselves '' , Esme einzuwerfen dared , `` not a part of the society can claim to have to behave well .
I klage anyone .
If it was bad or good has been done , what is done is done .
It was at that time .
To do this , nothing more to be said - and here we are unanimous on this .
And just as no blame must be assigned , so there must also be no debt will be repaid , if such a Board would be appropriate and if there is a way , they would have to pay off .
But what is the past , if we do not learn from this -
The past is one that we have forgotten them .
If I have anything to say about that -
Luther Rabinowitz had his piramīdas publication .
`` I will remember , their report '' , he said , and dismissed them .
The next day , when she went to work as usual , she was run over by a motorcyclist , who described how passers-by , in a kind of `` murderous rage '' on the footpath .
There are coincidences .

Judge temporarily halts law that all Abtreibungskliniken in Louisiana could force them to close down
A suit , stopped on Sunday for the time being , the implementation of a law in Louisiana , the lawyers say , that it might have to close all five Abtreibungskliniken would have led the state .
By this measure , the governor of Louisiana , Bobby Jindal , in June for the law was made on 1 Sept. and due to enter into force , the doctors who carry out abortions would force a Patientenaufnahmerecht , in a hospital within a radius of 30 miles of their practice .
The decision of the judge , however , means that , for the time being , the doctors can continue to carry out legal abortions , while they apply for such a right .
`` the plaintiffs can continue working on law , while they try to obtain these rights '' , wrote John deGravelles curbs in its judgment .
Within a month , a hearing will be scheduled for the judges , for the law to bring about a dauerhaftere decision .
Abtreibungsbefürworter welcomed the decision , the latest in a series of rulings against similar measures and said that doctors more time to obtain gewännen Krankenhauseinweisungsrechte .
`` today 's decision means that the women in Louisiana a dastardly escape the law , their health and their rights , they want to take '' , said Nancy Northup , president and chairman of the Center for reproductive rights , in the name of three of the five clinics in the state had complained , in order to stop the law .
It was not immediately clear whether the verdict from the doctors at the two hospitals to the complaint Kushitic not connected and also Einweisungsrechte had asked for .
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have enacted similar laws , and courts recently such measures in the state of Alabama and Mississippi for drivers have said .
Schlüsselstellen a law in Texas , the most of the remaining clinics in the state have been forced to close , were stopped by a curbs on Friday .
Abtreibungsbefürworter and the American College of Gynecologists Ostretricians and as well as the American Medical Association , agreed , saying that Einweisungsrechte of doctors unnecessary restrictions .
Pro-life campaigners counter that the measures under the protection of the health of the women who serve as well , although some of the impact of a closure of clinics welcomed .
Only a doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana , has Patienteineinweiserechte , told the Center for reproductive rights .
If all the other doctors in the state be forced to perform abortions , not more , would this doctor for fear of his safety , not more , to carry out the operation , said the group .
In its argument against the verdict , said representatives of the State of Louisiana , that they do n't have doctors because of the implementation of abortions would punish , while their applications were still pending on Patienteneinweiserechte .

After weeks of tug of war , and of Italy 's prime minister , Matteo Renzi , EU-Vorsitzender against strong conservative resistance on the EU-Sondergipfel last week , the nomination of his Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini as head of EU foreign policy , it will be the successor to the British , Catherine Ashton .
Renzi , as the pro-government daily newspaper La Repubblica , in the appeal of his current favorite Regierungsteam as Mogherini as a strengthening of the position of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU .
He also expected a boost for his `` reform package '' in Italy .
Last but not least , in the hope that Renzi , the left always against him aufbegehrende Parteibasis calm , Mogherini is this - even if more moderate way .
To the conservative representatives with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and the President of the Council nominated as Poland , Donald Tusk , the prevailing view in Rome , so that a political balance .
Because the EU will be the Chefdiplomatin plagiarism while at the same time , the President of the Commission , Juncker .
The outstanding support of the European Parliament is regarded as safe .
President Giorgio Napolitano would have the nomination of the 41jährigen politician of the ruling Democratic Party ( PD ) , hardly an `` important recognition '' of Italy 's role in the EU .
La Repubblica , the widespread optimism that has been in power for almost two decades in leading Parteiämtern tried and tested for their ambition , Mogherini `` the enormous challenges '' will show up .
The native of Römerin is married and has two daughters .
Their Parteikarriere began his PhD in 1996 in the 1950s of the youth organisation of the Democratici di Sinistra ( Linksdemokraten ) , the 2008 with the Catholic centrist party Margherita to today 's social democratic PD zusammenschloß .
In 1999 , Mogherini for three years , Vice-President of the European community organization of Socialist Youth ( European Jungsozialisten ) .
With the election in 2001 of the Parteirat Linksdemokraten increased it in the high politics , worked in the department of foreign affairs , whose head was it soon .
You besetzte traditional Italian foreign policy priorities , such as the Middle East , has been through studies of the NATO in Afghanistan , with a contingent of troops involved in the Italy is known , used the contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and to the Democrats in the US .
Since 2008 , it is a member of the Chamber of Deputies , in it for defence and adopt-a-stone European and international affairs .
As Renzi in February 2014 he became Prime Minister , Mogherini to his Secretary of State .
If the PD again today for a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country , which has more than 40 % of the votes of the party in the European elections in May , then , as I have noted in PD-Kreisen , Federica Mogherini a share .
The Vorhaltungen in Brussels , the new EU-Außenbeauftragte have too little diplomatic experience , it is so lacking in substance , will be in the PD gekontert .
In Brussels , especially from Poland and the Baltic members , a realistic Mogherinis accents to the crisis in the Ukraine and as a `` rußlandfreundlicher course '' .
Are you in favour of the Russian company Gazprom on the South Stream pipeline , the Russian natural gas , bypassing Ukraine , is to be transported directly to southern Europe , which is also the Energiesicherung in Italy .
After his term in July , Renzi took office as EU-Vorsitzender Aktives Mogherini , to their first state visit to Moscow .
The photos showing them with Putin at the Shake-hands in Brussels , were received with outrage , that they , as well as the Kreml-Chef for October to a Milan Summit .

Tax burden of business people in the area of Washington is increasing along with the economic recovery
A recovery in the economy means more customers , more sales and new jobs .
It also means higher taxes .
State and local Steuerbescheide for companies in the country in the last year , rose slightly , while the economic recovery is accelerating , according to a new study published in the past week , and the companies in the area of Washington , were no exception .
Companies in the area of the District , Maryland and Virginia together paid $ 27,6 billion to state and local authorities in the fiscal year 2013 , an increase of 3.8 % compared to the revenues of 2012 in the amount of $ 26.6 billion .
The state and local tax burden of the companies in the last year , rose 4.3 per cent to $ 671 billion , compared to 3.9 per cent in the year before , and it was the third consecutive growth after several years of decline expected in 2009 and 2010 .
State taxes have increased more than the local taxes , 4.3 percent , according to the study , conducted by Ernst & Young , the Maintenance with the Center for State taxation , a Steuerpolitikgruppe was carried out .
More than half of the tax revenue of the District , 56 percent , comes from corporate taxes , while 36 per cent of the revenues come from businesses Marylands .
Virginia scored with 28 % the lowest tax revenues from companies .
A large part of the increase in tax revenues is in a recovery in the company 's investment , say the researchers , leading to an increase in the Immobiliensteuern to 3.7 percent this year , according to the three consecutive years , with growth rates of less than 1 per cent .
While a large proportion of these profits from big states such as California , New York and Texas , the process seems to be also true for the Washington area .
Businesses in the District , Maryland and Virginia together paid more than $ 10 billion in state and local Immobiliensteuern last year , compared to $ 9.6 billion in 2012 - a rise in the course of a year to 4.2 per cent .
But the apparent recovery in the Immobilienwerten in Maryland is not as effective in the increase of state and local tax revenue , because here the Immobiliensteuern to barely more than a fifth of the Steuerbescheide of companies .
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of Immobiliensteuern .
`` in Maryland , the following is happening : a large part of the real estate , especially in the Steuergebiet to D.C. , is either owned by the government , or by non-profit organizations that do not pay Immobiliensteuern '' , said Douglas Lindholm , director of the Center on the State Taxation .
Maryland is therefore forced to , for example , is much more on the personal income taxes to leave , in order to be able to offer the same services , the other states offer .
The recent recovery in tax revenues by companies can not alone be the recovery of the property market
Unternehmenseinnahmen also seem to recover , so the data .
Businesses in the region have reported income of about $ 2.3 billion in Staatsorganisationen compared to 2.1 billion in 2012 .
Maryland took a $ 1 billion in Unternehmenseinkommenssteuern , the highest amount in the region .
While the trend in the same direction , increases the local tax burden for companies not evenly to all three places .
The pace of the District was 4.3 per cent , with the national average , while the rise in Maryland was significantly higher , 4.9 percent .
Only Virginia reported a unterdurchschnittliches 武三思 of 4.1 percent .
Virginia has 6 percent in all three of the least Amtsbereichen autonoumus Unternehmenseinkommenssteuern ( in all three there are fixed income-tax ) .
The Unternehmenssteuersatz is 8.25 percent in Maryland and the District at relatively high 9,975 percent .
A similar study of the US-Handelskammer at the beginning of this year showed that in Virginia , and state and local taxes are required and there is generally a better Steuerklima than in Maryland .
In the study , the District was not investigated .
Despite the advantages of Virginia is under pressure by its southern neighbours .
North Carolina has to reduce its income-tax laws this year from 6.9 % to 6 % , the same rate as Virginia , and the sentence will be launched next year to 5 percent decline .
If the state continues to be his Einkommensziele in the coming year , this law could be achieved the Unternehmenseinkommenssteuersatz until 2017 the state up to 3 per cent .
In the meantime , it seems that it is the small businesses in the Washington area , better to go , and they therefore pay more state and local taxes , according to the most recent study .
Corporate taxes , personal income taxes as paid by small business people - a Übergangsstruktur , after most of the small businesses are organized - in the District , Maryland and Virginia in the last year , rose 20 percent to $ 2.4 billion , a faster growth rate than the corporate taxes as a whole .
The researchers say that the trend and the rise in corporate taxes in the whole country are likely to continue this year , with an increase in the general Mehrwehrsteuereinnahmen for the state and local governments to 6.2 per cent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year .
Washington , however , could be the space behind , if the spending of the federal government on the labour market in the region .

Andrew Lawson was a man of the sort , whose character has changed things , even in such a huge organisation like the NHS .
As a consulting Anästhesiearzt he devoted himself to the task of his career , the sick and the agony of the disease , as well as the anguish of the treatment to spare .
Among his patients , remembers his wife , was a MI6-Mitarbeiter , with the devastating effects of torture had to live .
Lawson knew that the doctors and the diagnosis of diseases are important , while the largely invalid are dealing with a completely different : pain .
One day in 2007 , he was , however , the one whose ordeal began .
`` I have not felt '' , he wrote in May of this year .
I had difficulty aufzuraffen , me .
While he fought with the soil symptoms , he noticed that he and his wife Juliet chronicles the allegations made .
`` I want everything to happen , sooner rather than later '' , he noted .
As Juliet went away on business on a business trip , Lawson felt quite remarkably shifted and without any reason .
Something was in the air .
He asked a colleague , a X-ray Sarpek .
Just two weeks earlier , he was skiing in the French Alps .
The result of the X-ray lay before .
He suffered from mesothelioma , an incurable cancer of the lungs , so the Brustfell überziehende skin .
As with most cancers , is the most difficult to determine the exact cause .
For example , while some smokers develop lung cancer , are not all Lungenkrebserkrankten smokers have been in the past .
But mesothelioma is different .
In almost every case , is the catalyst for a Asbestbelastung - contact with the Faserbaustoff , who once was considered as `` Wunderstoff '' but has now been recognized as fatal .
For most of us is a disease mesothelioma , which can easily ignore .
Asbestos is , after all , a product of the past .
The most dangerous type has been in Britain since the 1960 's , not used any more , as the industry voluntarily committed to do , this is no longer to use .
There , too , where he was used only in certain industries , people who worked directly with the substance - plumbers , carpenters and construction workers , for example , the shipyard workers .
As an industrial Gefahrstoff from a different time today , he seems to be a cause for concern .
But such complacency is misplaced .
Britain , it seems , saw the at the peak of a mesothelioma epidemic today .
There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world .
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year , twice as many people die from this disease and as die in accidents in motor vehicles .
Annual figures from the Mesotheliomtodesfälle since 1980 and the presumed future deaths in Britain
The reason why we are now witnessing the fatal consequences for years , although asbestos is illegal ( in 1999 , they have all been banned Asbesttypen ) , is the one that developed mesothelioma after decades .
And the scourge of mesothelioma is not limited to former workers of the construction sector .
Asbestos was , and is often still in the houses , in which we live , the offices , in which we work , the schools , in which we learn and the shops , where we shop .
And therefore no Klassenschranken piano-chamber mesothelioma , financial limitations , occupations or age .
The privileged bastions of the elegant department stores in London up to private schools , are not a bunker .
The Parliament buildings are asbestverseucht .
Even in the hospitals , in which we are supposed to be healthy , but are already as this deadly Karzinogens Ausgangsherde have been identified .
Andrew Lawson was not old .
He was also not a plumber .
It was , in fact , hard to imagine where he may have come into contact with asbestos could be .
Then he put his finger on it .
`` it seems as if in the tunnels at Guy 's Hospital , where I completed my training for six years , there was a lot of asbestos '' . he wrote .
Everybody , students , nurses , doctors , and Pförtner - use the tunnels .
One wonders how many of my contemporaries will be suffering from the same disease ?
This question , unfortunately , he was unable to answer , at least in part .
`` of the four doctors at Guy 's Hospital were trained , and in the last five years , suffering from mesothelioma '' , he wrote in a letter , `` I am the last one is still alive '' .
How many of us will get this disease ?
In Andrew Lawson mesothelioma was diagnosed at the age of 48 years .
When he died on 17 February this year , he was 55 .
It was an unusually long survival time .
Fifty per cent of all Mesotheliomerkrankten die within 8 months after the diagnosis .
The disease is always fatal .
We can therefore only reiterate Lawsons question : `` how many of us are still being get disease ? ''
The UK 's leading expert on mesothelioma , Professor Julian Peto , is that between 1870 and 2050 , if the Asbestepidemie in Britain is expected to come to a standstill , it will be a total of 90,000 , have fallen victim to the disease will be .
Most of them have no idea at the moment , so that they will die .

A quick look at the files of the courts , the people affected often because of damage , shows how far the scourge of Mesothelioms is already widespread .
In June this year , Marks & Spencer , for example , to Sulu Allen fahrlässigerweise exposed to asbestos .
She worked for nine years for the chain , from 1978 to 1987 , and was responsible on the Kleidungsabteilung at two locations - one of them the Flagshipstore in Oxford Street .
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years than when they work in M & S began .
Now , she has two children in the Twenties .
`` before this thing '' , she says , `` I had never heard of mesothelioma , I did not even really about asbestos .
I never would have thought that that would affect me .
There are only a few people who know a lot about asbestos .
The fact of the matter is that the concept of asbestos is not a substance , but a group of six minerals .
The name comes from the word `` Asbestiform '' , a description of the PVC , the fabric is durable and flexible .
Three of the six were used in the construction industry .
Asbestos , also known as white asbestos , this is now by far the most commonly found asbestos in buildings .
It was for Dachplatten Fußbodenplatten Rohrisolationen Boilerisolierungen , , , , even for brake pads used in cars .
It is less lethal than other Asbestformen , however , is from the EU and the World Health Organization as a `` big risk '' with possible death .
More dangerous , however , is the brown asbestos ( Amosit ) and the blue asbestos ( Krokydolith ) .
Britain was once the world 's largest importer of brown asbestos , and experts suspect that `` it is clear , however , indirect evidence that this is a major reason for the high Mesotheliomraten was unique '' .

Sulu Allen has perhaps not seen as a typical Mesotheliomopfer , but the work of Julian Peto , which suggests that their story is not unusual .
He has presented a study of those affected will be presented , in that `` a substantial proportion of the mesothelioma without known suspension through work or in the home by Asbestkontakt probably in the environment has caused '' .
A large part of these contacts is based on his words , the `` normal use and ageing of our building .
It looks as though no one could assume , to be sure .
A report by Goddard Consulting , the Palace of Westminster , also shows how people in the heart of the government , unwittingly exposed to the substance may have been .
In 2009 , reported that the Serviceschächte and pipes behind the Ausschussräumen of Parliament were contaminated with asbestos , whose deadly fibres by something as harmless as `` strong air movements '' could be an outcry .
MPs are often accused of having to look after their own interests , but here , it looks as if the opposite is taking place .
While the direction of the Parliamentary Arbeitsdienstes insisting that the Westminsterpalast Gesundheitszeugnis received a `` clean '' , it is now undisputed that £1 billion over the course of several years of work that needs to be paid to the Parliament to be renovated , the electronic installations to modernise and to remove the asbestos , and that after the general election in 2015 are the Members will meet in the nearby QE2-Konferenzzentrum rather than on the green benches in Westminster .
The Goddard-Bericht also pointed out that `` the presence of asbestos is not in accordance with the respective provisions has been handled '' .
No one can know whether this mismanagement will cost lives .
All you can do now is wait .
A person , the contact with asbestos could never determine exactly is Graham Abbott , a general practitioner .
As Andrew Lawson suggested the 50-year-old Abbott that he was during his work in hospitals , the asbestos was exposed to .
`` I have worked in a hospital , Asbestklagen were decided in the positive '' , he says , `` but I can not prove it in my case .
It 's so difficult to get to all the places where you have to remember that , and has worked on the data .
What exactly is he still recalls the day in early December 2009 , he had a kind of fever .
He was 45 , and was just an operation by late in the evening .
Suddenly , I had chills .
It was all of a sudden .
I felt awful .
I believed that the home not to create more .
As a doctor , knew Abbott that the pain from the Brustfell , the skin around his lungs around herrührten .
But , as Captain Sulu Allen , he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma .
He went a month not to work .
Doctors were surprised his chest X-ray and Pleurakathether , in order to remove fluid from the lungs , and in the laboratory to test .
His complaints , however , remained without a diagnosis .
His health stabilized slowly , and he returned to his job back .
From time to time , however , the symptoms return , often after high-solubility and fierce breahing .
In 2011 , Abbott was a patient with similar symptoms in his practice , and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma .
But even now , this is not the Abbott with his own case .
After all , his patient was a few decades older , and had worked with asbestos .
The link in the case was clear .
In September 2011 , Abbott 's condition worsened and his family brought his CT-Scans and X-ray to a group of experts .
In December 2011 , exactly two years after Abbott had felt sick for the first time , a camera equipped with a probe into the cave between Rippen- and introduced the Brustfell .
I am an optimist .
I usually just kept on going , `` he says .
To be honest , I had so many worries me not at all .
But Rachel , my wife , was worried .
The result of the biopsy was in the week between Christmas and New Year 's : `` you told me that it was mesothelioma '' .
Graham Abbott : diagnosis of mesothelioma
Suddenly , Abbott appointments with Macmillan-Krankenschwestern , one of which , it is recommended to take a lawyer .
Only now , he understood the scale of the epidemic .
`` it turned out that asbestos was very widespread , particularly in large public buildings , where pipes with asbestos were often isolated '' , he says .
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings , ill now .
And so is mesothelioma now younger people , not in the typical professions have been working on .
The most dangerous tubes with Asbestisolierungen führten in hospitals under the earth , so patients are more likely not to have been exposed to the substance .
But many employees , from one building to another Fußgängertunneln changed ( such as Andrew Lawson ) or in underground canteens ate Graham Abbott ( as it often did ) , with most likely came into contact with the toxic substances .
It turns out that for several decades after the war hospitals for the patients were potentially lifesaving , but life-threatening for the treating doctors .
He is still away .
Students on their Bunsenbrenner Asbestmatten .
And it is not only hospitals .
Asbestos was due to its efficiency and flammhemmenden properties are often in offices , shops , libraries and Stadthallen used .
Schools , too .
In fact , many people have probably had the first Asbestkontakt in the classroom .
Across the country , thousands of Chemiestunden , have students on their Bunsenbrenner Asbestmatten .
On Web sites will be the issue of asbestos in schools now often mentioned .
And meanwhile have so innocent items in our houses like Fußbodenplatten Schuppendächer contain asbestos or by default .
`` it 's a Industriegift that , in large parts of our real estate '' , notes Andrew Morgan , the lawyer , Andrew Lawson in his trial , Guy 's Hospital .
In one case , was the only contact , of an affected woman , suddenly the demolition of a Gartenschuppens in the 1970 's .
So you go on , as you shed your mattress .
The effects of the diagnosis , and the knowledge that the disease is incurable , is immense .
`` it takes a while to digest '' , says Graham Abbott .
I went back to work , and tried to carry on , but I realized that I could not focus on that , what I was doing .
I was two weeks ago in practice .
Then , I knew that I go to and I had to take care of myself .
Well , I will not see another Christmas .
With the greatest difficulty was the perspective of the position of a medical doctor to that of a patient .
As countless patients before him , he recalls , as he was overwhelmed by all the information was , with whom he had to come .
`` it was very hard , all of this '' , he says .
`` I asked my doctor how long I have ? ''
And you gave me about 12 months .
I remember that I thought , `` Oh , yes , I will not see another Christmas .
That 's it then. `` ''
Mesothelioma is a particularly treacherous , because it is our Lebenserhaltungsmechanismus - the breahing itself - is that the deadly cancer .
Most of the cases of mesothelioma are caused by Asbestkontakt .
Asbestos is composed of tiny fibres .
If the asbestos fibres and the outcry will be inhaling , they can in the Brustfell , the skin around the lungs , to be determined .
Asbestos fibres can irritate and cause the Brustfell Zellmutationen .
`` the problem is with the inhalierten nadelförmigen asbestos fibres '' , says Professor Tom Treasure , a Herz-Thorax-Arzt , the 2001 at Guy 's Hospital .
This is exactly what the hospital , of which Andrew Lawson suggested that it has suspended the asbestos is now , ironically , a leading centre for the treatment of mesothelioma .
Treasure knew Lawson and a few others , the probably also during their training in hospital after they were exposed to asbestos .
As soon as the Asbestnadeln the Lungengewebe , says Treasure , `` they will be of the Atemvorgang to the edge , where the skin is .
It is by its nature invasive right from the beginning .
The usual options in other cancers in mesothelioma does not work so well .
The effectiveness of an operation , for example , is hotly disputed .
Some say that it was worth a try .
Treasure denies this .
`` it is possible the Brustfell not under pressure '' , he says .
They come with the knife did not beat about the bush .
Meanwhile , the cancer `` on chemotherapy is not very good '' , the `` effect '' , but not heals .
`` sometimes there are Langzeitüberlebende '' , says Treasure .
But at the end of the day , they all die .
Fortunately , some of the patients , in fact , live a long time , much longer than expected .
The author , Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis .
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis , Graham Abbott still fighting .
After he contacted Abbott had mesothelioma , came in contact with Andrew Lawson , of the four years after his diagnosis a Ein-Mann-Unterstützungs- and consultancy for Mitbetroffene had become .
`` hello , Krebszentrale '' , he cheerfully on calls .
`` he was very positive '' , says Abbott .
He had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still very active .
Abbott six Chemotherapiezyklen were originally offered the four months , and his life is only expected to last a month , would be extended .
`` I was desperate '' , he says .
I wanted to give up .
Lawson , however , was `` the things in a more positive light '' .
Following the advice of several doctors decided to Abbott , his treatment with Prof. Loic Herz-Thorax-Spezialist Lang-Lazdunski , at Guy 's .
`` we had an advantage because of the fact that I have not had to be weiterverwiesen , I called right away and got a date '' , Graham .
A normal patient would receive a payment and have to wait for the approval of the treatment .
Money is a key factor for Mesotheliom-Erkrankte the best available therapies , in order to be able to perceive .
But if these treatments fail , after all , inevitably , there are many people of a different financial concern - about the future of the families they leave behind .
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation .
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP .
`` it is known that asbestos since 1898 , is extremely dangerous for the health '' , says Morgan .
In the 1960s , but what has changed is that we realized that even a very low burden was a health risk .
And this is where the negligence of the companies have a role to play .
Andrew Lawson , and Guy 's Hospital , after all with their case , but it was not what Morgan called a `` full compensation '' , as Lawson not with absolute certainty , that could prove to be a mesothelioma Asbestkontakt at Guy 's .
After the investigation into his death was confirmed by a spokesman for the Guy 's , however , that `` the asbestos fibres in the affected Kellerbereich in the 1990 's have been removed '' .
This was too late for Andrew Lawson .
Such as asbestos may be removed
It is , in fact , for Mesotheliom-Erkrankte , to seek compensation , a huge problem , the deadly Asbestkontakt a company or a job on the frequency - normally decades after the events .
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed down .
Versicherungsunterlagen can be lost .
And those who defend itself against the claims , know that the time for it , but it is certainly not with recognised the authors .
In response , there has been strong this year , the new legislation makes it easier for Mesotheliom-Betroffene beforeany , compensation , even if their former employers are no longer here .
The law has one of the insurance industry , supported by funds of £350 million for all established , diagnosed after July 2012 , a contact can prove , but no one can sue .
In these cases , the plaintiffs will receive 80 percent of what a court would have them in a normal Schadensersatzprozess zusprechen can - about £120,000 .
About 300 successful applications for the program are expected per year .
Andrew Morgan thinks like so many Mesotheliom-Betroffene that £350 million in a `` very good work '' of the insurance industry .
`` It 's a deal of insurance for insurers '' , he says , and suggests that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have to pay if the time is not known , and it would be the company and they find Mesotheliom-Erkrankte normal could sue .
Also , Mike Penning , who was working and Pensionsminister , has acknowledged that the law was `` not perfect '' .
But both Penning as Morgan gave to that , in the face of seven deaths every day a quick action was necessary .
`` the people are suffering so much and need help '' , said Penning today during the second hearing of the Mesotheliom-Gesetzes in December of last year .
At this point in time was Graham Abbott for 19 months in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski .
After their first debate Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation from which he , unlike Tom Treasure is expected to have a positive effect .
This was from a radiation therapy and chemotherapy - accompanied by a Dreifachtherapie Lang-Lazdunski , with a survival rate of more than five years of up to 40 percent can present .
Abbott felt strengthened .
`` this is , of course , with the most important thing '' , says Abbott .
You can see that again in patients .
There is something that you can just carry on .
If you aufgibst , it is you very quickly .
Graham Abbott underwent the operation in March 2012 .
At the end of August , he had the last of the six Chemotherapiezyklen behind .
Nachsorgescans showed no signs of the disease .
Then I had a scan in March 2014 .
There have been several Krebs-Flecken to my chest .
I was just 50 .
It 's not life-threatening .
It 's lebensbeendend .
Abbott again underwent six Chemotherapiezyklen .
Now , there is no trace of the tumors more visible .
But the process is physically and mentally very tiring .
You have to think about practical things - on the money , if not more , for example , am I , or my wife , show how the Boilerzeiteinstellung works .
If you receive bad news , you will be negative .
You have to look forward .
As the father of Elly , 16 , and Tamsin , 14 , this is not always easy .
`` for parents , It 's difficult '' , he says .
It is difficult to know what we should say and how much .
When I received my first diagnosis , I said to my girls that I have a disease , with which I would not grow old .
They were quite different .
Tamsin is very sociable and unpredictable .
They told their friends and we soon got very many calls .
Elly was Lapajne .
She said not much .
Such discussions are something that all cancer patients have to go through .
But for Mesotheliomerkrankte such talks are not of hope , and not a trace of hope of survival .
The disease will eventually also ( like Stephen Jay Gould ) for a grim security .
As Andrew Morgan says , `` mesothelioma is not life-threatening .

Twin : German beer for Guangzhou
Hops and malt - even in China , a popular combination .
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China .
Frankfurt 's twin town in China now wants a brewery and hopes also to a Flug-Direktverbindung between the two cities .
German beer , brewed in Frankfurt 's twin Guangzhou - that is the urgent wish of the officials in China .
`` we would be very happy if a German brewery would settle in our city '' , said the Vize-Parteisekretär the South China metropolis , Li Yiwei , this week , when visiting a SPD-Delegation in his city .
Time and again , the official of the ruling Chinese Communist Party in the course of the discussion on this issue of Zwölf-Millionen-Metropole back .
Guangzhou , in Germany , also known as Canton , is one of the richest cities of China , Li .
So that the purchasing power of the people , to be able to afford to buy German beer .
The Hessen Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel SPD-Vorsitzende , who led the German Politikerdelegation , said to the host , he will be in Germany after a possible partner for the project umhören .
`` there is not much need for beer : good water , cereals and zest for life '' , he added at the lunch with the Parteioberen in Guangzhou .
This vitality strahle already , he would flatter Mr Li from the hosts .
As a result , the official from Guangzhou with Schäfer-Gümbel - but with the red wine , the food was served .

The Lufthansa had offered the flight earlier in the year 2012 , but for economic reasons .
`` it would be worth '' , again showed the local politicians .
`` the commerce between our two cities continues '' .
Currently , travelers would have to take a detour through Changsha in Hunan province , Li lamented .
The administration of the Guangdong province , of which Guangzhou is the capital , is hoping for the flights .
The Vize-Gouverneur of the province , Chen Yunxian , this desire in his conversation with the Social Democrats in the foreground .
`` this is a very good idea '' , said Schäfer-Gümbel - the Chinese vice-minister Li Jinjun , an intimate water-people Germany , nodded in agreement .
Neat partnership
The leutselige Vize-Parteichef of Guangzhou hopes that he will be in the next year to a Frankfurt Partnerschaftstreffen can visit .
Li Yiwei was already on the main , but not yet in this position .
He came into office only this year , after his predecessor from office due to corruption charges had been promoted .
Also , the local leader , Wan Qinglian , had to go .
The action against the officials in Guangzhou is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in the party and administration , by President Xi Jinping , with hardness is enforced .
The new leaders , Li Yiwei dovevano his Parteikarriere worked for an American company , which is highly unusual in the Communist Party of China is .

In a statement to the press , it contradicts statements of CEO Peer Medau and attested to this , `` like a tapestry '' to pose .

The statement that the plans were known only in July , are definitely wrong , `` so Pötzl .
At the same time , he refers to the fact that it is not in the plans to `` Vorfestlegungen or even decisions '' , it is , however , `` preferences '' .
Also the access necessary for the expansion of the narrow road up to the castle is less dramatic than the Medaus feared .

It goes to the current state to 5.50 meters , that is a metre wider than before , `` explains Pötzl .
The argument that their Stacchus Medau-Betreiber schuleigenen parking in the future and will only be used by students from the University of Applied Sciences , wants to let Pötzl do not apply .
Zugeparkt is not at all , because , as with other public car parks now intelligent can solve .
Think of the residents
The nursery Bergwichtel , on the site , which is located on the doorstep and along the access route to the scanners would lead , according to the Hochschulpräsidenten `` should not be compromised '' .
Rather , it is to be remembered , `` that this is not just about the nursery , but also about the people living along the river to the 800 students Friedrich-Streib-Straße and the neighbouring Primary School .
It 's so much more than the vested interests of the gentlemen `` , Medau Pötzl .
Whether the criticism of the Elternbeirats the nursery , with the construction of the road would be one of the few natural spots Coburgs lost was `` justified '' , the reader can decide for themselves. ``
At the beginning of October Pötzl will together with the State Public Works of the councillors on the structural development of the university DreamTents `` by 2020 and , in this regard , the importance of the new Überhäufung address '' .
Peer Medau had last week , the parents of the nursery on the plans of the university informed .
According to the airfield for the new scanners do not like so far about the campus and the Friedrich-Streib-Straße , but about the Medau-Berg .
So that would have to be the narrow road about a kilometre in length will be upgraded .
According to the projections of the Medaus would get the traffic in the park of the chateau at Hohenfels it tenfold .
Of about 2000 vehicles every day is the speech .
On the part of the city if they want not to comment on the project so far .

On the bouncy Burggartenfest was on Saturday with a lot going on .
The concept was agreed by the organiser of the event .
Despite the hefty downpours on Saturday night , an estimated 1,200 came to Canada in the Burggarten Open-Air-Fest .
At times the admission had to be stopped .
`` it was annoying '' , said Ron Sem , one of the organisers .
Salzwedel l light and fun .
From two Spanish words have Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem Amula formed the name .
Because the Open Air in the Burggarten Salzwedeler DatabaseMetadataMethods brightness on the day and in the evening , through various shows .
Well , and the fun comes from alone anyway .
This was demonstrated early Saturday , when the first visitors to the Open Air aufmachten .
A feast for all generations had promised to the organizers .
And this is what you have achieved .
Around the Versorgungsstände on the Burggartenwiese Salzwedeler had it , but also guests from the regular .
They pursued the first live performances , wippten with the foot in tact , enjoyed cool drinks - in short : relax and enjoy were pull-him-towards-me .
And across the generations .
While the one on blankets on the extra angekarrten white sand at the beach bar lümmelten , others a quarter of wine in the wine shop labten raged on , the offspring of the bouncer , which is a big attraction for the smaller guests .
But even when the volunteers had & crafts in the truest sense of the word , with all hands to do , to the crowd and imaginative creations , in the small faces .
The largest use of the table football tables or participated in a Skateboard-Workshop Goodfoot-Crew Salzwedel , from participation .
Until the big rain came .
At 5.30 p.m. , shortly before orgasm , he settled on the visitors , particularly families were looking for the vastness and nests .
But the attraction of the festival , it did not .
`` there were more people than expected '' , said Ron Sem , of a `` success on the whole line '' .
This is a repeat of the major party in the coming year .
Although on the content and size of the events still needs to be worked on , Sem in a first assessment on Sunday against the Volksstimme .
He described that as angry at the entrance had to be stopped .
It was obvious the security forces has been booked with too little .
The result : many of those who had already paid for , no longer on the site .
The response was very good .
In a first cautious estimate , said the Salzwedeler participation of about 1200 visitors , who were in the Burggarten .
There were problems with the equipment .
The Salzwedeler Hip-Hop-Band blocks'n'u Rox broke their appearance so unnerved .
The technicians were not able to create a halfway reasonable sound .
The planned Shisha-Lounges could not be established , because the tents because of a puncture after Salzwedel could not be brought .
`` in the next year , but they are to be there '' , says the organiser of the event .
The premiere of the of the scandalization Amula-Open-Airs was more than successful .
And the case of bad weather .
However , the organisers have some mistakes , the first to be forgiven , but in the case of the second edition have had to be removed .
Also in the social network Facebook must be the organizer of the criticism .
`` sorry , but for 12 euros , you just expected more '' , wrote Melanie Meier on the Veranstaltungsseite .
`` unfortunately , you 've taken a little bit '' , says Ele Zimmermann at the same point .
Others see the initial problems not quite so closely .
I think it is very good that some are not only stupid , but also really try to talk a bit on its feet .
Hats off ! `` , writes Stephanie Jenß to Amula .
Now the Koritnica-Mündung remains a year in which to make these points of criticism .

With Rona Fairhead , the BBC is perhaps the great director , found the needs it .
You will meet with a proud Ruhmesschleppe from the banking world , the Institute and the inner circle of the Tory one .
And it has its own Fronterfahrung .
Her career began at the global Managementberatungsunternehmen Bain and Co. , which is what they are to Morgan Stanley , Bombadier , ICI and the media of Pearsons www.diedruckerei.de .
It was seven years , President and CEO of the Financial Times and resigned as the top post of Pearsons carrier to a younger male colleagues .
Their compensation was allegedly almost £1 million .
Also their political ranking is solid .
It was David Cameron by Lord Browne , the former chairman of BP , is recommended , as this to more private Kenntnissen in Whitehall ; it was an advisor to the cabinet .
Her husband is a former Tory councillor .
Back in May , I described the task of the Chairman with a poisoned chalice .
Not only is the BBC as a huge and complex entity in the heart of public life , but there is also an internal paradox in its structure .
The trust works in two directions : to the inside on the first guard of own Managementhierarchie in the BBC , but also as a voice of public concern and anxiety , if things go wrong .
The result is an almost unsustainable duopoly , that after a full comprehensive reform .
But what new incoming chairman , it would risk everything , and an institution auseinanderzunehmen , which is so complex , such as a Chinese dynasty , while he himself to his job .
It 's a difficult task .
And as if that were not enough , there are still many keen to see the BBC reduced - power , money , and status .
While the competition is closer to the old and new technologies , and threaten the security , is the upcoming negotiation of the royalties for the BBC with special dangers .
For the modest sum of £145,50 per year is buying the British public , I am sure that the largest media company in the world .
The BBC tells a good story : she says that they reached 96 per cent of all households , and each of them only 40 pence per day costs .
And the BBC seem to be rising in popularity on the back up again : 53 percent support them today , compared to 31 per cent 10 years ago .
The binocular and websites for the BBC have changed : I get Vestdijk Nachrichtenschlagzeilen on my mobile and I missed my iPlayer programmes later on .
But it remains a very beloved and significant institution .
It needs a leader - I hope she has found him .

Merkel speaks power Word : toll is `` very clear ''

Bundesverkehrsminister Alexander Dobrindt ( CSU ) had `` made a proposal , and which is now going to be accomplished '' .
The NRW-CDU insisting on their 'no ' vote , however , equal to a toll on all roads .
Merkel stressed , including Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble ( CDU ) return to constructive in the debate for a bill .
On this issue I have with Dobrindt , he also talked about other possibilities , more private capital for investment in infrastructure , for example , to activate the promotion .
`` there is nothing at all special gehöre '' . Schäuble had on Sunday a `` mirror '' report unkommentiert , his house , in order to test its own concept of jurisdiction with Mauteinnahmen Autobahn-Investoren to 2017 - after the election .
CSU-Chef Horst Seehofer warned that as a result , in the cabinet Mautkonzepte against the Lead Minister .
CDU-Bundesvize Armin Laschet reiterated his objections .
`` the coalition agreement never went , and to all the cosy hotel bar '' , said Bundesstraßen bemauten CDU-Landesvorsitzende of North Rhine-Westphalia .
In this respect , it would be an important signal that Seehofer now announced , once again I have to talk about this .
Opposition to the plans also comes from the CDU-Landesverbänden Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate .
Background , there are fears that a toll the traffic to neighbouring countries .
Seehofer had because of the Mautkritik from ranks of the CDU Koalitionstreue requires .
The left sees the plans in the face of the dispute in the Union as a failure .
`` the Murks-Maut is dead '' , said leader , Bernd Riexinger , the Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung `` ( Monday ) .
`` with the failure of the toll of the Minister '' . Dobrindt wants a Vignettenpflicht on all German roads system , which should start in 2016 .
Domestic car owners but not allowed to be in the coalition agreement .
Therefore , it should be about the Kfz-Steuer a full compensation for the toll .
The model must be foreign drivers but according to EU law and not because of their nationality .

The Burgvereine will soon be back on the same ?
The last time there was always between the two Wolfratshauser Aktienclub Burgvereinen .
The boards now think about a possible cooperation .
As an example , for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser Aktienclub castle , the late Richard Dimbath , former chairman of the Wolfratshauser Aktienclub Burgfreunde , lengthen the project in French .
A year ago there was no good and the atmosphere between the Burgverein Burgfreunden Tölz-Wolfratshausen .
So far , the points seemed to be very different , as with the history of the Wolfratshauser Aktienclub castle and a possible reconstruction should be handled .
Now , the two camps to move towards each other : it should soon be talks on a common approach .
This confirmed the Vereinsvorstände Speedflying Sjöberg ( Burgverein ) and Herbert Piffl ( Burgfreunde ) , on demand of our newspaper .
`` I have Mr Piffl mobile-tailored and suggested that we could be together again '' , reports Sjöberg .
In his view , could all members of both clubs to pull together again in the future .
So are more visible successes .
While the Burgfreunde suddenly to the late Richard Dimbath last to a reconstruction of the castle in the mountain forest , stands for the eye to the `` Sjöberg Burgverein Überhäufung and Erlebbarmachung '' of the terrain in the foreground .
Herbert , chairman of the second Piffl Burgfreunde , according to their own figures about the phone call was very happy .
Since he is the Burgfreunden Dimbaths death .
A new chairman is expected to be in the middle of September in a general meeting will be found .
Currently , the association is one of about 40 members , according to the access .
`` after the death of my friend Richard Dimbath activities out of respect we have the first Neptulon '' . this `` Denkphase '' was necessary , `` to consider how it could go on like this '' .
According to the new chairman then Piffl is said to be in the conversation with the Burgverein .
Until then , could the Burgfreunde also a current mood within their group .
A candidate for the presidency , there is currently not yet , says Piffl .
`` but I am confident that someone will find '' . he himself does not want to stand for election , because he has his residence in Bad Tölz .
The new chairman should be a Wolfratshauser Aktienclub .
The Tölzer `` on the project , but would very much like to work on '' .
The different points of view in terms of reconstruction , in the eyes of Piffls will probably remain in place in the near future .
It gives Dimbath as a `` missionary '' , always on the restoration of the castle .
Two similar , already far advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not a chimera .
Through a high level of participation of the population , as well as by volunteers from all over the world , they are a tourist .
Piffl : `` I was at the beginning .
But in the course of the time I am more and more convinced that it makes sense to push ahead with the project `` . it is a '' modern technology `` for the Flößerstadt be created .
Here , there is nothing else .
In addition , the project would be by EU-Zuschüsse , type and potential sponsors , believes Piffl .
`` the idea of reconstruction and , personally , I do not simply want to jettison '' . he hoped that the Burgverein in this point may be something moves .
Their goal , the first to document history , `` is important and it is good '' .

The first day of spring with wet and stormy weather conditions affected flights from Adelaide Airport
The SPRINGTIME has brought Australia a wintry surprise , with heavy showers and strong wind that affected flights from Adelaide Airport .
In the evening until 21 p.m. , another 5 mm of rain fell on the city , after 6.6 mm , which had already fallen on Saturday night .
The last rainfall was the result of a series of short , turbulent showers , including a mold , which started just before 20 p.m. , nearly 4 mm of rainfall in about 10 minutes .
After the winter last week for an early dose of spring , temperatures in the city fell again on Monday to a maximum of 15.8 ° C .
The gusty weather probably led to the delayed landing of a Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide .
The plane was supposed to land shortly after 19.30 p.m. , but was hit by a wind shear - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to take off .
Wind gusts reached 50 km/h on the ground at this stage in the Adelaide Airport .
The flight data showed that the plane had to take off a second , and finally , at about 20.40 pm .
The flight delay led to delay some of the other flights , including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Hoschar flight from Sydney .
For Adelaide , on Tuesday predicted a temperature of 16 ° C , with possible showers .

After the election in Saxony : CDU deputy Strobl , NPD 's prohibition is called into question
Given the voting losses of the NPD in Saxony , the CDU Federal Deputy Thomas Strobl has argued for an end to the ongoing proceedings before the Federal Constitutional Court to ban the NPD .
Berlin - The German CDU deputy Thomas Strobl should find an end to the ongoing proceedings to ban against the NPD in the constitutional court .
`` The NPD performs worse than last time , '' said Strobl , who is also head of the CDU country in Baden-Württemberg , the `` Leipziger Volkszeitung . ''
That is a welcome development in the right direction and a development that makes me more likely to come to the conclusion that the NPD fought politically and in front of the Constitutional Court .
The NPD had failed narrowly in the vote on Sunday at the five % threshold .
A first attempt to ban the far-right party had failed in 2003 , because of the protections in the NPD 's top informants at the time .
The Federal Council in December 2013 after a long preparation for a new application in Karlsruhe .

The decline , along with a drop in the number of homeowners under the age of 35 could lead to a loss of garden centres tens of thousands of pounds a year , if today 's young consumers , according to a study by the HTA , as reported in the Financial Times , the `` core age group for garden products . ''
The report says that tenants spend an average of 55 percent of the amount spent by people with home for their garden .
The increase in the number of people living in highly urbanised areas without gardens , the popular procedure to the more diverse gardens to park purposes and the declining size of garden are other factors that threaten the industry , to be implemented in the estimated £5 billion a year in sales .

Feminists criticise race and police behavior after Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was at the beginning of this month , killed by a police officer in Ferguson .
The participants raised their hands in the air and sang , `` hands up , do n't shoot , '' while they waited for the funeral .
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson , Mo , because of the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown , the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists .
After their experience white feminist commentators put the sex before the race , when it comes to reproductive rights and to address income inequality .
While tensions rose in the Midwest , and received attention throughout the country , saw Perez that turned the responses of white women , 100 % of the race .
Compared with the responses of black women shortly after the shots of 9 August , the personal essays with titles like `` thoughts on Ferguson from a white woman '' and `` feminism is not just about the oppression of women '' relatively late .
But Perez meant an important change .
`` I do not think that many people in feminism , and talk about the white privileges on the high-class kind , '' she said .
The people felt pushed to express something about the incidents .
It is characteristic of the crisis we are facing and because the situation in Ferguson is ethnicized so that they have to say .
For English professor Koritha Mitchell of Ohio State University , Ferguson brought to light problems faced by black women every day , but not be seen as `` women 's issues '' in the cultural area .
`` I can publish something funny on Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 likes from everywhere , '' said Mitchell .
If I post something about how people are under siege in their own country , the silence is deafening .
`` How can it be safe for women to speak publicly about a relationship , but not about safety in public spaces ? '' She asked .
For black women , such as Mitchell , race , gender and sexuality have studied in the history of the United States , there is no dichotomy between racial and gender issues .
For black women , they have not had the luxury of separating the issues of clean ; they live every day in the combined reality .
While the issues of race and gender combine white women in the feminist mainstream circles , says Angela Hattery , professor of women and at the George Mason University that their predecessors did the opposite .
`` At least 10,000 black men were lynched between 1865 and 1890 , and the justification was almost always the rape of a white woman , '' said Hattery .
White women had to be involved in the story to justify the Lynch murder .
For Hattery came the division between white and black women at the point where white fighters for women such as Susan B. Anthony the country in the late years of the 19th century , and that could be the fight for the right to vote only for one group : women or blacks .
`` They took the decision to stand up for women 's suffrage , and the right to vote for blacks should come later , '' said Hattery .
If such things are remembered , one with power , why do n't trust women of color white women .
We have not done our job well .
We have never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons .
Even after 1920 women were given the right to vote , it took a decade to get organized , white women against the lynching in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching .
The group was founded almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women , says Mitchell .
For Mitchell , the flood of white feminist responses to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behavior , racial discrimination - a mirror of the times in which white feminists played `` catch '' with the problems of black women for generations .
`` Would n't it be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms have the right to a child 's education as seriously as they do with the right to conception control ? '' Asked Mitchell .
The second generation of feminists , who built their careers on the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives , try to understand what that means .
The familiar white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown on Facebook and published a pithy article by Rebecca Carroll of the Guardian , which calls for more protests on the issue of racism by white Americans .
`` I hope that women who have a different , but parallel reason to understand the danger inherent in the body - and opinions on the race , which are significantly different in public opinion polls - will lead the changes , '' Steinem wrote .
Although Steinem stands for a more intersectional feminism , which raises the race as well as gender issues are perplexed by some of their comments on the racial issue in America .
Christina Sommers , a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of `` who Stole Feminism ? '' Said to She The People , that young men in the United States , in particular young men of color , `` far more vulnerable than their sisters , '' but Steinems comments on Ferguson , in contrast to their previous criticism .
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women , but almost nothing for boys .
But when the White House recently a small program , My Brother 's Keeper , clapped in order to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men , there were infuriating reactions from many feminists , including Gloria Steinem .
The relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem that is at the forefront of mainstream feminism .
After the U.S. border police took up almost 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the southwest border of the country this year , the issue of immigration reform comes to the surface again - this time as a women 's issue .
Andrea Mercado , Co Chairman of We Belong Together , an organization that mobilizes the women for immigration reform , said that the issue as a key issue for women it must publish the stories of immigrant women .
`` They speak for themselves , '' said Mercado .
If the vast majority of working visas , male immigrants , are the women who accompany them in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation .
`` These stories find an echo in the women 's organisations , '' she said .

`` Guardians of the Galaxy '' why was not a blockbuster
`` The Expendables 3 '' by Sylvester Stallone played less than $ 30 million of its $ 90 million budget in the United States , while `` sin City : a Dame to Kill For '' only $ 12 million in its budget of $ 70 million .
The film `` sex Tape '' tailored to Cameron Diaz played the busiest only $ 14.6 million , while children 's films such as `` easy to tame dragons made 2 '' also disappoint in revenue .
An article in the Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that the children 's films could be the lack of quality in the films themselves .
Collin described 2014 as `` the worst year for children 's films '' and `` 2 '' made it easy to tame dragons as a purely `` functional '' fantasy sequel .
In films for a slightly older audience , however , it appears as if the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem .
In July , Entertainment Weekly average Cinema Score and Meta Critic - evaluation for each summer movie , between the American Memorial Day and the 20th of July 2013 and at least 2000 canvases in the current year .
The results are based on the opinion of cinemagoers and film critics and suggest that this year 's film hits equivalent to those of last year .
Some commentators believe that the development is due to changing habits and the growing popularity of Web streaming services such as Netflix .
Director Jon Favreau , who is currently working on Disney 's upcoming animated film , said to the Hollywood Reporter website : `` I think the times are changing . ''
We must accept that and not try to chase after the past .
In contrast to the currently weak cash results of Hollywood productions , Netflix streaming content with the recent sales of $ 1.2 billion , almost twice as much as last year 's sales amounted to $ 837 million .
Last summer , the director Steven Spielberg criticised the film studios that they concentrated too much on the comic and predicted a `` meltdown '' of Hollywood .
In light of the current downturn , some commentators argue that his grim prophecy could contain a true core .
Because of the potential blockbuster expected in the summer of 2015 , including the Gers : Age of Jurassic World Ultron , Minions and other representatives of the film industry , however , are more optimistic :
The producer of X-Men , Simon Kinberg , described the decline in cash results recently as `` cyclical '' and compared to the Hollywood Reporter said : `` the next summer will be the biggest summer box-office at all , and no one will be more concerned about the business . ''

Israeli children are returning to the war in Gaza in their schools back
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near the Gaza Strip on Monday returned to the schools , after they had spent the summer in air protection areas , while rockets and mortar shells on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza fell and the schools remained closed , while the area recovered from the fighting .
The school brought the rocket launch no shot holes in communities in the south of Israel , a feeling of joy and expectation , but the signs of the battles are still fresh .
In the southern city of Ashdod , employees of the `` Pashosh '' - Kindergarten , which has been hit by a missile , before the arrival of the student shrapnel shards from the walls and sliding walls .
`` We are a bit scared , but excited , '' said Bart Ronit , someone who lives in Kibbutz Saad and local English teacher .
Many children from our area urgently need a return to a routine .
Her 11-year-old daughter , Shani Bart , said it felt `` a bit weird '' to suddenly go back to school .
`` These were difficult times , and we have not gone out of the house , '' she said .
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near the border with Gaza to offer his support .
The war until a cease-fire last week , thousands of residents of border communities remained cut off as Saad in their homes or left their homes to move to safer areas further away from Gaza and the rocket and mortar fire to escape .
Many residents of Nahal Oz , a village near the border with Gaza , in which a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar grenade , still reluctant to return .
The Ministry of Education said a dozen families had not yet returned .
Their children were temporarily housed in other schools .
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot , a border town in Gaza , which is heavily scarred by Palestinian fire .
He urged the children to learn a lot and said `` we will make sure that you get their knowledge and provide security . ''
Israel and Hamas agreed last Tuesday to a permanent ceasefire .
The ceasefire provided an immediate end to the fighting , but major problems remain unresolved , such as Hamas ' demand for a lifting of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of air and sea ports in Gaza .
Israel calls for the disarmament of Hamas and the transfer of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting .
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin in Egypt later this month .
More than 2,100 Palestinians have been killed in the war , three quarters of them civilians , and the Palestinians and the U.N. estimates that at least 494 children .
Israel denies those claims and estimates that at least half of those killed by militants , but presented no concrete evidence for this information .
On the Israeli side , 66 soldiers and six civilians , including a Thai worker , killed .
Hamas and other militants in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortar shells at Israeli cities during the fighting , most of them in the south of the country .
Meanwhile , the Israeli military conducted more than 5,000 air and other attacks .
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza area and some 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 U.N. schools , which have been converted into temporary shelters .
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the shelters and the fight continues , the educational authorities last week postponed the start of the school year .
`` I hope that the school is open again soon , so that we can continue to learn , just as the children in the world and the Jewish children , '' said Mohammad Amara , a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza City .

Perry says that Texas was not authorized derogatory tweet

The tweet was later deleted and replaced by another of Perry 's account , the abstritt the previous .
Just a tweet was sent from my account , I was not authorized .
`` I do not approve of the tweet and I have deleted it , '' it said in the message .
Employees of Perry responded immediately to requests for comments .
Although the tweets of Perry 's official account , it was not clear who actually uses the feed .
In the previous tweet was an unfavourable image of the district attorney of Travis County , Rosemary , Berg , who was sentenced in April 2013 due to drink-driving .
Perry put a veto on a financial support of their offices , when they refused to resign , which could be an indictment of Perry - possibly 2016 presidential candidate - led to a grand jury this month in Austin .
The text of the tweets : `` I 'm not always drunk with the triple allowable alcohol level ... But if I do , I accuse Governor Perry when he ausplaudert . ''

4 tips for better pictures and videos
If you want to make photos or videos under water , there are a variety of devices .
The cheapest option is a waterproof Point and Shoot , like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or Action Cam , such as the GoPro Hero3 + Silver Edition , which are both for about $ 300 .
I took these photos with a family celebration with several cameras , which are all available at a price of less than $ 350 .
Regardless of the equipment , there are a few rules for the best results .
Check your equipment twice .
Even if you have a waterproof camera , make sure that the battery pack and other subjects are closed .
Put your camera on the photos or videos that you want to get in .
Some cameras and camcorders have scenes and recording , which optimizes the exposure time for the underwater twilight conditions .
And before you jump into it , check until the depth of your equipment .
Some cameras are allowed only for up to 5 feet , others up to 50 or 60 feet .
Browse our buyers and the ratings for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models .
Take multiple shots - because not many fold .
Point and shoot cameras have a LCD , with which you can compose images , not normally action cams .
Even if you have a LCD , it is difficult to see under water , and the right picture setting is a matter of chance .
So make a lot of shots .
If your camera has a row mode , which made a series of recordings with slightly altered exposure settings , you can use it .
Stay near the surface .
The light is dramatically worse , ever further away from the surface .
If so , you can stay close to the surface , if you are shooting in a pool , a lake or the sea .
This allows you to bring more color in your photos ; the deeper you go , the less you will see color .
Go close to the objects .
This is also a good advice on land , but it is all the more important because of the poor lighting conditions under water .
It is particularly important if you are working with an Action Cam : these devices often have a wide-angle lens , which means that you need to get closer to your objects if they are to fill the whole picture .

After weeks of wrangling , Italy 's Prime Minister and acting EU president , Matteo Renzi , imposed against strong conservative resistance at the EU summit last week , the nomination of his Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini as the leader of the EU 's foreign policy , it will be the successor to the British , Catherine Ashton .
Renzi sees the government as a close daily newspaper La Repubblica , the appointment of his favourite team in the government 's current Mogherini as strengthening the position of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU .
He also expects a boost for its `` reform package '' in Italy .
Last but not least , Renzi hopes to make the left base quietly risen against him again and again , because she is - albeit more moderate way .
With the conservative representatives with President Jean-Claude Juncker and the President of the Council nominated Donald Tusk , Poland will be the prevailing view in Rome in order to produce a political settlement .

The pending approval of the European Parliament is considered safe .
Otherwise President , Giorgio Napolitano , the nomination of the 41-year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party ( PD ) is hardly a `` important recognition '' of the role of Italy in the EU .
La Repubblica spread optimism that for almost two decades , leading party offices and Mogherini , known for its ambition to `` enormous challenges '' will show up .

Production in the euro area on a 13-month low
The increase in production in the eurozone slowed in August to the lowest point in the last 13 months , a closely watched study .
The final Markit manufacturing purchasing managers index ( PMI ) fell to 50.7 in August , after a stand of 51.8 in July .
An indication of 50 gives an expansion .
New orders went back and saw factories at a time of rising tension , between the EU and Russia over Ukraine .
The figures come before the meeting of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) on Thursday .
The markets expect the bank a clear plan for dealing with a hesitant recovery of the eurozone and the threat of deflation with an inflation rate of just 0.3 % .
There is speculation that the head of the ECB , Mario Draghi , could make further details later this week if he draws a quantitative easing for the eurozone , according to those who have been made by Britain and the U.S. during the financial crisis .
`` Although a small growth is better than no growth , have become the restraining effects of the growing economic and geopolitical uncertainties for the manufacturers , '' said Rob Dobson , senior economist at Markit .
The factory PMI for Germany , the largest trading partner of Russia in the EU , fell to the lowest level in 11 months , with 51.4 .
In the meantime , the second largest economy of the bloc , France , the PMI fell to 46.9 .
France remains a problem child , as well as the descent of Italy from a solid expansion to stagnation .
Indications that growth incentives in key industrial machinery , as well as in Spain , Germany and the Netherlands are also not reassuring , `` said Mr Dobson .
The decline in the industry is fueling the fire of the analysts expect further monetary or fiscal stimulus .
Good news came from the Republic of Ireland , where the PMI rose to 57.3 , the highest level since the end of 1999 .
Howard Archer , chief economics expert at IHS Global Insight , said : `` the best thing that can be said for the purchasing managers index of manufacturing in the euro area in August , is that the sector continues to grow . ''
He added : `` producers in the eurozone find life difficult at the moment , obviously , since the current heightened geopolitical tensions - particularly in relation to Russia and Ukraine - continue to increase uncertainties in the difficult conditions in many countries .
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular , and consumer confidence , and probably lead to some contracts being delayed or even cancelled , especially large contracts .
He said that it is `` increasingly likely '' that the ECB should launch a kind of QE , `` although we suspect that this will be limited . ''

`` The socialists in France should keep your mouth shut and bring France in order , '' said the most important allies of Francois Hollande .
Mr Valls called the deeply divided Left , `` to show their love '' for the controversial socialist president , has met with the disapproval of the cabinet reshuffle among the vast majority of French people .
The president deserves everyone 's respect , he deserves our loyalty , he deserves our support .
`` It is our duty to remain at his side , '' he said to great applause .
As reassuring , the Prime Minister insisted that his government 's controversial 35 -hour week in France despite fierce demands for a relaxation of the rules by Emmanuel Macrons , the new Minister for the Economy , will not call into question .
On Saturday , Mr Hollande had called on his Mitsozialisten , urgently , to show a `` united '' with the government .
But the justice minister , Christiane Taubira , a spanner in the works , in which she appeared at a meeting of renegade Socialist MEP and criticised the Socialist Party for the French `` faith in their future . ''
Marine Le Pen , the leader of the far right National Front , derided the constant infighting of the socialists and said that she could not imagine that the new Valls government will sustain more than a few months .
François Hollande is the emperor without clothes , but Prince Manuel Valls has none , they are forced to form a new government , if not the old one has survived the summer .
`` And the new will also survive the autumn or winter , '' said Miss Le Pen against supporters .
She said repeated the reputation of her party after a dissolution of Parliament and that she was confident in early elections and the government ready to emerge as the winner .
The French ruling party suffered a defeat in the local elections in March and the right-wing National Front was the EU elections in May .
A poll in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche showed that 76 percent of French people believe that the Socialist Party is exposed to the risk of disintegrating before the end of Hollande 's 2017 into several rival factions .
Pascal Perrineau , a political scientist at the Sciences Po University , warned that the French would quickly lose patience when the new socialist government not to improve the economy and record unemployment figures .
`` There is a small window of opportunity , but the public must feel quickly that things change , '' he warned .
Otherwise , the situation could deteriorate further .

Tax rises of businessmen in the Washington area with economic recovery
A recovery of the economy means more customers , more sales and new jobs .
It also means higher taxes .
State and local tax rulings for companies in the country rose slightly last year , while accelerating the economic recovery , a new study published last week , and the companies in the Washington area were no exception .
Companies in the District , Maryland and Virginia area jointly paid $ 27.6 billion to state and local authorities in the 2013 financial year , $ 26.6 billion in 2012 , an increase of 3.8 percent compared to the revenue .
State and local tax burden of companies last year rose by 4.3 percent to $ 671 billion , compared to 3.9 percent in the previous year , and it was the third consecutive year of growth after several years of decline in 2009 and 2010 .
Government taxes more than the local taxes rose to 4.3 percent , according to the study , conducted by Ernst & Young service agency with the National Center for taxation , a tax policy group was conducted .
More than half of the tax revenues of the District , 56 percent comes from corporate taxes , compared to 36 percent of the revenue from Mary 's company .
Virginia made with 28 percent of the lowest tax revenue from companies .
A large part of the increase in tax revenue is based on a recovery of the real estate companies , say the researchers , which led to an increase in real estate taxes by 3.7 percent this year after three consecutive years , with growth rates of less than 1 percent .
While a large proportion of these profits from large states like California , New York and Texas , seems to be the end for the Washington area .
Companies in the District , Maryland and Virginia were paying about $ 10 billion in state and local property taxes last year , compared to $ 9.6 billion in 2012 - an increase of 4.2 percent in the course of a year .
But the apparent recovery in real estate values in Maryland is not as effective in improving state and local tax revenues , since the real estate taxes amount to barely more than a fifth of the tax rulings of companies .
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes .
`` In Maryland is happening : a large part of the property , particularly in the tax area , D.C. , is either owned by the government or non-profit organizations that pay no property taxes , '' said Douglas Lindholm , Managing Director of the Center on State Taxation .
Maryland , for example , is therefore forced to rely much more on income taxes , in order to be able to offer the same services that offer the other states .
The recent recovery of tax revenues by companies may not be attributed solely to the recovery of the property market
Corporate revenues also seem to recover , according to the data .
Companies in the region reported on income taxes $ 2.3 billion in state organizations , compared to 2.1 billion in 2012 .
Maryland took $ 1 billion in corporate income taxes , the highest amount in the region .
While the trend in the same direction , does not increase the local tax burden on companies evenly in all three locations .
The increase rate in the District , with 4.3 percent of the national average , while the increase was significantly higher in Maryland , 4.9 percent .
Only Virginia reported a subpar tax of 4.1 percent .
Virginia , with 6 percent in all three areas the lowest corporate income taxes ( in all three there are fixed tax ) .
The corporate tax rate is 8.25 percent in Maryland and the District at a relatively high 9.975 percent .
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year in Virginia that requires lower state and local taxes and a better overall tax climate than in Maryland .
The District was not investigated in the study .
Despite the advantages of Virginia under pressure from its southern neighbours .
North Carolina has adopted laws to reduce its corporate tax rates from 6.9 percent to 6 percent this year , the same sentence as Virginia , and the rate will fall to 5 percent next year .
If the state continues its income targets next year , this law could reduce the state 's corporate income tax rate to 3 percent by 2017 .
In the meantime , the small businesses in the area of Washington seems to be better , and they therefore pay more state and local taxes , the most recent study .
Corporate taxes paid in personal income taxes by small businessmen - a transitional structure on the basis of most small businesses - are organised in the District , Maryland and Virginia last year rose by 20 percent to $ 2.4 billion , a significant faster growth rate than the corporate taxes as a whole .
The researchers say that the trend and the increase in corporate taxes across the country are likely to continue this year , with an increase in general VAT revenue for the state and local governments by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared with the same period last year .
Nevertheless , the region will lag behind Washington , if the spending of the federal government has an impact on the labour market in the region .

Amazon buys Twitch for $ 1.04 billion
Amazon has just confirmed what had reported information on Monday morning : the online retailer and video producer , and a host of other things - Twitch buys the video streaming service for $ 1.04 billion ( US $ 970 million ) .
The announcement comes as a surprise , not because nobody had expected a takeover of Twitch , but because it was widely assumed that the company would buy YouTube .
Three months ago , it looked as if the sale of the Twitch video service from Google for a cool billion , and the cooperation also appeared .
Twitch , which was founded only three years ago when Justin.tv was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube .
Instead , it quickly became a platform for players who wanted their stunts , published in games , `` YouTube for live games , '' says an insider .
The Twitch interface .
And `` let 's play , '' a video genre , in which the know-alls ( mostly older ) give games a veneer of secret science theater , are already very popular on YouTube .
The fact is that YouTube is called often , if you want to describe Twitch , so was the news that wanted to buy YouTube Twitch , recorded a bit bored , a textbook example of an established technology company that buys a potential competitor .
It is a mystery why the deal was not reached with YouTube , since the company was reportedly prepared to pay as much as Amazon .
Everything we currently know about this statement by Emmet Shear , president of Twitch : `` we have opted for Amazon , because they believe in our community , they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us get there faster . ''
Another mystery , frankly , the incredible success of Twitch .
For snobs like me , who say that they prefer sport than watching , it is difficult to understand the attraction , which assumes the games rather than watching others to take even the control console .
It is one thing to look over the shoulder of a friend at 3 o `` clock in the morning , while she creeps through Resident Evil , and quite another to watch a nutcase , as he is shot 20 times in Call of Duty in the head .
Now you could see all these games .
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games , so the watch may be without its own control over the prospect of a really good view recipe for headaches .
I admit that the fast runs in the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age in record time , all games are entertaining .
But as long as it is not a game or humor , virtuoso Twitch channel is not likely to be very interesting .
But what skeptics like me know it ?
Twitch is called by 55 million different visitors a month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic .
And how exactly Amazon wants to make money from it ?
It is hard to imagine that Twitch is integrated so elegantly into Amazon Instant Video , YouTube Twitch could easily swallow .
But Twitch has something that each company would have liked : thousands of young men who are courted by advertisers .
As the chairman of Twitch , Shear , said Amazon and Twitch `` both believe in the future of gaming , '' and the media shows no signs of contraction , or even - schluck - as a spectator sport .

Konstantin the ruthlessly honest memoir
It is actually more philosophical testimony as a biography , Konstantin alarm , singer-songwriter , pacifist , political activist , former prisoner , certainly , `` monk and warrior '' at 287 pages of paper .
Not chronologically , but more thought scraps of ideas , has written on 1 June 1947 in Munich , born in his memoirs , each chapter taken by an appropriate song .
And he is brutally honest : from Onanie during his high school to the shoplifting and drug use , it leaves no human weakness .
Also , to show how he himself has learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow men .
Wide space , but also more abstract concepts : love , soul , ego , Being in the now , spirituality - all of which he is trying to go to the bottom in a very philosophical , but also very personal way .
And he also explained his pacifism , his social criticism , his political commitment - and also how it has shaped not only the music ( the opera lover became the soul and rock musician ) , but also his prison stay .
The latter has brought the ascetic monk , the high-living Konstantin alarm `` by subtraction , '' as he says , `` by omitting everything superfluous . ''
Between all the high spiritual views , there are brief anecdotes on the earth : for example , beatings in a busy restaurant , or a crazy car , which he envisaged as a tree .
Here , too , he is brutally honest .

The hellish year of the survivors of Beslan : ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school , such as the suffering of children today .
Ten years ago , over 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militants at a school in Beslan in Homestead .
More than 330 people , more than half of them children , were killed in the day ordeal that shocked the world .
We have returned to Beslan , in order to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the atrocity in the classroom .
Exactly a decade after the horrific Beslan school siege , in which 334 people were killed , including 186 children , the heroic survivors warned last night before a new apocalypse in Ukraine .
As a fanatical Islamist terrorists , children and parents on September 1 , 2004 , the start of a new academic year , captured and killed , seemed to like the Boeseste of evil .
The tragedy united West and East in disgust , and then surprisingly turned into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery .
Ten years later we have returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the atrocity in the classroom .
We found surprising young people who have overcome the resistance , although the memory of this terrorist hell will pursue them forever .
Their best hope ?
The war that has plagued Ukraine - and the children as they die - is now at an end .
The girl who was photographed in trying to meet the school sports hall zurueckzuklettern
She was photographed by the Russian Star photographer Dimitri Beliakow and famous , when she tried only in their underwear , zurueckzuklettern in the English school sports hall after a mine exploded .
Aida was completely confused after her mother Larissa , now 40 years old .
Both have been left for dead , but they survived .
`` A woman told me that I should run for my life , but I could not , '' said Aida .
My legs were bloodied .
I stood up and climbed again , to search for my mother .
A soldier brought her to safety .
After a series of operations , she was healed completely , but said yesterday : `` three months ago , the pain returned .
I am afraid that I must be operated on again .
Some shrapnel shards are still in my knees .
Their goal is to become a dentist to help the people , as they have been helped by doctors .
`` This tragedy has changed my life , but it has not been broken , '' she says pugnacious .
`` This has happened to me , and that can not be changed .
I always go to the gym once a year to remember those who have stayed there .
My friends and I try not to talk on other days .
The pain is too great .
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there .
We played together , when we were small , and dreamed of going to school together .
`` I do n't want to marry until I finish my studies and my career will begin .
I think a family later .
She says that the siege will always remain a part of it , although the memory of every year something weak .
I am glad that many people in the world , to our horror , and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in Britain and everywhere .
The online photo of me when I see how I zurueckklettere in school , I think that many people see it for the first time , our disaster and help to understand that this does not happen again .
The boy , who fled through the bullets , in the opinion of his mother is dead
It was his first day of school ( Russians go with 7 years in school ) and survived the siege in the arms of his mother Tamara .
When , he said : `` Mama has told me to lie down if there was an explosion , and hold their hand . ''
After an explosion , he thought she would die .
She said to him : `` run . ''
Terrified that it could be dead , he fled and saw on the way to a baby , it took at hand and fled through a hail of bullets .
His father , Vladimir , who completed his son out into the arms , said : `` Damir told me that his mother had died .
He said : `` I could not save them . ''
In reality , Tamara was stumbled outside and leg injuries in the hospital , in turn , on the assumption that her son had died .
After its reunification , she said : `` I wept for joy .
I could n't believe it .
He ran and hugged me .
Damir was flown to London ( from the now dissolved newspaper News of the World ) , by the then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie to receive the title of Barnardo 's Children 's Champion .
`` This horror is following you every day , but I wish I could stop the remembering , '' he said yesterday .
But I can say that it is in my memory .
I know that I then threw all my toy guns .
But now I can play computer games with shot scenes , and that is not a problem for me .
`` I am not afraid to go back into the gym , but I do not think about myself .
I remember these children , with whom I have played in the courtyard , and which have failed .
We never say that they have been killed or are dead .
We say that they have remained in the sports hall .
I remember very well my trip to London , especially in the toy shop , where I could choose everything I wanted , and the journey in an open top car .
But now he is afraid of a place like Ukraine , where wars are causing the kind of accident that he and his friends suffered .
This horror is following you every day , but I wish I could stop to remember .
`` I am so sorry to all those who suffer from the horrors , '' said Damir , worked as a volunteer in a monastery last week .
I am so happy to help .
I hope one day will go to the police and take me to the training academy next year .
His mother Tamara , 48 , said : `` 37 children were killed in our neighborhood , can you imagine that ?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege , there was simply no children who were able to create and run around , and this silence lasted for many months .
She vividly remembers her trip to London with Damir .
The people wept in London , when I told our story .
I then understood how people can understand on the other side of the world our feelings , and show their support .
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the price and the opportunity to travel to London in the autumn of 2004 .
I wish I could call and tell her own Cherie that 10 years have passed , but I still remember the meeting of her and her husband in London , and how the Damir and helped me .
I remember how Damir wanted to eat borsch and they all cried local Russian restaurants .
I remember how he played with waiters in a restaurant . Damir shot with his water gun on them and they ran away and played with him .
And that was just one month after the horror .
I was surprised that the British so readily shared our pain and supported us .
She said : `` I always think that this world is not better in these 10 years .
The war in Ukraine is now , and people are dying every day , and I believe that many children have been killed and killed .
These are precisely the kind of children like ours .
I think that for many of the war is a part of the news that they hear when they are bored or busy with something else .
I know what these people simply feel that the whole horror .
And I ca n't stop it , to feel that .
Nothing has changed , people still want to kill each other and that is so sad .
Damir was great and is a very gentle and quiet boy , he is not at all aggressive or angry .
For example , he is not looking for revenge , he is not overwhelmed by the past horrors .
I know that he does not like it , but he has six close friends from the class and sometimes they go into the gym and ignite candles there .
He suffered when he was small , including - I remember how he sometimes put on the sofa , turned the face of us for hours .
Not sleeping , his eyes were open .
I also remember how he threw all his weapons and other military toys . Damir is now 17 , bigger than me , handsome , intelligent and healthy .
I can hardly believe that I was a few hours so sure he was dead and I would never see him again .
When I came to me after the explosion , and on its feet , I saw myself , and saw the hell around me , with all the body parts .
I was absolutely sure that my little boy could have survived in this hell impossible .
`` I remember that I called him , '' Damir , `` but I was so sure that he had not heard me .
But he has heard it and he ran away .
And so goes the life , unlike many others , for us .
Georgi Ilyin , 17
The boy , whose terrible image after the siege was a symbol of the horrors of Beslan
Consolation : the Beslan survivors Georgi Lyin with his mother , Fatima , 2004 , right after the siege of Georgi today
His blutueberstroemtes face was marked by fear when he ran for his life , while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates .
His image was one of the most shocking symbols for the barbarity of Beslan .
His mother Fatima , 54 , a doctor , had dismissed him for his first day of school before they rushed to get their older son Vladimir to university .
`` I left the court about two minutes before the terrorists stormed it , and my little boy remained there for three terrible days alone , '' she remembers .
Not alone , there was a whole family of relatives of us , but they were all killed .
Only my Georgi managed to survive .
As the date draws nearer , the harder it is to remember and to talk about it .
There is no single day that we do not remember this tragedy .
We do not think that it is a long time ago , I think it would have happened yesterday , I am constantly watching some scenes from these days .
Nobody will ever forget , I promise you .
Urgent : the image of Georgi ( left ) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as a statue ( right ) .
I remember that wanted to go to school , so keen on this day . He said that he wanted to embrace his teacher .
I only knew that he was alive , when I saw him on television .
And now there is even a statue of the weeping Georgi in San Marino .
Georgy does not look like the picture , and it is hidden at home with us on the bookshelf .
I understand that , but I also think that people around the world feel our pain , thanks to this image .
Georgy today says : `` it is important that this can never happen again .
`` I doubt that we ever learn the truth .
People constantly examine such tragedies and never learn the truth .
And now they are investigating the crash of the Boeing in Ukraine .
Will we ever know what caused it ?
The horror of this world becomes something .
`` I can not understand how this is possible , because if you ask the people , nobody wants a war , so how is this happening ?
Ten years is nothing in such pain .
We need dozens of years to forget about it a little bit .
It has attacked my health and I feel it still .
About three or four years I had a few nightmares because of the siege , but then it was better .
Later in 2004 , I went back to school and had scared every day .
I thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed .
That is why I always go to the gym , when the 1th of September .
I want to pay my tribute to my old childhood friends .
It is hard for me to go to the gym , but I have to do it .
I do not feel as victims , this story is now a part of my past .
I will not forget it , but I am not sorry .
My life goes on .
I have concluded the school this year and visit a medical college in Vladikavkaz .
I will be a heart surgeon .
My first choice was a training in the army .
I wanted to be a soldier , but my health did not .
I wanted to fight for my country , but that will not happen .
Georgi Fanijew , 20
The boy , who survived , even though he was caught at the feet of murderous terrorists
A miracle : Georgi Fanijew was trapped during the siege at the feet of a murderous terrorist , but he managed to survive .
During the siege , he was captured in the hall and sat next to the bomb , which was mounted at the feet of murderous terrorists .
It is really a miracle that he was not killed .
`` We feel it as if it were yesterday , '' says Georgi , who wanted to go as an intelligence officer in the FSB , but could not do so because of his health damage due to the siege .
It is still with me , it is nothing that I have left behind me .
I am older now and people say that children can deal easily with terrible experiences - I have to say that is not true .
`` I worked with 2006 psychologists and then actually felt a little better , but I can not forget it .
And I would like to forget .
2005 - the year after - was the first and only time I went back into the gym .
I lost consciousness .
I will never go back there and please do not ask me to show you where I have sat in this famous image .
Philippa : Georgi Fanijew today , with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is enormous and I wear it every day with me .
My friends know that I do not like to think or talk about and they never asked me after school .
Physically , it is good to me .
I should be careful with my injured knee , but I can now run well .
But because of my health , I was unable to study at the FSB secret service academy in Saint Petersburg , as I wanted .
I have my papers submitted to the medical and they replied that it was not possible .
My second passion was the animals , so I went to the veterinary institute .
I have been there two years behind me .
He learns the treatment of all animals , from cats to cows. ``
He said : `` I knew that I would never tell my children from my experience .
Children should not know about it and they should not suffer , of course .
His mother Marina , 42 , said : `` this pain never leaves me .
In my soul , it is worse when the anniversary .
I will go to the celebration of the memory .
I know that will not go in .
It must be even more intense for him , because he was not there and I .
I waited for him at home and could not help .
I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me . All of them are here in Beslan .
It remains to us .
Georgy is now an adult , but he is still in this horror .
It is hard to accept that if something happened to be business-friendly .
He is a boy , he likes sport because of his knee , but he is unable .
He has been operated on several occasions , he can run , but no sport .
I would say that he has overcome the horror of 50 % , but you can never completely overcome and forget .
This terrible experience will always follow .
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the siege and that only reinforces my pain .
I have lost a lot of people who I knew well and were expensive to me .
My son is with me , and that is the greatest gift that God could make me , but my heart cries for the slain .
I know of families in which children were born , but also of widows who have never married .
It is difficult to accept that life goes on , even if this is not .
I will never forget how I jumped in my heart when I saw him in the hospital .
And now I see what is going on in the world - wars in other regions .
These people are fighting for what ?
Why do they kill each other ?
The war is now very close to our country and I can not believe this .
We were a friendly country , how can it be that we are fighting now ?
People are suffering and children , I am sure that many children have been killed in Ukraine and many more are being killed .
If we could only throw up all these rebels - as far away as possible .

Makhar , then three years old , escaped , but Aljonas mother and sister died in the murderous carnage .
Since then , her father Ruslan has married again and with his new wife , Svetlana , a little girl that he called after his lost daughter Kristina .
Aljona , now ten years old , does not remember the siege and has grown into an intelligent and happy girl , neighbors say .

Since crashed , swords , shields , hand-bells and litter lances surrend flew through the arena that could be a fear and worry about the health of the gladiators .
But on the impressive `` summa , '' the muscular referee Rudi , always an attentive eye .
`` We wanted to revive the Roman daily life again and make the culture of Roman life , '' explained Lorenz Euskirchen , chairman of the Friends of Roman organizer `` channel , '' the intention behind the spectacle .
After two years of preparation was from the park for one day a `` oppidum Romanum , '' a Roman city , vice-mayor Claus Wehage said in his address .
Finally , the Romans did not only war and conquest in our region , but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we admire today .
Vestiges of them were also the Roemertag , such as `` marble aqueduct '' from the eleven -metre and 1400 -metre Roman canal bridge that was once at Lueftelberg .
The Frontinus Society was the water and energy once and now , and director Petra Fricke knew : `` we still benefit from the knowledge of that time . ''
It also confirms graduate surveyor Ralph saint of `` engineering Two '' from the Rhine , the Romans surveying instruments such as Chorobat , Groma or Dioptra presented .

We are pleased to be able to respond to this demand and offer the UK 's first luxury travel service for students of today .
In order to achieve a particularly impressive performance at the university , the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft , Rolls-Royce Phantom , Aston Marten or McLaren P1 .
Mr Stewart also admitted that the service was a security division .
This service is an ideal alternative for students who otherwise would have to dump their belongings in a dangerously overloaded car through the country .
Together with our new -start options , we look forward to ensure that this year the students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury .
A company spokesman said that there were no new bookings , just because the service had been introduced , but added that `` the students book service in the next few weeks . ''
The company also stated that it expects a market for this offer , despite the tuition fees of £9,000 per year .
Students today differ greatly in their expectations and demands of the students before 10 , 20 , 30 or 40 years - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression , and never can be .
The National Student Union criticised , but the service .
Megan Dunn , vice-president of the NUS for higher education , said : `` this offer seems completely separate from the lives of the majority of students .
Many students who begin this month with the study , are facing a crisis in the cost of living , because the available financial aid in the form of loans and scholarships with soaring bills for the simplest livelihoods step before they can even think of thousands of pounds for something as simple as the arrival in the hostel .

Ebola : West Africa 's economy burdened the epidemic
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a serious blow to the economy .
Markets are orphaned and international companies are at a distance .
The devastating Ebola epidemic puts a severe blow to the economy of West Africa .
The harvest rots in the fields , the mines are abandoned and orphaned the markets - the virus has afflicted the region difficult .
Some international companies are already at a distance .
`` The Ebola epidemic is not just a medical crisis , but also an economic one , '' the head of the African Development Bank , Donald Kaberuka .
Liberia is the hardest hit
`` It is a total disaster , we are losing a lot of money , '' says Alhaji Bamogo , who sold on the second largest market in Liberia 's capital Monrovia .
Anyone who wants to buy food only comes on the market , or something to disinfect against Ebola .
Liberia has been hardest hit by the virus , alone , fell victim to the fever of more than 600 people .
Health officials recently declared that the disease had penetrated every corner of the country .
The virus has spread in Guinea , Sierra Leone and Nigeria .
A total of more than 1500 people have died , thousands more are stuck in .
Draw employees from foreign firms
Everywhere in the resource-rich countries put companies out of business .
Foreign companies such as ArcelorMittal , the steel industry and their employees , several international airlines fly to the affected regions .
Also , the local traders and farmers respond : only a few merchants still leave their homes in order to obtain supplies .
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia , which are under quarantine , among other things , the rot for the export of major cocoa and coffee beans in the fields .
The farmers do not dare to leave their homes for the harvest .
Food is scarce
`` People are travelling less and less , '' says Phillipe De Vreyer , Paris expert for the economy of West Africa .
The man , for example , usually goes on the market and sold his vegetables , prefers to stay at home .
The population gets so directly the consequences of the epidemic and urgent : food is scarce .
In the markets , the supply of basic foodstuffs such as rice .
At the same time , the threat of damage - a region heavily dependent on international firms with far-reaching consequences .
The greatest danger is that international companies avoid the area for a long time , basically , says Philippe Hugon from the French think tank Iris .
The key is how far and how long it will spread the virus .
If investors could give the impression that `` it is dangerous to live in Guinea , Sierra Leone and Liberia and invest , '' warns Hugon .
It also affects the strained state budgets of the Member States
The disease also burdened the already strained state budgets of the countries concerned .
The credit rating agency Moody 's feared that their budgets are being stretched by high spending on the health system and in addition to the worsening economy .
The African Development Bank has already pledged to the health systems of the countries concerned with 60 million dollars ( 45 million euros ) to help .
The effects are already being felt in Nigeria , where only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed so far .
It is not affected by the oil-rich region in the southern Niger Delta .
But elsewhere , many people remain at home for fear of contagion .
Reservations in hotels go back significantly .

Synomymous after second win of the season three th place in the table .
With the 2:0 on a grim week for Rapid , has taken a positive end on Sunday .
`` The victory is very liberating , '' said coach Zoran Barisic , whose team had reached with the training in the Europa League on Thursday between a deep .
`` The sense of achievement was incredibly important , '' and the captain Steffen Hofmann , who confirmed the three th green and white .
Schrammel - Traumtor brings Rapid on season-opener Rapid has shown with the second season the right response to the disappointment of Helsinki and comes with a sense of achievement in the break .
`` We wanted to show a positive reaction , '' said foreign defender Thomas Schrammel , with its splendid leadership volley from Sechzehnereck asked in the 14th minute to set the course for victory .
`` I thought I was up all the frustration of Thursday and schnalzte it under the bar , '' said the 26-year-old smiling .
As Schrammel Novmember had taken on the 13th so far in 2010 , the last time in a Bundesliga game , was for Ried .
The first championship match in Rapid Dress will therefore remain in special memory .
`` For me this is something special , I am from the rapid generation , '' said Schrammel .
Due to the short-term basin - Blessur Schrammel Mario Pavelic , from the left to the right defensive side and also made it very well .
He has enough experience that he can exercise this position as well .
He has earned the gate he has done several assists this year , `` praised Barisic .
Team shows character Schrammel also supplied the flank of 2:0 by Hofmann after a hour , which finally made the decision .
Because before the guests could also write .
`` Thank God we had some luck , '' said Schrammel , alluded to the divergence of performance and result in the last few weeks : `` the results did not vote , but the Spielerische was always good in comparison to last year . ''
Barisic even found that `` in many games before - was better than today , '' against `` the strongest team that has played in this stadium this season . ''
The first Dreipunkter since 26 July have therefore proved that despite the setbacks , the team structure intact : `` my team has shown today that it has character . ''
Less pleasing for him : `` we have finally played back to zero . ''
The fact that too much work while Sestak with Brian Behrendt , Mario Pavelic , Christopher Dibon , Deni , and Michael Schimpelsberger are multiple failures , and Srdjan Grahovac , Stefan Stangl and Philipp be pushed to their Startelfdebuets , make the victory even more valuable .
`` We must not forget that , '' warned Barisic , who lost in the past three days with Behrendt and Pavelic players , `` who were very stable in recent times . ''
The play-offs should thus be used to `` lick wounds and move up in the physical area a bit , '' said Barisic , who has five U21 - selection of players in its ranks .
One of the suits , perhaps , is captain of Hofmann 's break .
It is for the team that goes beyond pain .
In this difficult phase , he has shown that he is a very important player for us , `` noted Barisic .
Hofmann gave the game Rapids before his replacement in the 68th minute , not only the structure , but also achieved the second goal .
For the 33 -year-olds , who completed his 350th Bundesliga game , it was the first hit of the game since November 2 , 2013 ( 4:2 on Admira ) .
Hofmann : `` must not believe that everything is good '' `` we have certainly had a bit of luck , but eventually the luck must come back to us , too .
Now it was high time , `` said Hofmann .
But he warned : `` we must see to it , not always black and white .
We have not played so badly in recent weeks , as has been stated .
We can not believe that everything is fine .
The importance of its role in the team could not deny it .
It is a very young team , which I can help at the moment .
In certain periods , but to me , `` said Hofmann .
The coach Michael Baur and his team had little .
He regretted the quick against Zaubertor hits `` from the category , '' as well as the regular gate of utility in the 40th minute , which was denied by referee Koll Egger .
The only criticism I can make the team is that we were not specific enough towards Tor in some phases .
Since we have had too few qualifications .
Striker Maximilian Karner was similar : `` it has just started badly , but then we have found and even made a gate .
By and large , would have been better .

On the bouncy castle at the castle garden festival was on Saturday .
The concept of the organizer .
Despite the strong downpours on Saturday evening an estimated 1200 fans came to the open-air festival in the castle garden .
The admission had to be stopped temporarily .
`` It was annoying , '' said Ron Shem , one of the organizers .
Salzwedel l light and fun .
Two Spanish words have formed the name Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem Amula .
Because the Open Air in the Salzwedeler castle garden will radiate brightness on the day and evening through various shows .
Well , and the fun comes from alone anyway .
This was demonstrated early Saturday , when the first visitors to the open air .
The organizers had promised a feast for all generations .
And they succeeded .
Around the supply at the castle garden , it had also made Salzwedeler , guests from the near future .
They pursued the first live performances , wippten with the foot of the beat , enjoyed cool drinks - in short , were called for relaxation and enjoyment .
And across the generations .
While the luemmelten on blankets on the extra angekarrten white sand at the beach bar , labten others at a quarter of wine in the wine , the offspring raged on the bouncy castle , which was a great attraction for the smaller guests .
But even in the face of the volunteers had their hands full in the truest sense of the word to the crowd , and to conjure up imaginative creations into the little faces .
Adults used the kicker tables or took part in a skateboard workshop , the crew of the good foot from Salzwedel .
Until the big rain came .
Shortly before 17.30 p.m. rubberpussy he settled on visitors , especially families sought the vastness and nests .
But this did not diminish the attractiveness of the festival .
`` There were more people than expected , '' said Ron Shem , a `` success on the line . ''
That is why I am a repeat of the big party in the coming year , nothing .
Although it has to be worked on the content and size of the events , Sem made on Sunday in a first assessment to the popular vote .
He described as annoying that the admission had to be stopped .
Obviously , the security company had been booked with too few forces .
The result : some who had already paid , were no longer on the site .
The response was very good .
In a first tentative estimate , said the Salzwedeler co-organizer of about 1200 visitors , the contrast in the castle garden .
There were problems with the sound .
The Salzwedeler hip-hop band Blocks `` n '' Rox broke their appearance so unnerved .
The technicians were unable to create a reasonably sensible sound .
The planned shisha lounges could be built , because the tents could not be brought because of a puncture after Salzwedel .
`` But they will be next year , '' says the organiser .
The premiere of the Amula Open Airs was succeeded by the number of visitors .
And in bad weather .
However , the organizers have committed some errors that will be the first time , but must be eliminated at the second edition .
On the social network Facebook , the organizers critique .
`` Sorry , but for twelve euros , we expected more , '' says Melanie Meier on the events page .
`` Unfortunately , you 've taken a little bit , '' says Ele Zimmermann at the same point .
Others do not see the initial problems so closely .
I think it is very good that some people are not only stupid , but also really try to do something on their feet .
Hats off ! , `` writes Stephanie Jenß for Amula .
Now the organizers a year to these criticisms .

The village comes back from the handball team
Holger Glan village will no longer play for the DHB team .
The 31-year-old from the SG Flensburg Handewitt led to this decision - especially health problems .
The decision was not easy for me , it is matured for several months .
It is time for me to listen to my body signals and to end my career in the national team , `` said the 2007 World Champion on his Facebook page .
It is therefore with a record of 167 matches and 576 goals for Germany in international retirement .
Because it wants to go to roll back massive space players for the Champions League winner from Flensburg , a few years on the hunt , he is not the new national coach Dagur Sigurd son .
The Icelanders , who on Tuesday announced his squad for the internationals against Switzerland , led the village a `` long and good conversation .
I have been equally enthusiastic about his ideas and approaches , as they will inspire my longtime players and my successors .
But for my club , I would also be available to healthy over the next few years , longer regeneration breaks are needed that does not permit the current double burden .

He was due to Achilles problems of team doctors of the German handball federation ( DHB ) can be treated with a Cortisonspritze , which triggered a strong inflammation .
This was followed by emergency and two other interventions .
Then the village announced a lawsuit against the team doctor , the confrontation ended with a comparison .
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team career go to any body without trace .
I have some health sites , which I can no longer ignore .
After the three foot operations caused infection , 2012 at short intervals , I 've got my blood pressure never properly under control .
Some others come to wear conditional complaints .
At the beginning of the year , I noticed that I control my head , but my body ca n't be fooled , `` said the village in an interview with Time magazine . ''
He would be ready for a comeback only in absolute emergencies .
`` If I 'm always willing to discuss it , '' said the father of the magazine .
I can not , however , the years in which I can still play handball , the fingers of one hand .
I must also say that I am also quite humble after my long hospitalization in 2012 , when it comes to my health .
In my career , I would like to go at least to some extent .

Children need roots and wings
He was a teacher for 44 years , 23 as head of the school .
This time , Manfred Richter knows many of Peter 's house , and Koll , from their time as a student .
His methods were sometimes unconventional , but always in his quest to see the people in the school .
The Snezka is the most famous mountain in the Giant Mountains .
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif from his home .
Richter was born in 1930 , northern Bohemia , Trutnov today .
In 14 , he was interested in the teaching profession after four years of secondary school .
One year later , the Sudeten Germans were expropriated .
Within half a hour , the family had to leave their house .
After a few months in a camp in Bavaria , it was 1946 - in the freight car .
So judges staggered into the Upper Franconian lower village .
The teacher training took place in Bamberg , Germany .
Manfred Richter had to run ten miles six times a week to the next station , take the train to Bamberg , three kilometres across the entire city and go back to school .
After two months , got Manfred Richter in a Red Cross home in Bamberg a sleeping : along with up to 15 students in a dormitory .
In 1951 he made the first and 1954 candidates after three years of teaching the second exam .
Because he was not free to teachers , he applied to Upper Bavaria and came to the school in the creek on 1 November 1954 .
The `` Miss Room '' was his first `` service '' in the school .
In 1958 he was referring to the house next to the school teacher , a three -room apartment service .
This house bought Manfred Richter , 1980 , after the school was dissolved in 1968 , Bach .
In the meantime , there was a school association Peter Bach - Koll Bach , three classes and Peter , five .
From the school in 1968/69 , Peter , in today 's town hall .
When it was founded in the Indian village school association , remained the primary school in the village .
In order to avoid demotion in the smaller school , according to Karl , the former rector of Georg Sigl and Manfred Richter was his successor .
But Peter grew , and so could the children and their teachers from September 1982 , the current building , which was expanded in 1997 after Judge retirement .
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor Ludwig Goetz , a workroom at community costs and in the expansion of 1997 cellars built , although that was not eligible under the guidelines for school buildings .
`` Mayor Goetz was very friendly , '' recalled school judges .
Throughout his career , Manfred Richter has never forgotten the speech of a government representative , who had responded to a school on law and justice : `` we must never forget the love . '' Manfred Richter set up what he had heard as a young teacher .
`` We need to give the children two things : roots and wings , '' says the 84 -year-old .
And he had to learn : `` do not always succeed . '' Whether he means to his students or just his own six children , is not entirely clear .
In any case , the judge was sometimes unconventional .
If they are students , he got a criminal work and were not ordered to sit .
At the expense of the community , judges had to buy two pairs of boxing gloves and left the two sides against each other , even if there should be a violet .
For the good of the school of judges as rector of a good relationship with the former mayor Ludwig Götz ( CSU ) .
This moved the French judges after his retirement to last at least 1996 candidates on the CSU list for the municipal council .
But the judge was selected in six and joined the CSU .

Under this , there is a stillness
We showed a powerful tribe in our series `` my piece of the puzzle for the summer Rhoener happiness '' last Friday .
There are several of these giant trees in the county , the copy is the `` Geißruheiche '' above the white Brunn .
A bumpy walk leads up to the 600-year-old oak .
It is past the piles of stone and basalt , basaltic rock seas .
A little below the quarry from the mountain , one kilometre north of the road to Weisbach , because it is .
Vitality provides the natural monument , it stands on the environment , and other trees with a volume of over eight metres to an American sequoia .
A small Buddha on a tree stump suggests that it is a spiritual or mystical place .
But despite intensive research , there were only references to the name of origin .
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has consulted the Bischofsheim archives and interviewed older people from among white , to discover the explanation it has with the Geißruheiche .
His findings remained a rather sober explanation for the name .
Until about 80 years ago , the goat shepherd should have driven their animals from the white , from the laboriously cleared rocks and liberated meadows .
At the foot of the tree should have rested on the ascent exhausted animal guardians .
Meanwhile , the area has won back its importance , because actually , goats graze in the meadows .
The area has been declared in addition to the Biosphere Reserve , Schneider has discovered .
Entering the stone collections must be careful though , because the rehashed basalt from the sun is also a popular place for cross otters .
A path leads from the white , to the tree , but something is hidden .
Other ways are signposted , the direction of Rhoen and invite to an extended hike .
Where does the Wasserburg ?
An outing that is sought in our next task is to find the rare height .
The reflection in the trench is a good impression of the building , but we have some historic buildings in the county , which could fit in the building .
Where is our `` Rhoener piece of happiness '' ?

His pickup truck , in which he communicated via three telephones and a radio with his staff and the 15 -strong motorcycle police squadron Hessen , Facebook entries and wrote reports , also needed a check .
`` The majority of participants from the Rhine-Main area , '' he said , `` but also from Gießen or Fulda , from Lauterbach or the Taunus and even from many cities in Westphalia travelled cyclists .
The number of participants is a bit of the available accommodation capacities .
In Category I , the participants will be accommodated in hotels , in Category II in collective accommodation .
The cyclist from the resort had a good impression when they departed after a hour and a half : `` bye ! ''
`` It was beautiful in the salt bath ! '' They lifesaver good-bye .
After arriving in Scotland , the group was allowed to take a brief respite .
But in the evening , the cyclists were claimed in the idyllic old castle park .
Under the direction of Schott 's company for tourism and Stadtmarketing ( GTS ) , the park had a beautiful festival atmosphere and , of course , we had some tart prepared with chilled white feather .
Mayor Susanne Schaab , GTS - Managing Director Markus Hoßfeld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner - Sachs in his capacity as a member of the board of the ADAC Hessen-Thüringen welcomed the visitors .
The three were visibly pleased about the `` many operations in Scotland . ''
DJ Tobias Hagen then gave the dance stage .
The opportunity for a moving outdoors despite the sporting activity was used on the bike .
Among the guests were increasingly citizens who were charmed by the good mood as well as the large number of cyclists .
On the second day , the cyclists were the stations Birstein , Guardian Bach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the Trenkwaldern - on the program .
Yesterday , after 180 kilometres of excited , the athletes met again in Bad Vilbel .

The initial reception of refugees in Harburg is bursting at the seams .
Now the agency has set up three tents of the Red Cross .
Politicians were informed shortly before the district - they are not pleased .
`` These quick-fix actions continue to foment public reservations and give the politicians a chance to participate constructively in the humane accommodation of refugees , '' says about Britta Herrmann , chairman of the Greens in the Harburg district assembly .
Her party is demanding that the District Harburg currently unused houses for accommodation .
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents .

At full speed at the club , run the preparations for the 50-year-old foundation from 12 to 14 September .
It is planned on Friday , September 12 , a large entertainment evening with the group `` village rockers . ''

Then the mood is in the large marquee evening , with the `` STOA Palatine Buam . ''
Brass band provides the music
Highlights on Sunday , and 9.30 are in the parish church and the great procession at 14 pm .
The afternoon is also the federal and Gauschießens prize-giving .
A pretty sight will be the 25 ladies with their Dirndln .
The chapel is the brass band festival Berngau .
The mayor took over Wolfgang Wild and State Secretary Albert for Acker .
The original name of `` protecting society fir Berngau '' dates from 1907 , when on March 21 , the `` social entertainment through exercise in the room , and small-bore shooting '' was founded .
The Nazi regime had led to the dissolution of the association in 1937 .
Only 1964 of the 19 young men have found that on 30 April at the inn , the `` new '' club `` fir '' have lifted Berngau .
Karl March and Adolf Ried led the club to protect master through a difficult period in which it was mainly to find a club and install the shooting operation .
In the autumn of 1965 , started the club in the inn `` flax , '' with two teams in the round competitions .
In subsequent years , the marksmen were organized in seven teams , in all classes up to the 1th Gauliga .
The club records poured every year and the magic threshold of 380 rings for the first time in 1980 was achieved by Rudi Meier .
So how have increased the efficiency of active shooters , the membership have evolved positively .
After the `` club '' is no longer sufficient to meet the needs of a modern marksman , the Board has decided , under the leadership of Johann Rinn , in the cellar of the new `` Landgasthof Teis , '' to create a future domicile .
After a performance of 2700 hours on May 8 , 1988 , pastor of the church 's blessing for the new protected areas .
One of the great highlights of Ngata was the 44th Gauschießen , coupled with the solemn consecration of the new protect flag in July 1991 .
On the 23th and 24th of April 1994 , the club celebrated its 30th anniversary .
The group was founded in 1995 .
Joseph was a young officer .
A major challenge for the `` Boll '' and for the club as a whole was the orientation of the Bavarian meeting of 2005 .
In many hours of volunteer work over the past year , the association 's members have modernised the rooms and the shooting facility in Berngauer Hof and brought to the state of the art .
Eleven teams in round competitions
I can also see the sporting achievements of the marksman .
A total of eleven teams are taking part in the round competitions : six air rifle teams , an air gun team , a sport pistols kk1 , a youth and two AH teams .
The 1th team with Lars Ellrich , Katharina Ellrich , Steffi degrees and Kerstin Keller man is in the round of 2013/14 by the highest league in Schuetzengau Gauoberliga ( TOS ) , in the District League 1 .

In addition to the shooting of events like Bock stand , Faschings-Redouten and King Ball , club and Christmas tradition .
With the shooter in the celebrations in parish and community .

Exclusive extract from Howard Jacob 's hochgelobtem new novel about love and the letter `` J . ''
You zerflossen , so the best way to describe it , it could be resolved slowly , like a cardboard box , which has been in the rain .
Occasionally , a woman told him that he was too serious , demanding , intense , scratching , and perhaps a little brush .
And then he shook their hands .
The brush , he knew .
He was stachelig , such as hedgehogs , yes .
The last victim was just starting this Stacheligkeit affair , which has been promising to alleviate the boredom of his life than he would have otherwise , and perhaps even a degree of satisfaction .
Ailinn solo Mons was a delicate beauty with untamed hair and a fluttering heart trembling from a village on the North Island , which was even more remote and rough than Port Reuben .
It came with an older accompaniment to the south , considered the Kevern for her aunt , and had inherited a plot in a damp but heavenly valley with the aptly named Paradise Valley .
Over several years , no one had lived in the house .
The pipes were in the water baths were still spiders , slugs had left their mark on all windows and believed that they belong to all of this , and the garden was overgrown with weeds that looked like giant cabbage .
It was like the house from a children 's story , both menacing and enticing , a garden full of secrets .
Portrait of the author : Howard Jacobson , whose novel `` J '' is on the list for the Man Booker Prize in 2014 .
The shortlist will be announced next week .
Ailinn Kevern had sat with hands on the broken chairs in the high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon . Both had joined in the spirit of service console , which supplied the country with soothing music and soothing news than the sight of the brown legs reminded him of an old song of a long-forgotten black entertainer , happy his father had closed shutters in the house .
Your feet are too big .
On the basis of their own aggressive songs of this kind were not played on the console .
Not banned - nothing was forbidden - simply not played .
It has been successfully obsolesziert obsoleszieren as the word .
In the general taste , which had never managed decrees and regulations , and how the people in the books From the dishwasher - for a millionaire - memoirs , novels , cookbooks and love for the music they chose the ballads .
In the euphoria of the day Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and sing in a coarse comic serenade Ailinns big feet .
Ailinn did not understand this .
`` This was a well-known song of a jazz pianist named Fats Waller , '' he said , and automatically presented two fingers to his lips .
His father had done to stop the letter J , before he came out of his mouth .
It began as a game between him and his father , when he was still small .
His father had played it with his own father , he had told .
If you have a word with a J start without two fingers on your lips , it will cost you a penny .
Even then , it was not a very fun game , and even now it was not very funny .
He knew that this was all that was expected of him .
It had to explain what jazz was .
What Ailinn had never heard .
Jazz was , even though he was not directly prohibited , not played .
The improvisation was no longer fashionable .
There was only room for one `` if '' in life .
The people wanted to be quite sure where it would end up at the beginning of a melody .
Likewise , the mind .
His unpredictability made people nervous .
And jazz was musically expressible mind .
Although he was 10 years old , without being heard by Sammy Davis Junior , Kevern knew something about jazz from the semi-secret collection of old CDs of his father .
But at least he had to explain Ailinn that Fats Waller was black .
They probably could not remember her age at a time when the pop singers were not black .
Again , no laws or constraints .
A compliant society meant that each element of this company agreed to the principle of groups like the talent - and grateful to fate .
African-American people of Caribbean origin were suited by temperament and conformation for entertainment and sports , so they sang and ran .
People who originally came from the Indian subcontinent , were blessed by nature with electronic talent and were charged with ensuring that no family was left without a functioning telephone service .
What was left of the Polish community , took care of the sewage system ; what was left shattered by the Greeks .
Those from the Gulf and the Levant , whose grandparents had left the country soon as WHAT HAPPENED IF THERE IS WAR , WAR happened - for fear of being accused of Feuerschuerens , fearing that the flames would consume the next - had opened Labneh and shisha pipes - restaurants , were given and were depressed by inaction .
Each according to his abilities .
Since she had heard Ailinn only ballads , it was difficult to understand how the insulting words which had her Kevern , could be just as ever .
Music was an expression of love .
`` We are not really offensive , '' said Kevern .
Except perhaps for people whose feet are too big .
My father has never insulted anyone , but he loved this song .
He talked too much , but the neglected garden gave him a false sense of security .
Nothing could overcome the soundproofing of the giant cabbage leaves .
Ailinn still not understood .
Why your father should have something to love ?
He wanted to say that there was a thump , but hesitated to put two fingers on the lips in their presence .
They already thought that he was a little strange .
`` It appeared to him instead , '' he said .
She shook her head in disbelief and kept Keverns view .
There was nothing else in the world to see their ungekaemmtes raven black hair .
There was nothing that he otherwise would want to see .
`` If you say it , '' they mean without conviction .
But this does n't explain why you vorsingst me .
She seemed genuinely concerned .
My feet are too big ?
He saw again .
Your feet are not directly .
Maybe your ankles , a little bit ...
And you say you hate me , because my ankles are too thick ?
You hate ?
Of course , I do not hate you .
This is just the silly song .
He could have said `` I love you , '' but it was still too early .
`` Your thick ankles are exactly the reason why you think , '' he tried it instead .
I am a bit perverse .
That was not correct .
It was meant to be funny .
When he tried to be funny , he was often in trouble because he did not like his father about the soothing charm , needed to restrain the cruelty inherent in jokes .
Perhaps his father also wanted to be cruel .
Perhaps he wanted to be the Kevern .
Despite his friendly eyes .
Ailinn solo Mons was red and arose out of her chair , threw the console and buried the wine that they had drunk .
Elderberry flower wine , so it was no excuse for drunkenness .
They seemed to tremble in their excitement , such as palm fronds in the storm .
`` And your thick head is exactly the reason why I am perverse to you , '' she said .
Except that I am not at all .
It did him tired , both because of the unnecessary cost of his words as well as the fear that was demonstrated in their eyes when they rebelled against him .
She thought that he would beat them ?
She had not told him of the life on the cold northern archipelago , where she was raised , but he had no doubt that it was essentially as here .
The same huge and icy ocean broke here and there on the shore .
The same men who have been confused with a thicker skin and verdrießlicher , WHAT HAPPENED TO WAR than were their ancestors as smugglers and wreckers , went from pub to pub , always ready to raise a hand against a woman who refused or derided .
Thick head ?
It would have shown her a thick fist when they do n't care !
They only canoodle - Deathstar was the word most often used for an erotic attraction between men and women , an antidote to the bland love ballads from the console - and then they laughed .
The Keverns view was an unnecessary refinement , as was the Deathstar itself an act of violence .
Ailinn solo Mons gave him to go through her body a sign .
He arose from the deckchair as an old man .
She also felt bleiern , but she was surprised by the ferocity of his grief .
That was not the end of the world .
They hardly knew , however .
She saw him on how he removed as from a room on the upper floor of their companion - a man who complained to him by what he had created himself .
Adam leaves the garden , she thought .
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general , although some had raised their hands against them .
A man , she turned back , ashamed to be defeated without fighting spirit - why was this a sight seemed to know them well , if they could not remember a single time , but they had seen something before the day before ?
When she was alone again , looked Ailinn solo Mons on her feet .
A number of years before the events worked just told Esme Nussbaum , an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher commissioned by Ofnow , the non-legislative body for the public mood , in a brief presentation on the continued violence on low and middle level in the areas of the country where the reduction , if not abolished , will most likely have been expected , given the money and energy that had been invested in the eradication of violence .
`` A lot done , and much still needs to be done , '' she wrote , `` to appease the innate aggressiveness of a people that had a thousand wars and won most of them , especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country , where the sweet breath of human kindness historically seen despite the towering spires between the hedges was rarely felt .
But some properties are ineradicable .
The higher the steeple , it seems , the less the passion that he continues to inspire .
The people weep when listening to sentimental ballads , enthralled claims to overcome difficulties and stories about the virtues of marriage and family life , but does not believe only the former rudeness of rural communities , as well as our urban fabric firmly in the hands , but there is also evidence of the emergence of a new and insidious argument is looking at home , at work , on the streets and even on the playing fields .
`` You have an unfortunate tendency to exaggeration , '' said her mentor , when he had read the entire report .
I suggest that you read less novels .
ESME Nussbaum lowered her head .
I must also ask : are you atheist ?
`` I think I have to say , '' said Esme Nussbaum .
Are you a lesbian ?
Esme was once again on their right to privacy and refusal to testify .
Feminist ?
Again silence .
`` I am not asking this , '' said Luther Rabinowitz , finally , `` because I would be against atheism , Lesbentum or feminism .
This is a prejudice free workplace .
We serve a prejudice free society .
But certain types of hypersensitivity that are absolutely unacceptable and commendable in itself , can occasionally results , as you have presented to distort them .
You obviously have prejudices against the church , and these things that you describe as `` cowardly '' and `` raw '' could be interpreted by others as well , of course , as an expression of strength and vitality .
If you ride around on WHAT IS IF THERE IS , as if it would have happened if it had happened yesterday , means the country 's essential vitality .
ESME Nussbaum looked around , while Rabinowitz said .
Behind his head repeated a LED sticker in Flamingo pink Ofnow the advice that gave the country in the last quarter of a century or more .
Smile , you appreciate their neighbors , their partners , listen to ballads , visit musicals , use your phone , you talk , you listen , you agree to apologize .
Speaking is better than silence , the song is better than the written word , but nothing is better than love .
`` I understand completely what you want , '' said Esme Nussbaum with a quiet voice , when she was sure that her boss had spoken to an end , `` and I say that we are not yet healed as effective as we delude ourselves .
My concern is that we find ourselves without warning , perhaps , as we repeat the mistakes in the first place , IF THERE IS THIS WHAT IS .
This time , however , it is not others where we miss our anger and our mistrust .
Luther Rabinowitz , a pyramid with hands .
In order to indicate a patient .
`` They go too far , '' he said , `` if you act as a '' mistake `` that our grandparents may or may not have committed .
They also go too far when you say that their `` anger '' and their `` mistrust '' of `` others '' had left out .
It should not really be necessary to remind someone in your position that we understand the past , such as the protection of the present , not by `` us '' and `` other . ''
There was no `` we '' and there was no `` other . ''
It was a time of disorder , that is all we know .
`` If we are honest with ourselves , '' dared to Esme , `` no part of society can claim to have behaved well .
I accuse anybody .
Whether it was done badly or well , what has happened has happened .
That was then .
Nothing more needs to be said - we are all agreed .
And just as no blame must be assigned , it must be repaid , not to blame , if such a repayment would be appropriate and if there were a way to eradicate it .
But what if we do not learn from the past -
The past is that we forget them .
If I may say something about that -
Luther Rabinowitz did coincide his pyramid .
`` I will remember her report , '' he said , and dismissed them .
The next day , when she went to work as usual , was run over by a motorcyclist , who , as passers-by described , in a kind of `` brutal rage '' was driven onto the footpath .
There are coincidences .

Lenny Henry : my father never took me in the arm .
Never said `` I love you ''
Henry was one of seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958 .
His father , who died when Henry was 19 , worked in a factory and their relationship was limited .
Henry , Rudy 's Rare Records for a comedy , which is based partly on an imaginary conversation with his father and was born out of the series on Radio 4 .
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap , with lively melodies .
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments .
He attended many `` therapies '' after the death of his mother , and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father .
It was difficult to know him .
We never saw his face , his voice only heard : `` listening to the noise .
Let thy sister in peace .
LU2300 !
I want to watch cricket .
My older brothers , Seymour and Hilton - who were already grown up when I was a child - went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of cricket .
I have never had such a conversation with him .
A large part of my life , he was a serious guy in the corner , read the newspaper .
Henry recently opened a foundry in Dudley , and although the conditions are better than at the time of his father , he gained an insight into how life was for him to be liked .
It is a little brighter , but they are dark , smoky , deep Stygian maze with a lot of soot and smoke and flame surges .
My father used to be presented in the tub and then you could hear him slowly , as he began to sing , because he could wash the foundry .
When I went around there , I realized that he had done so for years to get the food on the table , and my respect for him has been greater .
However , Henry grew up as a child without the love of his parents .
My father never hugged me , he never said `` I love you . ''
Only when my mother was ill at the end of their lives , we started , `` I love you , I love you , I love you '' to say .
By his own daughter Billie , with Dawn French , he shared the love that he had missed as a child .
Could you stop with the `` I love you '' ?
But listening to hug me !
Dad , I 'm 22 !
With Dawn French .
Why should we not be friends ?
It is a great mother .
It is still friends with French , he was married 25 years .
Dawn is a good man .
Why should we not be friends ?
It is a great mother .
Henry 's own mother was diabetic .
This contributed to her death .
When I was so very , very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes , my doctor said `` you have to be radical .
So I moved this fitness thing through and had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms .
It is very difficult .
And it is exhausting .
Nobody likes to eat carrots .
Henry 's career change may be seen in his elegant , short cut .
Since he has been praised by critics for his Othello , he is captured by the theater .
It was followed by The comedy of errors , and then , by August Wilson .
That is a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that have filled his busy working life .
He started with only 16 years when he was working in a factory .
A DJ discovered him on the stage when he wrote to New Faces and imitation people about him .
His television career began in the mid seventies . `` I was for a long time the only black imitator / comedian on TV . ''
He learned at work .
I had to be not just great in the eyes of the public , but also learn from 1975 to 1985 , as I tell all the jokes could be an efficient machine , while I was a TV star , and that was really difficult .
Lenny 1975 New Faces
Since his manager had the right to stage the Black and White minstrel show , a light entertainment programme , in which the people `` black , '' said Henry anmalten his comedy there over five years .
My family was very unpleasant .
I wish somehow that it never would have happened , but I do not regret that I have done .
It was a strange , uncomfortable position for me , but I was working on giant projects and learned how to deal with a large audience .
But these `` years of award-winning light pillar of the British TV '' was also a `` grotesque parody of black people . ''
Through the introduction of characters that the British black culture both celebrated and scorned , Henry worked on an alternative comedy circuit in the eighties .
The first series of the Lenny Henry Show was broadcast in 1984 , and in the nineties he was the chef Gareth Black Lock in the comedy series boss ! .
Advertising , documentaries , TV series and in the next decade , but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv 2008 , he thought : `` what are you doing next , Len , because it feels all the time , or only as you stomp on the spot . ''
Then came a documentary series for Radio 4 , entitled What 's So Great About ... ?
The first episode was about Shakespeare .
I was downright allergic to Shakespeare .
I had never really learned in school about him and held him mainly for a domain of the middle class , white tights and a cabbage in front of it .
So I had a great fear .
All those we interviewed for the show , Peter Hall , Trevor Nunn , Adrian Lester , said Judi Dench , `` you should try it .
It is not bad , if you do n't know what you are talking .
Put a couple of words in the mouth , and then you will understand why we all love Shakespeare .
Henry led 20 lines from Othellos last speech for the documentary , and he was thrilled .
I had the feeling that I was able to do this .
It was almost as if someone put me at the head .
`` That is , it is a serious thing to take them seriously , and your text , a bit chaotic .
The samples were brutal , and I read this piece for months before we made it .
And it was a success .
They seemed to expect a car accident , and that simply did not happen .
And soon he appeared in the comedy of errors .
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it .
There was a moment when I thought , `` oh , you 've changed yourself . '' ``
There was a technical error and Henry felt instinctively that he had to entertain the audience .
`` A small voice told me '' you have to bridge now 10 minutes , while they fix the computer. `` ''
Instead , the stage director , announced that the idea would continue once the problem was solved .
I went to the stage and said something in me , `` oh , thank God . ''
I am not responsible .
I can leave it to someone else .
`` You are playing in a play , so stick to your role . ''
Henry , at the Duchess Theatre
The text was to learn for the ambitious .
Panic is very good , which strengthens the sinew .
It was also good , so it is like a big sign of the Gods , `` this is your destiny . '' ``
He says this , of course , with a DONNERNDEN voice .
So I maintain .
I love that .
I love being in a sample .
Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is criss-crossed by humorous outbursts , while he imitates people .
I have decided not to make a stand-up comedy , because I think that this kind of instant satisfaction from a room full of strangers somehow dangerous .
If you look at it constantly , from a wall .
I am sometimes live at the Apollo , if I wish to do so , but overall there is not so much as before .
I ask him whether he will ever make a stand-up comedy tour .
The fun that I have in a room with a director who helps a beginning , a middle and the end of a journey - I do not think I would ever give up .
So here is his new incarnation ?
I think it is .
I am an actor .
It 's fun .
It always tells a story , and that is great .
I love stories .
The people love stories .

Merkel speaks to toll Word : `` quite clearly ''
Now the Chancellor once again clearly committed to it .
But it is not a licence for all the complicated details .
Persistent concerns from the CDU , the CSU wroth have against the car toll .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke after prolonged resistance from their CDU foot for the introduction of a car toll .
`` Let me be very clear : it is in the coalition agreement , and they will come , '' said the party 's top bodies on Monday after meetings of the CDU in Berlin .
But for now , Merkel has not presented a detailed model .
In the government program `` certain parameters are black and red . ''
Minister Alexander Dobrindt ( CSU ) have `` made a proposal , and now will continue . ''
However , the NRW CDU insists on saying `` no '' to a toll on all roads .
Merkel stressed that Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble ( CDU ) put constructively in the discussions on a bill .
On the subject , he spoke with Dobrindt about other ways to activate more private capital for investment in infrastructure , as well as broadband expansion .
`` There is nothing special . '' Schäuble on Sunday had left a `` mirror '' report Comments , his house , a separate concept to reward investors with highway tolls - after the 2017 election .
CSU leader Horst Seehofer subsequently warned against the cabinet toll to develop concepts against the relevant minister .
CDU Federal Vice Armin Laschet reiterated his objections .
`` The coalition agreement was never assumed all round - and to charge , '' said North Rhine-Westphalia 's CDU chair country .
In this respect , it is an important signal that Seehofer announced again now to talk about the issue .
Opposition to the plans also comes from the CDU associations Baden-Wuerttemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate .
Background are fears that a local border traffic tolls to neighbouring countries .
Seehofer had requested because of the toll criticism from the ranks of the CDU coalition loyalty .
The left sees the plans failed in the face of the dispute in the Union .
`` The toll is dead , '' said leader Bernd Riexinger Murks - the `` Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung '' ( Monday ) .
`` With the toll the minister fails . '' Dobrindt wants to introduce a sticker on all German roads , to be launched in 2016 .
Domestic car owners should not be burdened , according to the coalition agreement , but in addition .
Therefore , they should receive full compensation for the toll on the vehicle tax .
The model must not discriminate against foreign drivers but under EU law because of their nationality .

Return to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights .
The congressmen , Keith Ellison and John Lewis have introduced a bill to establish the organisation of trade unions as a civil right .
`` As trade unions , die die too middle-class jobs , '' said Ellison , a Democrat from Minnesota , and deputy chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus .
That is why I am proud with the civil rights icon John Lewis before the employee empowerment law .
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal possibilities of discrimination because of the organisation of trade unions , like other forms of discrimination - and stop the anti union of the forces .
In addition to the national labour law in order to create a way for the discrimination of workers to organize an union to sue in civil court for justice - and to receive compensation or the - is a sensible and necessary initiative .
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards .
Indeed , the best way to understand what Ellison , suggest Lewis and the other sponsors of their bill , the link back to a very American idea .
Despite the setbacks faced by the trade unions in recent years - in Wisconsin , Michigan and other states across the country - once countries around the world have encouraged Americans to recognise labour rights to extend and respect .
There was a time to remember the millions of Americans in this country , democracy , freedom of speech , freedom of the press and the right of association in the same breath .
As the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War , General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution which should ensure that would replace the militarized autocracy Hedki Tojos through democracy .
In full awareness of the fact that the workers and their unions a role in the creation of a new Japan , they used a language that explicitly recognised that `` guarantees the rights of workers to union and common negotiation and action . ''
As the United States after World War II Germany , General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler 's fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy .
In recognition of the fact that the workers would have to organise themselves , and should raise their voice in the new nation , the Germans added a clause that explicitly testified : `` the right to form associations in order to secure employment and to improve economic conditions and guarantees of every individual and every profession or industry .
Agreements that restrict this right or seek to diminish it is null and void ; seeks measures are unlawful .
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt held the presidency of the International Commission on Human Rights , which was drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , which was adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global agreement , Roosevelt and the other author is a guarantee that `` everyone has the right to form trade unions to protect its interests or to join them . ''
For generations , Americans accept the premise that labour rights are human rights .
When this country other countries how to shape the civil and democratic societies , Americans said that the right to the establishment of a trade union - and that the union should take part in collective bargaining as an equal partner with companies and government agencies - must be protected .
After these rights were under attack in America , it is indeed very wise to remember that the American ideal of working people must have the right to unite and in a free and open society .
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. , fifty years ago :
The story is a great teacher .
Now we all know that the labour movement is not limited to the strength of the nation but enlarged it .
By raising the living standards of millions of people miraculously work has created a market for the industry and raised the entire nation to unimaginable levels .
Those who attack the work , forget these simple truths , but history .
History remembers , and we should do this .
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights and protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representatives - is long overdue .
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that have made America great in the past and delivering on the promise of democracy .

Pull back the clubs together ?
Finally , there was always a dispute between the two Wolf Hauser Castle .
The bureaux now think about a possible cooperation .
As a model for the reconstruction of the Wolf , Hauser was the late Richard Dimbath , former chairman of the Wolf Council Hauser Castle friends , in the French Guédelon project .
A year ago , there was not a good climate between the castle and the castle of Wolfratshausen friends .
So far , seemed very different points of view , how to deal with the history of the Wolf Council Hauser Castle and a possible reconstruction .
The two camps now move closer together , it should be held soon to discuss a common approach .
This is confirmed by club CEOs Torsten Stockaryd ( Castle Association ) and Herbert Piffl ( Castle Friends ) to demand our newspaper .
`` I phoned Mr Piffl and suggested that we could sit down with us , '' says .
In his view , all members of both clubs could learn to work together again in the future .
So there were faster visible successes .
While the castle had friends around the suddenly deceased Richard Dimbath until a reconstruction of the castle on the mountain , stands for the Association of the Castle , `` opening and Erlebbarmachung '' at the forefront of the terrain .
Herbert Piffl , second president of the castle friends , was on the call , according to their own .
Since Dimbaths death , he is the castle friends .
A new chairman is to be found in mid-September at a general meeting .
The association currently counts around 40 members under the age of 74 .
`` After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath we have the first activities out of respect . '' This `` thinking period '' was needed `` to consider how it could happen . ''
According to Piffl , the new chairman should go into the conversation with the castle .
Until then , the castle could make friends with a current mood within their group .
There is not yet a candidate for the presidency , says Piffl .
`` But I am confident that someone will be found . '' He himself will not be standing because he has his residence in Bad Toelz .
The new chairman should be a wolf Council .
The Toelzer wanted to `` participate in the project but very happy . ''
The different positions in terms of reconstruction will probably remain in the eyes of Piffls in the near future .
He praises Dimbath as a `` missionary '' who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle .
Two similar projects are already far advanced in Austria and France would show that this idea is not a pipe dream .
A high participation of the population , as well as by volunteers from all over the world , be they a .
Piffl : `` I too was skeptical at the beginning .
But over time , more and more I have come to believe that it makes sense to promote the project . `` It could create a '' unique `` for the raftsmen city .
Here , there is nothing else .
Moreover , the project would be financed by EU subsidies , visitor tickets and potential sponsors , Piffl believes .
`` The idea of reconstruction is why I personally do not want to throw overboard . '' He simply hope that the club moves on this point , perhaps .
The aim of documenting the story first , `` is important and good . ''
After that , we could see .

Andrew Lawson was a man of the sort , whose character changed things , even in such a huge organisation like the NHS .
He spent his career as a consulting anesthetist the task of the sick to avoid both the agony of the disease as well as the agony of the treatment .
Among his patients , remembers his wife , was a MI6 employee , who had to live with the devastating effects of torture .
Lawson knew that the doctors are important diagnoses and diseases , while the cases mostly with something quite different : pain .
But one day in 2007 , he was the one who started his ordeal .
`` I have not felt , '' he wrote in May of this year .
I had difficulties to pick me up .
While he fought with the flu similar symptoms , he noticed that he made his wife Juliet impatient accusations .
`` I want everything immediately rather than later , '' he said .
When Juliet for a week on a business trip , felt disturbed by Lawson , unusually , and without reason .
Something was in the air .
He asked a colleague to carry out a radiograph of his chest .
Just two weeks ago , he was in the French Alps for skiing .
The result of the radiograph was before .
He suffered from mesothelioma , an incurable cancer of the breast skin , attacking the skin covering the lungs .
As with most cancers is usually difficult to determine the exact cause .
While some smokers with lung cancer , for example , have been previously diagnosed with lung cancer , not all smokers .
But mesothelioma is different .
In almost all cases , the trigger of asbestos contamination - contact with the fiber material , which was once called the `` miracle material '' but was recognized as lethal .
For most of us mesothelioma is a disease that is easy to ignore .
Asbestos is a product of the past .
The most dangerous type was not used in Britain since the 1960 s , when the industry voluntarily committed itself to not using this .
Even where it was used , only people worked directly with the material in certain sectors - plumbers , construction workers , carpenters and shipyard workers , for example .
As an industrial risk material from another time , he hardly seems to be worrying .
But complacency is misplaced .
Britain , it seems , is the culmination of a Mesoltheliom epidemic .
There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world .
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year , twice as many people die from this disease than in road accidents .
Annual figures of Mesotheliomtodesfaelle since 1980 and likely future deaths in Britain
The reason why we see the deadly effects of asbestos for years now , even though it is illegal ( all types of asbestos were banned in 1999 ) , is that after decades of a mesothelioma .
And the scourge of mesothelioma is not limited to former workers in the construction industry .
Asbestos was and still is often found in the houses in which we live , the offices we work in , the schools where we learn and the shops where we shop .
And that is why mesothelioma knows no class barriers , financial limitations , professions or age .
The privileged bastions , from the elegant department stores in London to private schools , are not protected .
The buildings are contaminated with asbestos .
Even in the hospitals where we are supposed to be healthy , have been identified as a result of this deadly Karzinogens .
Andrew Lawson was not old .
He was also not a plumber .
In fact , it was difficult to imagine where he could possibly have come into contact with asbestos .
Then he found out .
`` It looks as if the tunnels at Guy 's Hospital , where I completed my training for six years , there was a lot of asbestos . '' He wrote .
All students , nurses , doctors and porter - use the tunnel .
One wonders how many of my peers will suffer from the same illness ?
Unfortunately he was unable to answer this question , at least in part .
`` Of the four doctors who were trained at Guy 's Hospital , and in the last five years , mesothelioma patients , '' he wrote in a 2010 letter , `` I am the last one is still alive . ''
How many of us will fall ill ?
When Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma at the age of 48 .
When he died on 17 February this year , he was 55 .
It was an unusually long time .
Fifty percent of all Mesotheliomerkrankten die within 8 months after diagnosis .
The disease always ends fatally .
We can therefore only reiterate Lawson 's question : `` how many of us will fall ill ? ''
The UK 's leading expert on mesothelioma , Professor Julian Peto , assumes that between 1870 and 2050 , when the asbestos epidemic in Britain is expected to come to a standstill , will be a total of 90,000 fallen victim to the disease .
At the moment , most of them have no idea that they will die .

A quick glance at the files of the courts , which often turn for claims , shows how widespread the scourge of Mesothelioms already .
In June this year , Marks & Spencer , for example , Janice Allen negligently exposed to asbestos .
She worked for nine years for the chain , from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible for the clothing department in two locations - one of the flagship in Oxford Street .
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years when she began her career at M .
Now she has two children in their twenties .
`` Before this , '' she says , `` I had never heard of mesothelioma , I do n't really knew anything about asbestos .
I never thought that I would deal with it .
There are few people who know a lot about asbestos .
The fact is that the concept of asbestos is a substance , but a group of six minerals .
The name comes from the word `` Asbestiform , '' a description of the fiber structure , which makes the fabric resistant and flexible .
Three of the six were used in construction .
Chrysotile asbestos , also known as white asbestos is now by far the most frequently found asbestos in buildings .
It was on the floor of plates , pipe insulation , boiler insulations , used even for brake pads in cars .
It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos , but by the EU and the WHO as a `` great risk '' with possible casualties .
More dangerous , however , is the brown asbestos ( Amosit ) and the blue asbestos ( Krokydolith ) .
Britain was once the world 's largest importer of brown asbestos , and experts suspect that `` it 's clear , but indirect evidence that this was a major reason for the uniquely high Mesotheliomraten . ''
An employee of Marks & Spencer was in store in Oxford Street , London , exposed to asbestos Alamy
Janice Allen may not be seen as a typical Mesotheliomopfer , but the work of Julian Peto suggests that their story is not unusual .
He presented a study of those affected , showing that `` a significant proportion of mesotheliomia without well-known suspension was caused by work or home , presumably by asbestos exposure in the environment . ''
A large part of these contacts is based his statement on the `` normal use and aging '' of our buildings .
It seems that no one could expect to be safe .
A report by Goddard Consulting , which studied the palace of Westminster , shows how people in the heart of the government have been unknowingly exposed to the substance may be .
2009 Goddard reported that the service shafts were contaminated and pipes behind the committee rooms of the Parliament , whose deadly asbestos fibres could be caused by something as harmless as `` strong '' air movements .
MEPs are often accused of looking after their own interests , but here it looks as if the opposite .
While the management of the Parliamentary Labor Service that the Westminster Palace have received a `` clean '' health certificate , it is now indisputable that must be raised to £1 billion over several years to renovate Parliament to modernise the electrical installations and to remove the asbestos , and that after the 2015 general election will meet members of the QE2 conference centre in nearby rather than on the green benches in Westminster .
The Goddard report also pointed out that `` the presence of asbestos was not handled in accordance with the relevant provisions . ''
No one can know whether this mismanagement will cost lives .
All we can do now is wait .
A person who was able to determine the exposure to asbestos is never exactly Graham Abbott , a general practitioner .
Like Andrew Lawson , the 50-year-old Abbott believed that he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals .
`` I worked in a hospital in the asbestos lawsuits were decided positively , '' he says , `` but I ca n't prove it in my case .
It is so difficult to remember all the places where we worked , and to the data .
He still remembers the day in early December 2009 , in which he got a kind of fever .
He was just 45 , and led an operation by late evening .
Suddenly , I had chills .
It came suddenly .
I felt terrible .
I thought not to create the ride home .
As a doctor , Abbott knew that the pain from the chest skin , the skin around his lungs came around .
But , like Janice Allen , he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma .
He was not a month to work .
Doctors were surprised to see Pleurakathether x-rays of his chest and put fluid from the lungs and test in the laboratory .
His complaints , however , remained without a diagnosis .
His health is slowly , and he returned to his job .
However , the symptoms returned from time to time , often after physical activity and heavy breathing .
Abbott 's 2011 came with similar symptoms a patient in his practice and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma .
But even now , Abbott is not his own case .
After all , his patient was several decades older and had worked directly with asbestos .
The connection was clear in the case .
Abbott 's condition deteriorated again in September 2011 and his family doctor brought his CT scans and x-rays to a group of experts .
In December 2011 , exactly two years after the first time Abbott had felt ill , introduced a camera equipped with a probe into the cave between the ribs and chest fur .
I am an optimist .
I usually just go , `` he says .
Frankly , I had made so many concerns .
But Rachel , my wife , was worried .
The result of the biopsy was in the week between Christmas and New Year 's Day : `` I was told that it was mesothelioma . ''
Graham Abbott : diagnosis of mesothelioma
Suddenly , Abbott had appointments with Macmillan nurses , one of whom he recommended taking a lawyer .
Only now he realized the extent of the epidemic .
`` It turned out that asbestos was spread very far , especially in large public buildings , which were often isolated pipes with asbestos , '' he says .
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings , now become ill .
And so mesothelioma is now younger people who have not worked in the professions .
The most dangerous pipes with asbestos insulation in hospitals were under the earth , so patients were more likely to be exposed to the substance .
But many employees , who alternated in pedestrian tunnels from one building to another ( such as Andrew Lawson ) , or in underground canteens ( as did Graham Abbott often ) , most likely came into contact with toxic substances .
It turns out that for several decades after the war were hospitals for patients may be lifesaving , but life-threatening for the treating physicians .
It will still be removed .
Students showed their bunsenburner asbestos mats .
And it is not just hospitals .
Asbestos was due to its fabulous insulating and flame retardant properties often used in offices , shops , libraries and city halls .
Even schools .
Indeed , many people probably have had the first contact with asbestos in the classroom .
Across the country , thousands of hours of chemistry students have parked their bunsenburner on asbestos mats .
The website is now often mentioned the issue of asbestos in schools .
And , meanwhile , have included innocent objects in our homes , such as floor plates or scales by default asbestos roofs .
`` It is an industrial poison that is contained in large parts of our properties , '' said Andrew Morgan , the lawyer who has represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy 's Hospital .
In one case , was the only contact the women affected by the demolition of a Gartenschuppens in the 1970 s .
So you have to be careful how you tear off your garden shed .
The effects of the diagnosis , and the knowledge that the disease is incurable , is immense .
`` It takes a while to digest , '' says Graham Abbott .
I went back to work and tried to continue , but I realized that I could n't concentrate on what I did .
I was two weeks in practice .
Then I knew that I had to go and take care of myself .
Well , I will not see another Christmas .
With the greatest difficulty was the change from the position of a doctor to the patient .
Like countless patients before him , he recalls how he was overwhelmed by all the information with which he had to come .
`` It was very difficult to include everything , '' he says .
`` I asked my doctor , '' how long do I have ? ``
And you gave me about 12 months .
I remember that I thought , `` well , I will not see another Christmas .
That 's it. `` ''
Mesothelioma is particularly insidious because it is our life conservation mechanism - breathing itself - is that caused the deadly cancer .
The majority of cases of mesothelioma caused by exposure to asbestos .
Asbestos is composed of tiny fibres .
If the asbestos is kicked up and the fibres are inhaled , they can in the breast skin , the skin around the lungs , set .
Asbestos fibres irritate the skin and can cause breast cell mutations .
`` The problem arises with the needle of inhaled asbestos fibres , '' says Professor Tom Treasure , a heart / thorax doctor , who moved in 2001 to the Guy 's Hospital .
Just the hospital , which Andrew Lawson , that he has exposed to asbestos , is now , ironically , a leading centre for the treatment of mesothelioma .
Treasure knew Lawson and several others who were probably also exposed to asbestos during their training in hospital .
Once the asbestos needles are pressed from the tissue , says Treasure , `` breathing process to the edge , where the skin .
From the outset , it is inherently invasive .
The usual options for other cancers do not work so well with mesothelioma .
For example , the effectiveness of an operation is controversial .
Some say that it was worth a try .
Treasure denies this .
`` You ca n't cut out the breast coat , '' he says .
They do not come with the knife around it .
Meanwhile , the cancer `` does not speak very well to chemotherapy , '' the `` effect , '' but not cure .
`` Sometimes there is a long time to live , '' says Treasure .
But in the end they all die .
Fortunately , some patients actually live long , much longer than expected .
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis .
Two and a half years after Graham Abbott is still fighting its own diagnosis .
After he contacted mesothelioma , Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson , who had four years after his diagnosis , an one-man support and consultancy for Mitbetroffene .
`` Hello , cancer central , '' he said , happily on calls .
`` He was very positive , '' says Abbott .
He had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still very active .
Abbott had originally offered six cycles of chemotherapy , which is expected to take four months and would prolong his life only a month .
`` I was desperate , '' he says .
I wanted to give up .
Lawson , however , was `` the things in a more positive light . ''
Following the advice of several doctors decided Abbott , his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang - Lazdunski , heart specialist at the thorax Guy `` s .
`` We had an advantage because I had to be referred to , I just cried and got an appointment , '' Graham .
A normal patient would have to receive a payment and have to wait for the approval of the treatment .
Money is crucial for mesothelioma - sufferers , in order to be able to perform the best available therapies .
But if these treatments fail , eventually , inevitably , many of those affected by another financial concern - about the future of the families they leave behind .
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation .
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP .
`` It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health , '' says Morgan .
But what changed in the 1960 s that recognized that was also a very low burden of a health risk .
And here the negligence of the companies began to play a role .
Andrew Lawson and Guy 's Hospital , in their case , but it was not what Morgan calls a `` full compensation '' because Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma at Guy 's was due to an asbestos exposure .
After the investigation into his death was confirmed by a spokesman of Guy 's , however , that `` the asbestos fibres were removed in the basement area in the 1990 s . ''
It was too late for Andrew Lawson .
How can be removed asbestos
In fact , it is seeking compensation for sufferers of mesothelioma , an enormous problem , the deadly asbestos contact a company or a job - usually decades after the incidents .
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed .
Insurance documents can be lost .
And those who defend themselves against claims , know that the time for them , but certainly not with the plaintiffs .
In response , there were significant new legislation this year , which makes it easier for mesothelioma - to enforce compensation , even if their previous employers are more .
The law has set up a fund of £350 million funded by the insurance industry for those who have been diagnosed after July 2012 , can prove a contact , but no one can sue .
In these cases , the plaintiffs will receive 80 percent of what a court in a normal compensation process could grant them - about £120,000 .
About 300 successful applications in the program are expected per year .
Andrew Morgan thinks that , like so many mesothelioma - £350 million a `` very good work '' of the insurance industry .
`` This is a deal of insurers for insurers , '' he says , and suggests that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have to pay if it ignored the time and mesothelioma patients - and they could sue the company .
Even Mike Penning , former labor and pension minister , admitted that the law `` not perfect . ''
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that rapid action is needed in the face of seven deaths every day .
`` The people are suffering so much and now need help , '' said Penning during the second hearing of the mesothelioma Act in December of last year .
At that point was Graham Abbott for 19 months in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang - Lazdunski .
After their first meeting , Lang - Lazdunski an operation , which he expects in contrast to Tom Treasure , a positive effect .
This was accompanied by a radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy , with Lang - Lazdunski can present a survival rate of up to 40 percent over five years .
Abbott felt stronger .
`` This is , of course , the most important thing , '' says Abbott .
Time and again , we see in patients .
There is something that you can move on .
If you are going , you very quickly get worse .
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012 .
At the end of August , he had the last of the six cycles of chemotherapy .
After concern scans showed no signs of the disease .
Then I had a scan in March 2014 .
There were several cancer spots around my chest .
I was just 50 .
That is not life-threatening .
This is lebensbeendend .
Abbott again underwent six cycles of chemotherapy .
No trace of the tumors is now more visible .
But the process is physically and mentally exhausting .
You have to think about practical things - about money when I am not , for example , or my wife , as the boiler works time .
If you receive bad news , you will be negative .
You have to look to the future .
As the father of Ellie , 16 , and Tamsin , 14 , is not always easy .
`` This is difficult for parents , '' he says .
It is difficult to know what to say and how much .
When I received my first diagnosis , I told my girls that I would have a disease with which I would not grow old .
They reacted quite differently .
Tamsin is very sociable and impetuous .
She told her friends and we soon got a lot of calls .
Ellie was more circumspect .
She said not much .
Such discussions are something that all cancer patients have to go through .
But for Mesotheliomerkrankte such talks are not of hope , not a shred of hope for survival .
Finally , Stephen Jay Gould also brings the disease ( as ) a grim security .
As Andrew Morgan says , `` mesothelioma is not life-threatening .

Warning strike : train drivers are threatening consequences for commuters
The nationwide warning strike by train drivers on Monday night could also affect the movement of persons in NRW .
The strike was announced for 18 to 21 p.m. , all carriers , including the long-distance , regional and commuter rail traffic .
The main thrust of the warning strike is the transport of goods .

The district said the union of German drivers ( GDL ) , Sven Schmitte in Düsseldorf .
We expect significant failures .
There is no regional priorities .
The main thrust of the warning strike was the transport of goods .
Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced to do everything possible to keep the impact as low as possible .
The GDL did not say , however , where it wants to strike , so it is difficult to foresee the consequences .

Twin town : German beer for Guangzhou
Hops and malt - a popular combination in China .
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China .
Frankfurt now wants a brewery in China , and also hopes for a direct flight between the two cities .
German beer , brewed in Frankfurt and Guangzhou - that is the urgent desire of officials in China .
`` We would be delighted if we were to establish a German brewery in our city , '' said the deputy secretary of the South China Metropolis , Li Yiwei , this week during a visit to the SPD delegation in his city .
Again and again , the official of the ruling Communist Party of China in the course of the conversation on this metropolis of twelve million .
Guangzhou , which is called in Germany , Canton , is one of the richest cities in China , Li .
People therefore have the purchasing power to afford German beer .
The Hessian SPD chairman Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel , who led the German delegation , said the host to politicians , he will hear in Germany after a possible partner for the project .
`` It does not need a lot of beer : good water , grain and vitality , '' he added at the lunch with the top party in Guangzhou .
This joy shine , Mr Li , flattered the hosts .
As a result , the official from Guangzhou with Schäfer-Gümbel - albeit with red wine , which was served at the meal .
The Chinese brand Tsingtao goes back to German brewing .
Tsingtao - beer is brewed according to the German purity law .
More commerce
A second request of the Chinese hosts would be a direct flight between Frankfurt and Guangzhou , said deputy leader Li .
Lufthansa had offered the flight earlier in the year 2012 , but for economic reasons .
`` It would be worth it again , '' he was convinced the local politicians .
`` The commerce between our two cities continues . ''
Currently , travelers would have to take a detour through Changsha in Hunan Province , Li complained .
The administration of the Guangdong province , whose capital is Guangzhou , hopes the flights .
The deputy governor of the province , Chen Yunxian , made the request during his conversation with the Social Democrats in the foreground .
`` This is a very good idea , '' said Schäfer-Gümbel - the Chinese vice-minister Li Jinjun , an intimate knowledge of Germany , nodding approvingly .
The partnership
The hopes of the deputy leader of Guangzhou , that he can visit Frankfurt next year to a partnership meeting .
Li Yiwei was already on the Main , but not yet in this role .
He came into office only this year , after his predecessor had been promoted from office on corruption charges .
The local leader Wan Qing had to go .
The action against the officials from Guangzhou is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in the party and the administration , which is enforced by tough leader Xi Jinping .
The new leader Li Yiwei had worked before his party career for an American company , which is highly unusual in the Chinese Communist Party .
Before he took office in Guangzhou , he was a top official of cars built in Fujian , where VW a great work .
Frankfurt has officially received more than a dozen twinning .
The connection to the Guangzhou 9000 miles away is one of those that are maintained by both sides , including school exchanges .
Last year was celebrated the 25th anniversary of the Sino-German relationship .
The China metropolis on Yamen , with its economic power is almost as strong as in Hessen .
Next year , they wanted to achieve a gross domestic product of 250 billion euros , reported Li .

Berkeley explains housing again for `` normal ''
One of the most prominent developers of London pointed out that the housing market in the south-east of England , `` returned to normal levels . ''
Homes in the capital were highly sought-after and subject to huge price increases , which the Bank of England due to the widespread fear of a credit bubble in June led to put limits on mortgage loans .
Tony Pidgley , founder and CEO of the company , Berkeley said on Monday : `` since the beginning of the current financial year , the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the peak in 2013 , '' adding that this is a `` stable environment '' in action .
The housing market in London was set up during the downturn , as well as foreign buyers in the capital .
According to the official cadastre , prices have risen in the last year alone jumped by 18.5 percent , far more than the average rise in England and Wales as a whole .

China denies Hong Kong right to government election , protesters swear vengeance
On Sunday , the Chinese parliament despite the increased calls for democratic reforms against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 elections by the Hong Kong electorate .
This approach probably fueled the protests in Hong Kong 's business district , announced during the planning and mobilization of activists , within a few hours after the announcement .
The decision of the Chinese People 's Congress allows the Communist leaders in principle , not to reject all candidates loyal to Beijing .
`` This is not unexpected , but it makes us angry , '' said legal expert Emily Lau , leader of the Democratic Party .
That is not what Beijing had promised .
They have lied to the people of Hong Kong .
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime .
In his defence of China 's decision , said Li Fei , deputy secretary-general of the Standing Committee of the National People 's Congress , that the approval of public nominations in the elections for the Hong Kong government to `` chaotic . ''
Since 1997 , when Britain returned Hong Kong to Chinese control , Beijing has promised the residents from 2017 to choose the government seat .
China 's leaders on Sunday presented the decision as a democratic breakthrough , because it gives the people of Hong Kong a direct vote , but the decision also makes clear that the Chinese leadership keeps the process through a nomination committee tightly controlled by Beijing .
According to a new clause only candidates should also `` love of country and love Hong Kong '' to be admitted .
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most effective public protests in Hong Kong for several years .
The Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement in Hong Kong behind the pro-democracy campaign , whose organizers have threatened to seal off the financial district if Beijing allows no genuine universal suffrage .
Within a few hours after the announcement on Sunday night had hundreds of Occupy Central 's supporters gathered in the rain before the government headquarters in Hong Kong .
During the demonstration , the organizers said that their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience , and they planned to protest waves in the coming weeks .
They did , however , no details , apparently to avoid problems with the authorities .
In an online statement , the organizers of the movement `` has learned that the occupation of the central district only as a last resort , an action that should take place only when all dialogue possibilities have been exhausted and there is no other choice .
We are sorry to say that today all dialogue possibilities have been exhausted and the occupation of the central district will take place .
The authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for days for the announcement of Beijing , and tighter security measures including police and government buildings were on Sunday in front of the barricades .
The unrest is exacerbated by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they slowly lose control of their city .
The influx of people from the mainland increased the competition for products and services .
Moreover , there is growing fear that Hong Kong 's values such as democracy and freedom of speech are starting to crumble under growing pressure from Beijing .
Some criticized the demonstrations of the Occupy Central movement , because they are the lifeblood of Hong Kong 's business - is .
`` The protests , which they say , could cause major economic damage , depending on how many people are involved in it and how long they persist , '' said legal expert Regine Ip , who criticised the movement for a long time .
We do not want to stoke fears that Hong Kong gets out of control .
This impression is bad for investment .
China 's state-controlled media also reported recently on democracy activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western powers .
This summer , activists organized an unofficial referendum on electoral rights , which were attended by 780,000 people - more than a fifth of voters in Hong Kong .
In July , tens of thousands took part in one of the largest democracy demonstrations in the history of the region .

Clever ways to save at university textbooks
Since the cost of university textbooks for many students more than $ 1,000 a year , considered the fast second semester student Matt Schroeder a clever saving idea .
He invented a temporary system for books by students of higher semester and offered a nominal compensation in order to delay the sale .
`` My maths book normally costs $ 180 , but I got it for $ 10 for a semester and a chick - fil A biscuit , '' said Schroeder , 19 , who visited the Covenant College in Georgia .
The books needed for last semester would have cost him $ 430 , he said .
He gave $ 120 .
The college leadership said that students spend on average more than $ 1,200 a year for textbooks and study materials for the students , however , that there were several cost-containment options .
Online shops and creative approaches such as Schroeder 's are increasingly the solution of choice for students .
The hiring of textbooks is popular , and so students can use a book for a semester , often at a considerably lower price than when buying .
Neebo Inc , which operates more than 250 university book stores , said that the hiring of textbooks have doubled since 2011 .
Polls show the industry that was rented for about a quarter of the books in the college bookstores last spring semester , said Neebos Vice-President Tevor Meyer .
Less than half of all textbooks are bought according to the Amalgamation National Association of College Stores in campus bookstores .
Here is the multiplication table for the best deals .
Buy online
Some new books online cost only a third of the price they are in the campus bookstore .
The ninth edition of the `` Annunciation '' VNO Ron Larwon , Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $ 290 , but can be obtained at the specialized textbook retailer Chegg.com for $ 239.99 .
Used to buy
If the notes of others or make up a normal wear nothing , second-hand books are a good option .
`` Annunciation '' is used to have on Chegg.com for $ 93.49 .
Matt Casaday , 25 , a student at Brigham Young University , says that he has spent on Amazon .com 42 cents for a second-hand copy of `` Strategic Business Media Fells : understanding The End Of The Advertising Business . ''
The book was sold new for $ 48 .
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey , head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls advised students to ask their professors , whether earlier editions .
Sometimes the updates are not relevant for the seminar work .
In such cases , often older editions can be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest edition .
Besides Chegg and Amazon , half .com , eBay Inc is also a popular alternative for used books .
Rent
The hiring of textbooks is worth considering if you treat them fairly well , remember to return them and you do n't want to keep the books at the end of the course .
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book .
A student could , for example , `` rent '' for the duration of a semester for about $ 20 .
Find out about the provisions of the shop where you can rent , including the penalties that may be incurred for writing notes , or usage .
Tenants beware : if you return the book , the penalties can exceed the price of a new book .
E-books
Instead of traditional textbooks , e-books are an option .
In fact , these books are sometimes hired by an electronic license for a certain period of wholesalers such as Amazon .com and Barnes & Noble Inc. Chegg is provided .
`` Annunciation '' at Chegg can rent for 6 months for about $ 61 .
Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best deals , which can be downloaded free of charge , while nowadays many classic scientific and engineering science textbooks can be very expensive .
In any case , look around .
Joe Gault , 29 , who will soon visit the Pepper 's Law School , recommends the ISBN number for the price of books , because you can be sure to find the right textbook .
And an online order should be examined , and whether the book is actually in stock .
He learned that lesson the hard way .
He bought a book for four weeks and had finally paid the full price in the college bookstore .

Genetic disorder often wrongly diagnosed
A British woman says that she thought that she would die as a result of a misdiagnosis over many years .

She actually suffered Charcot Marie Tooth disease ( CMT ) - a group of ererbter disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and spinal cord .

`` I felt guilty , because I was curious , so I told this to anyone , but I went home , was looking for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA 's society , '' she said .
When I received a reply , I was terribly shocked and got into panic .
I thought that I would be in a wheelchair with 18 and 25 die , slowly and would lose all my skills .
I made it all alone with me and planned my own funeral .

He simply stood and hugged me and said , `` my love , I do not believe that you , otherwise you 're now in a wheelchair . ''

Judge temporarily stops law that could force all abortion clinics in Louisiana to close
A U.S. federal judge on Sunday provisionally stopped the implementation of a law in Louisiana , the lawyers say that it probably would have led to the closure of all the state 's five abortion clinics .
This measure of Bobby Jindal , governor of Louisiana , was raised in June 1 . The law , and should , in effect , would force doctors to perform abortions , including the right to acquire a patient at a hospital within a radius of 30 miles of their practice .
The judge 's decision means , however , that the doctors can perform legal abortions continue for the time being , while they apply for such a right .
`` The plaintiffs can continue , while trying to obtain these rights , '' wrote Judge John deGravelles in his judgment .
A hearing will be scheduled within a month for the judges to bring about a more permanent decision for the law .
Abortion supporters welcomed the decision , said the latest in a series of rulings against similar measures , and that doctors have more time to obtain hospital admission rights .
`` Today 's decision means that the women in Louisiana , a law that they want to take their health and their rights , '' said Nancy Northup , president and chairman of the Centre for reproductive rights , which had sued on behalf of three of the five clinics of the state to stop the law .
It was not immediately clear whether the ruling also covered the doctors from two hospitals , which have not joined the lawsuit and had also asked for the rights .
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have introduced similar laws , but such measures have recently declared courts in Alabama and Mississippi for the constitution .
Cruxes of a law in Texas , which would have forced most of the remaining clinics in the state to close , were stopped by a federal judge on Friday .
Abortion advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and , as well as the American Medical Association say that the rights of doctors are demanding unnecessary restrictions .
Anti-abortion activists counter that the measures serve to protect the health of women , although some of the effects of the closure of hospitals .

If all the other doctors in the state are being forced to carry out any more abortions , this doctor would not carry out the operation , fearing for his safety , said the group .
In their arguments against the judgment of the state of Louisiana , officials said that they would not punish doctors because of the performance of abortions , while their applications for patient rights , no way .

Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatments lead to higher death rates of ovarian cancer in rural areas .
Angelina Jolie and her brother James put online a video tribute to her mother , who died in 2007 , ovarian cancer .
For women in rural areas of Australia , there is a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than for women in cities .
Researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1100 Australians , in which 2005 ovarian cancer was detected , and found that only 25 percent were still alive five years after diagnosis .
The head of research , said Susan Jordan , QIMR Berg Hofer Medical Research Institute , is that for those who lived in rural and remote regions of the state , the mortality risk during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas .
Small STUDY : new drugs may slow lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers examined the medical care of women over seven years .
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in the diagnosis of cancer , the type of eggs stick to existing illnesses , as well as the social and economic status also influenced the chances of survival .
For older women and those whose cancer had progressed at diagnosis , the survival rate was already on the lowest .
For those who lived in rural and remote regions of the state , the mortality risk during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas .
Although the study looked at why women living outside the city , died with a higher likelihood of ovarian cancer , Dr. Jordan assumed a belated diagnosis and the lack of access to the best treatment centres as possible factors .
`` This disease is best treated by gynaecological oncologists , and these are usually found in larger cities , '' she said .
Despite the improvement of medical services in order to confront the distances slightly , it proposed as a possible remedy to reinforce the service of doctors flown to give specialists the opportunity to provide women closer to their place of residence , as well as treatment programmes for people outside their region .
Dr. Jordan said that the study regardless of the geographical status of a poor long-term survival rate for women in ovarian cancer , and underscored the need for better treatment and prevention strategies .
The Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer funded study published today in the Medical Journal of Australia .
In March 2013 , 33 years from the Gold Coast veteran Neave , a young mother that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer .

In a statement to the New Press , it contradicts statements of CEO Peer Medau and certifies this , `` as a commander '' to pose .
This is not the style of the university , according to the communication .
It is the family Medau already `` been informed verbally in mid-June on the request of the university .
The statement that the plans were first announced in July , are definitely wrong , `` says Pötzl .
At the same time , he points out that the plans are `` Vorfestlegungen decisions '' or `` preferences , however , it is . ''
The access to the necessary expansion of the narrow street castle was less dramatic than feared by the Medaus .
A nine metre wide street was and is not mentioned .
It is the current state at 5.50 meters , which is a metre wider than before , `` explains Pötzl .
The argument of Medau operators that use their own parking free school in the future , and then only by students of the university , will not accept Pötzl .
In the process , not at all , because as with other public parking spaces can be resolved now intelligently .
The residents think
The mountain , which is situated on the site and would lead to their doorstep along the access road to the parking deck , according to the university president `` should not be affected . ''
Instead , he said , `` that it is not just about the nursery , but also about the residents of the youths , Friedrich Streib Street and the 800 neighbouring secondary school pupils .
It is about much more than special interests , `` Mr Medau Pötzl .
Whether the criticism of the parents of the crèche , with the expansion of the road would be a `` lost the few natural spots Coburgs '' is entitled to go , `` the reader can decide for themselves . ''
At the beginning of October , together with the State Office of Public Works Bamberg Pötzl wants to inform the councillors about the architectural development of the university until 2020 , `` and in this context , the importance of the new development . ''
Peer Medau last week , the parents of the crèche had informed about the plans of the university .
According to the gate for the new parking deck as usual on the campus and the Friedrich Streib Street , but on the Medau hill .
It would have to be developed on the narrow road about a kilometre length gate .
According to projections from the Medaus would increase traffic in the park of high cliffs .
The talk is about 2000 vehicles a day .
Not so far from the city wanted to speak to the project .

Putin called on Kiev to the inclusion of `` welfare talks '' with eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday , according to Russian media reports that the Ukrainian government is fighting against the separatists in the east of the country and directly with negotiations on the `` statehood '' of the breakaway region .
His spokesman Dimitri Peskow was later realized that did not mean that Putin will be under the control of the separatist area of eastern Ukraine part of Russia , but that its status must be defined in relation to the Russian-speaking region of Ukraine , the power of representation of its rights and interests .
Putin 's appeal to the Kiev government to negotiate on an equal footing with the pro-Russian insurgents , however , fits the strategy apparently since the beginning of the riots five months ago : aid to the separatists in the areas and pressure on the Ukrainian government to allow the newly proclaimed region of Novo Rossiya de facto independence for an alliance with Russia rather than with the West .
In an interview with the state television station Channel One , Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recapture the territories held by separatists in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions , which were taken in March and April , after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on 18 March .
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently taken the area as `` Novo Rossiya '' or `` Novorossiya , '' a term that recalls the pre-revolutionary heyday of the Russian empire .
Putin pointed out that all those Ukrainian politicians during the campaign for the elections on Oct. 26 , while government groups and civilian communities in the attacking areas held by separatists hope for imminent peace talks are `` trapped '' in their illusions , told Itar-Tass .
`` We must immediately begin detailed discussions , not only on technical issues , but also on the political organisation of society and the state status of south-eastern Ukraine , in order to protect the interests of the people who live there , '' he said .
Peskow said that Putin 's reference to statehood must be seen in the context of the greater autonomy that has been discussed for months by the Kiev leadership , in order to allay fears in Russian-speaking areas that threaten their cultural and linguistic rights .
Only the Ukrainian government can give the necessary autonomy to the eastern areas , said Peskow .
We are not talking about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia , Peskow said , `` because there is no conflict between Russia and Ukraine , but an internal conflict in Ukraine . ''
The clarification of the Kremlin spokesman for correcting the `` misinterpretation '' of Putin 's remarks underlined Russia 's leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east , in contrast to the direct annexation of Crimea , where the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians .
Moscow would have been far more difficult to annex the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine , since most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and polls from before the conflict in Ukraine to remain a broad majority .
The autonomy , which was raised by Russian diplomats at international forums , would give the regional governments in Ukraine , its own authority to negotiate trade agreements and foreign relations , thus giving the Kremlin a de facto control over an area that connects the Russian territory of Crimea .
The Black Sea peninsula annexed five months ago , is the home port for the majority of the Russian navy , as well as an important commercial port and historic coastal region .
The regions between the Rostov region in Russia and the Crimea is also rich in mines , factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military .
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko suggested in his investiture speech on June 7 that the Ukrainian legislation - after new elections - should consider amendments to the Constitution , which provide the respective areas of greater control over their finances and the status of languages .
But his idea of autonomy appears in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels , is accused of arming and incitement to Moscow .
Putin 's last call for Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders on an equal footing , followed by a further encroachment of the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks have entered on the previously peaceful region in eastern Ukraine along the Sea of Azov .
The coup that took over the Russian-backed separatists , according to the fears of Ukrainian security agents , the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to the Crimea , the control of Nowoasowsk .
For this reason , massive civilian and military preparations are under way to Mariupol , a steel industry port of 500,000 inhabitants , which lies between Nowoasowsk and the narrow access to the Crimea .
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels and asked for urgent action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine , a former Soviet republic , which has been independent for 23 years .
`` We are close to the point of no return , '' warned Poroshenko .
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine .
The EU summit decided no concrete actions that lead to the drafting of further sanctions against Russia , which should enter into force at an unspezifizierten escalation of Ukraine crisis .
Ukrainian soldiers have had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk , after the two columns of Russian tanks and 1,000 soldiers last week in the Donetsk region , in order to support the beleaguered separatists , said Col. Andriy Lysenko , spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Repo , on Saturday in Kiev .
The first probably 63 Ukrainian soldiers who were trapped by the Russian invasion in Ilowajsk , were exchanged on Sunday against 10 Russian paratroopers captured a week ago on Ukrainian territory , announced on Sunday with Cadets .

At a family , I think later .

I am happily that many people remember in the world yet our frights and we are so grateful for the aid , that we received of people in Great Britain and everywhere here .

The boy , that through the hail of bullets flea , in the opinion , let its mother be dead
It was its first school day ( Russians go at 7 years of age into the school ) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of its mother Tamara .
As seven year old , it said : `` Mama said me , I should leave myself if there were an explosion , and hold '' its hand .
After an explosion , it thought would die , it .
It said to it : `` Course . ''
Full anxiety , it could be dead , flea it and saw on the way a crying infant , seized it at hand and flea through a hail of bullets .
Its father Wladimir , that closed its son outside into the arms , said : `` Damir said to me that its mother had died .
It said : `` I was not able to rescue '' it .
In reality had stumbled according to Tamara outside and with leg injuries in the hospital , on their part in the acceptance , that its son had died .
After its reunification , it said : `` I cried before joy .
I was not able to believe it .
It raced me in and embraced .
Damir was flown later to London ( of the newspaper dissolved in the meantime News of the world ) in order to received the title of a Barnardo 's by the at that time premier Tony Blair and his wife Cherie it Children 's it champion .
`` This horror pursues you every day , but I wished , I could stop with the remembrance , '' said it yesterday .
But I can say that it becomes in my memory paler .
I know yet that I threw away directly after that all my toy pistols .
But now I can play computer game with shot scenes and am that for me no problem .
`` I no anxiety before that have to return into the sports hall , but I do not think over me even after .
I do not remember created have these children , with whom I played in the yard , and that it after outside .
We never say that they were killed or are dead .
We say that they remained in the sports hall .
I remember very well my trip to London , especially at the toys store , where I was able to choose myself everything , what I wanted , and the trip in a vehicle open above .
But now it has anxiety around place such as the Ukraine where wars cause the type of misfortune , that it and its friends suffered .
This horror pursues you every day , but I wished , I could stop remembering on that .
`` I am so sorry around all that , that suffer from the horror , '' said Damir , that worked past week as more voluntarily in a cloister .
I want to help so gladly .
I want to go one day to the police and hope that they will take me next year at the training academy .
Its mother Tamara , 48 , said : Were `` 37 children out of our neighborhood killed , can imagine you that ?
I remember gave lasted the terrible quiet after the siege , it simply no children who were able to call and run around , and this quiet many months on .
It remembers lively its trip to London with Damir .
The people in London cried when I told our story .
I understood at that time how people can understand our feelings on the other side of the world , and show its support .
It was Cherie Blair and its foundation grateful for the price and the possibility to travel in the autumn 2004 to London .
I wished , I could call Cherie and say its simply even that 10 years passed , but I remember still the meeting me its and its man in London , and helped myself like the Damir and .
I remember yet how Damir wanted to eat gladly borscht and they called all local Russian restaurants .
I remember how it played with waiters in a restaurant . Damir shot raced with its water pistol on it and it away and played with it .
And that was only a month after the horror .
I was surprised us that the Britons divided so willingly our pain and supported .
It said : `` I think always that this world in these 10 years became not better .
In the Ukraine , the war goes on now , and people die every day , and I believe that many children were killed become and yet killed .
Those are exact such children such as our .
I think that for many of the war a part of the messages is , that they hear , if they are bored or are busied with something other .
I know simply , what these people feel , the entire horror .
And I can not stop therewith feeling that .
Did nothing change , still mutually want to kill itself the people and is that so sad .
Damir became large and is a very soft and quieter boy , he is not at all aggressive or furiously .
It does not search for example for revenge , it is not overwhelmed of the past horrors .
I know that he does not remember gladly on that , but he has go six close friends out of the class and it occasionally into the sports hall and ignite there candles .
When he was smaller , he suffered under that - I remember me how he put himself sometimes on the sofa , that turned away face of us , for hours .
Sleeping , its eyes were not open .
I remember also yet how it threw all its weapons and other military toys away . Damir is now 17 , more largely than I , good-looking , intelligent and healthy .
I can hardly believe that I was certain so some hours long , that it dead would be and I would see it never again .
When I came myself after the explosion recovered and on the legs , I looked around myself , and the hell saw around me around , with body part lying around everywhere .
I was certain absolute that my smaller boy impossibly could have survived in this hell .
`` I remember me that I shouted it , '' Damir , run , run away '' , but I was certain also so that it had not heard me .
But it heard it and ran away it .
And so life goes on unlike that of many other , for us .

Are we learned ever , what caused it ?
This world becomes something terrible .
Can `` I not understand how that is possible , for if you ask the people , wants to happen no one a war , therefore how that ?
Ten years are nothing at all in such pain .
We need dozens of year in order to forget it a small few .
It attacked my health and feel I it still .
About three or for four years I had a couple of nightmares because of the siege , but then it became better .
I went later in 2004 again to the school and had every day anxiety .
I thought of my friends and classmates , who had been killed .
Therefore I go always into the sports hall if the 1st of September more closely moves .
I want to accord my my old childhood friend tribute .
It is heavy for me , in which sports hall to go , but I must do it .
I do not feel as a victim , this story is now a part of my past .
I will not forget it , but I bemitleide myself not .
My life goes on .
I locked this year the school and visit a medical university in Wladikawkaz .
I will become heart surgeon .
My first choice was an education in the army .
I wanted to become a soldier , but my health let that not to .
I wanted to fight for my country , but that is not happened .

A miracle : Georgij Fanijew was caught during the siege on foot a homicidal terrorist , but it created it , to survive .
During the siege , it was caught in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb , that was secured to the foot of a homicidal terrorist .
It is actual a miracle that it was not killed .
`` We feel it as if it would have been yesterday , '' says Georgij , that wanted to go as a secret service officer to the FSB , but this because of its health damages based on the siege do not do could .
It is still with me , it is nothing what I let behind me .
I am now older and the people say that children can handle easily bad experiences - I must say , that does not agree .
`` 2006 I worked with psychologist and felt after that actually somewhat better , but I can not forget it .
And I would be forgotten gladly .
The first and only time was 2005 - in the year after that - that I went again into the sports hall .
I lost the consciousness .
I will not return and ask myself never again there you please to show you where I sat in this famous picture .
More surviving : Georgij Fanijew today , with a photo of itself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is enormous and I carry it every day with me .
My friends never know that I do not keep in mind gladly or speak about that and it asked me about the school .
Physically it goes me good .
I should be careful with my injured knee , but I can run now well .
But because of my health , I was not able to study at the secret service academy of the FSB in Saint Petersburg how I wanted .
I have my documents , also the medical sent in and answered it that it would not be possible .
The animals were my second passion , therefore I went at the veterinary institute .
I have there already two years behind me .
It learns the treatment of all animals `` from cats to cows '' .
It said : `` I knew that I never would report my children of my experiences .
About that children should know nothing and obviously also should not suffer it it .
Its mother Marina , 42 , said : `` This pain never leaves me .
It is in my soul , worse if the anniversary more closely moves .
I will go to the ceremonies for remembering .
I know that Georgij will not go .
It does n't have to be more violent for it yet much because it was there and I .
I waited at home for it and was not able to help .
I am God so grateful that he was returned me . Here in Beslan , everyone of them is drawn .
It remains in us .
Georgij is now an adult , but this horror is still in it .
It is heavily , to accept that if one somewhat so unfair strikes .
He is a boy , he likes sport , but he can not participate because of its knee .
It was operated repeatedly , it can run , but can drive no sport .
I would say that it overcame the horror to 50 % , but one can overcome and forget that never totally .
This terrible experience always will pursue us .
Many friends and neighbors were killed in the siege and that reinforces only my pain .
I lost many people , whom I knew well and who were expensive me .
My son is with me , and that is the largest gift that God was able to make me , but my heart cries around the killed .
I know of families , in which new children were born , but also of widows , who married never again .
It is to be accepted heavily that life goes on , also if one does not want that .
I never am forgotten how my heart burst in me , when I saw it in the hospital .
And now I see advances , what in the world - wars in other regions .
For what do these people fight ?
Why are they killing itself mutually ?
The war is not our country now very near and I can that almost believe .
Were we can be earlier a friendly country , how it that we fight now ?
People and children suffer , I am certain that in the Ukraine already many children were killed and yet many are killed .
If we could grasp and throw out only all these rebels - so far away like only possible .

On the hop castle in the castle garden festival was happening at the Saturday a few things .
The draft of the organizers agreed .
In spite of the strong downpour on Saturday evening approximately 1200 music fans to the opus-Air-festival in the castle garden came .
Occasionally the entrance had to be stopped .
`` That was annoying '' , said Ron Sem , one of the organizers .
Salt frond l light and joke .
Out of two Spanish words , Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem formed the name Amula .
Brightness should for that opuses Air in the Salzwedeler castle garden at the day and in the evening through various shows radiate .
Well , and the joke comes anyway of alone .
That appeared already from the early Saturday when the first visitors to the opus Air opened themselves .
The organizers had promised a festival for all generations .
And that is arrive them .
All around the provision states on the castle garden meadow had itself it Salzwedeler , but also guests out of the nearer and further environment cozily made .
They pursued the first live entrances , wippten with the foot in the tact , wetted cool drinks - shortly : Relaxation pure and enjoyment were announced .
And that diagonally through the generations .
During itself the one sand white on covers on the extra angekarrten at the beach bar lümmelten , other itself at one-quarter wine in the Vinothek labten , raged the new generation on the hop castle , that was a large attraction point for the smaller guests .
But also in the child make-up , the voluntary helpers in the truest sense of the word had all hands fully to do in order to become the press gentleman and to do magic imagination full creations into the small faces .
The larger used the Kickertische or were involved in a Skateboard workshop that the Goodfoot Crew aligned out of salt frond .
Until the large rain came .
Shortly before 17.30 clock , it beat down sought on the visitors , above all families the expanse and dry .
This did yet the attractiveness of the festival no discontinuance .
`` It came more people than expects '' , said Ron Sem , that spoke about a `` success on the entire line '' .
Therefore would stand a repetition of the large party in the coming year toward nothing .
Although at contents and size of the Events yet worked will must , Sem in a first balance made on Sunday vis-à-vis the people voice clearly .
As annoying it designated that meanwhile the entrance had to be stopped .
Obviously the security firm had been booked with too little powers .
The consequence : Many that already had paid came no longer on the terrain .
The resonance had been very good .
In a first careful estimation , the Salzwedeler with organizer of about 1200 visitors , that romped about in the castle garden , spoke .
There was problems in the tone technology .
The Salzwedeler hiply-Hop-volumes Blocks`n`Rox interrupted unnerves its entrance therefore .
The technicians were not in a position , to create a half-way sensible Sound .
The planned Shisha Lounges could not be constructed because the tents could not be brought because of a tire breakdown after salt frond .
`` In the next year become it however at the same time be '' , so the organizer .
The premiere of the Amula-opus-Airs was of the numbers of visitors more than arrive .
And that in bad weather .
To be sure the organizers committed some mistakes , removes will must , that yet are forgiven in the first time , but in the second levy .
Also in the social network Facebook , the organizers must put away criticism .
`` Sorry , but for twelve Euro has one simply more expects '' , expresses itself Melanie Meier on the organization side .
`` You have you unfortunately a little received '' , means Ele carpenter at same place .
Others do not see the initial problems very so closely .
I find it very good that many not only stupidly talk nonsense , but rather also really try to place something on the legs .

Now a year time remains the organizers in order to turn down these points of criticism .

In that came the answers black women compare to shortly after the shots of the 9th of August the personal essays with title such as `` thought to Ferguson of a white woman '' and `` feminism revolves not only around the suppression of women '' comparatively late .
But for Perez , the one important variation meant .
`` I do not believe that one finds in the feminism many people , who , over the white are and speak privileges on so hochklassige type , '' said it .
The people felt pressed in addition to express something to the occurrences .
It is characteristic of the crisis , in which we find us and because the situation is in Ferguson so ethnisiert , that they must express that .
For English professor Koritha Mitchell of the Ohios State University brought Ferguson problems at the light , which black Americans are stopped every day , that however as a `` woman subjects '' in the cultural room are not observed .
`` I can publish something funny on Facebook over me and my partner and get 150 Likes of everywhere here , '' said Mitchell .
If I post somewhat about , how colored in its own country stand under siege , the being quiet is deafening .
`` How can it not be certain for women to speak publicly over a relation , but over security in the public room '' ? asked it .
For black women such as Mitchell , the race , sex and sexuality in the story of the USA studied have , gives it no Dichotomie between race problems and sex problems .
For it , black women had not the luxury to separate the subjects cleanly ; they live every day in the combined reality .
While white women connect now the subjects of races and sex in the feminist Mainstreamkreisen , says Angela Hattery , professor for women and sex investigation at the George Mason University that its predecessors did the opposite .
`` Between 1865 and 1890 , at least 10,000 black men were lynched and was the establishment almost always the rape of a white woman , '' said Hattery .
White women had to be involved in the story in order to justify the lynch murder .
For Hattery , the split between white and black women came at the point , at which white fighters assessed for the woman right to vote such as Susan B. Anthony the country in the late years of the 19th century of analyzed and , that the battle was able to be successful for the right to vote only for respectively a group : Women or black .
`` You made the decision to support the woman right to vote , and the right to vote for black later should come , '' said Hattery .
If one remembers such things , becomes one with power aware why colored women do not trust white women .
We made our job not well .
We never helped black women at the same time to protect its husbands and sons .
Also after women 1920 received the right to vote , it lasted another decade until white women against the lynching in the Association organized themselves of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching .
The group emerged ask for according to almost 40 years the original aid of sides of black women , says Mitchell .
For Mitchell , the flood of white feminist reactions is on the questions turned-up by Ferguson - police behavior , race discrimination - a mirror of the time , in which white feminists played `` catching '' with the problems , with which black women sat down since generations apart .
Would it `` not be control so seriously would take do '' crazy , if the activists , that such traditional feminist platforms the right on upbringing of a child like it that with the right on conception inspection ? asked Mitchell .
Feminists of the second generation , that constructed its career on the fight for reproduction rights and the access to contraceptive means , try to understand now , what means that .
The well known white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went two weeks to the Erschießung of Michael Brown on Facebook and published a pithy article of Rebecca Carroll , columnist of the Guardian in which she demands more protests of white Americans to the subject of racism .
`` I hope that women , the one other , but parallel reasons for that have to understand a danger characterizing the body - and opinions to the race , that in public surveys clearly differently are - the variations cite become , '' wrote Steinem .
Although Steinem stands for one sooner intersektionalen feminism , in which race subjects just as as sex subjects are addressed , some of its commentaries are astonished to the race subject in America yet .
Did Christina in the summer , researcher on the American Enterprise institute and author of `` Who stoles Feminism '' ? say vis-à-vis She The People that young men in the United States , especially young colored men , `` far vulnerableer are than its sisters , '' to its earlier criticism stand however Steinems comments to Ferguson in contrast .
There is now hunderte of special programs for girl and young women , but almost nothing for boy .
But as the white house recently a small program , My Brother 's it Keeper , put on in order to help vulnerable young black and hispanischen men , gave it annoying reactions of many feminists , under that Gloria Steinem .
The ratio of the police to that of the black Community is not the single problem that into the foreground of the Mainstreamfeminismus presses itself .
After the US boundary police took up almost 63,000 unaccompanied minor at the south west boundary of the country this year , also the subject of the immigration reform steps again at the surface - this time as a woman subject .
Andrea Mercado , Co chairperson of We Belong Together , an organization , who mobilizes women for the immigration reform , said that for a new view of the subject as an essential woman subject she had to publish solely the stories of the immigrant women .
`` These speak for itself , '' said Mercado .
If the large majority of the work visas goes at masculine immigrants , are the women , who accompany it , in a position , in which they are susceptible for domestic force and exploitation .
`` These stories find a reverberation in the woman organizations , '' said it .

A gentleman enjoyed furthermore a head massage of its partner : It earned `` that , secured '' in the end it today already jumped off bicycle chains again .
Meanwhile the mayor and the business leader yet had to work : They became interviews at the well before the Trinkkurhaus of reporter Rainer Janke and used the opportunity to advertise in the radio for bath salt Hausen .
Also graduation boss Tobias cultivated , since the first hr4-Radtour 2004 as a tour leader at the same time , was able to have a breather only shortly , had he yet amply with the technology on the spot to do .

`` The large part of the participants comes from the Rhine-Main-zone '' , told he , `` but also out of pouring or Fulda , out of sound stream or the Taunus and even out of numerous cities in Westphalia cyclists traveled .

Why `` Guardians became no box-office hit of the Galaxy ''
`` The Expendables 3 '' of Sylvester Stallone balanced out less than 30 million dollars of its 90 million dollar budget in the USA , during '' Sin city : A lady to Kill For '' solely 12 million dollars of its budget of 70 million dollars balanced out .
The film tailored on Cameron Diaz `` sex Tape '' balanced out easily made disappoint 14.6 million dollars at the opening weekend solely , during child film such as `` Drachenzähmen 2 '' also in the revenue .
An article of the telegraph film critic Robbie Collin indicates that in the child film the lack of quality could be in the films themselves the reason .
Collin designated 2014 as a `` the worst year '' previously for child film and described easily made `` Drachenzähmen 2 '' as pure '' functional '' Fantasy continuation .
Target group somewhat older in films for one seems it however so as if the quality of the films is not unconditional the problem .
In July Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore- and Metacritic estimation for every summer film start , that was shown between the American Memorial Day and the 20th of July 2013 and in the course year on at least 2000 linens .
The results rely on the opinion of the movie theater visitors and film critic and point on that there that this year 's film hits which are the past year equivalent .
Some commentators my that the development is to be attributed to self-changing see habits and the growing popularity of web-streaming-services such as Netflix .
Director Jon Favreau , that works presently appearing Dschungelbuch film at Disneys soon , said Hollywood vis-à-vis the web page reporter : `` I believe , the times change '' .
We must accept and not try that to follow the past .
In contrast to the presently weak cash register results of the Hollywood productions , Netflix obtained most recently revenues with the streamings contents in the amount of 1.2 billion dollars , almost twice as much like in the past year , in which the revenue 837 million dollars amounted to .
In the last summer , the director criticized Steven game mountain the film studios that it too very on filming of comic strips of concentrated itself and prophesied a `` kernel enamel '' Hollywoods .
In the light the present downswing seen argue some commentators that its gloomy prophecy could contain thoroughly a true kernel .
Based on that in the summer 2015 to expecting potential box-office hit , under that Avengers : Age of Ultron , min ion and Jurassic world are other representatives of the film industry however more optimistic :
The maker of X Men , Simon Kinberg , described the decline of the cash register results recently as simple `` cyclic '' and said reporter vis-à-vis Hollywood : `` The next summer will be the largest summer at the movie theater cash register generally , and no one will worry '' more around the business .

4 Tips for better lower water photos and video
If you would like to make gladly photos or videos under water , there is a selection at devices .
The most low-priced option is a watertight Point-and-Shoot how the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an Action Cam such as the GoPro HERO3 + Silver edition , that both are to be had for about 300 $ .
I received these photos in a family festival with several cameras , that are all to a price of less than 350 $ available .
There is independent of the equipment a couple of rules for the best results .
Control your equipment twice .
Also if you have a watertight camera , reassure yourself that the battery compartment and other specialties thickly are locked .
Adjust your camera also to the photos or videos , that you want to receive .
Some cameras and video camcorder control scene modes and reception modes , with which the exposure time is optimized for the dämmrigen lower water conditions .
And before you jump in , you test , into which depth your equipment is operable .
Some cameras are only for up to 5 feet allowed , other until 50 or 60 feet .
Search in our purchase leader and the estimations for digital cameras for conventional and watertight models .
If make multiple reception - because many will not work out .
Point-and-Shoot-cameras do not control a LCD , with which you can compose pictures , Action Cams normally .
Also if you have a LCD to look at is it difficult , this under water , and the correct picture attitude a matter of luck is .
Therefore you make many receptions .
If your camera controls a row mode , with which a row are made by receptions with easily changed exposure attitudes , you use it .
Remain near the surface .
The light will remove yourself dramatically worse , ever further you of the surface .
If you possible remain include in make therefore close to the surface , if you a pool , a lake or the sea .
Through it you can bring also more color into your photos ; the more deeply you go , the less color you will see .
Approach close to the objects .
That is also at country a good advice , but it is under water all the more more important because of the bad lighting conditions .
It is very especially important if you work with an Action Cam : These devices control often a firm wide-angle lens , what means , that you should must poet at your objects up to , if these should fill out the entire picture frame .

Judge stops temporarily law that all abortion clinics in Louisiana to the closing could force
A US federal judge stopped on Sunday provisionally the conversion of a law in Louisiana of which lawyers say , that it would have led probably to the closing of all five abortion clinics of the country .
This measure , that by Bobby Jindal , governor of Louisiana , in June to the law raised became and step should on the 1st Sep effective , would become physicians , that carry out abortion , in addition force to acquire a patient reception right in a hospital within a radius of 30 miles around its practice .
The decision of the judge means however that the physicians can carry out provisionally further legal abortion , while they apply for such a right .
`` The complainants can continue work on law in conformity while they strive for the acquisition of these rights , '' wrote federal judge John deGravelles in its judgment .
Within a month , a hearing is prepared for the judge in order to induce a more durable decision for the law .
Abortion advocate of welcomed the decision , that youngest in a row of judgments against similar measures said and , that physicians would win so more time in order to attain hospital introduction rights .
`` The current decision means that the women in Louisiana escape an insidious law , that wants to take them its health and its rights , '' said Nancy Northup , president and chairperson of the center for reproduction rights , that had complained in the name of three of the five clinics of the country , in order to delay the law .
It was not directly clearly whether the judgment extended also on the physicians out of the two clinics , that had not joined the complaint and had applied for also introduction rights .
Louisiana is one of 11 countries that similar laws released , whereby courts declared recently such measures in Alabama and Mississippi to be not constitution appropriate for .
Key places of a law in Texas , that that of the clinics remaining in the country would have forced to the closing , were stopped by a federal judge on Friday .
Abortion advocate and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists as well as the American Medical Association say concurring that introduction rights demand restrictions unnecessary by physicians .
Abortion opponents hold that toward that the measures serve the protection of the health of the women , although some welcomed also the effects of a closing of clinics .
Only a physician , who in Louisiana abortion carries out , controlled patient one manner rights , divided the center for reproduction rights with .
If all remaining physicians in the country are forced in addition , to carry out no more abortion , this physician would carry out the operation out of anxiety around its security no longer , said the group .
In its argumentation against the judgment , representatives of the country Louisiana said that it no physicians would punish because of the execution of abortion , while its proposals would be yet pending on Patienteneinweiserechte .

Novel highly praised new exclusive statement out of Howard Jacobsons over love and the letter `` J '' .
They dissolved , was able to describe one it best , solved it themselves slowly on like a carton , that one has stand let in the rain .
Occasionally a woman said it , it would be too serious , strenuous , intensively , dissociates and perhaps something kratzbürstig .
The hand and shook it then .
It knew Kratzbürstig .
It was thorny , like in hedgehog , yes .
The last victim of this thorny-ness had been was brought would have a just beginning affair , that very promising for a relief of the solitary boredom of its life as otherwise , and it perhaps even a certain contentment .
Ailinn Solomons was was even yet remote and rougher rubbed a trembling delicate beauty with untamed hairs and a fluttering heart out of a village on the north island , that than a Port .
It had come had with an older accompaniment to south , was inherited had that considered Kevern to be its aunt , and that a plot of land in a damp however heavenly valley with the appropriate name Paradise Valley .
Over several years , no one had lived in the house .
The pipes were were had left behind and believed leak , in the baths yet spiders , naked snails its traces on all windows , would belong that of all to them , and the garden was overgrow with weeds , that looked like gigantic cabbage heads .
It was like the house out of a child fairy tale , both threateningly like enticing , a garden of full secrets .
Portrait of the author : Howard Jacobson whose novel `` J '' stands on the Longlist for that one Booker price 2014 .
The Shortlist is announced in the coming week .
Kevern had sat with Ailinn hand holding on the broken deck chairs in the high grass and had wetted an unusually warm spring afternoon . Both had linken absent-minded up with the service console , that furnished the country with calming music and soothing messages , when the view of its crossed brown legs reminded one it of an old song of an a long time forgotten black entertainer , that its father had listened gladly in closed roll stores in the house .
Your feet are too large .
Based on its inherent aggressiveness , songs of this type were played no longer on the console .
Forbidden simply not played - nothing not so correctly was forbidden - .
It became successful obsolesziert , so like the word obsoleszieren .
The general taste created , select , what directives and directions never would have created , and like the people in books the Vom-Tellerwäscher-zum-Millionär-Memoiren , cookbooks and love novels , selected it in the music the ballad .
In the euphoria of the day , Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and in a coarsely strange serenade Ailinns large feet to besingen .
Ailinn did not understand that .
`` That was a well known song of a jazz pianist by the name of Fats ramparts , '' declared it its and put automatically two fingers at its lips .
Its father always had done that in order to stop the letter J before he came out of its mouth .
It had begun as a game between it and its father when he was yet small .
Its father had played it with its own father , had told he .
If you begin a word with a J , without putting two fingers over your lips , it costs you a Penny .
It had been already at that time no very funny game , and it was also now not very funny .
It knew , expects became that this of it , that was all .
It had to explain , what jazz was .
Ailinn had heard never which .
Jazz became , also if it was not forbidden directly , not played .
The improvising was no longer modern .
It was only place for an only `` if '' in life .
The people wanted to be certain entire at the beginning of a melody where it would end .
Just as the intellect .
Its unpredictable-ness made the people nervously .
And jazz was musically expressed intellect .
Although it had become 10 years old , without having heard of Sammy Davis junior , knew Kevern something over jazz of the half secret collection of old CDS of its father .
But at least it did n't have to explain Ailinn that Fats ramparts was black .
In its age , she was not able to remember probably a time , in which pop singers were not black .
Again counted , no laws or compulsions .
An in conformity company meant that each element of this company agreed gratefully with to the principle of the group aptitude - gratefully like that of the fate of spared .
People with afro Caribbean origin were suited through temperament and physique for support and sport , therefore they sang and raced .
People , who came originally of the Indian subcontinent , were like of nature with electronic talent blessed and were looked after with the task , to guarantee that no family remained without functioning service telephone .
What was remaining yet of the Polish partnership , attended to the sewer system ; what was remaining of the Greeks , plate smashed .
That out of the gulf countries and the Levante , whose grandparents the country quickly left had not as WHAT EVENTS WAS IF IT happened WAS out of fear TO EVENTS to be accused because of Feuerschürens , out of fear even that the flames would consume it next - had Labneh- and Shisha-pipes-restaurants opened , held considers itself and became with the inactivity depressive .
Every after its capacities .
Because it had belonged to only ballad , it fell Ailinn heavily , to understand , become could like the insulting words , that just had sung before Kevern its , per vertont .
Music was expression of love .
`` That are not really insulting , '' said Kevern .
Except perhaps for people , whose feet are too large .
My father never insulted someone , but he loved this song .
It spoke too much , but that neglected gave garden it the deceitful feeling of security .
Was nothing able to overcome the sound insulation of the gigantic cabbage-like leaves .
Ailinn did not understand still .
Why would your father have should so something dear ?
It wanted to say that it was a joke , hesitated however to put in its present again two fingers at the lips .
It thought anyway already that it was somewhat strange .
`` Appear amusingly to it , '' said it instead .
It shook unbelieving its head and blocked Keverns visibility .
There was in the entire world nothing other to see when its ungekämmtes crow black hair .
There was nothing what it would have wanted to see otherwise .
`` If you say it , '' mine it without conviction .
But that does not explain yet why you sing before me it .
They seemed honestly concerned .
Are my feet too large ?
It looked once again .
Your feet so directly not .
Perhaps your knuckles , a small little ...
Do and you say hates me , you because my knuckles are too thick ?
Do you hate ?
Naturally I do not hate you .
That is yet only the stupid song .
It would have been able to say `` I dear you '' , but for that it was yet too early .
`` Your thick knuckles are exactly the reason why you please me , '' tried it it instead .
I am there a little perverse .
That did not sound correctly .
It had strangely be should .
If he tried to be strange , he brought himself often in difficulties because he did not control like its father the calming Charm , that one needed , around the cruelty inherent in jokes to bezähmen .
Perhaps wanted to be be also cruel father .
Perhaps it wanted to be , Kevern , that .
In spite of its friendly eyes .
Ailinn Solomons became red and rose out of its deck chair , threw the console over and spilled the wine that they had drunk .
Elder blossom wine , therefore drunkenness was no apology for it .
In its excitement , they seemed to tremble , like Palm frond in the storm .
`` And your stubbornness is exactly the reason why I feel moved perverse to you , '' said it ...
Except , that I am that not at all .
It harmed it , both because of the unnecessary unfriendliness of its words such as the fear , that appeared in its eyes , when she resisted herself against it .
Did it think that it would strike it ?
It had not told it of life on the cold northern archipelago where it had grown up , but it had no doubts that it was essentially so like here .
The same gigantic and icy ocean broke itself here like there at the bank .
The same confused men , with even thicker skin and more annoyed after THAT WHAT EVENTS had been were than it its ancestors as a smuggler and beach robber , pulled from tavern to tavern , always ready to raise the hand against a woman , that denied itself them or verlachte .
Stubbornness ?
That would have shown it a thick fist if it did not pay attention !
Strike knutschen first you - Knutschen was the most frequently used word for an erotic attractive force between men and women , an antidote to the meaningless love ballads out of the console - it first knutschen and then .
After Keverns view , the one unnecessary refinement was because the Knutschen represented even already an act of the force .
Ailinn Solomons gave to go it through its body a sign .
He rose out of the deck chair such as an old man .
It felt also leaden , but the force of its sorrow surprised it .
That was not the end of the world .
They knew themselves yet hardly .
It watched removed herself it , like he - so like of a room on the upper floor its companion it at the same time watched - a man , burdened through something , what he himself had conjured up .
Adam leaves the garden , thought it .
It felt a sudden pain for it and men in general although some had raised its hands against it .
Did a man turn away of its , its back bended , embarrasses himself , overcomes , without battle spirit - why was that a view that they seemed to know well , if she not was able to remember yet a single time , at that it so something the current day ago already once seen had ?
When it was again alone , Ailinn Solomons looked at its feet .
Esme nut tree , an intelligent and enthused 32-year-old researcher did not work some years before the just told incidents on behalf of Ofnow , that legislative supervision organ for the public mood , at a short presentation over the continued force on low and middle level in exactly the province , in which its reduction if abolition , at that soon to not to expect been become , in consideration of the moneys and energy , that become invests into the extermination of this force Were .
`` Much was done already , and much yet must be done to soothe wrote it , `` around the innate aggressiveness of a people , that waged wars thousand and that therefrom won has , especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country , in which the sweet breath of human kindness historically was seen rarely perceived in spite of the high towering steeples between the sterns .
But some characteristics turn out as ineradicable .
The more highly the steeple , seems it , the slighter the passion that it wakes further .
The population cries in the hearing of sentimental ballad , becomes intoxicated at stories over overcome difficulties and maintains to believe firmly in the virtues of marriage and family life , but nevertheless there considers is not only the earlier raw-ness the rural communities just as as our municipal structures firmly in the hand , but rather also records to be the emerging of a new and insidious contentiousness at home , at the job , on the streets and even on the playing fields .
`` You have an unfortunate tendency to the exaggeration , '' meant its mentor when he had read the entire report .
I propose that you read less novels .
Esme nut tree sank its head .
Must I ask also : you are atheist ?
`` I believe , I do n't have to say that , '' answered Esme nut tree .
Are you lesbian ?
Again Esme referred to its right on privacy and denial of the statements .
Feminist ?
Again being quiet .
`` I ask that not , '' said Luther Rabinowitz in the end , `` because I would be against atheism , Lesbentum or feminism .
That here is an unprejudiced job .
We serve an unprejudiced company .
But certain types of Hypersensibilität , that are absolutely acceptable and commendable at itself , can occasionally results how you introduced it , distort .
You yourself have could be interpreted obviously prejudices against the church , and these things , that you `` raw '' designate as `` insidious '' and , by other just as well as an expression one naturally power and vitality .
If one ride around further on that , WHAT EVENTS IS IF IT IS EVENTS , as if it had happened , if it , yesterday happened would be , means to take the country its essential vigor .
Esme nut tree looked around itself while Rabinowitz spoke .
Behind its head repeated a LED writing train in flamingo pink the pieces of advice that Ofnow more long had given the country in the last quarter century or .
If smile at its neighbor , appreciate its partner , hear ballad , visit musicals , use explain its telephone , you speak , you , you hear to , you agree , apologize .
Speaking is better than a being quiet , the sung word is better than the written , but is nothing better than a love .
`` I understand absolutely whereon you want out , '' answered say Esme nut tree with quiet voice when it certainly was , that its superior had spoken to end , `` and I nothing other when that we are not healed yet so effective , how we show ourselves .
My apprehension lie therein that we regain ourselves without warning if possible at the same time , how we repeat the mistakes , that generally first to THAT WHAT EVENTS IS , IF IT led IS EVENTS .
It are not this time however the other at which we leave out our fury and our mistrust .
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with the hands .
In order to indicate therewith an angel patience .
`` You go too far , '' said it , `` if you actions as '' mistake '' designate , that our grandparents not also committed perhaps or .
They go also too far if you speak therefrom , that these left out its `` fury '' and its `` mistrust '' at `` other '' .
It should be actually not necessary to remember someone in your position that we do not speak in the understanding of the past such as in the protection of the present , about `` us '' and `` other '' .
There were gave no `` we '' and it no `` other '' .
It was a time of the disorder , that is all what we know .
`` Of that if we are honest to us even , '' ventured maintain can Esme to throw in , `` no part of the company to have behaved well .
I accuse no one .
Whether it was done bad or well , what happened , happened .
That was at that time .
In addition must nothing be said more - there are us we united .
And exactly like no guilt shown will must , must be deleted also no guilt if such a cancellation would be appropriate and if there would be a way to delete it .
But to what the past serves if we do not learn from that -
The past serves in addition that we forget it .
If I may say in addition something -
Luther Rabinowitz let collapse its pyramid .
`` I will consider its report , '' said it and released it .
At the next day when it went lived how to the work , it became run over of a motorcyclist , gone was who how passersby described , in a type of `` brutal fury '' on the footpath .
There are chances .

It is actual more philosophical testimony as a biography , what put constant alarm , singer-songwriter , pacifist , politsicher activist , former prisoner , in `` monk and warrior '' on 287 sides on paper .
Chronologically , but rather more thought shred for thought shred the citizen of Munich born at the 1st of June 1947 did not write down its memoirs , initiated each chapter by a suitable song text .
And it is there protectionless honest : Of the masturbation as a Gymnasiast to the shoplifting and drug consumption , it leaves out no human weakness .

Tax load of businessmen in the room Washington climbs with the economic recovery
A recovery of the economy means more customers , more Verkäufe and new jobs .
It means also higher taxes .
National and local tax replies for business in the country increased in the past year easily while the economic recovery sped up , such a newly published study in the past week , and the firms in the room Washington formed no exception .
Jointly 27.6 billions paid business in the room District , Maryland and Virginia $ at national and local places in the fiscal year 2013 , a climb around 3.8 percent vis-à-vis the revenue of 2012 in the amount of 26.6 billions $ .
The national and local tax burden of the businesses climbed in the past year around 4.3 percent on 671 billions $ on , in comparison with 3.9 percent per year before , and it was the third growth year in consequence after the replies 2009 sinking several years and 2010 .
National taxes climbed more strongly at than the local duties , around 4.3 percent , so the study , that was carried out by the service agency seriously & Young with the center for national taxation , a tax politics group .
More than the half of the tax collections of the District , 56 percent , comes from business tax while 36 percent of the revenue Marylands come from business .
Virginia obtains the slightest tax collections with 28 percent out of business .
A large part of the climb in the tax collections is established in a recovery of the real estate values of the businesses , say the researchers , what led to an increase of the real estate tax around 3.7 percent per year after the three successive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent .
During a large part of these profits out of large countries such as California , New York and Texas came , seems to be true the flow also for the room Washington .
Business in the District , Maryland and Virginia 2012 - paid jointly a climb in the course of a year over 10 billions $ at national and local real estate taxes in the past year , in comparison with 9.6 billions $ around 4.2 percent .
But the apparent recovery in the real estate value is not in Maryland so effective in the increase of national and local tax collections because here the real estate tax amount to itself on tightly more than one-fifth of the tax replies of business .
Business in Virginia and D.C. pay almost the half of its national and local taxes in the form of real estate tax .
`` In Maryland , following happens : a large part of the real estate , especially in the tax zone around D.C. , is either in the possession of the government or of Non-profit-organizations , that pay no real estate tax , '' said Douglas Lindholm , manager of the center on State Taxation .
Maryland is forced therefore to depended for example much more on the income tax , around which to be able to offer same services , that other countries offer .
The youngest recovery in the tax collections through business can not be assigned alone the recovery of the real-estate market
Business revenue seem to recover also , so the data .
Business in the region reported over income tax in country organizations of 2.3 billions $ in comparison with 2.1 billions per year 2012 .
Maryland took 1 billion $ in business income tax on , the highest sum of the region .
During the trend into the same direction goes , climbs the local tax load for business not at all three places uniformly on .
The Anstiegsrate in the District corresponded with 4.3 percent while the climb in Maryland was clearly higher , 4.9 percent to the national average .
Only Virginia reported a below average tax recovery of 4.1 percent .
Virginia has the clearly slightest business income taxes ( in all three gives it firm business tax rates ) with 6 percent in all three jurisdictions .
The business tax rate in Maryland is about 8.25 percent and in the District in comparatively high 9,975 percent .
A comparable study of the US chamber at the beginning of this year showed that in Virginia slighter national and local business tax are demanded and altogether a better tax climate rules than in Maryland .
In the study , the District was not examined .
In spite of the advantages , Virginia is under pressure through its southern neighbor .
North Carolina dismissed laws to the decline of its business tax rates this year of 6.9 percent to 6 percent , that same sentence such as Virginia , and the sentence sink becomes in the coming year to 5 percent .
If the country reaches further its income goals in the coming year , this law could reduce the business income tax rate of the country until 2017 until to 3 percent .
In the meantime , it seems to go Washington better to the small businesses in the room , and they pay therefore more taxes national and local , so the youngest study .
Business tax , that as a personal income tax by small businessmen paid become climbed - a transition structure , after that most small businesses organized are - in the District , Maryland and Virginia in the past year around 20 percent on 2.4 billions $ on , a clear faster growth rate than the business tax altogether .
The researchers say that the trend and the climb will stop in the business taxes in the entire country probably this year , with an increase of the general more defense tax collections for the country and the local governments around 6.2 percent in the first three quarters 2014 in comparison with the same period of the preceding year .
Nevertheless the room could Washington afterwards lame if the edition abridgment of the Federal Government affects the labor market in the region .

The society boards of directors confirm that Torsten Sjöberg ( castle society ) and Herbert Piffl ( castle friends ) on demand of our newspaper .
`` I have Mr. Piffl called and proposed , that we us once put together could '' , reports Sjöberg .
In its opinion , all members of both societies could pull in the future again at a cord .
So more quickly visible successes are to be indicated .
While the castle friends had around the suddenly deceased Richard Dimbath until finally a reconstruction of the castle at the mountain forest in mind , the `` development and Erlebbarmachung '' of the terrain stands for the castle society around Sjöberg at frontmost place .

Matthies means : Highest time for large networking
In view of the galloping technical progress , that threatens to change our comfortable home in High-Tech-control centers , our columnist Bernd Matthies with some extremely trusted electronic accessories comforts himself .
While I write that here , my view falls of the self-coiling cable , that connects the listener with the telephone , and I think : Is Boah , like retro that then ?
But behind it a consideration sticks : If the cable were not , all listeners would fly around here in shortest time abandoned in the house , and that would be yet significantly more retro .
Does anyway count yes on the ekeltronischen ( ekeltronischen ?
No , typing error : electronic ) sector the rule that the world novelty of today the electro scrap of tomorrow is , bought - becomes obsolete .
And who for example today another tube television in the living room has , says that therewith solely that it basically rejects television .
Why these considerations ?
Because the crowding of the Ifa brings to the attention of us at the radio tower in this week again our absolute incompetence in questions of the electronics .
The layman , that blindly controlled early washing machine and CD player , grasps today not once the purpose of the devices , that are spread with inconceivable vain expert language before it : `` Connected home , Wearables , Health Care and urbanly technologies '' promises us the press place .
Is yes , it going yet ?
About what should one speak with people , who spread evidently voluntarily such curds ?
In the reason , it has gone yes for about 20 years above all therefore that we should network please our house .
So that the yogurt itself reorders itself , so that the Brandmelder in the vacation announces us on the Malediven , that it burns degree in the work room .
It and were not wonderful if we of the office out of the air-conditioning on our early arrival ... ?
Yes , that prefaces to be sure an air-conditioning .
But a dream becomes very certainly soon true : We lift our watch , say its loud `` sucking ! '' - And at home the dust aug robot departs .
Crazy .
Everything runs out on nothing slighter than a revolution : `` The boundaries between white and brown good blur '' , whispers an industry connoisseur , one the washing machine can connect with some headphones , sends shows that steam cooked the weather report and the data glasses on how long yet needs the pizza in the oven , what utilizes however nothing , because we stand in the obstruction .
Out of the daily practice , we know moreover : If a new-fangled device is needed once really urgently , the rechargeable battery is guaranteed empty .
What a further reason is that the self-coiling cable will survive at the telephone also the next radio shows .

Children need roots and wing
It was 44 years in the school service , therefrom 23 as a school leader .
Out of this time , Manfred judge knows many stood Petershausener and Kollbacher out of its time as a student .
Its methods were carried sometimes unorthodox , but always of its striving to see in the student the person .
The Schneekoppe is the best known mountain of the giant mountains .
Manfred judge loves the painting with the subject out of its homeland .
Judge was born 1930 in Trautenau/north bohemian , today Trutnov .
Already with 14 , he was interested after four years waiter school in the teacher occupation .
A year after that the Sudeten Germans were expropriated .
Within a half hour , the family had to leave its house .
After some months in a warehouse , it went 1946 to Bavaria - in the goods car .
So verschlug it judge into the upper Franconian depression village .
The teacher development took place in Bamberg .
In addition Manfred judge had to run six times ten kilometers to the next railway station per week , had to go with which train go to Bamberg , there three kilometers diagonally through the entire city to the school and evenings back .
After two months , Manfred judge in a red-cross-home in Bamberg got a sleep opportunity : together with up to 15 fellow pupils in a dormitory .
It made 1951 the first and 1954 after three years scholar office applicant the second country examination .
Because Upper Franconia had no free scholar generation for it , he applied himself to Upper Bavaria and came on the 1st of November 1954 at the school in Kollbach .
The `` Miss room '' was its first `` service dwelling '' in the school house .
It related 1958 in the new built teacher house next to the school a three-room-service dwelling .
This house bought Manfred judges 1980 after the school had been dissolved in Kollbach 1968 .
Until there , there were three classes and in Peter Hausen five in Kollbach in the school association Peter Hausen Kollbach .
From the school year 1968/69 , these in Peter Hausen in the current city hall were summarized .
When the school association was established indian village , the elementary school in the place remained only .
In order to escape a Rückstufung in the school smaller now , the at that time chancellor Georg Sigl changed after Karl field - and Manfred judge became be successor .
Yet Peter Hausen grew , and so the children and its teachers were able to relate as of September 1982 the current building , that was expanded 1997 after judge retirement .
Manfred judge praises the straightforward generosity of the at that time mayor Ludwig Götz , that let construct on community costs in addition a work room and in the expansion 1997 cellar rooms , although that was not after the guidelines subsidy capable for Schulbauten .
`` Mayor Götz was very school friendly '' , remembered judge gratefully .
In its entire career , Manfred judge never forgot the speech contribution of a government representative , that had answered on a report of a schools inspector over right and justice : `` One never may forget '' the love . Manfred judge transferred , what he had heard there as a young teacher .
`` One two kinds must give the children : Be rooted and wing '' , says that today 84-Jährige .
And it had to learn : `` That does not succeed always '' . Whether it means there only its student or just as its own six children , is not entirely clear .
In every case , doing was judge sometimes unorthodox .
If students thrashed himself , they got a punishment work of it not and were condemned also not for detention .
At the expense of community couple of box gloves had get let judges two and let begin both contractor against each other , also if there should be at the same time once a violet .
To the welfare of the school , judge maintained a good relation to the at that time mayor Ludwig Götz ( Christian Socialist Union ) as a chancellor .
This moved the impartial judge after its retirement in addition to run for office 1996 at least as more last on the Christian Socialist Union list for the local council .
Yet judge was selected before on place six and stepped the Christian Socialist Union by .

Lenny Henry : My father never took me into the arm .
Said never `` I dear you ''

Its father who died when Henry 19 was , worked was limits in a factory and its ratio .
Henry rehearses it for a comedy , Rudy 's scarce Records that is based partially upon an imaginary conversation with its father and developed from the series on radios 4 .
The Soundtrack is a mixture out of Reggae and Rap , with lively melodies .
But Henry had to work itself through some difficult childhood moments .
It visited `` many '' therapies after death of its mother , and Henry is reflective over its relation to its father .
It was heavy to know it .
One never saw its face , heard only its voice : `` Stop with the noise .
Let your sister in quiet .
Move you !
I want cracked view .
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - that were already adult , when I a child was - went with it into the tavern and spoke over things , like the form of the beer glass or the beauty of a Cricketschlags .
I never had such a conversation with it .
It was a large part of my life this serious type in the corner that read the newspaper .
Recently Henry opened a foundry in Dudley , and although the conditions are better than an at times its father , he won yet an insight therein how life might have been for it .
It is now somewhat brighter , but they are dark , waft away , deep stygische mazes with flame pushes and smoke and much soot .
My father put himself earlier simply into the tub and then one slowly was able to hear it how he began to sing , because he was able to wash the foundry of itself .
When I ran around there , became clearly that it had done that for years in order to bring the meal on the table , and my attention before it became larger to me .
Nevertheless Henry grew up as a child without Liebesbezeugungen of its parents .
My father never embraced me , he never said `` I dear you '' .
First as it of my mother toward the end of its life badly went to say caught we on , `` I dear you , I dear you , I dear you '' .
Through its own daughter Billie , with Dawn French , was able to divide it the love , that it had missed as a child .
Could you stop once `` I with that dear yourself '' ?
Stop yet embracing me !
Papa , I am 22 !
With Dawn French .
Why should we not be friends ?
It is a magnificent mother .
It is married was still with French friendly , with that it 25 years .
Dawn is a good person .
Why should we not be friends ?
It is a magnificent mother .
Mother own Henrys was diabetic .
That contributed to its death .
As I therefore very , very overweight became and showed symptoms of diabetes , said must be radical my physician `` you .
Therefore I got through this fitness thing and had to make also a drastic diet in order to reverse the symptoms .
It is very heavy .
And it is strenuous .
No one eats gladly carrot .
Henrys career change appears perhaps in its elegant , shingled beard .
Since he was praised by the critics for its Othello , he is collects of the theater .
It followed the comedy of the errors , and then Fences of August Wilson .
That is be filled out have another experience as the Sitcoms and comedies , that busy work life .
It began with only 16 years when it worked in a factory .
A DJ discovered it on the stage when it wrote people imitated and to New Faces over it .
Its TV career began middle of the seventies . `` I was for a rather long time the single black imitator/Comedian on television '' .
It learned in the occupation .
I had to become not only before the eyes of the public large , but rather also of 1975 to 1985 , that learn how I was able to become an efficient joke-Erzähl-machine , while I was through television a star , and was really difficult .
Lenny 1975 in New Faces
And White Minstrel show looked possessed there its manager the stage rights at that , an easy support program , in that itself the people `` blackly painted '' , led Henry its Comedy there over five years up .
That was my family very unpleasant .
I wished somehow that it never would have happened , but I do not regret that I did it .
It was a strange , unpleasant position for me , but I cooperated on giant projects and learned how one handles a large audience .
But this `` years-long prize-winning easy column of the British distance marriage '' was also a `` grotesque parody of black people '' .
Through the introduction of figures , that the British black culture both mocked celebrated how , worked Henry in the eighties at an alternative Comedykreis .
The first row of the Lenny Henry show went 1984 on shipment , and in the ninetieses , it was among other things as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the Comedyserie boss ! well known .
Advertising , documentary , series of TV and film rolls stamped its next decade , but after its series of BBC LennyHenry . tv 2008 , he thought himself : `` What you make next , Len because it feels all so , as bring you only the time around or trittst a few on the place '' .
After that a Dokumentarserie came for radios 4 with the title What 's it so Great About ... ?
The first consequence revolved around Shakespeare .
On Shakespeare , I was regular allergic .
I never had learned something in the school correctly over it and considered it predominantly to be a domain of the middle class , white in stocking pairs of pants and a cabbage head ahead inside .
Therefore I had large anxiety before that .
Everyone that we interviewed for the show Peter hall , Trevor Nunn , Adrian Lester , judos Dench said should try `` you it once .
Do not make it badly if you do not know , whereby you speak .
Nimm a couple of the words into the mouth , and then you will understand why we love all Shakespeare so .
Henry itemized 20 lines out of Othellos of last speech for the documentary and it was enthused .
I had the feeling that I was able to create that .
It was almost , as would have someone the head finally correctly mounted me .
`` Therefore goes it , it is a serious thing , nimm it seriously , learn your text , would research a little .
The samples were brutal , and I read this piece for months before we made it .
And it was a success .
They seemed to expect a car accident , and that did not happen simply .
And soon it appeared in the comedy of the errors .
Suddenly I was was hardly able to believe in the national theater and I it .
There there was a moment when I thought , `` oh , you have you changes '' . ''
There were felt a technical mistake and Henry instinctively that it had to maintain the audience .
`` A small voice said must bridge you now 10 minutes to me '' , repair while it the computer '' . ''
Instead the stage leader announced that the presentation would go on , as soon as the problem would be solved .
I went said of the stage and anything in me `` oh , God would be thanks to '' .
I am not for that responsible .
I can leave that someone to other .
`` You play in a theater piece , therefore shelter in your role '' .
Henry in Fences at the Duchess Theatre
To learn the text for Fences was demanding .
Panic is very good , that strengthens the tendons .
Also that arrived well , it is say is therefore like a large sign of the Gods , that `` that here your determination '' . '' to me .
It says this , naturally , with a THUNDERING voice .
Therefore I remain at the same time .
I love that really .
I love it to be in a sample room .
Henry has however still the head of a Comedian - our conversation is gotten through of humorous outbreaks while it imitates again and again people .
I concluded to make no state-up-Comedy because I find , that this type of the immediate satisfaction of a hall is dangerous more fully more strangely somehow .
If one seeks that continually , one goes therewith before a wall .
I appear sometimes live in the Apollo if I am in the mood in addition , but altogether it does not give me so much like earlier .
I ask it whether it will make ever again a state-up-Comedytour .
The joke , that I have in a room with a director , that helps at the same time , a beginning to form a means part and the end of a trip - I do not believe that I would like to abandon that ever again .
Is that here therefore its new incarnation ?
I think already .
I am gladly an actor .
It is fun .
One tells always a story , and that is magnificent .
Stories love I .

Putin demands the reception of `` Staatlichkeitsgesprächen '' with the east Ukraine of Kiev
The Russian Präsident Wladimir Putin according to demanded Russian published reports on Sunday that the Ukrainian government adjusts the battles against the separatists in the East of the country and directly with negotiations to that-ness '' receives `` national the disloyal region .
Its speaker Dimitri Peskow placed later clearly that Putin not therewith had meant , that the zone standing under the inspection the separatist of the east Ukraine would become a part of Russia , but rather that status newly are defined become would must vis-à-vis the Ukraine in order to give the russischsprachigen region the power to the representation of its rights and interests .
Putins proclamation at the Kiewer government to negotiations at eye level with the per Russian rebellious fits however to the strategy five months ago apparently pursued by it since the beginning the riot : Aid for the separatists in the taking in of zones and pressure on the Ukrainian government in order to enable the newly proclaimed region Novorossija factual independence for an alliance with Russia instead of with the west .
Putin convicted in an interview with the national television station canal one the Ukrainian military campaign to the back conquest of the zone held by separatist in the eastern regions Donezk and Luhansk , that were taken in in March and April , after Moscow had rummaged annexed the Ukrainian peninsula on the 18th of March .
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently the taken in zone as a `` Novorossija '' or `` new Russia '' designated , a concept that reminds one of the before revolutionary heyday of the Russian empire .
Putin referred on that , that all that , that are attack hope caught '' in the course of the campaign of Ukrainian politician for the choices on the 26th Oct and during government groups civil communities in the zones held by separatist for early peace conversations `` in its illusions , Itar Tass reported .
`` We must receive immediately detailed conversations , not only to technical questions , but rather also to the political organization of the company and the country status of the south east Ukraine in order to preserve the interests of the person living there , '' said he .
Peskow said , refer to seen become would must that Putins the national-ness in the context with the larger autonomy , that is discussed for months by the Kiewer leadership , in order to disperse fears in russischsprachigen zones that its cultural and linguistic rights would be endangerd .
Only the Ukrainian government can give the eastern zones the necessary autonomy , said Peskow .
It concerns here not negotiations between the Ukraine and Russia , said Peskow , `` because it not around a conflict between Russia and the Ukraine concerns , but rather an internal conflict in the Ukraine '' .
The clarification of the Kremlin speaker to the correction of that `` false interpretation '' of Putins comments unterstrich the claim to leadership of Russia in the contact with the separatist rebellion in the East in contrast to the direct Annektion of that rummaged , on which the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians .
Moscow would have far larger difficulties to annex the regions Donezk and Luhansk in the east Ukraine because that of the 6.5 million inhabitants are no Russians and surveys yielded out of the time before the conflict a wide majority for the whereabouts in the Ukraine .
The autonomy , that was addressed by Russian diplomat on international forums , would give give the regional governments in the Ukraine authority own trade agreement and outside relations to negotiate , and so the Kremlin de facto the control of a zone , that connects rummaged the Russian country zone with that .
The five months ago annexed peninsula in the black sea is the homeland harbor for the large part of the Russian navy as well as an important trade harbor and historic coast region .
The regions between the Rostowgebiet in Russia and that rummaged is in addition rich at mines , factories and foundry , that produce important components for the Russian military .
The Ukrainian Präsident Petro Poroshenko proposed in its speech to the inauguration on the 7th of June that the Ukrainian legislation - after reelection - additions should consider to the constitution , with which the respective zones a larger control is cleared of its finances and the status of the languages .
But its presentation of autonomy seems in sharp contrast , to which the Kremlin and the separatist rebels to stand , whose armament is reproached and for Aufstachelung Moscow .
Request last Putins at Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders at eye level , followed after a further advancing of the rebels in the past week after Russian troops and tank are penetrated over that peaceful region along the Asowschen sea into the east Ukraine previously .
The separatists supported by Russia the first step of a campaign to the acceptance of the strategic coast region received rummaged is in the hand stroke , that of security officials Ukrainian according to fears to that , the inspection by Nowoasowsk .
For this reason massive civil and military preparations started in order to secure Mariupol , a steel industry harbor with 500,000 inhabitants , that lies rummaged between Nowoasowsk and the narrow access to the peninsula .
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday in a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels and asked urgently for deeds in order to prevent a further Russian aggression against the Ukraine , an earlier Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years .
`` We stand shortly before a point , at which it gives no back more , '' Poroshenko warned .
Troops strange thousand and hunderte of strange tanks are now on the territory of the Ukraine .
The EU summit concluded no concrete actions , that leadership demanded the design of further sanction against Russia that should step in an unspezifizierten escalation of the Ukraine crisis effective .
Ukrainian soldiers must themselves of its positions in Ilowajsk retract after two Russian tank columns and 1,000 soldiers penetrated last week into the Donezkregion in order to support the belagerten separatists , said colonel Andrij Lysenko , speaker of the Ukrainian national security advice and defense advice reports on Saturday in Kiev .
The first probably 63 Ukrainian soldiers , who were included by the Russian idea in Ilowajsk , were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers , who had been taken a week ago on Ukrainian zone caught , Lysenko divided on Sunday with .

It is just so that YouTube often is named , if one wants to describe Twitch , therefore the message became that YouTube Twitch wanted to buy , somewhat bored received , a textbook example of an established technology business that buys up a potential competitor .
It is a riddle why the deal with YouTube did not come into being , because the business was ready according to reports to pay just as much like Amazon .
All , what we know in the moment about that , is these statements of Emmet Shear , president of Twitch : `` We decided us for Amazon because they believe in our Community , they divide want to help us our values and long-term visions and it at the same time to arrive '' more quickly there .
A further secret is , honestly said , the incredible follow from Twitch .
For snob such as , that explain that it dear sport to watch drive as at the same time to grasp is it heavily , the attraction , that assumes to watch other in the playing instead of even the control console into the hand to take me .
It is a thing to view a friend at 3 o'clock mornings over the shoulder while it slinks through Resident Evil , and somewhat entirely other to watch , a spinner at the same time , how he is shot 20 times one after another in Call of Duty into the head .
You now just could look at all these games .
Another problem lies therein that many of the most popular games are today egos games , therefore the watching can be without own control of the view perspective a really good prescription for headache .
I admit that the fast conduits , in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronics age graduate games entire in record time , are , entertaining .
But as long as a game masterly or humor masterly is not there , its Twitch canal is probably not so very interesting .
But what do skeptic such as I know already therefrom ?
Twitch is called of 55 million different visitor per month and is that source fourth largest by Internet traffic tip .
And how exactly does Amazon want to make from that money ?
It is heavy to imagine that Twitch is integrated so elegantly in Amazon Instant video , how YouTube Twitch simply would have been able to swallow .
But Twitch has something what would have each business gladly : Thousands of young men , who are courted as advertise customers .
How the chairperson of Twitch , Shear said , , Amazon and Twitch both `` believe in the future of the Gaming , '' and the medium does not show no signs of an atrophy , yet once - swallow - as a spectator sport .

Return to the very American ideally the labor laws as human rights
The congresswomen Keith Ellison and John Lewis brought in a legal proposal in order to establish the organization of labor unions as a civil right .
Die `` so like labor unions , die also the middle class jobs , '' said Ellison , a democrat out of Minnesota and deputy chairperson of the progressive Caucus in the congress .
Therefore I introduce proudly jointly the colleague authorization law with the civil right icon John Lewis .
This pioneering law gives workers the same legal possibilities in discrimination because of the organization of labor unions such as in other forms of the discrimination - and stops so antigewerkschaftlich adjusted powers .
The supplement of the national labor law law in order to create a possibility for a discrimination exposed workers to the organization of a labor union representation , to complain around before a civil court around justice - and around compensation or fine to received - a meaningful and necessary initiative is .
But it is with security no radical initiative - in any case not after American standard .
The best type and manner to the understanding is actual its , what Ellison , Lewis and the further sponsors of its bill propose , the connection back to a very American idea .
In spite of the setbacks , which the labor unions in the past years stopped were - in Wisconsin , Michigan and other countries in the entire country - have American once countries in the world in addition encourages to acknowledge , to expand and to keep labor law .
There was a time , at which millions of Americans yet remember , when this country named democracy , speech freedom , press freedom and the union right in a breath .
When the United States occupied Japan after the second world war , encouraged general Douglas Mac Arthur and its rod the country in addition to dismiss a constitution , that should guarantee , that the militarized autocracy Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy .
In full consciousness its that the workers and its labor unions took in in the creation of a new Japan a roll , used it a language that explicitly acknowledged , that `` the rights of the workers are '' on union and joint negotiating and actions guaranteed .
When the United States occupy after the second world war Germany , Dwight David Eisenhower pressed general and be rod the Germans to write a constitution , that would provide , that the fascism of Adolf Hitler would be replaced by a strong democracy .
In recognition of the fact that the workers would have to organize themselves , and should raise its voice in the new nation , inserted the Germans a clause , that explicitly stated : `` The right to establish unions , in order to secure and to improve the works and economic conditions is guaranteed every single and every occupation or business .
Agreements , that restrict this right or aim on that , to lessen it are are null and void ; on that aiming measures illegal .
When the earlier First lady Eleanor Roosevelt possessed the chair over the international human right commission , of which the general explanation of the human rights was sketched , how she was received 1948 by the United Nations than a worldwide agreement , Roosevelt and the other authors inserted a guarantee that `` every is right the to form labor unions to the protection of its interests or to join '' them .
Since generations , Americans accept the reason premise that labor laws of human right are .
When this country advised other countries at the same time , how one could form civil and democratic societies , declared American that the right would have to be protected on the foundation of a labor union - and on that , that this labor union then at collective negotiations as an equivalent partner with business and government places participate might - .
After these rights in America under gunfire ridden is it actually very would show to bring to the attention of itself the American ideally again , consequently the working population the right have must to unite itself and to get in a free and open company ear .
How pastor Martin Luther King Jr. fifty years ago said :
The story is a magnificent teacher .
Now everyone knows that the worker movement did not restrict the strength of the nation , but rather enlarged it .
Through the raising of the standard of living of millions people work created in wonderful manner a market for the industry and raised the entire nation on unimaginable production levels .
That that attack the work forget these simple truths , but the story preserves it .
The story remembers , and we should do that also .
The formal recognition of the labor laws as human rights - and the expansion of the protection of the civil rights as a protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representations - is a long time overdue .
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideal that largely made America in the past and redeemed the promise of democracy .

China denies Hong Kong right on government choice , demonstrators swear reward
On Sunday the Chinese parliament decided in spite of the increased calls after democratic reforms against the nomination of candidates for the choices 2017 through the Hongkonger constituency .
This action fuels probably the long announced protests in Hong Kong business district while activists led the planning and mobilization in addition within less hours after the announcement into the ways .
The decision of the Chinese people congress permits it the communist leaders basically not to reject everyone of Beijing faithful candidate .
`` That does not come unexpectedly , but it makes us yet furiously , '' said legal expert Emily tepidly , chairperson of the democratic party .
That is not that what had promised Beijing .
One designed the inhabitants of Hong Kong .
And it is clear that we have to do it with an authoritarian regime .
In its defense of the Chinese decision , Li Fei , vice secretary-general of the permanent committee of the national people congress said that the allowance of public nominations would be in the choices for the Hongkonger government to `` chaotic '' .
Since 1997 when Great Britain returned the control of Hong Kong the Chinese , promised Beijing let select the inhabitants from 2017 the government chair .
The Chinese leadership presented the decision of the Sunday as a democratic breakthrough because there are the citizens of Hong Kong a direct right to vote , but the decision makes also clearly that the Chinese leadership retains the flow through a nomination committee controlled closely by Beijing firmly in the hand .
After a new clause , only candidates `` with love are supposed to be allowed moreover to the country and love to Hong Kong '' .
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and audience most effective protests have taken place in Hong Kong for some years .
Behind the per democratic campaign in Hong Kong , the movement Occupy Central With Love and Peace whose organizers threatened therewith stands to seal off the finance district if Beijing allows no real general right to vote .
On Sunday evening hundreds of Occupy-Central-followers in the rain had met itself within less hours after the announcement before the government headquarters in Hong Kong .
In the demonstration , the organizers said that its movement had reached a new step of civil Ungehorsams and they planned protest waves in the coming weeks .
They made in addition however no nearer statements to avoid apparently around problems with the authorities .
In an Online communication , the organizers announced that the movement took `` the occupation of the headquarters district only as a last means into consideration , an action that should take place only then , if all dialogue chances are emptied and no other choice exists .
It harms us to have to say that today all dialogue chances were emptied and the occupation of the headquarters district definitively will take place .
The authorities in Hong Kong prepared themselves for days for the announcement of Beijing , and intensified security measures counted on Sunday before the government building including police powers and barricade .
The unrest becomes through the feeling of many in hung Kong reinforced that they lose slowly the control of its city .
The train of people of the mainland reinforces the competition around products and services .
Moreover the fear are awake that the values of Hong Kong such as democracy and speech freedom begin to crumble under the growing pressure of Beijing .
Some criticized the demonstrations of the Occupy-Central-movement because it would endanger the business - the lifeline of Hong Kong - .
`` The protests of which they speak could cause large economic damage , depending how many are involved on that and like long they last , '' said legal expert Regine ip that criticizes the movement for some time .
We want to stir up no fears that Hong Kong runs except inspection .
This impression is bad for investments .
The nationally controlled media China reported also recently over the democracy activists in Hong Kong as agents driven subversive by western powers .
In this summer , activists organized participated an unofficial referendum to the rights to vote , in which 780,000 people - more than one-fifth of the voters in Hong Kong .
In July ten thousands took part at one of the largest democracy demonstrations in the story of the region .

With Rona Fairhead , the BBC found perhaps the magnificent director , whom it needs .
It arrives with a proud renown train out of the bank world , the medium management and the internal circle of the Tory party .
And it has own front experience .
Your career began in the worldwide management consultation business Bain and Co. whereon it changed to Morgan Stanley , Bombadier , ICI and the medium world of Pearsons .
You chairman of the board of the Financial Times was for seven years and resigned when the uppermost post of the mother business Pearsons went at a younger masculine colleague .
Your settlement amounted to nominally almost 1 million£ .
Also its political Ranking is solid .
It became sought became David Cameron of lord Browne that recommended earlier chairperson of BP , than this after more private-sector knowledge in Whitehall : it the adviser of the cabinet .
Your husband is an earlier Tory councilor .
Already in May I described the task of the chairpeople with a poisoned cup .
Not only the BBC stands as a gigantic and complex unit in the heart of the public life , but rather there is also an internal paradoxically in its structure .
The confidence functions in two directions : after interior on the first corps of the own management hierarchy in the BBC , but also outward as a voice of public apprehension and unrest if the things incorrectly run .
That provides for a duo pole almost untenable , that demands after a complete comprehensive reform .
But which newly arriving chairperson it would risk , to begin is so complex to hit on everything and to take apart an institution , that like a Chinese dynasty while he brings himself at the same time even perhaps around its job .
It is a difficult task .
And as that would be not already enough , are interested also yet many on that to see the BBC reduced - power , money and status overtakes .
While the competition more closely moves and new technologies threaten old , comfortable securities , the standing negotiation of the license fees is connected for the BBC with special dangers .
For the modest sum of 145.50£per year the British public shops itself into the certainly largest medium business of the world .
The BBC tells a good story : it says that it reaches 96 percent of all households and everyone costs therefrom only 40 Pence per day .
And apparently the BBC climbs on the popularity scale again towards the top : 53 percent support it today , in comparison with 31 percent 10 years ago .
The Seh- and utilization habits for the BBC changed : I get nowadays message headline on my mobile phone and see missed programs later on my iPlayer .
But it remains a very beloved and notable institution .
It needs a notable chairperson - I hope , it found it .

Altogether already more died than 1500 people , cable would send stuck itself further on .
Foreign firms draw-off colleague
Everywhere in the resource rich countries , firms stop its business .
Foreign businesses such as the Stahlkonzern Arcelor with valleys draw-off its employees , several international airlines approach the concerned regions no longer .
Also the domestic dealers and farmers react : Only a few sales people yet its homeland places leave in order to provide supply .
In some zones in Sierra Leone and Liberia , that stand under quarantine , the cocoa beans and coffee beans important for the export decay among other things on the fields .

In an attitude at the new press , it contradicts statements of the manager Peer Medau and attests this to pose `` like a commander '' .

Zugeparkt becomes not at all because that intelligently can be solved like in other public parking lots meanwhile .
Think of the residents
The child manger Bergwichtel , that is on the terrain and would lead the driveway before its front door to the park cover along , should become '' according to the university president `` not impaired .
Rather it gives to consider , `` that it concerns here not only the child manger , but rather also around the residents at the confluence to the Friedrich-Streib-street and the 800 students of the neighboring secondary school .
It concerns therefore much more than around minority interests of the Mr. Medau '' , so Pötzl .
Whether the criticism of the parents adviser of the child manger , with the extension of the street Coburgs would be lost go '' entitled would be one `` the few nature left spots , `` can the reader himself decide '' .
Beginning of October wants to inform Pötzl together with the national department of building and inspection Bamberg the Stadträte about the structural development of the university until 2020 `` and address '' the meaning of the new development in this context .
Peer Medau had informed past week the parents of the child manger about the plans of the university .
Accordingly the driveway should not lead for the new park cover like previously over the campus and the Friedrich-Streib-street , but rather over the Medau mountain .
Therewith the narrow street would have to be expanded on about a kilometer length zweispurig .
According to projections of the Medaus , the traffic in the park of lock would decuple itself high rock therewith .
Of about 2000 vehicles the speech is daily .

According to the Online daily newspapers Majorca slide Rio the plaintiffs produced the office of the district attorney for corruption fight Mallorcas on Friday proofs of extortions through policemen and employee of the city Calvià .
Two further place policemen were arrested of the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the corruption accusations and are questioned jointly with Navarro of a judge .
The national Spanish daily newspaper ABC reported that the annoyed night club owners stated , the nepotism of the authorities would have serious effects on its businesses .
`` It concerns no longer the Geldverdienen , it concerns the survival , '' said one of the businessmen to the court .
Our basis of life lets out of the game .
We have nothing to lose .
Magaluf made in this summer based on a viral YouTube video international headline , in which a 18jähriger of British tourist was shown , that at 24 men during a drink tour fellatio performed .
The island authorities tried since then to stop the illegal behavior of inebriated vacationers in Magaluf in that the amount of the participants was minimized in the notorious alcohol soaked tavern tours .
The Playhouse club in which the fellatio occurrence took place was forced for a year to the closing while Playhouse and the tavern tour organizer must pay Carnage jointly a punishment of 55,000€ ( 73,000 $ ) .
The tourist places Magaluf , that is chosen above all in young British vacationers , is jump also for some accidents under alcohol influence well known , under that also the trend of the `` Balconing '' , in humans of a balcony to the other or of a balcony into the hotel pool .

Clever ways for saving in university textbooks
Because the costs amount to more for university textbooks for many students than 1,000 $ per year , the almost second semester student considered mat Schroeder a clever save idea .
It invented a lend system for books of students of higher semester and offered a nominal compensation on in order to delay the back sale .
`` My mathematics book costs normally 180 $ , but I got it for 10 $ for a semester and a Chick-fil-A-Keks , '' said Schroeder , 19 that the Covenant College in Georgia visits .
The books necessary for the last semester would have cost it 430 $ , said it .
It issued 120 $ .
The Collegeleitung announced , that students in the average issue more than 1,200 $ annually for textbooks and study material , that there would be different costs damping option for the students however .
Online stores and creative approaches such as the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of the choice for the students .
The renting of textbooks becomes more popular , and so students long can use a book a semester , frequently to a clearly more favorable price than in the purchase .
Neebo Inc , that operates more than 250 university bookshops , announced that the renting of text books had doubled itself since 2011 .
Surveys in the industry show that about one-quarter of the books in the College bookshops in the past spring semester was rented , said Neebos vice president Tevor Meyer .
Less than the half of all textbooks Association will disturb bought after statements of the trade union nationally of College in campus bookshops .
Here the multiplication table is for the best deals .
Online buy
Some new books cost Online only one-third of the price for which they are to be had in the campus bookshop .
The ninth edition of `` Calculus '' vno Ron Larwon , Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost 290 $ , can be related however in the specialized textbook retailer Chegg . com for 239.99 $ .
Needed buy
If one the notices of other or normal use traces settle nothing , needed books are a good option .
`` Calculus '' is needed to have on Chegg . com for 93.49 $ .
Dully Casaday , 25 , conclusion student at the Brigham Young University , says , issued has that he on Amazon . com 42 cents for a needed edition of `` Strategic media Decisions : Understanding The business End of The Advertising business '' .
The book was sold newly for 48 $ .
Academician such as Ingrid Bracey , leader of the University of Massachusetts at the Amherst College OF Without rampart recommended students to inquire at its professors whether earlier editions would be allowable .
Sometimes the updates are not relevant for the term papers .
In such cases , older editions can be acquired often for a fraction of the costs for the newest edition .
Except Chegg and Amazon is helped also . com of eBAY Inc a popular alternative for needed books .
Rent
The renting of textbooks is not a consideration appraise if you treat it somewhat well , on that think to return it and you the books after conclusion of the course retained would want .
They can save more than 80 percent of the costs of a newly bought beech .
A student could rent for example `` Calculus '' for the duration of a semester for about 20 $ .
Inform yourself about the determinations of the business in that you rent , also over the punishment fees , that occur where appropriate for the letter of notices , lower deletion or use traces .
Tenants paid attention : If you do not return the book , the punishment fees even can exceed the price of a new beech .
E Books
Also E Books instead of conventional textbooks are an option .
Sometimes these books are rented de facto in that an electronic license is allocated for a certain period by distributors such as Amazon . com , Chegg as well as Barnes & noble inc .
In Chegg , one can rent `` Calculus '' for 6 months for about 61 $ .
Bracey says that students in literature courses find frequently the best offers , because many classics can be downloaded nowadays free of charge , while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive .
In any case look around .
Joe Gault , 29 , that soon the Pepperdine Law School will visit , recommends the ISBN number for the price determination in books because one can be certain so to find the correct textbook .
And before an Online order , one should test , so Gault whether the book is actually available .
It learned this lesson on the hard tour .
It bought had and paid a book , that four weeks delivery time in the end the full price in the College bookshop .

Merkel speaks authority : Maut will come `` very clearly ''
Now the chancellor confesses herself once again clearly in addition .
It is not a license for all complicated details however .
Stubborn objections out of the Christian Democratic Union against the automobile Maut have the Christian Socialist Union visibly ergrimmt .
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel has would resist spoken an authority after continuous out of its Christian Democratic Union for the introduction of an automobile Maut .
To say `` around it very clearly : It stands in the coalition contract , and it will come '' , said the party chief on Monday after sessions of the Christian Democratic Unions tip groups in Berlin .
On a detailed model , Merkel determined itself however first of all not .
In the blackly red government program , `` certain parameters '' would be named .
Federal Minister of Transportation Alexander Dobrindt ( Christian Socialist Union ) had made is continued work on '' `` a suggestion , and at that now .
The NRW Christian Democratic Union persists to be sure on its no to a Maut immediately on all streets .
Merkel emphasized , also Treasury Minister Wolfgang Schäuble ( Christian Democratic Union ) would bring himself constructive into the consultations for a draft of a bill on .
Over the subject out it had spoken with Dobrindt also over further possibilities to activate more private capital for investments in infrastructure , about also in the wide volume extension .
`` There nothing at all is special at it '' . Schäuble had let on Sunday a `` mirror '' -report unkommentiert , be would test house an own draft to compensate around freeways investors with feeble revenue - after the choice 2017 .
Christian Socialist Union boss Horst Seehofer warned thereupon before that to develop feeble drafts against the leading minister in the cabinet .
Christian Democratic Union federal vice arm Laschet strengthened its objections .
`` The coalition contract went never therefrom from , all circles and main highways to bemauten '' , said the Christian Democratic Union regional chairman North Rhine-Westphalian .
To this extent let it be an important signal that Seehofer had announced now to speak once again over the subject .
Resistance against the plans comes also of the Christian Democratic Unions state associations Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate .
Fears are background that a Maut impairs the small boundary traffic to neighboring states .
Seehofer had demanded coalition faithful because of the feeble criticism out of rows of the Christian Democratic Union .
The left looks at the plans in view of the dispute in the union as failed .
`` The Murks Maut is dead '' , said party chief Bernd Riexinger of the `` new Osnabrücker newspaper '' ( Monday ) .
`` With the Maut , the minister '' fails . Dobrindt wants to introduce a Vignettenpflicht on all German streets , that should start 2016 .
Native car owners may be burdened according to coalition contract however not in addition .
Therefore they should receive a full balance over the motor vehicle tax for the Maut .
The model may not handicap foreign drivers however in accordance with EU right because of its nationality .

Andrew Lawson was a man of the sort whose character changes things , even in such a gigantic organization such as the NHS .
As an advising anaesthesia physician , he dedicated suffer its career of the task , that both to save the Agonie of the illness such as the torments of the treatment .
Under its patient , remembers his wife , was a MI6-Mitarbeiter , who had to live with the devastating effects of tortures .
Lawson knew that the diagnoses and illnesses are important to the physicians , during the treated predominantly with somewhat entirely other busied are : Pain .
One day in 2007 , it was however that whose life of suffering began .
`` I did not feel me , '' wrote it in May this year .
I had difficulties to pull myself together up .
While it fought with the flu-like symptoms , it noted that it made his wife Juliet impatiently accusations .
`` I wants all rather immediately than later '' , noted it .
When Juliet was for a week on a business trip , Lawson felt entirely unusual would prove and disturbs without reason .
Anything lay in the air .
It asked a colleague to undertake a x-ray investigation of its breast .
It had been only two weeks ago in the French Alps to the ski load .
The result of the x-ray investigation existed .
It suffered from Mesotheliom , an incurable cancer , that attacks the breast fur , therefore the skin covering the lungs .
How in most cancer diseases , the exact trigger is to be determined usually heavily .
While for example some smokers become ill with lung cancer , all lung cancer sick early smokers were not .
But Mesotheliom is differently .
In almost all cases , the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fiber building material , that once as a `` miracle material '' counted however in the meantime as deadly recognized became .
For that of us , Mesotheliom is a disease that can ignore how easily .
Asbestos is in the end a product of the past .
The most dangerous asbestos type was used in Great Britain since the '1960 's no longer when the industry promised voluntarily in addition to use this no longer .
Where it yet was used , only people in certain industries worked directly with the material - plumber , construction worker , carpenters and shipyard worker for example .
As an industrial danger material out of another time it seems to be today hardly yet serious .
But this even contentment is inappropriate .
Great Britain , seems it , experiences today the highpoint of a Mesoltheliom epidemic .
There are more deaths through Mesotheliom here than in every other country of the world .
With altogether 2,500 deaths per year , many people die twice as at this illness as in traffic accidents .
Annual numbers of the Mesotheliomtodesfälle since 1980 and presumable future deaths in Great Britain
The reason why we experience the deadly effects now , although asbestos illegally has been for years ( 1999 became all asbestos types forbidden ) , is that that a Mesotheliom develops first after decades .
And the scourge of the Mesotheliom is not restricted on former worker of the building industry .
Asbestos was is , and frequently yet , in the houses available , in which we live , the offices in which we work , the schools in which we learn and the businesses in which we shop .
And therefore Mesotheliom knows no class barriers , financial boundaries , occupations or age .
The privileged bastions , of the elegant department stores in London to private schools , are no protection room .
The parliament buildings are asbestos contaminated .
Also in the hospitals , in which we should become yet healthy , were settled already as an exit herd of this deadly Karzinogens .
Andrew Lawson was not old .
It was also no plumber .
It fell it in the deed heavily to imagine where it could have come possibly with asbestos in contact .
Then it found out it .
`` It looks so as if in the tunnels at the Guy 's it hospital , where I graduated for six years my education , a quantity asbestos available was '' . wrote it .
All - students , nurse , physicians and doorman - use the tunnels .
Does one ask himself how many of my contemporaries will suffer from the same illness ?
It unfortunately at least partially was able to answer this question .
`` Of the four physicians , that at the Guy 's it hospital instructed became , and that in the last five years at Mesotheliom of sick '' , wrote he 2010 in a letter , `` am I the last , that yet lives '' .
How many will of us yet become ill ?
In Andrew Lawson , Mesotheliom was diagnosed at the age of 48 years .
When it died on the 17th of February of this year , it was 55 .
That was an unusually long over lifetime .
Fifty percent of all Mesotheliomerkrankten die within 8 months after the diagnosis .
The illness ends always deadly .
We can repeat therefore only Lawsons question : Will `` like many of us yet become ill '' ?
The leading expert of Great Britain to Mesotheliom , professor Julian Peto , supposes that between 1870 and 2050 , if the asbestos epidemic in Great Britain will come presumably for succumbing , altogether 90,000 of the illness to the victim fallen be become .
That therefrom still have no idea in the moment that they will die so .

A short view of the acts of the courts , at which the concerned turn frequently because of compensation demands , shows how far the scourge of the Mesothelioms already is spread .
In June these years gave notice & Spencer for example to , Janice of all careless would prove stopped asbestos to have .
It worked for nine years for the chain , of 1978 to 1987 and was responsible over the clothing department at two locations - one of them of the Flagshipstore in the Oxford streets .
Mrs. All was first 18 years as when it began its activity in M & S .
Now it has two children in the Zwanzigern .
`` Before this thing , '' says it , `` I had heard never of Mesotheliom , knew I not yet once really something over asbestos .
I never would have thought that that would concern me once .
There is only a few people who know much over asbestos .
Fact is that the term asbestos a substance , but rather a group of six minerals does not relate itself .
The name stems of the word `` Asbestiform '' , a description of the fiber structure that flexibly makes the material resistant and .
Three of the six were used in the building business .
Chrysotil , also as a white asbestos well known , is the asbestos by far most frequently found today in buildings .
It was used for roof disks , foot bottom disks , pipe isolation , boiler isolation , even for brake linings in cars .
It is less deadly as other asbestos forms , is looked at however nevertheless of the EU and the WHO as a `` large health risk '' with possible death consequence .
The brown asbestos ( Amosit ) and the blue asbestos ( Krokydolith ) is more dangerous however .
Great Britain was once that importer world 's largest of brown asbestos , and experts assume that `` there are clear , however indirect references , that these was '' a main reason for the uniquely high Mesotheliomraten .
A colleague of notice & Spencer was stopped in the Flagshipstore in the Oxford streets , London , asbestos Alamy
Janice all did not see itself perhaps as a typical Mesotheliomopfer , but the work of Julian Peto points on that there that its story is unusual in no case .
It produced a study of the concerned , in which represented becomes , that `` an essential share of the Mesotheliome became '' without well known exposure through work or in the house probable through asbestos contact in the environment caused .
A large part of these contacts is based its statements after upon the `` normal use and aging '' of our buildings .
It looks so , as could no one therefrom go out to be certain .
A report of Goddard Consulting , that examined the palace of Westminster , shows how people could have been also in the heart of the government , unknowing the material exposed .
2009 reported Goddard that the service shafts and pipings had contaminated behind the from shot room of the parliament with asbestos , whose deadly fibers could be swirled up by air movements '' `` strong somewhat as harmless as .
Members of parliament frequently are accused to attend to its own interests , but here it sees so from , as would be true the opposite .
While the direction of the parliamentary community service existed on that , that the Westminsterpalast had received a `` clean health testimony '' , it is in the meantime uncontested that 1 billion£work expense must be raised over several years in order to renovate the parliament , to modernize the electric installations and to remove the asbestos , and that after the general choices 2015 the delegates will meet probably sooner in the suggested QE2-Konferenzzentrum than on the green banks in Westminster .
The Goddard report referred also on that that `` the existence became not '' handled by asbestos corresponding to the respective determinations .
No one can know whether this Missmanagement life will cost .
All what one can do now , is wait .
A person , that the contact with asbestos never exactly determine was able to be Graham Abbott , a general practitioner .
How Andrew Lawson the 50-year-old Abbott assumes that it was stopped during its work in hospitals the asbestos .
`` I have in a hospital worked , in the asbestos complaint positively decided became '' , says it , `` but I can it in my case do not prove .
It is so difficult to remember all places , at which one worked , and at the data .
On what it yet exactly remembered the day is itself beginning of December 2009 at which it got so a kind of fever .
It was 45 , and an operation carried out just late evenings .
Suddenly I had violent shivering .
It came very suddenly .
I felt terribly .
I believed to create the trip home no longer .
As a physician , Abbott knew that the pains of the breast fur that stemmed skin around its lungs around .
But how Janice all it had no reason to assume a Mesotheliom .
It did not go a month to work .
Surprised physicians made x-ray of its breast and set Pleurakathether on in order to take fluid out of the lungs and to test in the laboratory .
Its troubles remained however without diagnosis .
Its health improved itself slowly , and it turned at its job back .
From time to time , the symptoms returned however , frequently after sporting activity and violent breathing .
A patient Abbotts with similar symptoms in its practice came 2011 and was diagnosed later with Mesotheliom .
But also now Abbott did not connect this with its own case .
In the end its patient was some decades older and had worked directly with asbestos .
The connection in the case was clear .
In September 2011 deteriorated Abbotts condition again and its family doctor its CT Scans and x-ray to an expert group brought themselves .
In December 2011 , exactly two years after Abbott suffer had felt for the first time , was introduced a probe equipped with a camera into the cave between the rib fur and the breast fur .
I am an optimist .
I continue says usually simply , '' it .
Honestly said , had made me I not at all so many worries .
But Rachel , my wife , was provided .
The result of the biopsy existed in the week between Christmas and New Year : `` One said to me that it was '' Mesotheliom .
Graham Abbott : Diagnosis Mesotheliom
Suddenly had Abbott appointments with Macmillan nurse of which one recommended it to take itself a lawyer .
First now concept it the size of the epidemic .
`` It turned out very far spread was , that asbestos , especially in large public buildings , in which pipes were isolated often with asbestos , '' it says .
The people , who were stopped the asbestos in these buildings , become ill now .
And so Mesotheliom encounters now younger people who did not work in the typical occupations .
The most dangerous pipes with asbestos isolation in hospitals lay under the earth , therefore patients were not stopped probably sooner the material .
But many colleagues , who changed in pedestrian tunnels of a building in the other , ( like Andrew Lawson ) or in underground canteens ate ( like it Graham Abbott often did ) , came with largest probability in contact with the poisonous substances .
It appears that over several decades after the war of hospitals for the patients possibly life rescuing were , but life-threatening for the treating physicians .
It yet is removed also today .
Students turned down its Bunsenbrenner on asbestos mats .
And it concerns not only hospitals .
Asbestos was used based on its fabulous isolating and flame impeding characteristics frequent in offices , businesses , libraries and city halls .
Also schools .
Actually many people had probably the first asbestos contact in the class room .
Everywhere in the country , in thousands of chemistry hours , turned down student its Bunsenbrenner on asbestos mats .
On web pages , the subject of asbestos in schools now frequently is addressed .
And meanwhile so innocent objects in our houses such as foot bottom disks or barn roofs contained standard moderate asbestos .
`` It is an industry poison that in large parts of our real estate contained is , '' notes Andrew Morgan , that lawyer , who represented Andrew Lawson in its process against Guy 's it hospital .
In a case , the single contact that occurred to a concerned woman was , the abstract of a garden barn in the 1970ern .
Therefore you pay attention how you dismantle your garden barn .
The effects of the diagnosis , and the knowledge that the illness is incurable , is immense .
A while lasts `` to process that , '' says Graham Abbott .
I went again to the work and tried to make further , but I noticed that I was not able to concentrate on that , what I did .
I was two weeks in the practice .
Then I knew that I had to go and had to attend to me even .
Well yes , I no further christmas will experience .
With the largest difficulty , the telescope change of the position of a physician to that of a patient was .
He remembers patients countless how before it on that how overwhelmed he was by all the information , with which he had to come right .
`` It was very heavily , to receive that everything , '' says it .
Did `` I ask still have my physician '' how long I '' ?
And one gave me yet about 12 months .
I remember that I thought , `` well yes , I will experience no further christmas .
It was that then '' . ''
Mesotheliom is especially insidious because it is our life maintenance mechanism - the breathing itself - , that the deadly cancer causes .
Most cases of Mesotheliom are caused through asbestos contact .
Asbestos consists of smallest fibers .
If the asbestos is swirled up and the fibers are inhaled , they can itself in the breast fur , that skin fix around the lungs around .
Asbestos fiber irritate the breast fur and can release cell mutations .
`` The problem emerges with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibers , '' so professor Tom Treasure , a heart-Thorax-physician who changed 2001 at the Guy 's it hospital .
Exactly the hospital of which Andrew Lawson assumes that it stopped it the asbestos , is ironic would prove now , a leading center in the treatment of Mesotheliom .
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some other that were stopped probably also during its education in the hospital the asbestos .
As soon as the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue , says Treasure , `` become it of the breath process at the edge pressed where the skin is .
Inherently it is from the beginning invasive .
The usual options in other cancer diseases do not function in Mesotheliom so good .
The effectiveness of an operation is for example be named disputed .
Some my that it would be valued an attempt .
Treasure denies that .
`` One can not excise the breast fur , '' says it .
They get around with the knife not therefore .
Meanwhile the cancer does not address `` on chemotherapy very well , '' that `` effect shows '' , but does not heal .
`` Sometimes there is long-term survival , '' says Treasure .
But at the end , they die everyone .
Fortunately some patients live actually long , much more long than expects .
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis .
Graham Abbott fights two and a half years after its own diagnosis still .
After it had contacted Mesotheliom , came Abbott in contact with Andrew Lawson , that four years had become after its diagnosis an a-man-supports and consultation office for Mitbetroffene .
`` Hello , cancer headquarters , '' imagined he in calls cheerfully .
`` It was very positive , '' says Abbott .
It had received its diagnosis 4 years before and was still very active .
Originally Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles , that would last four months and would extend its life presumably only by a month .
`` I was doubted , '' say it .
I wanted to abandon .
Lawson created appear it however `` the things light of somewhat more positive in one to let '' .
After the consultation of several physicians , Abbott , its treatment with prof. Loic long Lazdunski , heart-Thorax-specialist concluded to continue it at the Guy 's .
`` We had an advantage through it that I must not further reprimanded become , I called simply on and got an appointment , '' gives Graham to .
A normal patient would be received must a transfer and wait must for the permission of the treatment .
Money is decisively for Mesotheliom become ill in order to be able to perceive the best available therapies .
But if these treatments fail in the end inevitable , stand many concerned of another financial worry - over the future of the families , that leave behind it .
And so they turn to the courts in the hope for compensation .
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP .
`` It has been since 1898 well known that asbestos is extremely dangerous for the health , '' says Morgan .
But what in the 1960ern changed is itself , that one recognized , that also a very slight load represented a health risk .
And here the negligence of the businesses began to play a role .
Andrew Lawson and Guy 's it hospital enclosed its case in the end , but it was not that , what names Morgan a `` full compensation '' , because Lawson was not able to prove with absolute security , that be Mesotheliom on an asbestos contact at the Guy 's it to lead back was .
After the investigation to its death , a speaker of the Guy 's confirmed it however that `` the asbestos fiber in the concerned cellar area in the 1990ern became '' removed .
That was too late for Andrew Lawson .
How asbestos can be removed
It is actual for Mesotheliom become ill , that strive for compensation , an enormous problem to assign the deadly asbestos contact of a firm or a job - normally decade after the occurrences .
Many of its earlier employers were sold or closed .
Insurance documents can lost go .
And that that defend themselves against claims do not know that the time is for it , but very certainly with the complainants .
As a reaction on that there were this year clear new legislations , that it makes for Mesotheliom concerned simpler , to sue for a compensation , also if its earlier employers are to be discovered no longer .
The law arranged a fund promoted by the insurance industry of 350 million£for everyone , prove can accuse can that were diagnosed after July 2012 , a contact , but no one .
In these cases , the complainants 80 received communicate can would have percent its , what a court in a normal compensation process them - about 120,000£ .
About 300 successful proposing in the program are expected per year .
Andrew Morgan thinks like so many Mesotheliom concerned that 350 million represented£a `` very good work '' of the insurance industry .
`` That is a deal of insurers for insurer , '' says it , and points on that it concerns in this sum one-quarter its , what insurers should have paid , if the time were not passed over about that and Mesotheliom become ill could find the businesses and normally could accuse it .
Also Mike Penning , at that time work minister and pension minister , admitted that the law would not be `` perfect '' .
But both Penning such as Morgan admitted that in view of of seven dead daily some fast actions would be necessary .
`` The people suffer so very and need today aid , '' said Penning during the second hearing of the Mesotheliom law in December the past year .
At this time Graham Abbott has been for 19 months in the hands of prof. Loic long Lazdunski .
After its first consultations , long Lazdunski recommended an operation of which it expects in contrast a positive effect to Tom Treasure .
This was accompanied of a radiation therapy and a chemotherapy - a triple therapy with which long Lazdunski can present a survival rate over five years of up to 40 percent .
Abbott felt strengthened .
`` That is natural with the most important , '' says Abbott .
One sees that again and again with patients .
There is there something what lets continue you .
If you abandon , it goes you very quickly more badly .
Graham Abbott subjected itself in March 2012 of the operation .
It had the end of August the last of the six chemotherapy cycles behind itself .
Nachsorgescans showed no sign at all of the illness .
Then I had in March 2014 a Scan .
There were several cancer spots around my breast .
I became just 50 .
That is not life-threatening .
That is life concluding .
Again Abbott subjected itself six chemotherapy cycles .
Now no trace of the Tumore is more visible .
But the process is physical and psychically very strenuous .
They must think of practical things - over the money if I am no longer , for example , or my wives show how the boiler time attitude functions .
If you receive bad news , you become negative .
They must look forwards .
As a father of Ellie , 16 , and Tamsin , 14 , is that not always easy .
`` For parents , that is heavy , '' says it .
It is to be known heavy , what one should say and like much .
When I received my first diagnosis , I said to my girls that I would have an illness , with which I would not become old .
They reacted very differently .
Tamsin is very sociable and impetuous .
It told got it its friends and we soon very many calls .
Ellie was more reserved .
It did not say much .
Such conversations are endure must somewhat , that all cancer patients .
But for Mesotheliomerkrankte , such conversations are not gotten through of hope , not by a trace of hope for survival .
The illness brings ( so like in conclusion also for Stephen Jay Gould ) a grim security .
How Andrew Morgan says , `` Mesotheliom is not life-threatening .

The school start brought the communities drawn by Raketeneinschusslöchern in the south of Israel a feeling of joy and expectation , but the signs of the battles are yet fresh .

Until an armistice the war last week interrupted remained thousand of inhabitants the boundary communities such as Saad in its houses or left removes its houses , around into more certain areas further to pull of Gaza and to escape the rocket fire and mortar fire .
Many inhabitants of Nahal Oz , a community in the vicinity of the boundary to Gaza , in which a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar garnet , hesitate yet with the return .
The development ministry announced , about a dozen of families would not be returned yet .
Your children were accommodated provisionally in other schools .

Israel and Hamas agreed at the past Tuesday on an unbefristeteten armistice .
The weapon quiet provided for an immediate end of the battles ; important problems remain however unsolved , like the demand of the Hamas after a lifting of the Israeli Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of the air harbors and lake harbors in Gaza .

Feminists criticize racial issue and police behavior after Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson , Mon at the beginning of this month .
The participants raised their hands in the air and sang , `` hands up , do n't shoot , '' while they waited before the funeral .
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson , Mo , due to the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown said the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez a change in online discussions of white feminists .
In her experience , white feminist commentators raise the sex before the race when it comes to reproductive rights and income inequality .
During the tensions in the Midwest , however , rose and received attention throughout the country , saw Perez , the responses of white women turned up to 100 % of the breed .
Compared with the responses of black women came shortly after the shots from 9 August the personal essays with titles like `` thoughts to Ferguson of a white woman '' and `` feminism is not only about the oppression of women '' relatively late .
But for Perez meant that an important change .
`` I do not believe that one in feminism is many people talk about the white and privileges on so-type , '' she said .
People felt urged to express something about the incidents .
It is characteristic of the crisis in which we find ourselves and ethnicized because the situation in Ferguson is that they need to express it .
For English professor Koritha Mitchell of Ohio State University , Ferguson problems to light that black Americans are exposed to every day , but they should not be seen as a `` women 's issues '' in the cultural sphere .
`` I can publish something funny on Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 likes from anywhere , '' Mitchell said .
If I post something on how black people are under siege in their own country , the silence is deafening .
`` How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship , but not about security in the public space ? '' She asked .
For black women like Mitchell , who have studied race , gender and sexuality in the history of the United States , there is no dichotomy between race and gender issues .
For them , black women have not had the luxury to separate the issues clean ; they live in the combined reality every day .
While white women now connect the issues of race and gender in the feminist mainstream circles , Angela Hattery , professor of women 's and gender studies at George Mason University , says that their predecessors did the opposite .
`` At least 10,000 black men were lynched between 1865 and 1890 and the justification was almost always the rape of a white woman , '' said Hattery .
White women had to be involved in the story , in order to justify the Lynch murder .
For Hattery came the divide between white and black women at the point at which white fighters for women 's suffrage as Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late years of the 19th century and said that the fight for the right to vote only for one group could be successful : Women or blacks .
`` They made the decision to stand up for women 's suffrage , and the right to vote for blacks should come later , '' said Hattery .
If you are reminded of such things , one with power will understand why coloured women do n't trust white women .
We have not done our job well .
We have never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons .
Even after women were given the right to vote in 1920 , it took another decade until white women against the Lynchen organised in the Association of Southern woman for the Prevention of Lynching .
The group was founded nearly 40 years after the original request for help from black women , says Mitchell .
For Mitchell , the flood of white feminist responses to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behaviour , racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time , in which white feminists `` trapping '' played with the problems facing black women is set apart for generations .
`` It would be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms have the right to a child 's education as seriously as they do with the right to control conception ? '' Asked Mitchell .
The second-generation feminists , who built her career on the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives , are now trying to understand what that means .
The famous white feminist activist Gloria Steinem came two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown on Facebook and published a pithy article by Rebecca Carroll , distribution of the Guardian , in which they demanded more protests of white Americans on the issue of racism .
`` I hope that women who have a separate but parallel reason to understand the danger inherent in the body - and opinions on race , which are very different in public opinion polls - will lead the changes , '' Steinem wrote .
Although Steinem intersectional feminism stands for a more interactive section , in which race and gender issues are some of their comments on the racial issue in America but puzzled .
Christina Sommers , a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of `` Who Stole feminism ? '' Said to She The People that young men in the United States , especially young coloured men , `` are far more vulnerable than their sisters , '' but Steinems to Ferguson 's comments are in contrast to its previous criticism .
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women , but almost nothing for boys .
But as the White House recently a small program , My Brother 's keeper , celebratory , in order to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men , there were infuriating reactions of many feminists , including Gloria Steinem .
The relationship between the police to the black community is not the only problem that is at the forefront of the mainstream feminism .
After the US border police has taken nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors in the country 's southwest border this year , is also the subject of immigration reform to the surface again - this time as a women 's issue .
Andrea Mercado , co-chairman of We Belong Together , an organization that women mobilised for immigration reform , said that for a reconsideration of the issue as a fundamental issue of women , they only had to publish the stories of immigrant women .
`` They speak for themselves , '' Mercado said .
If the vast majority of work visas is going to male immigrants , the women who accompany them , are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation .
`` These stories will find an echo in the women 's organisations , '' she said .

Production in the eurozone to a 13-month low
The increase in production in the eurozone slowed in August to its lowest point in the last 13 months , a closely watched survey with .
The final Markit manufacturing purchasing managers index ( PMI ) fell in August to 50,7 in , according to a state of 51.8 in July .
A number above 50 indicates an expansion .
New orders went back and factories experienced declines in a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine .
The figures come before the meeting of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) on Thursday .
The markets are expecting a clear plan for dealing with a hesitant recovery in the euro area , as well as the threat of deflation from the bank with an inflation rate of just 0.3 % .
There is speculation that , in the course of this week , the head of the ECB , Mario Draghi , could provide further information , whether he is considering a quantitative easing for the eurozone , in line with those of the United Kingdom and the United States were made during the financial crisis .
`` Although a small growth is better than no growth , are the deterrent effect of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties for the manufacturer has become clearer , '' said Rob Dobson , senior economist at Markit .
The factory PMI for Germany , Russia 's largest trading partner in the EU , fell to the lowest level in 11 months with 51.4 .
In the meantime , fell in France , the bloc 's second-largest economy , the PMI to 46,9 .
France remains a problem child , as well as the Italian descent of a solid expansion to stagnation .
Evidence that incentives for growth in the key industry mechanism no longer are Germany , Spain and the Netherlands are not reassuring , `` Mr Dobson said .
The decline of the industry is probably the fire of the analysts expect further monetary or fiscal stimulus .
Some positive news came from the Republic of Ireland , where the PMI to 57.3 rose to the highest level since the end of 1999 .
Howard Archer , chief economist at IHS Global Insight , said : `` The best thing you can say for the purchasing manager index of manufacturing in the eurozone in August , is that the sector continues to grow . ''
He added : `` Producers in the eurozone will find life is obviously very difficult , because the current heightened geopolitical tensions , particularly in relation to Russia and the Ukraine , continue to increase uncertainty in the difficult conditions in many countries .
This increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular , and consumer confidence , and probably leads to some orders be delayed or even cancelled , particularly large contracts .
He said that it will `` increasingly likely '' that the ECB should finally start a kind of QE , `` although we suspect that this will be limited . ''

Putin calls for the inclusion of `` statehood talks '' with eastern Ukraine from Kiev
The Russian President Vladimir Putin told Russian media reported on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop the fighting against the separatists in the east of the country and immediately begins with negotiations on the `` statehood '' of the breakaway region .
His spokesman Dimitri Peskow made clear later that Putin will not have meant that the area under the control of separatists in eastern Ukraine is a part of Russia , but that his status should be redefined to Ukraine , in order to give the power to represent the rights and interests of the Russian-speaking region .
Putin 's call to the Kiev government suits negotiations on an equal footing with the pro-Russian insurgents but to the strategy pursued by him since the beginning of the riots five months apparently : Support for the separatists in the adoption of areas and put pressure on the Ukrainian government to allow the newly proclaimed Novo Rossija region de facto independence for an alliance with Russia instead of the West .
In an interview with the state television station Channel One , Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recapture areas held by the separatists in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions , which were taken in March and April , after Moscow had annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18 .
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently adopted this area as `` Novo Rossija '' or `` New Russia , '' a term that recalls the vorrevolutionäre heyday of the Russian empire .
Putin and Ukrainian politicians pointed out that all those during the campaign for the elections on 26 Oct. while government groups attacking civilian communities in the areas held by separatists hope for early peace talks `` trapped in their illusions , '' Itar-TASS reported .
`` We must immediately begin detailed discussions , not only on technical issues , but also on the political organization of society and the state status of south-eastern Ukraine , in order to protect the interests of the people who live there , '' he said .
Peskow said that Putin 's reference to the statehood should be seen in the context of the greater autonomy , which will be discussed by the Kiev leadership for months , in order to allay fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk .
Only the Ukrainian government can give the necessary autonomy to the eastern areas , Peskow said .
We are not talking about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia , Peskow said , `` because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine , but an internal conflict in Ukraine . ''
The clarification of the Kremlin spokesman to correct the `` misinterpretation '' of Putin 's remarks underscored Russia 's leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east , in contrast to the direct Annektion Crimea , where the majority of the 2 million residents are ethnic Russians .
Moscow could have been far more difficult to annex the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine , since most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are no Russians and polls arose from the time before a broad majority for the whereabouts of the conflict in Ukraine .
The autonomy , which was raised by Russian diplomats at international forums , the regional governments in Ukraine would give authority to negotiate trade agreements and external relations of their own , and thus give the Kremlin de facto control over an area that combines the Russian territory with the Crimea .
The five months ago annexed peninsula in the Black Sea is the home port for the bulk of the Russian navy , as well as an important trading port and historic coastal region .
The regions between the Rostov region in Russia and Crimea is also rich in mines , factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military .
The Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko suggested in his speech to the inauguration on June 7 that the Ukrainian legislation - after new elections - should consider amendments to the Constitution , the respective areas will be given greater control over its finances and the status of languages .
But his idea of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels , which is accused of arming and incitement of Moscow .
Putin 's last call for Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders on an equal footing , followed by a further encroachment of the rebels in the past week , after Russian troops and tanks have penetrated through the previously peaceful region along the Azov Sea in eastern Ukraine .
The Russian-supported separatists took over the coup , according to Ukrainian security officials fear is the first step of a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea , the control of Nowoasowsk .
For this reason massive civilian and military preparations are under way to fix Mariupol , a steel industry port with 500,000 inhabitants , which lies between Nowoasowsk and narrow access to the Crimea .
Poroshenko said on Saturday at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels and asked an urgent need for action to prevent a further Russian aggression against Ukraine , a former Soviet republic , which is independent for 23 years .
`` We are just at the point of no return , '' warned Poroshenko .
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine .
The EU summit decided no concrete actions , the lead the draft demanded further sanctions against Russia , which will come into force in a unspezifizierten escalation of the Ukraine crisis .
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk , after two Russian armored columns and 1,000 soldiers broke last week in the Donetsk region , in order to support the besieged separatists , said Col. Andriy Lysenko , spokesman of the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council Repo on Saturday in Kiev .
The first probably 63 Ukrainian soldiers who were trapped by the Russian invasion in Ilowajsk were exchanged on Sunday against 10 Russian paratroopers who were captured in a week on Ukrainian territory , said Lysenko on Sunday .

Amazon buys Twitch for $ 1.04 billion
Amazon has just confirmed that information had reported on Monday morning : The online retailer - and video producer , and a variety of other things - buys the video streaming service Twitch for $ 1.04 billion ( US $ 970 million ) .
The announcement is surprising , not because no one had expected a Twitch takeover , but because it was widely believed that YouTube would buy the company .
Three months ago , it looked as if the sale of Twitch decided to Google 's video service for a cool billion . The cooperation also appeared , of course .
Twitch , which was founded as see only three years ago , was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube .
Instead it has quickly become a platform for players who wanted their bravura pieces published in games , `` YouTube for live games , '' said an insider .
The Twitch interface .
And `` let 's play , '' a video genre , in the opinion of the ( mostly older ) games give a veneer of secret science theatre , are already very popular on YouTube .
It is precisely that YouTube is often called , if you want to describe Twitch , so was the news that YouTube Twitch wanted to buy a little bored , a textbook example of an established technology company that buys a potential competitors .
It is a mystery why the deal with YouTube did not do so , because the company was reportedly willing to pay as much as Amazon .
Everything that we know at the moment is Emmet Twitch sheer , President of this statement : `` We have decided on Amazon , because they believe in our community , they share our values and long-term vision , and they want to help us get there faster . ''
Another mystery is , frankly , the incredible success of Twitch .
For snobs like me who say that they prefer to watch a sport , it is difficult to understand the attraction , the assumption that others watching the games themselves to take the control console in the hand .
It is one thing to see a friend at 3 o'clock in the morning on the shoulder while they trailed by resident Evil , and quite another to watch a spinner as 20 times in a row in Call of Duty is shot in the head .
You could see all these games right now .
Another problem is that many of the most popular games are ego games today , so the watch without control over the look of their own perspective can be a good recipe for headaches .
I admit that the quick passes , all of our electronic age in the Roger Bannisters complete games in record time , are entertaining .
But as long as it is not a game or humor virtuoso , his Twitch channel is probably not very interesting .
But what do skeptics like I already know of them ?
Twitch is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic spikes .
And exactly how Amazon wants to make money from it ?
It is hard to imagine that Twitch so elegantly integrated into Amazon instant Video , such as YouTube Twitch simply could swallow .
But Twitch has something that each company would like : Thousands of young men to be courted as advertisers .
As the chairman of Twitch , sheer , said that Amazon and Twitch `` both believe in the future of gaming , '' and the medium is showing no signs of contraction , yet not even - gulp - as a spectator sport .

In a statement to the New Press he contradicts statements of the business leader Peer Medau and attests to this , `` Mr as a field '' pose .
This is not the style of the university , says in the statement .
So the family Medau had already been `` verbally informed about the idea of the university in mid-June .
The statement that the plans were first announced in July , are definitely wrong , `` so Pötzl .
At the same time , he points out that the plans is not `` Vorfestlegungen or even decisions , '' it `` preferences . ''
The development required for the entrance of the narrow road up to the castle was less dramatic than the Medaus fear .
A nine-metre-wide road was and is not the speech .
It is the current state of 5.50 meters , which is a meter wide than before , `` explains Pötzl .
The argument of the Medau operators that their free and its own parking areas in the future will only be used by students of the university , will not apply Pötzl .
Parks will not solve anything , because that as with other public parking spaces become intelligent .
Think of the residents
The crèche mountain IMP , located on the site and on their doorstep would lead along the access road to the parking deck , `` according to the university president should not be affected . ''
Rather , it is to remember that , `` it is not only about the nursery , but also about the residents at the junction of the Friedrich-Streib Street and the 800 students of neighbouring Primary School .
It is so much more than vested interests of Mr Medau , `` so Pötzl .
Whether the criticism of the parents Advisory Board of the nursery , with the expansion of the road would be one of the few natural spots Coburgs lost was `` entitled , '' the reader can decide for themselves. ``
At the beginning of October to Pötzl together with the State Bauamt Bamberg inform the city councils of the structural development of the university by 2020 and raise the importance of the new development in this regard. ``
Peer Medau last week had informed the parents of the nursery on the plans of the university .
The approach of the new parking deck should not continue to lead on the campus and the Friedrich-Streib Street , but on the Medau mountain .
This would have to be expanded the narrow road about a kilometre length two lanes .
According to the projections Medaus would make the traffic in the park of the castle high rock tenfold .
There is talk of about 2,000 vehicles a day .
The city was not yet comment on the project .

Harburg : Tents for new refugees
At Neuländer Square refugees are now housed in tents .
The initial reception center for refugees in Harburg bursts bursting at the seams .
Now the inner authority has set up three tents of the Red Cross in addition .
The district politicians were only informed shortly before that - they are less enthusiastic .
`` These actions do-fuel further reservations of citizens and give the district no opportunity for politicians to contribute constructively to the humane accommodation of refugees , '' says Britta Herrmann , group chairman of the Greens in Harburger Assembly district .
Her party calls for the district administration Harburg currently unused houses for accommodation available .
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents .

So many refugees remain longer than the usual three months .

Lenny Henry : My father has never taken me in the arm .
Has never said `` I love you ''
Henry was one of seven children of a family Jamaica Cuban immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958 .
His father died when he was 19 , worked in a factory and their relationship was limited .
Henry rehearsing for a comedy , Rudy 's Rare Records , which is based in part on an imaginary conversation with his father and emerged from the series on Radio 4 .
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap , with lively melodies .
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments .
He visited `` many '' therapies after the death of his mother , and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father .
It was difficult to know him .
You never saw his face , only heard his voice : `` Hearing with the crash .
Let your sister in peace .
Beweg you !
I want to watch cricket .
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who were already grown up , when I was a child - went with him in the pub and talked about things , such as the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket strike .
I have never had such a conversation with him .
A large part of my life , he was a serious guy in the corner , the newspaper .
Recently opened a foundry in Dudley , and although the conditions are better than at the time of his father , Henry won it with an insight into how life may have been for him .
It is now a little brighter , but they are dark , cheapest , deep stygische maze with flames shock and smoke and soot .
My father was simply earlier in the tub and then you could hear him slowly , as he began to sing , because he could wash the foundry .
When I went around there , I realized that he had done so for years , in order to bring the food on the table , and my respect for him has been growing .
However , Henry grew without stuff of love to his parents as a child .
My father never embraced me , he never said `` I love you . ''
Only when my mother went badly towards the end of their lives , we began to say `` I love you , I love you , I love you ' .
By his own daughter Billie , Dawn French , he could share the love that he had missed as a child .
Could you let 's stop with the `` I love you '' ?
Hearing but to embrace me !
Dad , I am 22 .
With Dawn French .
Why should n't we be friends ?
She is a great mother .
It is still friends with French , with whom he was married for 25 years .
Dawn is a good man .
Why should n't we be friends ?
She is a great mother .
Henry 's own mother was diabetic .
That contributed to her death .
So when I was very , very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes , my doctor said `` you have to be radical .
So I moved through this thing and has also had to make a drastic diet , in order to reverse the symptoms .
It is very difficult .
And it is exhausting .
No one likes to eat carrots .
Henry 's career change is perhaps evident in his elegant , short cut .
Since he was praised by critics for his masterpiece , he is captured by the theater .
It was followed by The comedy of errors , and then fences of August Wilson .
This is a different experience from the sitcoms and comedies that have filled his busy working life .
He started with only 16 years , when he was working in a factory .
A DJ discovered him on the stage , when he wrote persons and imitation of New Faces about him .
His television career began in the mid-1970s . `` I was the only black impersonator / comedian on television for a very long time . ''
He was at work .
I had to not only be large in the eyes of the public , but also learn from 1975 to 1985 , as I could be an effective jokes-narrative-machine , while I was a star on television , and it was really difficult .
Lenny 1975 in New Faces
As his manager had the stage right to the Black and White alternatively show , a light entertainment , in which the people `` black anmalten , '' Henry led to his comedy there over five years .
My family was very unpleasant .
Somehow , I wish that it would never happen , but I regret that I have done it .
It was a strange , awkward position for me , but I worked on big projects and learned how to deal with a large audience .
But this `` years of award-winning light pillar of British television '' was also a `` grotesque parody of black people . ''
With the introduction of characters , which celebrated the British black culture as both a mock , Henry worked on an alternative comedy circuit in the 1980s .
The first series of Lenny Henry Show went on air in 1984 , and in the 1990s he was known as the chef Gareth Black lock in the comedy series leader , among other things .
Advertising , documentaries , TV series and movie roles characterized his next decade , but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv 2008 he thought : `` What are you doing next , Len , because everything feels like , when you 're only time rum or join a little bit on the spot . ''
Then came a documentary series for Radio 4 titled What 's So Great About ... ?
The first episode revolved around Shakespeare .
I was downright allergic to Shakespeare .
I had never right in the school learned something about him and held him for a domain of the middle class , whites in tights and a cabbage at the front .
So I had great fear .
All that we interviewed for the show , Peter Hall , Trevor Nunn , Adrian Lester , Judi Dench said `` You should try it again .
It is not a bad thing , if you do n't know what you talk to .
Put a couple of words in the mouth , and then you will understand why we all love Shakespeare .
Henry led 20 lines from Othellos last speech for the documentary , he was thrilled .
I had the feeling that I could do this .
It was almost as if someone had his head finally set up correctly .
`` That is what is at stake , it is a serious thing , take them seriously , your text , recherchiere wrote a bit .
The samples were brutal , and I read this piece for months before we made it .
And it was a success .
They simply do not seem to expect a car accident , and this happened .
And soon joined in the comedy of errors .
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it .
There was a moment when I thought , `` Oh , you 've changed you . '' ``
There was a technical error and Henry instinctively felt that he had to entertain the audience .
`` A small voice told me '' You must now bridge 10 minutes while the computer repair. `` ''
Instead , the stage director announced that the idea would continue once the problem is solved .
I went from the stage and something in me said 'Oh , thank God. ``
I am not responsible for it .
I can leave it to someone else .
`` You play in a play , so stay in your role . ''
Henry in fences on je Theatre
The text for fences to learn was demanding .
Panic is very good , that strengthens tendons .
It also sold well , so it is like a large sign of the gods that I say , 'This is your destiny. `` ''
He says this , of course , with a thundering voice .
So I will say it .
I really love it .
I love to be in a rehearsal room .
Henry but still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is crossed by humorous outbreaks , while he repeatedly people imitated .
I have decided to make a stand-up comedy , because I think that this kind of immediate gratification of a room full of strangers is somehow dangerous .
If you are looking for the swearing , leaves it against a wall .
I am sometimes live at the Apollo , if I want it , but overall , I am not as much as before .
I ask him whether he will ever make another stand-up comedy tour .
The fun that I was in a room with a director who helps to shape a beginning , a middle part and the end of a journey - I do not believe that I would ever give up again .
So is this his new incarnation ?
I think so .
I am an actor .
It is fun .
You always tells a story , and this is great .
I love stories .
People love stories .

China denies Hong Kong law on government election , protesters swear vengeance
On Sunday , the Chinese parliament against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 elections despite the increased calls for democratic reform in Hong Kong 's electorate .
This approach fired probably the long-planned protests in Hong Kong 's business district , while activists in the planning and mobilization within a few hours after the announcement led the way .
The decision of the Chinese People 's Congress allows the communist leaders in principle to reject all the candidates are not loyal to Beijing .
`` It is not unexpected , but it makes us angry , '' said legal expert Emily Lau , chairman of the Democratic Party .
This is not what Beijing had promised .
It has lied to the people of Hong Kong .
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime .
In his defence of the Chinese decision said Li Fei , deputy secretary-general of the Standing Committee of the National People 's Congress that the admission of public nominations in the elections for Hong Kong 's government to `` chaotic . ''
Since 1997 , when Britain returned control of the Chinese Hong Kong , Beijing has promised to let the people choose the government leaders from 2017 .
The Chinese leadership presented the decision on Sunday as a democratic breakthrough , because there is a direct suffrage to the citizens of Hong Kong , but the decision also makes clear that the Chinese leadership keeps the process by a nomination committee closely controlled by Beijing firmly in hand .
After a new clause should be allowed in only candidates `` with love the country and love for Hong Kong . ''
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most effective public protests took place in Hong Kong for several years .
The movement is behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong Occupy Central With Love and Peace , whose organizers have threatened to insulate the financial district if Beijing does not allow a genuine universal suffrage .
On Sunday evening , within a few hours after the announcement , hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain in front of the government headquarters in Hong Kong .
In the demonstration , the organizers said that their movement have reached a new level of civil disobedience , and they planned protest waves in the coming weeks .
They gave no details , however , apparently in order to avoid problems with the authorities .
In an online communication has told the organizers that the movement `` the occupation of the central district considered only as a last resort , an action that is expected to take place only if all dialogue opportunities have been exhausted , and there is no other choice .
We are sorry to say that today have been exhausted all dialogue opportunities and the occupation of the central district will definitely take place .
The authorities in Hong Kong have prepared themselves for days at the announcement of Beijing , and there were more stringent security measures , including police and barricades in front of the government building on Sunday .
The unrest will be strengthened by the feeling of many in Hong Kong , they slowly lose control of their city .
The influx of people from the mainland reinforces the competition for products and services .
There is a growing fear that Hong Kong 's values such as democracy and freedom of speech are beginning to crumble under the growing pressure of Beijing .
Some criticised the demonstrations of the Occupy Central movement , because it threatens the business - the lifeblood of Hong Kong - .
`` The protests , which they say , could cause major economic damage , depending on how many are involved and how long they last , '' said legal expert regime Ip , who criticised the movement for a long time .
We do not want to stir up fears that Hong Kong spirals out of control .
This impression is bad for investment .
China 's state-controlled media also reported recently on the democracy activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western powers .
Organised an unofficial referendum on voting rights activists , in which 780,000 people participated in this summer - more than a fifth of voters in Hong Kong .
In July , tens of thousands attended one of the largest democracy demonstrations in the history of the region .

Judge stops temporarily law that all abortion clinics in Louisiana could force the closure
A US federal judge stopped on Sunday for the implementation of a law in Louisiana , the lawyers say that it probably would have led to the closure of the state 's five abortion clinics .
This measure , which was raised from Bobby Jindal , the governor of Louisiana , in June to the law and to enter into force on Sep 1 , would force doctors who perform abortions to acquire a patient receiving right in a hospital within a radius of 30 miles of their practice .
However , the judge 's decision means that doctors can continue to perform legal abortions for the time being , while they apply for such a right .
`` The plaintiffs can continue to work according to the law , as they seek to obtain these rights , '' John deGravelles federal judge wrote in his ruling .
Within a month , scheduled a hearing for the judge to bring about a more permanent decision for the law .
Abortion advocates welcomed the decision , the latest in a series of rulings against similar measures and said that doctors gained more time to gain rights to hospital admissions .
`` Today 's decision means that the women in Louisiana escape a devious law that they want to take their health and their rights , '' said Nancy Northup , president and chairman of the Center for Reproductive Rights , which had sued on behalf of three of the state 's five clinics , in order to stop the law .
It was not immediately clear whether the ruling also extended to the doctors from two hospitals , which has not joined the lawsuit and had also applied for the rights .
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have enacted similar laws and courts have recently declared unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi for such measures .
Key points of a law in Texas , which would have forced the closure of most of the remaining clinics in the state , were stopped by a federal judge on Friday .
Abortion supporters and the American College of Ostretricians and high impact violence , as well as the American Medical Association say unanimously that the rights of doctors are demanding unnecessary restrictions .
Keep abortion opponents counter that the measures serve to protect the health of women , although some also welcomed the impact of a closure of clinics .
Only a doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana , has Patienteineinweiserechte , told the center for reproductive rights .
If all the other doctors in the state be forced to carry out any more abortions , this doctor would no longer perform the operation out of fear for his safety , the group said .
In their arguments against the ruling , representatives of the state of Louisiana said that they would not punish doctors for the implementation of abortion , while their applications on Pati duck against rights were still pending .

Israeli children return back to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas in the vicinity of the Gaza Strip returned back to the schools on Monday , after they had spent the summer in air shelters , while rocket and mortar fire went down to their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza and the schools remained closed , while the area is recovering from the fighting .
The school start brought communities in southern Israel drawn by the rocket shot holes with a sense of joy and expectation , but the signs of the battles are still fresh .
In the southern city of Ashdod remote employees of the `` Pashosh '' -Kindergartens , which was hit by a rocket , before the arrival of pupils shrapnel shards from the walls and sliding walls .
`` We have a little bit of fear , but are excited , '' said Ronit Bart , Anwohnerin in the caves of Saad and local English teacher .
Many children in our area urgently need a return to a routine .
Their 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it felt `` a bit strange '' suddenly to go back to school .
`` These were difficult times , and we have not even gone out of the house , '' she said .
President Johns Hopkins researchers Rivlin visited the caves near the border with Gaza , in order to offer his support .
Until a cease-fire in the war last week , thousands of residents of border communities like Saad remained in their homes or left their homes to safer areas further removed from Gaza and escape the rocket and mortar fire .
Many residents of Ein Oz , a town near the border with Gaza , a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar grenade , are still with the return .
The Ministry of Education said that about a dozen families had not yet returned .
Their children were temporarily housed in other schools .
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot , a border town to Gaza , which is badly scarred by Palestinian fire .
He appealed to the children to learn a lot , and said `` we will make sure that you get their knowledge and offer security . ''
Israel and Hamas agreed last Tuesday on a permanent cease-fire .
The cease-fire caused an immediate end to the fighting ; important issues remain unresolved , such as Hamas 's demand for a lifting of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of air and sea ports in Gaza .
Israel is calling for the disarmament of Hamas and the transfer of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting .
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin later this month in Egypt .
More than 2,100 Palestinians have been killed in the war , three-quarters of them civilians , and at least 494 children according to estimates of the Palestinians and the United Nations .
Israel disputes this information and estimates that at least half of those killed are fighters , but presented no concrete evidence for this information .
On the Israeli side , 66 soldiers and six civilians , including a Thai worker , were killed .
Hamas and other militants in Gaza fired 4.591 rockets and mortar shells at Israeli cities during the fighting , the majority in the south of the country .
Meanwhile , the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks .
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza area and some 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools that have been turned into temporary protection areas .
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the shelters and the fight continues , the education authorities last week postponed the start of the school year .
`` I hope that the school is open again soon , so that we can continue to learn , as the children in the world and the Jewish children , '' said Mohammad Amara , a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza City .

If the PD again today has a better relationship with strong peace movement in the country , which have contributed to more than 40 percent of the votes of the party in the EU elections in May , then , as noted in PD-circles , Federica Mogherini played its part .
The reproaches in Brussels , the EU 's new foreign officers have too little diplomatic experience , that lacks in substance , is out in the PD .
In Brussels , especially from Poland and the Baltic members , mistrustful realistic touches her following the crisis in Ukraine and vilified as `` Russia-friendly course .

The NRW-CDU , however , insists on their `` no '' vote to a toll on all roads .
Merkel stressed that Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble ( CDU ) also put a constructive role in the discussions for a bill .
Beyond the issue , he spoke with Dobrindt also on other ways to enable more private capital for investment in infrastructure , such as the broadband expansion .
`` There is nothing special . '' Schäuble had left a `` mirror '' report comments on Sunday , his house to check its own concept highway to reimburse investors with toll revenues - after the election in 2017 .

Therefore , they should receive a full compensation for the toll on the car tax .
The model should not penalize foreign drivers but under EU law because of their nationality .

The Socialists in France should `` shut up and put France in order , '' said the most important ally of Francois Hollande .
Mr Valls called the deeply divided left to show `` their love '' for the controversial socialist president , whose cabinet reshuffle is met with disapproval at the vast majority of the French .
The president deserves everyone 's respect , he deserves our loyalty , he deserves our support .
`` It is our duty to remain at his side , '' he said to loud applause .
As anodyne gesture was the Prime Minister insisted that his government 's controversial 35-hour week in France despite intense demands for a relaxation of the rules of the new economy minister , Emmanuel Macrons , will not call into question .
On Saturday , Mr Hollande urged his Mitsozialisten to show `` united '' with the government .
But the justice minister , Christiane Taubira , rubbing sand in the gears , in which she appeared at a meeting breakaway socialist deputy and the Socialist Party attacked that they take `` the belief in their future , '' the French .
Marine Le Pen , the far-right leader of the National Front , derided the constant infighting of the socialists and said that they could not imagine that the new Valls government would stick for more than a few months .
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes , but Prince Manuel Valls also has no , they are not forced to form a new government , if the old times has survived a summer .
`` And the new will also do not survive the fall or winter , '' said Miss Le Pen told supporters .
They repeated their party 's reputation after a dissolution of Parliament and said she was confident to emerge victorious in early elections and is ready for government .
France 's ruling party suffered a defeat in the local elections in March and the right-wing National Front was in the EU elections in May .
A poll in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche showed that 76 percent of French people are of the opinion that the Socialist Party is the risk to crumble before the end of 2017 in several rival groups of Hollande 's tenure .
Pascal Perrineau , a political scientist at the University of Sciences Po , warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new Socialist government can not improve the economy and record unemployment figures .
`` There is a small window of opportunity , but public opinion must quickly feel that things are changing , '' he warned .
Otherwise , the situation could deteriorate further .

Going back to the American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have tabled a bill to establish the organization of trade unions as a civil right .
`` Die , die as unions and the middle-class jobs , '' said Ellison , a Democrat from Minnesota and vice-chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress .
So I am proud , together with the civil rights icon John Lewis , the employee Ermächtigungsgesetz before .
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal options with discrimination because of the organization of trade unions and other forms of discrimination - and stops set so anti-union forces .
The addition of the national labor law , to create an opportunity for discriminating against abandoned workers to organize a union representation , to bring to justice in a civilian court - and to receive compensation or criminal money - is a sensible and necessary initiative .
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - certainly not by American standards .
Indeed , the best way to understand what Ellison , Lewis and the other sponsors of the bill suggest the link back to a very American idea .
Despite the setbacks , which were exposed to the trade unions in recent years - in Wisconsin , Michigan and other states across the country - to have encouraged Americans once countries around the world to recognise labour rights and respect .
There was a time in which millions of Americans remember , when this country called democracy , freedom of speech , freedom of the press and the right of association in the same breath .
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II , General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution , which should ensure that the militarized autocracy Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy .
In full awareness of the fact that the workers and their unions took a role in the creation of a new Japan , they used a language that are explicitly recognized that guarantees workers ' rights of association and collective bargaining and action. ``
When the United States occupy Germany after World War II , General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff pushed the Germans , to write a constitution that would ensure that the fascism Adolf Hitler would be replaced by a strong democracy .
In recognition of the fact that the workers would have to organize and should raise their voice in the new nation , the Germans added a clause , which explicitly testified : `` The right to form associations to secure and improve labor and economic conditions will guarantee every individual and every profession or trade .
Agreements that restrict this right or seek to diminish it are null and void ; measures aimed to are illegal .
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt held the presidency of the International Commission on Human Rights , designed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , as it was taken over by the United Nations as a global agreement in 1948 , Roosevelt and the other authors added a guarantee that `` everyone has the right to form unions to protect its interests or to join them . ''
For generations , Americans accept the basic premise that labour rights are human rights .
As other countries in this country could advised how to shape civilian and democratic societies , told Americans that the right to the establishment of a union - and that the union could then take part in collective bargaining as an equal partner with companies and government agencies - must be protected .
After these rights in America come under attack , it is actually very wise to lead the American ideal in mind that working people must have the right to unite and to make themselves heard in a free and open society .
Fifty years ago , as Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said :
The story is a great teacher .
Now all know that the labor movement is not suppressing the strength of the nation , but they grew .
By raising the living standards of millions of people , work miraculously created a market for the industry and the nation as a whole increased to unimaginable levels of production .
Forget those who attack the work these simple truths , but they kept the story .
The story recalls , and we should do this .
The formal recognition of the work rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights and protection against discrimination in the creation of workers ' representatives - is long overdue .
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that have made America great in the past and the promise of democracy einlösten .

Why was no blockbuster `` Guardians of the Galaxy ''
`` The Expendables 3 '' by Sylvester Stallone played less than $ 30 million of its budget of $ 90 million in the United States , while `` Sin City : A Dame to Kill For '' only $ 12 million of its budget of $ 70 million album .
The film `` Sex tape '' tailored to Cameron Diaz played only $ 14.6 million on opening weekend , while children 's films such as `` tame dragons made easy 2 '' also disappoint in revenue .
An article in the Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that the lack of quality in the films themselves in children 's films could be the reason .
Collin described as `` the worst year '' in 2014 so far for children 's films and described `` dragon tame made easy 2 '' as a `` functional '' fantasy sequel .
In films for a slightly older audience , it seems as if the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem .
In July , entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore- and Meta critic rating for every summer film start between the American Memorial Day and July 20 , 2013 and was shown in the current year to at least 2000 canvases .
The results are based on the opinions of cinemagoers and film critic and suggest that this year 's film hits are equivalent to those of last year .
Some commentators believe that the development is due to changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of Web-streaming services such as Netflix .
The director Jon Favreau , is currently working on Disney 's upcoming jungle book movie , the Hollywood reporter on the website said : `` I believe that the times are changing . ''
We must accept that and do not try to run in the past .
In contrast to the currently weak funds results of Hollywood productions , Netflix streaming content in recent sales of $ 1.2 billion , almost twice as much as last year , in which sales totaled $ 837 million .
Last summer , the director Steven Spielberg 's film studios to ensure that they are very focused on Harry Potter of comics and predicted a `` meltdown '' in Hollywood .
Seen in the light of the current downturn , some commentators argue that its grim prophecy could contain a real core .
Due to the potential blockbuster expected in the summer of 2015 , including Aven Gers : The Age of Ultron , Minions and Jurassic World , however , other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic .
The producer of X-Men , Simon Kinberg , recently described the decline of cash results as simply `` cyclical '' and said to the Hollywood reporter : `` The next summer will be the biggest summer at the cinema office at all , and no one is more concerned about the business . ''

The castle clubs will soon be back in the same direction ?

Now the boards are thinking about a possible cooperation .
As a model for the reconstruction of the Wolf Council Hauser Castle , the late Richard Dimbath , a former chairman of the Council of the Wolf Hauser castle friends , having the project in France .
A year ago , there was no good climate between the club and the castle friends Wolfratshausen .
So far , the positions , as Hauser Castle and a possible reconstruction should be dealt with the history of the Wolf Council seemed very different .
Now the two sides move to each other , it will soon be held talks on a common approach .
Confirm that the club stands Torsten Invest ( Castle ) and Herbert Piffl ( and friends ) on demand of our newspaper .
`` I have called Mr Piffl and suggested that we could sit down together again , '' Invest reported .
In his view , all members of both clubs could pull together again in the future .
So there are visible results more quickly .
While the castle suddenly friends with the late Richard Dimbath until recently had an eye on a reconstruction of the castle in the mountain forests , the `` development and Erlebbarmachung '' for the club to Invest is at the forefront of the terrain .
Herbert Piffl , second president of the castle friends , has become very pleased about the call by its own account .
Since Dimbaths death , it is the castle friends .
A new chairman is to be found in a general meeting in mid-September .
The club is currently around 40 members , according to the 74-year-olds .
`` We have the club activities out of respect for the death of my friend Richard Dimbath first leave . '' This `` thinking period '' would have been necessary in order `` to consider how it could continue . ''
According to the Piffl , the new chairman will then go into the conversation with the club .
In the meantime , the castle friends could also make a current mood within their group .

`` But I am confident that someone will find . '' He himself will not stand because he has his residence in Bad Toelz .
The new chairman should be a wolf council houses .
The Toelzer wants to continue to contribute to the project `` but very happy . ''
The different views in terms of reconstruction in the eyes Piffls would remain in the near future .
He appreciates Dimbath as a `` missionary '' who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle .
Two similar , already far advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not a pipe dream .
By a large part of the population , as well as volunteers from all over the world , they are a tourist magnet .
Piffl : `` I was skeptical at first .
But over time , I am more and more to the conclusion that it is sensible to press ahead with the project . `` We could create a '' unique selling point `` for the raftsmen city .
Here , there is nothing else .
Moreover , the project by EU subsidies , visitor tickets and potential sponsors would be affordable , believes Piffl .
`` The idea of reconstruction will jettison I personally is not easy . '' He hope that the club at this point might make a difference .
Their goal , first to document the history , `` is important and good . ''

This makes for an almost unsustainable duopoly , which calls for a complete comprehensive reform .
But the incoming chairman would risk it , to stand on everything and disassemble an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty , while he is perhaps even about his job .
It is a difficult task .
And as if that were not enough , even many are keen to see the BBC reduced - overtaken power , money and status .
While the competition is approaching old and new technologies threaten comfortable collateral is the upcoming trial of royalties for the BBC with special risks .
For the modest sum of £145,50 per year , the British public is certainly the largest media company in the world .
The BBC tells a good story : She says that they reached 96 percent of all households , and each of them costs only 40 pence per day .
And apparently , the BBC on the popularity scale back up : 53 percent support it today , compared to 31 percent 10 years ago .
The vision for the BBC and usage habits have changed : I get news headlines today on my mobile phone and see missed programmes later on the iPlayer .
But it remains a very considerable and beloved institution .
It needs a considerable chairman - I hope she has found him .

Under this view , there is peace and quiet
A powerful tribe showed us to our puzzle for the summer series `` My piece of Rhöner happiness '' last Friday .
There are still a number of these giant trees in the county , the copy is the `` Geißruheiche '' above under white aroma .
A bumpy one walk leads up to the 600-year-old oak tree .
It is past couple , basalt outcroppings and basalt stone seas .
A little bit below the quarry from Bauer Berg , a mile north of the road after Weisbach , this is it .
Vital is the natural monument , it stands on the other trees in the area and remembers with a circumference of about eight metres of an American mammoth tree .
A small Buddha on a tree stump suggests that it is a spiritual or mystical place .
But , despite intensive research , there was no mention in the name of origin .
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has extra consulted the Bischofsheimer archive and questioned under white aroma of older people to learn what Bewandtnis it has with the Geißruheiche .
The result of his research was the very sober explanation for the name .
According to about 80 years ago have driven the goat shepherd of their animals under white hours on the meadows laboriously cleared and released by stones .
At the foot of the tree , the animal keeper exhausted by the rise should have rested .
In the meantime , the area has regained its importance for actually feed on the meadows and goat herds .
The area has also been declared the core area of the Biosphere Reserve , Schneider has found further .
When entering the stone collections should be cautious , however , because the basalt heated by the sun is also a popular haunt for otters .
A path leads from under white aroma to the tree , but something is hidden .
Other routes are signposted , the direction high Rhön climb and to invite a long hike .
Where is the water castle ?
A water castle , which is looking at our next task , however , is rather rare to find in height .
The reflection in the ditch is already a good impression from the building , but we have a number of historic buildings in the county , which could fit the building portrait .
Where is our `` piece from Rhöner happiness '' ?

After the election in Saxony CDU deputy Strobl , NPD-ban process into question
Given the loss of votes of the NPD in Saxony CDU-Federal Deputy Thomas Strobl has called for an end to the ongoing NPD ban procedure in the constitutional court .
Berlin - The CDU Federal Deputy Thomas Strobl should find an end to the current ban against the NPD in the constitutional court .
`` The NPD performs worse than last time , '' said Strobl , who is also the CDU-country chief in Baden-Württemberg , the Leipziger Volkszeitung. ``
This is a welcome development in the right direction and a development that makes me come to the conclusion that the NPD fought politically and not before the Constitutional Court .
The NPD has been very close to the five-percent hurdle in the vote on Sunday .
A first attempt was for a ban on the far-right party in 2003 had failed , because the Constitution protect whistle-blowers in the NPD leader at the time .
In December 2013 , the Federal Council after a long preparation filed a new request in Karlsruhe .
Government and parliament , do not .

Matthies says : Time to a large network
Given the galloping technological progress , which threatens to turn our cosy home in high-tech halls , our columnist Bernd Matthies comforting themselves with a very familiar electronic accessories .
As I write this , my view of the spiral cable that connects the listener with the phone , and I think : Boah , as retro is that ?

No , typos : Electronic ) sector is the rule that today 's world premiere of electrical waste of tomorrow , bought - outdated .
And who , for example , still has a tube TV in the living room , saying only that he is opposed to television as a matter of principle .
Why these considerations ?
Because the IFA Andrängen am Funkturm this week to regain our absolute incompetence in matters of electronics .
To the layman , in the past , washing machine and CD player blind dominated , today do not even understand the purpose of the devices with incredible eitlem Expertensprech spread before him : `` Connected home , award celebration , Health Care and Urban Technologies '' promises the press office .

Yes , it is , however , an air-conditioning .
But a dream will certainly be true : We lift our watch , say it out loud , `` suck ! '' - and home runs the vacuum cleaning robots .
Misleading .
All amounts to nothing less than a revolution : `` Blurring the boundaries between white and brown goods , '' raunt an industry experts , you can connect the washing machine with a set of headphones , the steam garer sends the weather forecast and the data glasses indicates how long the pizza in the oven still needs , but nothing is , because we are in a traffic jam .
From the daily practice , we also know that , if a neumodisches device is urgently needed , the battery is empty .
Another reason is that the spiral cable on the phone will survive the next radio shows .

HR4-700 cyclists ride in the park by bath salt ( and Scots stopovers a
If cyclists on their tour in bath salt ( or Scots stopping , that in itself is nothing special .
On Friday , however , the number of stopping impression : The 700 participants of the hr4 bike ride alone and accompanying entourage enjoyed a break in the lower end of bath salts , and later a party in the open air in the country of old Castle Park .
Under the motto `` cycle and celebrate on newly discovered ways between Nidda and Kinzig '' had the participants met on Thursday in Bad Vilbel and witnessed a concert of Van Baker & Band .
On Friday it was taken seriously : The cyclist took the first stage , the 60 kilometers on FLOR city after bath salt , and continue to Scots in attack .
In bath salts , were the athletes of Mayor Hans-Peter Seum associated with the bicycle as mentioned before , and the head of the own operation bath salt in Bad Vilbel , Petra swing-Döring , welcomed .
The refreshment of body and mind had been prepared for all sorts of good things : The country had women from Ranstadt and low-mock city 85 sheets apple , Zwetschen- , streusel cake and cheese cake baked a mouth that the talented cyclists .
`` These cakes can only bake country women , '' a participant from Aulendiebach praised , while he refused another piece .

The `` duo Bravo '' led the visitors with well known arias from operas and musicals and received enthusiastic applause .
The beautiful setting of the park was relaxing .
A man was also a head massage of his partner : `` He deserves , because he has already secured abgesprungene bicycle chains . ''
Meanwhile , the mayor and the operational head still work : They were interviewed by reporters Rainer Janke at the fountain in front of the historical house and took the opportunity to advertise on the radio for bath salt sojourn .
Promotion chef Tobias Hagen , since the first hr4 bike ride in 2004 as a tour manager , also could just run out of steam , he still had plenty to do with the technology on the ground .
His pickup truck , in which he communicated through three phones and a radio with his staff and the 15-member motorcycle police squadron of Hesse , wrote Facebook entries and reports , also needed a check .
`` The majority of participants comes from the Rhine-Main area , '' he told me , `` but also from casting or Fulda , Lauterbach or the Taunus and even travelled from many cities in Westphalia cyclists .
The number of participants is a bit after the night capacity available .
In Category I , participants will be housed in hotels in Category II in collective accommodation .
The cyclist had a good impression when they departed again after an hour and a half from the resort : `` Bye ! ''
`` It was nice in bath salt ! '' She gained the departure .
After the arrival in Scotland , the group could insert a brief breather .
But , in the evening , called for the cyclist in the idyllic old Castle Park .
Under the direction of the company for tourism and city marketing Schott ( GTS ) , the park had received a nice atmosphere and , of course , was prepared foods , such as the middle with well-chilled white feather .

Yesterday , after 180 kilometres of cycling together , met the athletes back in Bad Vilbel .

Tax burden of businessmen in the Washington area is rising with the economic recovery
A recovery of the economy means more customers , more sales and new jobs .
It also means higher taxes .
State and local tax rulings for companies in the country rose slightly last year , while the economic recovery accelerated in the past week , and the companies in the Washington area , according to a newly published study were no exception .
Companies in the District , Maryland and Virginia paid $ 27.6 billion in state and local authorities together in the 2013 financial year , an increase of 3.8 percent compared to revenue of $ 26.6 billion in 2012 .
The state and local tax burden of businesses rose by 4.3 percent to $ 671 billion last year , compared to 3.9 percent in the previous year , and it was the third year in a row after several years of falling voided in 2009 and 2010 .
State taxes more than the local taxes , increased by 4.3 percent , according to the study , which was conducted by the Center for State taxation , a tax policy group of the service agency Ernst & Young .
More than half of the District , 56 % , revenue comes from corporate taxes , while 36 percent of Mary 's revenues come from businesses .
Virginia has the lowest tax revenue from businesses , with 28 percent .
A large part of the increase in the tax revenue is due to a recovery of corporate real estate values , the researchers say , which led to an increase in property taxes at 3.7 percent this year after three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent .
While a large proportion of these profits came from big states like California , New York and Texas , the process seems appropriate for the Washington area .
Companies in the District , Maryland and Virginia paid more than $ 10 billion in state and local property taxes together last year , compared to $ 9.6 billion in 2012 - a 4.2 percent increase in the course of a year .
But the apparent recovery in the real estate values is not as effective in the increase of state and local tax revenues in Maryland , as in the real estate taxes amount to barely more than a fifth of corporate tax rulings .
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes .
`` Happens in Maryland is the following : A large part of the real estate , particularly in the tax area around D.C. , either by the government or by non-profit organizations that do not pay property taxes , '' said Douglas Lindholm , director of the Center on State Taxation .
Maryland is therefore forced to rely much more on income taxes , for example , to be able to offer the same services that offer other states .
The recent recovery in tax revenues by companies can not be attributed solely to the recovery of the property market
Corporate revenues also seem to recover , so the data .
Businesses in the region reported income taxes in state organizations of $ 2.3 billion compared to $ 2.1 billion in 2012 .
Maryland took $ 1 billion in corporate income taxes , the highest amount in the region .
While the trend in the same direction , the local tax burden for businesses is not evenly in all three places .
The growth rate was significantly higher in the District corresponded with the national average of 4.3 percent , while the increase in Maryland , 4.9 percent .
Only Virginia reported an average tax revenue from 4.1 percent .
Virginia has the lowest corporate income taxes ( in all three with 6 percent in all three areas , there are strong business rates ) .
The corporate tax rate from 8.25 percent in Maryland and the District at relatively high 9,975 percent .
A similar study at the beginning of this year , the US Chamber of Commerce showed that lower state and local business taxes will be required in Virginia and a total of a better tax climate than in Maryland .
The district was not examined in the study .
Despite the advantages , Virginia has been under pressure from its southern neighbors .
North Carolina has passed laws to reduce its corporate tax rates in this year of 6.9 percent to 6 percent , the same rate as Virginia , and the rate will fall to 5 percent in the coming year .
If the government continues to achieve its revenue targets in the coming year , this law could reduce the state 's corporate income tax rate to 3 percent by 2017 .
In the meantime , it seems to be the small businesses in the Washington area , and they are therefore more state and local taxes , according to the latest study .
Corporate taxes , which are paid by small businessmen as personal income taxes - a transitional structure , organized by the most businesses - in the District , Maryland and Virginia rose by 20 percent to $ 2.4 billion in the past year , a clear faster growth rate than the corporate taxes as a whole .
The researchers say that the trend and the increase in corporate taxes across the country will probably continue in this year , with an increase of general VAT revenue for the state and local governments by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year .
However , if the spending cuts by the federal government has an impact on the labour market in the region , the Washington area could lag behind .

4 tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you would like to make photos or videos under water , there are a variety of devices .
The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot , such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action-cam , such as the GoPro Hero3 + Silver edition , both of which are to be had for about $ 300 .
I have these photos at a family party with several cameras , all of which are available at a price of under $ 350 .
Regardless of the equipment , there are a few rules for the best results .
Check your equipment twice .
Even if you have a waterproof camera , make sure that the battery compartment and other subjects are densely closed .
Set your camera on the photos or videos that you want to capture .
Some cameras and camcorders feature scenes and recording sessions with which the exposure time is optimized for the dämmrigen underwater conditions .
And before you jump into it , check , up in the depth of your equipment is functional .
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet , others by 50 or 60 feet .
Search for traditional and waterproof models in our shopping guide and the ratings for digital cameras .
Take multiple shots , because many will not be achieved .
Point-and-shoot cameras usually do not have a flat , with which you can compose images , action-cams .
Even if you have an LCD , it is difficult to see this under water , and the right attitude is a matter of chance .
So take many pictures .
If your camera has a terraced mode , in which a number of shots are made with slightly different exposure settings , use it .
Stay close to the surface .
The light will be dramatically worse , the further you remove themselves from the surface .
If possible , you remain so close to the surface , if you make shots in a pool , a lake or the sea .
You can also bring more color in your photos ; the deeper you go , the less you will see color .
Go close to the objects .
It is also a good advice on land , but it is all the more important because of the poor lighting conditions under water .
It is particularly important if you are working with an action-cam : These devices often have a wide-angle lens , which means that you have to get closer to your objects , if they are to fill the entire picture frame .

Österreichs after second season victory in third place in the table .
With the 2-0 on Grödig a bitter week for Rapid has taken a hoping end on Sunday .
`` The victory is very liberating , '' said coach Zoran Barisic , whose team had reached a low with the death in the Europa League on Thursday .
`` The sense of achievement was incredibly important , '' confirmed captain and Müller Steffen Hofmann , who came in third place with green and white .
Schrammel Traumtor brings Rapid on winning street Rapid has shown the right response to the disappointment with the second season victory against Helsinki and comes with a success in the countries game break .
`` We wanted to show a positive response , '' said foreign defender Thomas Schrammel , with its splendid leadership-volley from Sechzehnereck has asked the course to victory in the 14th minute .
`` I thought , I Hau all the frustration of Thursday purely and schnalzte it under the bar , '' said the 26-year-old smiling .
The last time Schrammel on 13 Novmember 2010 so far had taken in a league game , it was still in Ried .
The first championship match in Rapid-dress will therefore remain in special memory .
`` This is something special for me , I am from the Rapid-kids , '' said Schrammel .
Due to the short-term pelvic-Blessur of Mario Pavelic became Schrammel from the left to the right defensive side and also did very well in his cause .
He has enough experience , that he can put this position also reversed .
The gate has earned it , he has done some assists this year already , `` praised Barisic .
Team shows character Schrammel delivered Hofmann 's flank for 2-0 after an hour , that finally brought the decision .
Because before that could well can also contact the guests .
`` Thank God we have had a bit of luck today , '' said Schrammel , alluded to the divergence of performance and result in recent weeks : `` The results have not voted , but the playful was always good compared to last year . ''
Barisic was , in fact , that it was `` in many games before better than today '' - against `` the strongest team that has played in this season in this stadium . ''
The first Dreipunkter since July 26 have therefore proved that the team structure is intact despite the setbacks : `` Today my team has shown that it has character . ''
Equally pleasing for him : `` That we finally have played back to zero . ''
A lot of work while countries break Even the fact that Brian Behrendt , Mario Pavelic , Christopher Dibon , Deni alar and Michael Schimpelsberger mourning several failures , and Srdjan Grahovac , Stefan Stangl and Philipp pushed be citizens gave their Startelfdebüts makes the victory even more valuable .
`` We must not forget that , '' warned Barisic , which lost in the last three days with Behrendt and Pavelic players , `` which were very stable in recent times . ''
The countries break should therefore be used to `` lick wounds and purchase a bit in physical terms , '' said Barisic , which has five U21 squad players in its ranks .
The break is particularly suits , one is Captain Hofmann .
He breaks for the team , goes beyond pain over it .
In this difficult stage , he has shown that he is a very important player for us , `` noted Barisic .
Hofmann gave the Rapids game before his replacement in the 68 minute not only the structure , but also scored the second goal .
For the 33-year-olds , who completed his 350 . Bundesliga game , it was the first hit out of the game since 2 November 2013 ( 4 : 2 on the eigentlich ) .
Hofmann : `` Can not believe that everything now is good , '' `` We have certainly had a bit of luck , but eventually the happiness must come back to us .
Now it was time , `` he said .
He warned , however , remain to be concentrated : `` You should not always black and white .
In the last few weeks we have not played as badly as it has been presented .
But we must not think that all is well .
He did not deny the importance of his role for the team .
It is a very young team that I can help a lot at the moment .
To keep themselves in certain phases , but to me , `` he said .
Grödig-coach Michael Baur himself and his team had few complaints .
He regretted the fast against hits `` from the category Zaubertor , '' as well as the regular gate of the farm in the 40th minute by referee Kollegger had been wrongly denied .
The only criticism I can make the team is that we were not specific enough towards the gate at some stages .
Because we have had too few qualifications .
Inside defender Maximilian Karner looked like it : `` It is a bad start , but we have only found and even made a gate .
On the whole , it would have been better .

BERKELEY said housing market back to `` normal ''
One of London 's most prominent developers pointed out that the housing market in the south-east of England returned to normal levels `` . ''
Homes in the capital were hotly sought and subject to huge price increases , which led to the Bank of England due to the widespread fear of a credit bubble , in June to put limits on mortgage loans .
Tony Pidgley , founder and CEO of high-class Bauunternehmens Berkeley said on Monday : `` Since the beginning of the current financial year , the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the peak in 2013 , '' and added that this is a `` stable environment '' offer .
The housing market in London was well positioned during the downturn , because foreign buyers pushed in the capital .
According to the register office , prices in the city alone jumped last year increased by 18.5 percent , far more than the average increase in England and Wales as a whole .
The average selling prices of Berkeleys private , cheap and student services rose by about a fifth last year and were at the end of April to £423.000 .
However , a stronger pound has made property in London less attractive to foreign buyers in recent months - some of them have also been deterred by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric about a possible `` villas '' tax before the general election next May .
The London estate agent Foxtons warned that the mortgage market report for April , which were introduced stricter lending rules in the past week , would also lead to lower market growth in both property sales as the prices in the second half of the year .
The Bank of England on Monday new data show a decline in the mortgage approval in July , which also indicates that the housing market is cooling .
Hamptions International , another real estate agency , revised down its forecast for the rise in house prices in London for 2015 to 3 per cent , on the basis of an already flagging house price consciousness .
The transaction volume in London 's most expensive areas such as Chelsea , Mayfair and Kensington is now has fallen by a quarter year on year , according to the real estate agent wa Ellis .
However , the desire for a home in the capital is a boon to Berkeley , because the sums due to date sales amounting to more than £2.2 billion .
Mr Pidgley added : `` The demand for the right , well-planned product in the best locations remained stable and , as a result , the futures sales remained stable . ''
In June , the company reported that it had sold 3.742 new homes in the year to the end of April - almost a third more than the 2007 peak before the crisis .
The annual pre-tax profit rose by 40 per cent to £280 million , sales at 18 per cent to £1.6 billion annually .
In a statement on Monday before the company 's annual meeting , Mr Pidgley said that the revenue for Berkeley in the current year would be expected to comply with the current market expectations .
Analysts estimate in the annual pre-tax profit to £450 million .
BERKELEY shares were trading in the afternoon in London at £23,96 .

Children need roots and wings
He was 44 years in school service , 23 of them as a school leader .
From that time , Manfred Richter knows many hardend Peter domestic and Kollbacher from their time as students .
His methods were sometimes unconventional , but always worn by his desire to see the students to the people .
The Snezka is the most famous mountain of the Giant Mountains .
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the theme from his home country .
Judge was born in 1930 in Trautenau / North Bohemia , Trutnov today .
At 14 he was himself after four years of secondary school for the teaching profession .
A year later , the Sudeten Germans were expropriated .
Within half an hour , the family had to leave their house .
It came after a few months in a camp in Bavaria in 1946 - in freight wagon .
So it convinces judges to the Upper FRÄNKISCHE reduce village .
The teacher education took place in Bamberg .
Manfred Richter six times per week run 10 kilometers to the next station , had to travel by train to Bamberg , where three kilometres across the entire city to go to school and back in the evening .
After two months , Manfred judge a sleeping opportunity in a Red Cross shelter in Bamberg , along with up to 15 classmates in a dormitory .
In 1951 , he made the first and the second state examination in 1954 after three years teacher candidates .
Since Upper Franconia had no free teacher point for him , he applied himself to Upper Bavaria and came to the school in Kollbach on November 1 , 1954 .
The `` Miss-room , '' was his first `` service '' in the school house .
In 1958 , he was a three-bedroom apartment in new buildings teacher house next to the school .
This house bought Manfred Richter in 1980 , after the school had been dissolved in Kollbach 1968 .
In the meantime , there were three classes in school association Peter Mitte Kollbach and Peter , five in Kollbach .
From the 1968 / 69 school year they were grouped into Peter Mitte in today 's town hall .
When the school board was founded in Indian village , remained only the primary school in the village .
In order to avoid a downgrading in the smaller school , the former chancellor George Sigl switched to Karl field - and Manfred Richter , his successor .
But Peter ( grew , and so were the children and their teachers from September 1982 to today 's construction , which was expanded after a judge retirement in 1997 .
Manfred judge praises the generosity of then-Mayor Ludwig Götz , built on local costs in a basement workroom and enlargement of 1997 , although this was not eligible for co-financing under the guidelines for school buildings .
`` Mayor Götz was very friendly , '' recalled are grateful to judges .
In his entire career , Manfred Richter has never forgotten the speech of a government representative , who had responded to a unit of a school Council on Law and Justice : `` We must never forget the love . '' Manfred Richter began with what he had heard a young teacher .
`` You must consider the two children : Roots and wings , '' says the now 84-year-old .
And he had to learn : `` Do not always succeed . '' Whether he thinks his students , or just his own six children , is not entirely clear .
In any case , Judge Tun was sometimes unconventional .
If students apply to 1993 , got it from him not a criminal work and were also ordered not to sit .
At the expense of the community , judges had two pairs Boxhandschuhe upgrade and left the two sides compete , even if it should be a violet .
For the sake of the school used judges as rector a good relationship for then-Mayor Ludwig Götz ( CSU ) .
This was the partyless judge after his retirement in 1996 to stand at least as last on the CSU list for the council .
But judges was selected at number six and joined the CSU .

Ailinn Solomon 's was a trembling delicate beauty with untamed hair and a fluttering heart from a village on the North Island , which was even more remote and harsh as Port Reuben .
They had come with an older accompaniment to the south , held the Kevern for her aunt , and had inherited a property in a damp but heavenly valley with the correct name Paradise Valley .
Over several years , no one had lived in the house .
The pipes were taking , in the bathrooms were still spinning , nudibranchs had left their mark on all windows and believed that they belong to all of this , and the garden was overgrown with weeds , it looked like a huge cabbage .
It was like the house from a children 's tale , both threatening and tempting , a garden full of secrets .
Portrait of the author : Howard Jacobson , whose novel `` J '' is on the list for the Man Booker Prize in 2014 .
The shortlist will be announced in the coming week .
Kevern had sat with Ailinn Händchen contestants on the broken chairs in the high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon , both had a spirit absent slotted into the console , which provided the country with soothing music and soothing news crossed as the sight of her brown legs reminded him of an old song of a long forgotten black entertainer , and his father had listened in closed shutters in the House .
Your feet are too great .
Due to their own aggressiveness songs of this kind were not played more on the console .
Not banned - nothing was really banned - just not played .
It was successfully obsolesziert , such as the word obsoleszieren .
The general taste , which had never managed decrees and regulations , and how people vote in books , the memoir From-dish washer-to-millionaire cookery books and romantic novels , they chose the ballads in the music .
In the euphoria of the day began Kevern big feet to an imaginary piano to play and in a gross-Komische Serenade Ailinns besingen .
Ailinn do not understand this .
`` This was a well-known song called a jazz pianist Fats Waller , '' he told her , and will automatically put two fingers to his lips .
That his father had always done , in order to stop the letter J , before he came out of his mouth .
It had begun as a game between him and his father , when he was still small .
His father had played it with his own father , he says .
If you put a word with a J website offpage without two fingers on your lips , it will cost you a penny .
It was not a very funny game , and it was also not very funny now .
He knew that this was expected of him , that was all .
It had to explain what was jazz .
Ailinn had never heard what .
Jazz was not played , even if he was not directly prohibited .
This was no longer of improvisation .
It was the only place for a single `` if '' in life .
People wanted to be sure at the beginning of a melody , where they would end .
As well as the mind .
His unpredictability made people nervous .
And jazz was musically ausgedrückter mind .
Although he was 10 years old , without having heard of Sammy Davis Junior , Kevern knew something about jazz of the semi-secret collection of old CDs of his father .
But at least he had to Ailinn not declare that Fats Waller was black .
At their age , they probably could not remember a time , in the Popsänger were not black .
That was again no laws or constraints .
A compliant society meant that every element of this society is grateful for the principle of groups agreed with talent , as the fate spared them .
People with Afro-Caribbean origin were suited by temperament and body for entertainment and sports , so sang and ran them .
People who originally came from the Indian subcontinent were blessed with electronic talent as by nature and were served with the task to ensure that no family remained without functioning telephone service .
Still , what was left of the Polish community cared about the sewers ; what was left of the Greeks did plate .
Those from the Gulf and the Levant , whose grandparents did not leave the country quickly than what had happened , if IT happened geschah- for fear of being accused of Feuerschürens , even for fear that the flames would consume them next - had Labneh- and shisha pipe restaurants opened , kept in mind and have been depressed with the inaction .
Each according to his ability .
Because they had heard only ballads , it fell Ailinn difficult to understand how the offensive words , the Kevern 's very front yard had ever could be set to music .
Music was an expression of love .
`` They are not really offensive , '' said Kevern .
Except perhaps for people whose feet are too big .
My father has never offended anyone , but he loved this song .
He talked too much , but the neglected garden gave him a false sense of security .
Nothing could overcome the soundproofing of huge cabbage leaves .
Ailinn still do not understand .
Why would your father should love something ?
He wanted to say that it was a Jux , but hesitated to put two fingers to their lips again in their presence .
They already thought that he was a little strange .
`` It was fun , '' he said to him instead .
She shook her head in disbelief and kept Keverns perspective .
There was nothing to see in the world , as her ungekämmtes pitch black hair .
There was nothing that otherwise he would want to see .
`` If you say it , '' they mean no conviction .
But it never explains why you have me vorsingst .
They seemed genuinely concerned .
My feet are too big ?
He saw yet again .
Your feet do so directly .
Perhaps your ankle , a little bit ...
And then you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick ?
You hate ?
Of course I hate you .
This is just the silly song .
He could have said `` I love you , '' but it was still too early .
`` Your thick ankles are precisely the reason why you find me gefällst , '' he tried it instead .
I am a bit perverse .
That sounded not right .
It was supposed to be funny .
When he tried to be funny , he was often in trouble because , like his father , he does not have the soothing charm that you needed to goad the inherent cruelty in jokes .
Perhaps his father also wanted to be cruel .
Perhaps he wanted to be the , Kevern .
In spite of its kind eyes .
Ailinn Solomon 's was red and arose from their deck chair , raised the console and buried the wine they had drunk .
Elder flowers of wine , drunkenness was no excuse for it .
In their excitement , they seemed to tremble , like palm fronds in the storm .
`` And your thick head is precisely the reason why I am perverse feel attracted to you , '' she said .
Except that I am not at all .
They did him tired , both due to unnecessary unfriendliness showed his words as well as the fear in their eyes , as they revolted against him .
They thought that he would beat them ?
She had not told him of his life on the cold northern archipelago , where they grew up , but he had no doubt that it was essentially such as here .
The same huge and icy ocean broke up here and there on the shore .
The same confused men , with even thicker skin and verdrießlicher after THE what had happened as it had been their ancestors as smugglers and wreckers , moved from pub to pub , always ready to raise a hand against a woman , refused to meet them or derided .
Thick head ?
It would have shown a big fist , if not farewells .
They only Knut Chen - Knut Chen was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women , an antidote to the vacuous love ballads from the console - they only beat Knut Chen and then .
Keverns believe it was an unnecessary refinement that Knut Chen was an act of violence .
Ailinn Solomon 's gave him a sign to go through her body .
He arose from the deck chair as an old man .
They also felt bleiern , but the impact of his grief surprised them .
That was not the end of the world .
They knew very few .
They saw him as he removed himself - as he watched from a room on the top floor of their companion - a man , complained had provoked by something he himself .
Adam leaves the garden , they thought .
They felt a sudden pain for him and men in general , although some had raised their hands against it .
A man turned on her , succumbed to his back , ashamed , defeated , without fighting spirit - why it was a sight that seemed to know them well , if they could not remember a single time , where they had seen something like this before the day before ?
When she was alone again , looked Ailinn Solomon 's on their feet .
An intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of a number of years before the events , ESME Nussbaum , has just told Ofnow , the non-legislative oversight body for the public mood , in a short lecture on the continued violence in low and middle-level in exactly the areas in which they reduce , if not eliminate , most likely to be expected , given the money and energy that had been invested in the eradication of this violence .
`` It was a lot done , and a lot still needs to be done , '' she wrote , `` in order to appease the innate aggressiveness of a people that has won a thousand wars and most of them , especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country in which the sweet breath of human kindness has historically been rarely felt despite the towering church towers between the hedges .
But some properties are ineradicable .
The higher the tower , it seems , the less the passion he still inspires .
The population cries while listening sentimental mental ballads enthralled with stories about overcome difficulties and claims to believe strongly in the virtues of marriage and family life , but it is not just the former rawness rural communities , as well as our urban fabric firmly in control , but there is also evidence for the emergence of a new and devious dispute is looking at home , at work , on the streets , and even on the playing fields .
`` They have an unfortunate tendency to exaggeration , '' her mentor when he had read the entire report said .
I suggest that you read a few novels .
ESME Nussbaum lowered her head .
I must also ask : Are you an atheist ?
`` I believe that I should not say that , '' said ESME Nussbaum .
Are you lesbian ?
Re-appointed ESME on their right to privacy and denial of the statement .
A feminist ?
Silence again .
`` I do not , '' said Luther Rabinowitz , finally , `` because I would be against atheism , Lesbentum or feminism .
This is a prejudice-free workplace .
We serve a prejudice-free society .
But certain types of hyper-sensitivity , which in themselves are absolutely unacceptable and commendable , occasionally can distort results , as you have presented to them .
They have obviously prejudices against the church , and these things that you describe as `` disingenuous '' and `` raw '' could be interpreted as well as an expression of strength and vitality of course by others .
If we continue on the riding around , what will happen if , as if it were , if it had happened , happened yesterday , IT IS done is to take the country 's essential vitality .
ESME Nussbaum looked around , while Rabinowitz said .
Behind his head repeated the advice of an LED lettering in Flamingo Rosa Ofnow gave the country in the last quarter-century or more .
Smile on their neighbours , you value your partner , you will hear ballads , please visit musicals , use your phone , you , you , you hear , you agree to excuse yourself .
Talking is better than silence , the song is better than the written word , but nothing is better than love .
`` I can absolutely understand what you want , '' ESME Nussbaum said in a quiet voice , as she was sure that her boss had spoken to an end , `` and I say anything other than that we are still not healed as effectively as we fool ourselves .
My concern is that without notice of us , we may find , as we repeat the mistakes that led to disclose what will happen if IT IS done in the first place .
This time , but not the other , in which we miss our anger and mistrust .
Luther Rabinowitz form a pyramid with the hands .
To indicate a patience .
`` They go too far , '' he said , `` if you describe the actions as a '' mistake `` that our grandparents may or may not have committed .
They go too far , if you say that they had left their `` anger '' and their `` distrust '' of `` other '' .
It should not be necessary to remind someone in your position that we understand the past , such as the protection of the present , not to speak of `` us '' and `` other '' .
There was no `` we '' and there was no `` others . ''
It was a time of disorder , this is what we know .
`` From the , if we are honest with ourselves , '' dared ESME smash , `` no part of the society can claim to have behave well .
I accuse anyone .
Whether it was done badly or well , what happened , happened .
That was then .
Nothing has to be said - as we are in agreement .
And just as no blame must be assigned , no debt must be repaid , if such a repayment would be appropriate and if there were a way to wipe them .
But what is the past , if we do not learn from it -
The past is designed to ensure that we forget it .
If I may say something -
Luther Rabinowitz , his pyramid coincide .
`` I will remember her report , '' he said and dismissed them .
The next day , when she went to work as usual , it has been overtaken by a motorcyclist , who described as passers-by , was driven into a kind of `` brutal rage '' on the footpath .
There are coincidences .

The infernal tenth year of the survivors of Beslan : Ten years have passed since the horrific siege of the school , like the spate of children are still suffering .
Ten years ago , more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militants in a school in Beslan in southern Russia .
More than 330 people , more than half of them children , have been killed in the three-day ordeal that shocked the world .
We have returned to Beslan , in order to find some of the victims who had escaped the death of bestiality in the classroom .
Exactly a decade after the horrific school siege in Beslan in which 334 people were killed , including 186 children , the heroic survivors warned last night before a new apocalypse in Ukraine .
Children and parents on September 1 , 2004 , the start of a new school year , as fanatical Islamist terrorists captured and killed , it seemed like the böseste of evil .
The tragedy brought together West and East in disgust , and then turned surprisingly in action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery .
Ten years later , we returned to Beslan , in order to find some of the victims who had escaped the death of bestiality in the classroom .
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance , although the memory of this terrorist hell will pursue it forever .
Their best hope ?
Now that the war that Ukraine will now have to cope with - and in the children as they die - to come to an end .
The girl , which was photographed in the attempt , in the age of school sports hall singer
She was photographed by the Russian Star photographer Dimitri Beliakow and famous , when she was only in her underwear , was in the age of school sports hall singer , after a mine exploded .
Totally confused sought Aida after her mother Larissa , now 40 years old .
Both have been held for dead , but they survived .
`` A woman told me that I should run for my life , but I could not , '' Aida said at the time .
My legs were blood flow .
In order to look after my mother , I stood up and climbed back into the pool .
A soldier brought them to safety .
After a series of operations , they completely healed , but said yesterday : `` Before the pain returned three months ago .
I am afraid that I must again be operated on .
Some shrapnel shards are still in my knee .
Their goal is now to be a dentist , in order to help the people , as she was helped by doctors .
`` This tragedy changed my life , but it has not broken me , '' she says a tear .
`` This has happened to me , and that can not be changed .
Once a year I always stayed in the gym to remind me of it there .
My friends and I try not to talk about it , on other days .
The pain is too great .
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there .
We played together when we were little , and dreamt of to go to school together .
`` I do not want to marry until I finish my studies and my career start .
I think of a family .
She says that the siege will always remain a part of it , but the memory of each year is a bit weak .
I am pleased that many people in the world still remember the horrors and we are so grateful for the support we received from people in the UK and all over the place .
When I see the photo online of me , as I understand our disaster in the school zurückklettere I think that many people see it for the first time , and to ensure that this does not happen again .
The boy , who fled by bullets , in the view that his mother is dead
It was his first day ( Russians go with seven years in the school ) and Tamara survived the three-day siege in his mother 's arms .
As seven years , he said , `` mom told me that I should get me if there was an explosion , and hold her hand . ''
After an explosion , he thought she would die .
She said to him : `` Run . ''
Full of fear that they could be dead , he fled and saw the baby on the way to a wine , took it by the hand and fled by bullets .
His father , Vladimir , into the arms of his son out there , said : `` Damir told me that his mother had died .
He said : `` I could not save them . ''
In fact , Tamara outside stumbled with leg injuries in the hospital , for their part in the assumption that her son died .
After its reunification , she said : `` I wept with joy .
I could not believe it .
He ran in and hugged me .
Damir was later flown to London ( of the now dissolved newspaper News of the World ) , in order to receive the title of Barnardo 's Children 's Champion by then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie .
`` This horror is following you every day , but I wish I could stop with the memory , '' he said yesterday .
But I can say that it is pale in my memory .
I remember that I wegwarf directly after all my toy guns .
But now I can play computer games with shot scenes and that is not a problem for me .
`` I am not afraid to go back in the gym , but I do not think about myself .
I remember these children , with whom I have played in the yard , and have not made it to the outside world .
We never say that they have been killed or are dead .
We say that they are stuck in the gym .
I remember my trip to London , particularly in the toy shop , where I was able to choose everything very well what I wanted , and the ride in an open top car .
But he has now fear for the ground like Ukraine , where wars cause the sort of accident that he and his friends suffered .
This horror is following you every day , but I wish I could stop reminding me .
`` I am so sorry for all those who suffer from the answer , '' said Damir , who last week worked as a volunteer in a monastery .
I want to help so much .
I will one day go to the police and hope that they will take me to the training academy next year .
His mother , Tamara , 48 , said : `` 37 children from our neighbourhood were killed , can you imagine that ?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege , there was simply no children who could call and run around , and this silence lasted for many months .
She remembers vividly on their trip to London with Damir .
The people of London cried when I told our story .
I understood at the time , as people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings , and show their support .
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the price and the ability to travel to London in the autumn of 2004 .
I wish I could call Cherie and you say to yourself that 10 years have passed , but I still remind me of her and her husband at the meeting in London , and how it works - and has helped me .
I remember how happy Damir wanted to eat borscht and she cried all local Russian restaurants .
I remember how he played with waiters in a restaurant . - shot with a water pistol on them and they ran away and played with him .
And that was just a month after the horror .
I was surprised that the British are so willing shared our pain and supported us .
She said : `` I always think that this world is not improved in the last 10 years .
In Ukraine , the war now again , and people die every day , and I believe that many children were killed and still be killed .
These are precisely such children as ours .
I think that , for many , the war is a part of the news that you hear when they are bored or preoccupied with something else .
I just know what these people feel throughout the horror .
And I can not stop to feel that .
Nothing has changed , people still want to kill each other , and that is so sad .
Damir was large and is a very gentle and quiet boy , he is not aggressive or angry at all .
He is looking for example not revenge , he is not overwhelmed by recent abominations .
I know that he does not like to remember but he has six close friends from the class and they go occasionally in the sports hall and light candles .
When he was small , he suffered including - I remember , as it is sometimes presented on the sofa , the face away from us , for hours .
Not sleeping , his eyes were open .
I still remember how he threw all his weapons and other military toys away . - is now 17 , bigger than I , handsome , intelligent and healthy .
I can hardly believe that , for a few hours , I was so sure that he was dead and I would never see him again .
When I recovered after the explosion and came on the legs , I saw me and saw the hell around me , with body parts lying around everywhere .
I was absolutely sure that my little boy in the hell could not possibly have survived .
`` I remember that I reminded him , '' Damir , going , going away , `` but I was so sure that he had not heard me .
But he has heard it and he ran away .
And , unlike many others , life goes on for us .
Georgy Ilyin , 17
The boy , whose terrible image after the siege has become the symbol of the horror of Beslan
Comfort : The 2004 Beslan-survivor Georgy Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege , on a picture of born today
His blutüberströmtes face was painted by fear when he ran for his life , while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates .
His image was one of the most shocking symbols for the barbarity of Beslan .
His mother Fatima , 54 , a nurse , had sold him for his first day , before they rushed to bring their older son Vladimir to university .
`` I left the court for about two minutes before the terrorists stormed it , and so was my little boy there for three terrible days alone , '' she recalls .
Not quite alone , there was a whole family of relatives of us , but they were all killed .
Only my born managed to survive .
The closer the date approaches , the harder it is to think and talk about it .
There is no single day on which we remind ourselves of this tragedy .
We do not think that it is a long time ago , I think it would happen yesterday , some scenes from these days are following me constantly .
No one will ever forget that , I assure you .
Urgent : The image of born ( left ) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as statue ( right ) .
I wanted to remember that born on this day are so happy to go to school , he said that he wants to embrace his teacher .
I only knew that he was alive when I saw him on television .
And now there are even this statue of the wine-born in San Marino .
Born does not like the image , and it is hidden at home on the bookshelf .
I understand that , but I also think that people around the world feel our pain , thanks to this image .
Born today says : `` It is important that something like this can never happen again .
`` I doubt that we will ever know the truth .
People investigate such tragedies again and again and never learned the truth .
And now they are investigating the crash of the Boeing in Ukraine .
Will we ever know what caused it ?
This world is becoming something awful .
`` I can not understand how this is possible , because if you ask the people , no one wants a war , so how is this happening ?
Ten years is nothing in such pain .
We need dozens of years to forget it just a little .
It has attacked my health and I still feel it .
About three or four years , I had a few nightmares because of the siege , but then it was better .
I went back to school later in 2004 and had fear every day .
I thought of my friends and classmates who were slain .
So I always in the gym when the 1st September approaches .
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends of mine .
It is difficult for me to go to the gym , but I must do it .
I am not a victim , this story is now a part of my past .
I will not forget it , but I do n't like bemitleide .
My life goes on .
I have concluded the school this year and visit a medical college in Vladikavkaz .
I will be heart surgeon .
My first choice was an education in the army .
I wanted to be a soldier , but my health has not .
I wanted to fight for my country , but that will not happen .
Georgy Fanijew , 20
The boy , who survived , even though he was caught at the foot of a murderous terrorists
A miracle : Georgy Fanijew was caught during the siege at the foot of a murderous terrorists , but he managed to survive .
During the siege , he was caught in the gym and sat beside the bomb , which was attached at the foot of a murderous terrorists .
It really is a miracle that he was not killed .
`` We feel it , as if it was yesterday , '' says Georgy , who wanted to go as the FSB intelligence officer , but could not do this because of his health damage due to the siege .
It is still with me , there is nothing that I have left behind me .
I am older now and people say that children can easily cope with terrible experience - I have to say that this is not true .
`` In 2006 , I worked with psychologists and felt better after something , but I can not forget it .
And I would like to forget .
In 2005 , a year later , was the first and only time I went back in the gym .
I lost consciousness .
I will never do not return and ask me to show you where I have sat in this famous image .
Survivor : Georgy Fanijew today , with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is extraordinary and I carry it with me every day .
My friends know that I do n't like to think about it or talk about it , and they never asked me after school .
Physically , it is good to me .
I should be careful with my injured knee , but I can now go well .
But because of my health , I could not study at the FSB 's intelligence academy in Saint Petersburg , as I wanted .
I have submitted my papers , including the medical and they have responded that it was not possible .
My second passion were the animals , so I went to the veterinary institute .
I have been there two years behind me .
He learns the treatment of all animals `` from cats to cows . ''
He said : `` I knew that I would tell my children never in my experience .
Children should know nothing and they should not suffer it of course .
His mother Marina , 42 , said : `` The pain never leaves me .
He is in my soul , worse if the anniversary is approaching .
I will go to the celebrations in his memory .
I know that born will not go .
It must be even more intense for him , because he was there and I do not .
I waited for him at home and could not help .
I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me , and all of them are drawn in Beslan .
It remains in us .
Born is now an adult , but this horror is still in him .
It is difficult to accept that , if a little experience so Unfaires .
He is a boy , he loves sport , but he can not attend because of his knee .
He was operated on several occasions , he can run , but no sport .
I would say that he has overcome the horrors to 50 % , but you can never completely overcome and forget .
This terrible experience will always follow us .
Many friends and neighbors were killed in the siege , and that only reinforces my pain .
I have lost a lot of people , which I knew well and who were dear to me .
My son is with me , and this is the greatest gift that God could make me , but my heart cries for the slain .
I know of families in which new children were born , but also of widows who have never married again .
It is difficult to accept that life goes on , even if it does not want .
I will never forget how my heart jumped in me when I saw him in the hospital .
And now , I see what is happening in the world - wars in other regions .
What are these people ?
Why do they kill each other ?
The war is now very close to our country , and I can hardly believe that .
We were once a friendly country , how can it be that we are now fighting ?
People and children suffer , I am sure that many children have been killed in Ukraine , and many more are being killed .
If only we could all use and throw these rebels - as far away as possible .
Aljona Tskajewa , 10

Saved : Aljona Tskajewa is brought to safety by a Russian special operations command ( left ) .

The world was held their breath when the baby Aljona carried in the arms of a Russian policemen from the siege in Beslan in 2004 .

The house prices have seen the strongest winter increase in seven years , shows a widely observed index .
The RP Data Core Logic Hedonic Home Value Index for homes in the Australian capital rose by 1.1 percent in August , according to the RP Data on Monday .
By this rise is the overall increase in June , July and August at 4.2 percent , the largest increase in the winter months since 2007 .
The annual rise in prices stood at 10.9 percent , more than twice as high as the increase in the 12 months to August 2013 , but the increases were not spread evenly across the country .
The RP Data research director Tim Lawless said that Sydney and Melbourne driving a two-pronged market .
The figures from RP Data show that house prices in Sydney rose by 16.1 percent last year , in Melbourne by 11.7 percent against .
The following markets are Adelaide , Brisbane and Darwin , where prices rose by an average of five and six percent .
At the other end of the scale , Canberra , which has been hit hard by the cuts in government spending and where prices rose by only 1.4 percent over the year .
Mr Lawless said further that the beginning of spring now would be an increase in real estate for sale to watch for the next few months , would be `` a real test '' of the market .
`` If you look at the persistently high rate of auction prices , a quick sale rate in general and the persistently low interest rate environment , it is likely that home prices will continue to rise in the next three months , '' he said .

Ebola : The epidemic on West Africa 's economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a serious blow to the economy .
Markets are orphaned , and international companies are at a distance .
The devastating Ebola epidemic deals a heavy blow to the economy of West Africa .
The crops rotting in the fields , the mines are left and the markets are orphaned , the virus has afflicted the region hard .
Some international companies are already at a distance .
`` The Ebola epidemic is not just a medical crisis , but also an economic one , '' says the head of the African Development Bank , Donald Kaberuka .
Liberia is the hardest hit
`` It is a total disaster , we lose a lot of money , '' said Alhaji Bamogo , who sells clothes at the second-largest market in Liberia 's capital Monrovia .
On the market only if you want to buy food or something for disinfection against Ebola .
Liberia is the hardest hit by the virus , here alone fell victim to the fever of more than 600 people .
Recently , health officials said the disease was penetrated in every corner of the country .
The virus has also spread in Guinea , Sierra Leone and Nigeria .
Overall , more than 1,500 people died , thousands of other memories .
Foreign firms are employees from
Across the resource-rich countries , companies set out its operations .
Foreign companies such as the steel group ArcelorMittal drag their employees from several international airlines fly no longer at the affected regions .
The local traders and farmers respond : Only a few merchants still leave their homes to get supplies .
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia , which are under quarantine , rotting in the fields , among other things , the major cocoa and coffee beans for export .
The farmers do n't dare to leave their homes for the harvest .
Food is becoming scarce
`` People will travel less and less , '' says Phillipe De Vreyer , Paris expert for the economy of West Africa .
The man , for example , which normally sold on the market and its vegetables , prefer to remain at home .
The population gets to feel the impact of the epidemic directly and urgent : Food are scarce .
On the markets , the supply of basic foodstuffs such as rice is waning .
The region is heavily dependent on international firms also threatens a reputational damage - with far-reaching consequences .
The greatest danger is that international companies avoid the area for a long time , says Philippe Hugon by French Think Tank Iris .
What matters is how far and how long the virus will spread .
Investors can get the impression that it is dangerous to live in Guinea , Sierra Leone and Liberia and thus to invest , `` warns Hugon .
The disease is also the strained state budgets of states
The disease is also the already strained state budgets of the countries concerned .
The credit rating agency Moody 's fears that their budgets are badly strained by the high spending for the healthcare system and top of the deteriorating economy .
The African Development Bank promised to help the health systems of the countries concerned with 60 million dollars ( 45 million euros ) .
Significantly , the effects are already in Nigeria , where only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed so far .
It is not yet affected the ölreiche region in the southern Niger Delta .
But elsewhere , many people remain at home for fear of infection .
Hotel bookings are clear .

Andrew Lawson was a man of the species , whose character things changed , even in a gigantic organisation such as the NHS .
As an advisory anesthetist devoted his career of the task to save the health of both the agony of the disease and the ordeal of treatment .
Among his patients , his wife recalls , was an MI6 staff who had to live with the devastating effects of torture .
Lawson knew that the doctors and the diagnosis of diseases are important , while the Behandelten are mostly preoccupied with something else : Pain .
One day in 2007 , he was the one , however , the ordeal began .
`` I have not felt myself , '' he wrote in May of this year .
I had difficulties , raise me .
While he struggled with the flu-like symptoms , he said that he had made his wife Juliet impatient accusations .
`` I want everything now rather than later , '' he noted .
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week , Lawson felt a very unusual way and concerned without reason .
Something was in the air .
He asked a colleague to carry out an X-ray examination of his chest .
Only two weeks ago he had been skiing in the French Alps .
The result was the X-ray examination .
He suffered from mesothelioma , an incurable cancer of the breast skin , which attacks the lungs of beneficial skin .
As with most cancers is often difficult to determine the exact cause .
While some smokers to lung disease , for example , are not all lung cancer in smokers .
But mesothelioma is different .
In almost all cases , the trigger is an asbestos contamination - contact with the fiber material , once regarded as the `` miracle material '' but has now been recognized as fatal .
For most of us is a disease mesothelioma , which can easily ignore .
Asbestos is a product of the past .
The most dangerous to use was no longer used in Britain since the 1960s , when the industry voluntarily committed to use them any more .
Even where he was still used , only people worked directly with the fabric - plumbers , builders , carpenters and shipyard workers in certain sectors , for example .
As an industrial risk material from another time , he seems to be of little concern today .
But this complacency is misplaced .
Britain , it seems , seen today is the culmination of a Mesoltheliom epidemic .
There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world .
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year , twice as many people die from the disease than in road accidents .
Annual figures of the Mesotheliomtodesfälle since 1980 and expected future deaths in Britain
The reason why we are seeing the deadly impact now , although asbestos is illegal for years ( 1999 ) were banned all types of asbestos , is that a mesothelioma developed only after decades .
And the scourge of the mesothelioma is not limited to former workers of the construction industry .
Asbestos was , and is , often , still present in the houses , in which we live , the offices in which we work , schools , in which we learn and the shops where we shop .
And therefore knows no class barriers mesothelioma , financial limits , jobs or age .
The privileged bastions , from the elegant department stores in London to private schools , are no protection .
The parliament building , asbestos contaminated .
Also in the hospitals where we should be healthy , have already been identified as source herd of this deadly Karzinogens .
Andrew Lawson was not old .
He was also a plumber .
In fact , it could be difficult to imagine where he may have come into contact with asbestos .
Then he found out it .
`` It looks as if in the tunnels at Guy 's Hospital , where I completed my training for six years , there was a lot of asbestos , '' he wrote .
Everyone - students , nurses , doctors and guard - use the tunnel .
One wonders how many of my contemporaries are suffering from the same disease ?
This question he could answer , at least in part .
`` Of the four doctors who were trained at Guy 's Hospital , and the 2010 in the last five years of mesothelioma disease , '' he wrote in a letter , `` I am the last , is still alive . ''
How many of us are still fall ill ?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma at the age of 48 years ago .
When he died on 17 February of this year , he was 55 .
It was an unusually long survival time .
Fifty percent of all Mesotheliomerkrankten die within eight months after the diagnosis .
The disease is always fatal .
We can therefore only repeat Lawson 's question : `` How many of us are still fall ill ? ''
Britain 's leading expert on mesothelioma , Professor Julian Peto , assumes that between 1870 and 2050 , when the epidemic of asbestos in Britain is expected to come to a standstill , a total of 90,000 will be a victim of the disease .
At the moment , most of them have no idea that they will die .

A quick look at the files of the courts , in which people often turn for damages , shows how far the scourge of Mesothelioms is already widespread .
In June of this year , Marks & Spencer , for example , have to be exposed to asbestos , Janice Allen negligent way .
They worked for the chain for nine years , from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible for the clothing department in two locations - one of the flagship store in Oxford Street .
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years than when they began their work at M & S .
She now has two children in their twenties .
`` In this matter , '' she says , `` I had never heard of mesothelioma , I did not even really about asbestos .
I never thought that I would affect the time .
There are few people who know a lot about asbestos .
The fact is that the concept of asbestos is not a substance , but a group of six minerals .
The name comes from the word `` Asbestiform '' , a description of the fiber structure , which makes the fabric resilient and flexible .
Three of the six have been used in the construction industry .
Chrysotile , also known as white asbestos , today it is by far the most commonly found asbestos in buildings .
It has been used for roof panels , floor plates , pipe insulations , boiler insulation , even for brake pads in cars .
It is less deadly than other forms of asbestos , but it is still seen as a `` major health risk '' with the possibility of death by the EU and the WHO .
More dangerous , however , is the brown asbestos ( Amosit ) and the blue asbestos ( Krokydolith ) .
Britain was once the world 's largest importer of brown asbestos , and experts suspect that `` there are significant , but indirect evidence that this was a major reason for the unique high Mesotheliomraten . ''
An employee of Marks & Spencer was exposed to asbestos in the flagship store in Oxford Street , London , Alamy
Janice Allen has perhaps not seen as a typical Mesotheliomopfer , but the work of Julian Peto suggests that their story is not unusual .
He has presented a study of those affected will be shown that `` a substantial proportion of Mesotheliome without known suspension through work or at home was probably caused by asbestos contact in the environment . ''
In his statement , a large proportion of these contacts is based on the `` normal use and aging '' of our buildings .
It seems that no one could expect to be safe .
A report by Goddard Consulting , which has investigated the Palace of Westminster , shows how people could also be in the heart of the government , have been unwittingly exposed to the substance .
2009 reported Goddard that the service shafts and pipelines behind the committee rooms of Parliament were contaminated with asbestos , whose lethal fibres could be taken by something as harmless as `` strong air movements .
Members of Parliament are often accused to care for their own interests , but here , it looks as to be the opposite .
While the Directorate of the Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the Westminster Palace have received a `` clean '' health certificate , it is now clear that £1 billion amount must be paid over several years to renovate Parliament to modernize the electrical installations and remove the asbestos , and that the Members of Parliament after the general election in 2015 will probably make more in nearby QEII Conference Centre in Westminster than on the green benches .
The Goddard report has also pointed out that `` the presence of asbestos was not handled in accordance with the relevant provisions . ''
No one can know whether this mismanagement will cost lives .
All we can do now is wait .
A person who could never identify the contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott , a general practitioner .
As Andrew Lawson , the 50-year-old Abbott claimed that during his work in hospitals , he was exposed to asbestos .
`` I have worked in a hospital , in which asbestos lawsuits were decided in a positive way , '' he says , `` but I can not prove it in my case .
It is so difficult to recall all places where you worked , and the data .
What he is still clearly remembered the day at the beginning of December 2009 , where he got a fever .
He was 45 , and had an operation in late in the evening .
Suddenly I had chills .
It came suddenly .
I felt terrible .
I thought the ride home to create no more .
As a doctor knew Abbott that the pain from the chest fur , the skin around his lungs herrührten .
But he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma as Janice Allen .
He went to work a month .
Verwunderte doctors , x-rays of his chest and put Pleurakathether to be fluid in the lungs and to test in the laboratory .
But his complaints were without diagnosis .
His health slowly stabilized , and he returned to his job back .
From time to time the symptoms returned back , however , often after physical activity and heavy breathing .
In 2011 , a patient Abbott 's with similar symptoms in his practice and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma .
But even now , Abbott combined this with his own case .
Finally , his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with asbestos .
The connection in the case was clear .
In September 2011 Abbott 's condition deteriorated again and his doctor brought his CT scans and X-ray images to a group of experts .
In December 2011 , exactly two years after Abbott had felt ill for the first time , one with a camera-equipped probe was introduced into the cavity between the Rippen- and the chest fur .
I am an optimist .
I am usually just move on , `` he says .
To be honest , I had not done so many concerns .
But my wife , Rachel , was worried .
The result of the biopsy was in the week between Christmas and New Year : `` It was said to me that it be mesothelioma . ''
Graham Abbott : Mesothelioma diagnosis
Suddenly , Abbott had appointments with Macmillan nurses , one of whom advised him to take a lawyer .
Only now , he realised the scale of the epidemic .
`` It turned out that asbestos was very widespread , especially in large public buildings where pipes were often insulated with asbestos , '' he says .
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings now become ill .
And so is mesothelioma now younger people who have not worked in the typical professions .
The most dangerous pipes with asbestos insulation in hospitals were under the earth , so patients were probably not exposed to the substance .
But many employees who changed in pedestrian tunnels from one building to another ( like Andrew Lawson ) or in underground canteens ate Graham Abbott ( as it often did ) , most likely came in contact with the toxic substances .
It is clear that hospitals for patients over several decades after the war were potentially lifesaving , but life-threatening for the doctors .
He is still today .
Students presented their bunsenburner on asbestos mats .
And it is not just hospitals .
Asbestos was due to its fabulous isolating and flame properties often used in offices , shops , libraries and town halls .
Even schools .
Indeed , many people have probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom .
Across the country , in thousands of chemical hours , students have parked their bunsenburner on asbestos mats .
Websites are now often raised the issue of asbestos in schools .
And meanwhile , items in our homes as innocent as floor plates or shingle roofs by default contain asbestos .
`` It is an industrial poison that is included in large parts of our properties , '' said Andrew Morgan , the lawyer who has represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy 's Hospital .
In one case , the only contact , which invaded a affected woman , was the demolition of a Gartenschuppens in the 1970s .
So beware , as you stop your garden shed .
The effects of the diagnosis , and the knowledge that the disease is incurable , is immense .
`` It takes a while to process it , '' Mr Abbott said .
I went back to work and tried to continue to make , but I realized that what I was doing , I could not focus on that .
I was two weeks ago in practice .
Then I knew that I had to go and look after myself .
Well , I will have no further Christmas .
The biggest difficulty was the fresh approach from the position of a doctor to a patient .
As countless patients before he reminds himself , as he overwhelmed by all the information was that he had to come around .
`` It was very difficult to absorb all of this , '' he says .
`` I asked my doctor '' as long as I yet ? ``
And it gave me about 12 months .
I remember that I thought , 'Well , I will have no further Christmas .
That 's it then. `` ''
Mesothelioma is particularly insidious because it is our life support mechanism - the breathing itself - that caused the deadly cancer .
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact .
Asbestos is composed of tiny fibres .
If the asbestos is being raised and the fibers are inhaled , they can establish themselves in the chest fur , the skin around the lungs , .
Asbestos fibres irritate the breast skin and can trigger cell mutations .
`` The problem is with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibers , '' said Professor Tom treasure , a cardio-thoracic surgeon , moved to the Guy 's Hospital in 2001 .
The hospital , which Andrew Lawson suspects that it has exposed to asbestos , is now ironically , a leading centre for the treatment of mesothelioma .
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were probably also exposed to the asbestos during their training at the hospital .
As soon as the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue , says treasure , `` they are pushed to the edge of the breathing process where the skin is .
It is inherently invasive from the outset .
The usual options work for other cancers in mesothelioma not so good .
For example , the effectiveness of an operation is hotly debated .
Some say that it was worth a try .
Treasure denies this .
`` The breast skin can not be cut out , '' he says .
You can not beat about the bush with a knife .
Meanwhile , the cancer `` on chemotherapy is not very good , '' the `` effect , '' but not healed .
`` Sometimes there are long-term survivors , '' says treasure .
But in the end they all die .
Fortunately , some patients are living in a long time , much longer than expected .
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis .
Mr Abbott still fighting two and a half years after his diagnosis .
After he had contacted mesothelioma , Abbott came in contact with Andrew Lawson , four years after his diagnosis had become a one-man-of support and consultancy for Mitbetroffene .
`` Hello , cancer centre , '' he is happy on calls .
`` He was very positive , '' Abbott says .
He had received his diagnosis four years earlier and was still very active .
Abbott had originally been offered six cycles of chemotherapy , which would take four months and expected to prolong his life just about a month .
`` I was desperate , '' he says .
I wanted to give up .
However , Lawson managed `` to let things in a more positive light . ''
Following the advice of several doctors Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski , cardio-thoracic specialist at Guy 's .
`` We had an advantage because I no longer had to be referred , I just cried and got an appointment , '' Graham .
A normal patient would need to receive a payment and have to wait for the approval of the treatment .
Money is crucial for mesothelioma sufferers , to be able to play the best available therapies .
But if these treatments , inevitably fail , many patients are from a different financial concern about the future of the families they left behind .
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation .
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher water House LLP .
`` It is known that asbestos is extremely dangerous for the health since 1898 , '' Morgan says .
But what has changed in the 1960s , we realized that even a small burden posed a health risk .
And here the negligence of companies started to play a role .
Andrew Lawson and Guy 's Hospital , in their case , but it was not what Morgan calls a `` full compensation '' that Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to an asbestos contact at Guy 's .
According to a spokesman confirmed the investigation into his death of Guy 's , however , that `` the asbestos fibres were removed in the 1990s in the basement area affected . ''
It was too late for Andrew Lawson .
How asbestos can be removed
In fact , it is a huge problem for mesothelioma sufferers who care about compensation , to trace the deadly asbestos contact a company or a job - usually decades after the incidents .
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed .
Insurance documents can be lost .
And those who defend itself against claims to know that it is time for them , but certainly not with the prosecutor .
There were significant new legislation that makes it easier for mesothelioma patients in this year in response to demand compensation , even if their former employers will no longer be traceable .
The law has established a fund of £350 million for all funded by the insurance industry , which were diagnosed after July 2012 , can prove a contact , but can not sue anyone .
In these cases , the plaintiffs will receive 80 percent of what a court in a normal compensation process could have granted them - about £120,000 .
About 300 successful applications for the program are expected per year .
Andrew Morgan , like so many mesothelioma patients , thinks that £350 million were a `` very good job '' of the insurance industry .
`` This is a deal of insurers for insurers , '' he says , and suggests that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have to pay if the time had not gone away and mesothelioma sufferers find the company and they could sue normally .
Mike Penning , then work and pensions minister , admitted that the law is `` not perfect . ''
But both Penning and Morgan gave that prompt action was necessary in the face of seven deaths a day .
`` People are so much suffering and need help now , '' said Penning during the second hearing of the mesothelioma law in December of last year .
At the time , Mr Abbott was in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months .
After their first debate , Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation that he expected a positive effect in contrast to Tom treasure .
This has been accompanied by a radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy , Lang-Lazdunski can present a survival rate of up to 40 percent over five years .
Abbott felt strengthened .
`` This is , of course , with the most important thing , '' Abbott says .
This can be seen in patients again and again .
There is something you can continue .
If you place you are worse very quickly .
Graham Abbott underwent the surgery in March 2012 .
At the end of August , he was behind the last of six cycles of chemotherapy .
Follow-up scans showed no signs of the disease .
Then I had a scan in March 2014 .
There have been several cancer spots in my chest .
I was just 50 .
This is not life-threatening .
This is lebensbeendend .
Again , Abbott underwent six cycles of chemotherapy .
No trace of the tumours is now more visible .
But the process is physically and mentally very tiring .
They need to think about practical things - about the money when I am no longer , for example , or my wife , show how the boiler time setting works .
If you get bad news , you will be negative .
You have to look forward .
As the father of Ellie , 14 , 16 , and Tamsin , this is not always easy .
`` It is difficult for parents , '' he says .
It is hard to know what to say and how much .
When I received my first diagnosis , I said to my girls that I have a disease that I would not be old .
They reacted in different ways .
Tamsin is very sociable and unpredictable .
They told their friends and we got so many calls soon .
Ellie was restrained .
She said not much .
Such talks are something that all cancer patients have to go through .
But for Mesotheliomerkrankte such talks are not crossed by hope , not a trace of hope for survival .
The disease is ( such as a grim security ultimately for Stephen Jay Gould ) .
As Andrew Morgan says , `` mesothelioma is not life-threatening .

Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatments lead to higher death rates from ovarian cancer in rural areas .
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have online a video tribute to her mother , who died of ovarian cancer in 2007 .
For women in rural areas of Australia , there is a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than women in cities .
Researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1100 Australians , where ovarian cancer was found in 2005 , and found that only 25 percent were still alive five years after diagnosis .
The research director Susan Jordan from QIMR mountain Hofer Medical Research Institute said that for those who lived in rural and remote regions of the state , the mortality risk during the study was about 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas .
A small study : New drugs could slow lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers studied the health care of women over seven years .
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in the diagnosis , the type of ovarian cancer , existing previous illnesses , as well as the social and economic status also influenced the chances of survival .
For older women and those whose cancer was already at a more advanced stage at diagnosis time , the survival rate was the lowest .
For those living in rural and remote regions of the state , the mortality risk during the study was about 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas .
Although the study was not investigated why women living outside the city with a higher likelihood died of ovarian cancer , Dr. Jordan claimed a late diagnosis and the lack of access to the best treatment centres as possible factors .
`` This disease is best dealt with by gynaecological oncologists , and these are usually found in major cities , '' she said .
Despite the improvement of telemedicine services in order to counter the distances they had flown as a possible remedy for a strengthening of the service to provide doctors , in order to give the opportunity to specialists , women closer to their place of residence , and treatment programs for people outside their region .
Dr. Jordan said that the study showed a poor long-term survival rate for women with ovarian cancer regardless of geographical status and emphasized the need for better treatment and prevention strategies .
The study funded by Rio tinto Ride to conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia .
In March 2013 Beaufort Neave , a young mother of 33 years of the Gold Coast learned that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer .

Shortly before 5.30 p.m. prasselte it down to the visitors , especially families sought the vastness and dry .
But the attractiveness of the feast , it did no harm .
`` There were more people than expected , '' said Ron SEM , spoke of a `` success on the line . ''
This is not a repeat of the major party in the coming year .
Although still needs to be worked on the content and the size of the event , Shem made clear in a first assessment on Sunday against the voice of the people .
He described as annoying that had to be stopped at the entrance .
Obviously , the security company had been booked with too little power .
The result : Some people who had already paid , were no longer on the site .
The response has been very good .
In a first cautious estimate said the Salzwedeler co-organizer of about 1,200 visitors , which is in the castle garden once thronged .
There have been problems with the sound .
The Salzwedeler hip-hop band blocks ' n 'Rox broke their appearance so unnerved .
The technicians were not in a position to create a fairly reasonable sound .
The planned shisha lounges could not be built because the tents because of a puncture could not be brought to salt fronds .
`` Next year it will be there , '' says the organiser .
The premiere of Amula-Open-Air was more of the visitor numbers as successful .
And in bad weather .
However , the organisers have some mistakes , which will be forgiven for the first time , but must be eliminated in the second edition .
The organizers also have criticism in the social network Facebook .
`` Sorry , but for 12 euros , you simply expected more , '' says Melanie Meier on the event page .
`` Unfortunately , ye assumed a bit , '' says Ele Zimmermann at the same place .
Others see the initial problems not quite so closely .
I think it is very good that some chat not only stupid , but also really try to put something on their feet .
Jon ! , `` writes Stephanie Jenß Amula .
Now the organisers remains a year to put a stop to these criticisms .

Clever ways to save on university textbooks
As the cost of college textbooks for many students are more than $ 1,000 per year , is considered a clever austerity idea of fast-second-semester student Matt Schroeder .
He invented a temporary system for books by students of higher semester and offered a nominal compensation to delay the sale .
`` My math book normally costs $ 180 , but I got it for $ 10 for a semester and a chick-fil-A-biscuit , '' said Schroeder , 19 , who visited the Covenant College in Georgia .
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $ 430 , he said .
He gave $ 120 .
The College Board said that students spend an average of more than $ 1,200 a year for textbooks and study materials that there were options for the students but different costs .
Online shops and creative approaches such as the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of choice for the students .
Renting textbooks is popular , and so students can use a book for a semester , often at a much lower price than at the time of purchase .
Neebo Inc , which operates more than 250 university bookstores , said that the hiring of text books have doubled since 2011 .
In the industry surveys show that about a quarter of the books was hired last spring semester in college bookstores , Neebos Vice President Tevor Meyer said .
Less than half of all textbooks are purchased , according to the trade group National Association of College Stores in campus bookstores .
Here is the ABC for the best deals .
Buying online
Some new books online cost only a third of the price for which they are to have the campus bookstore .
The ninth edition of `` Calculus '' VNO Ron Larwon , Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $ 290 , but can be purchased at the specialized Chegg.com textbook retailer for 239,99 $ .
Buy used
If one of the notes or normal usage tracks represent nothing , used books are a good option .
`` Calculus '' is needed in Chegg.com for 93,49 $ .
Matt Casaday , 25 , a student at Brigham Young University , says that he has spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a second edition of `` Strategic Media decisions : Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business . ''
The book was recently sold for $ 48 .
Academics like Ingrid Bracey , head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls advised students and their professors ask whether earlier editions are acceptable .
Sometimes the updates are not relevant to the seminar work .
In such cases , elderly spending can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest edition .
Chegg and Amazon is also a popular alternative for used books helped EverestPoker.com of eBay Inc .
Rents
Renting textbooks is worthy of consideration , if you treat them fairly well , remember , back to you and you do not want to keep the books at the end of the course .
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a new book purchases .
For example , a student might rent `` Calculus '' for the duration of a semester for about $ 20 .
Learn more about the terms of the transaction in which you rent , including on the criminal charges , the case for the writing of notes , underscores or use traces .
Tenants beware : If you do n't return the book , the criminal charges may even exceed the price of a new book .
E-books
E-books instead of traditional textbooks are also an option .
Sometimes these books are de facto rented by an electronic license will be provided by large retailers such as Amazon.com , Chegg , Barnes & Noble Inc. for a certain period of time .
Chegg can rent `` Calculus '' for six months for about $ 61 .
Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best deals , as many classics today can be downloaded for free , while scientific and engineering science textbooks can be very expensive .
Look themselves in any case .
Joe Gault , 29 , who will soon visit the PEPPER dine Law School , recommends the ISBN number for the provision of prices for books , because you can be sure to find the right textbook .
And in an online order remains to be seen , so Gault , whether the book is actually stock .
This lesson he learned the hard way .
He had bought a book that four weeks delivery time and eventually paid the full price in the college bookstore .

It is a great thing .
`` I know now that I can do this - fine ! ''

Not only the gladiators were knöcheltief in the mud at the first Rheinbacher Römertag in the amusement park .
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract more than 1000 visitors yesterday , who defied the rain showers and the autumn cold and were completely overwhelmed by the historical spectacle .
There was a colourful parade of performances , performances , games , exhibits and information about the Romans and their importance for the Rhineland .
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the warlike Kämpfertruppe of the once `` Amor Mortis , '' which used every Regenpause to demonstrate their robust Kampfeskunst in the soft arena .
Gladiatorenbesitzer `` Leonidas '' proved to be a humorous and expert II and sent his men in the ring to the heroic duel in various Gladiatorengattungen .

It was followed by the `` Essedarii '' with breastplate , the and Wurflanze as well as iron Gladiatorenhelm , leg and Armguard .
Particularly impressive was the appearance of the `` Retiarius , '' which took place with Wurfnetz , tridents and dagger against the `` Secutor . ''
As temples metallic the swords , the shields hand-bells and the Wurflanzen flew surrend through the arena , that a fear and anxiety could become the health of the gladiators .
But on the one hand the impressive `` All , '' the muscular umpire , an always attentive eye .
`` We wanted to revive the Roman everyday life and to experience the culture of Roman times , '' explained Lorenz Euskirchen , chairman of the organizer `` Freundeskreis Römerkanal , '' the intention behind the spectacle .
After two years of preparation , the theme park for a day became a `` Oppidum , '' a Roman city , such as Plevný Claus Wehage in his speech .
After all , the Romans brought not only war and conquest in our region , but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today .
Remains of it were also visible at the Römertag , about `` Aquädukt-Marmor '' from the eleven meter high and 1400 meters long Römerkanal-Brücke , which stood at Lüftelberg .
The Frontinus-Gesellschaft established the water and energy supply once and now , and the manager Petra Fricke knew : `` We are still profiting from the knowledge of the time . ''
This is also confirmed by Diplom-Vermessungsingenieur Ralph saints from the `` IngenieurteamZwei '' from Rheinbach , the Vermessungsinstrumente of the Romans , such as Chorobat , Groma or Dioptra .
The sketches in Lochlainn presented sketches and models from the excavations in 1894 as well as bricks from the Original-Hypokauste , the Warmluftheizung , which once warmed up the Römervilla .
Also impressive are the footprints , which were left behind by Wolf and Fuchs two millennia ago , before they burned down .
In 2011 , the office of Bodendenkmalpflege at the National Office of National was excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the industrial park Nord in Rheinbach .
You have found boundary of a first with a pact for drying cereals and the .
The building probably belonged to a villa Rustica , an agricultural commodity , explained the archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser .
A series of findings from these excavations presented them in a glass , including a large plate , several fine glass as well as parts of a delicate necklace .
The villa has probably existed from the first to the fourth century after Christ , until the Germanic of the Germanic tribes in the then Roman Rhineland .
At the same time the children were also involved with the Roman Windmühlenspiel , similar to today `` s Mühlespiel , or they wrote , like the Roman students , their names with Metallgriffeln on wax .
At the booth of the Römerthermen Zülpich , the children mosaics themselves were able to tinker at the stand of the Glasmuseums Rheinbach the and at the stand of the centre Eifel Nettersheim a heavy Weizenmühle made of stone to grind the flour for a flat bread or a cereal .
At the end of the 19th century , the `` Römer-Projektwochen '' ( `` Römer-Projektwochen '' ) , the `` Römer-Projektwochen '' ( `` Römer-Projektwochen '' ) and the `` Römer-Projektwochen '' ( `` Römer-Projektwochen '' ) were the `` Römer-Projektwochen '' ( two ) .

Ebola - The epidemic is affecting West Africa `` s economy
The in West Africa is also a heavy blow to the economy .
Markets are orphaned - and international companies are distancing themselves .
The devastation of West Africa is a serious blow to the economy of West Africa .
The harvest rotting on the fields , the mines are abandoned and the markets are orphaned - the virus has severely added the region .
Some international companies are already distancing themselves .
`` The Ebola is not only a medical crisis , but also an economic , '' judge by the head of the African Development Bank , Donald fragile-state .
Liberia is the hardest hit
`` It is a total disaster , we lose a lot of money , '' says Alhaji Bamogo , who sells on the second largest market in Liberia `` s capital city .
On the market only , who wants to buy food or something for disinfection against Ebola .
Liberia has been hit hardest by the virus , on its own , the fever fell victim to more than 600 people .
Recently , health officials said that the disease had penetrated into every corner of the country .
The virus has also spread in Guinea , Sierra Leone and Nigeria .
In total , more than 1500 people died , thousands of others stuck .
Foreign companies are recruiting employees
Companies in the resource-rich countries are running their business .
Foreign companies like Arcelor `` s Arcelor Mittal are withdrawing their employees , and several international airlines are no longer flying to the affected regions .
The local merchants and farmers are also reacting : only few merchants left their homes to obtain supplies .
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia , which are under quarantine , they are rotting , among other things , for the export of important cocoa and coffee beans in the fields .
Farmers do not dare to leave their homes for the harvest .
Food is going to be scarce .
`` People will always travel less , '' says Phillipe De Vreyer , Paris expert for the West African economy .
The man , for example , who normally goes on the market and sells his vegetables , prefers to stay at home .
The population will therefore feel the consequences of the epidemic directly and acute : food becomes scarce .
In the markets , stocks of staple foods such as rice are dwindling .
At the same time , the region , which is heavily dependent on international companies , threatens to damage the environment - with far-reaching consequences .
The biggest danger is that international companies shun the area for a long time , says Philippe Bibliografia of the French Think Tank Iris .
What is important is how far and how long the virus will spread .
In the case of investors , the impression is that it is dangerous to live in Guinea , Sierra Leone and Liberia , and thus also to invest , `` warns Bibliografia .
The disease also interferes with the state budgets of the Member States .
The disease also interferes with the already strained national budgets of the countries concerned .
The credit rating agency Moody 's fears that their budgets are heavily burdened by high spending on the health system , and in addition to the deteriorating economy .
The African Development Bank has already promised to help the health systems of the affected countries with $ 60 million ( EUR 45 million ) .
Keeping are the effects already in Nigeria , where only a few Ebola-Fälle have been diagnosed so far .
It is true that the oil-rich region in the southern Niger Delta has so far not been affected .
But , elsewhere , many people remain in fear of contagion at home .
Reservations can also be made in hotels .

Why `` BlizzPlanet of the Galaxy '' not a blockbuster
`` The Expendables 3 '' from Sylvester Stallone played less than $ 30 million of his 90 million dollars in the U.S. , while `` Sin City : A Woman to Kill For '' only $ 12 million of his budget of $ 70 million .
The film `` Sex Tape , '' which was adapted to Cameron Diaz , played only $ 14.6 million , while films , like `` Drachenzähmen easy , '' also failed to disappoint the income .
An article by the Telegraph-Filmkritikers Robbie Collinetta indicates that the lack of quality in the films could be the reason for the lack of quality .
Collinetta called 2014 as `` the worst year '' so far for films and described `` Drachenzähmen easily made 2 '' as pure `` functional '' Fantasy-Fortsetzung .
In the case of films for a slightly older target group , however , it seems as though the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem .
In July , Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore- and Metacritic-Bewertung for each Sommerfilmstart , which was shown between the American Memorial Day and the 20th of July 2013 and in the current year at least 2000 canvases .
The results are based on the opinion of the audience and film , and indicate that this year `` s hit are equivalent to those of last year .
Some commentators believe that development is due to changing visual habits and the growing popularity of Web-Streaming-Diensten like Netflix .
Director Jon Favreau , who is currently working on Disney to , said to the website Hollywood reporters : `` I think the times are changing . ''
We must accept this and not try to after the past .
In contrast to the currently weak Kassenergebnissen of the Hollywoodproduktionen , sales has recently generated revenues of $ 1.2 billion , almost twice as much as last year , in which sales amounted to $ 837 million .
In the last summer , the director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios that they focused too much on comics of comics and prophesied a `` meltdown '' of Hollywood .
In the light of the current downturn , some commentators argue that his sinister prophecy could well contain a real core .
Due to the potential blockbuster in the summer of 2015 , including involves : Age of Ultron , Minions and Jurassic World , other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic :
The producer of has , Simon Kinberg , described the decline of the recently as simply `` cyclically '' and said to Hollywood reporters : `` The next summer will be the biggest summer at the box-office , and no one will worry about the business . ''

The Höllenjahrzehnt of the survivors of Beslan : ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school , as the children of today are still suffering .
Ten years ago , more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militias at a school in Beslan in Beslan .
More than 330 people , more than half of them children , were killed in the three-day ordeal that shocked the world .
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the classroom in the classroom .
Exactly a decade after the horrific siege of the Beslan school , in which 334 people perished , including 186 children , the heroic survivors warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine .
As fanatical Islamist terrorists children and parents on 1 September 2004 , the start of a new year , captured and killed , this seemed like the skull of evil .
The tragedy united West and East in revulsion , and then turned surprisingly into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery .
Ten years later , we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the classroom in the classroom .
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance , even though the memory of this terrorist hell is going to haunt them forever .
Your greatest hope ?
That the war that is now ravaging Ukraine - and in the children as they die - is now coming to an end .
The girl who was photographed in the attempt at the NGO sports bruised

Aida , after her mother , has been was , now 40 years old .
Both were deemed dead , but they survived .
`` A woman told me that I was going to run my life , but I could not , '' said Aida then .
My legs were told .
I stood up and climbed again to search for my mother .
A soldier brought them in safety .
After a series of operations she felt completely healed , but said yesterday : `` Three months ago the pain returned .
I am afraid I have to work again .
Some shrapnel are still in my knees .
Their aim is to become dentist in order to help the people , as they have been helped by doctors .
`` This tragedy changed my life , but it did not break me , '' she says tear .
`` That is what happened to me , and that can not be changed .
Once a year I always go into the sports hall to remind me of those who stayed there .
My friends and I try not to talk about this in other days .
The pain is too great .
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there .
We played together as we were small , and dreamed of going to school together .
`` I do not want to marry until I finish my studies and start my career .
I am thinking of a family later .
She says that the siege will always remain a part of it , although the memory of each year will be somewhat weak .
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our horror and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in Britain and everywhere .
When I look online at the photo of me , as I see in school zurückklettere , I think that many people will see it for the first time , understand our disaster and contribute to something that is not happening again .
The boy , who fled through the bullets , in the opinion that his mother was dead .
It was his first day of school ( Russians go to school for 7 years ) and survived the three-day siege in the poor of his mother Tamara .
As Native he said : `` Mom told me , I should lie down when there was an explosion and keep their hand . ''
After an explosion he thought it would die .
She said to him : 'Run . '
Full of fear , she could be dead , he fled and saw on the way a little infant , took it at hand and fled through a bullets .
His father , Vladimir , who joined his son outside , said : `` Damir told me that his mother died .
He said : 'I could not save them ' .
In fact , Tamara was tripped up outside and with Beinverletzungen in the hospital , in turn , in the assumption that their son died .
After her reunion she said : `` I wept for joy .
I could not believe .
He ran and hugged me .
Damir was later flown to London ( from the now dissolved newspaper News of the World ) , to receive from the then Premier Tony Blair and his wife Cherie the title of a Barnardo 's Children 's Champion .
`` This horror takes you every day , but I wish I could stop remembering , '' he said yesterday .
But I can say that it is pale in my memory .
I still know that I am using all my once .
But now I can play games with Schussszenen and this is not a problem for me .
`` I am not afraid to go back to the sports hall , but I do not think about myself .
I remember these children , with whom I have played in the court , and who have not done it out .
We never say that they have been killed or dead .
We say that they have remained in the sports hall .
I remember my trip to London , especially to the toy , where I was able to choose everything I wanted , and the ride in an open car .
But now he is afraid of place like Ukraine , where wars cause the kind of misfortune that he and his friends have suffered .
This horror takes you every day , but I wish I could stop reminding me of it .
`` I am sorry to all those who suffer from the barbarities , '' said Damir , who worked last week as a volunteer in a monastery .
I would like to help .
I want to go one day to the police and hope that they will take me next year at the Schulungsakademie .
His mother Tamara , 48 , said : `` 37 children from our neighborhood have been killed , can you imagine ?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege , there was simply no children who could call and walk , and this stillness lasted for many months .
She remembers her trip to London with Damir .
The people of London wept when I told our story .
I understood then how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and their support .
She was grateful Blair and her Foundation for the price and the opportunity to travel to London in the fall of 2004 .
I wish I could call Cherie and you just say that 10 years have passed , but I still remember the meeting of her and her husband in London , and how the Damir and me helped me .
I still remember how Damir wanted to eat borscht and she wanted to once all local Russian restaurants .
I remember , as he played with waiters in a restaurant , Damir shot on her and she ran away and played with him .
And that was only one month after the horror .
I was surprised that the British were so willing to share our pain and supported us .
She said : 'I always think that this world has not become better in these 10 years .
War is now continuing in Ukraine , and people die every day , and I believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed .
These are exactly children like ours .
I think that for many of the war is part of the news that they hear when they are bored or preoccupied with something else .
I simply know what these people feel , all the horror .
And I can not stop feeling this .
Nothing has changed , people still want to kill each other and that is so sad .
Damir was great and is a very gentle and quiet boy , he is not aggressive or furious at all .
For example , he does not seek revenge , he is not overwhelmed by the past abominations .
I know he does not like to remind him , but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go into the sports hall and ignite candles there .
When he was smaller , he suffered from it - I remember , as he sometimes put on the sofa , the face of us turned away , for hours .
Not sleeping , his eyes were open .
I still remember , as he did all his weapons and other Militärspielzeuge , Damir is now 17 , bigger than me , handsome , intelligent and healthy .
I can hardly believe that I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again .
When I woke up after the explosion and came to the legs , I looked around , and saw the hell around me , with all the parts of the body .
I was absolutely certain that my little boy in this hell could have survived .
`` I remember that I was Sudanese-born , '' Damir , Budapest , Budapest , '' but I was so sure that he had not heard me .
But he has heard it and he is away .
And so the life , unlike that of many others , goes on for us .

Comfort : The Beslan-Überlebende Sverdlovsk Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege 2004 , on the right a picture of Sverdlovsk
His blutüberströmtes face was frightened when he ran his life , while Chechen terrorists beat his classmates .
His picture was one of the most emblematic symbols of the barbarity of Beslan .
His mother Fatima , 54 , a health care professional , had sacked him for his first day of school before she rushed to bring her older son , Vladimir to the University .
`` I left the court about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him , and so my little boy stayed there for three horrible days alone , '' he remembers .
Not quite alone , there was a whole family of relatives of us , but they were all killed .
Only my Sverdlovsk managed to survive .
The closer this date is , the more difficult it is to think about it and talk about it .
There is no single day in which we do not remember this tragedy .
We do not think it is long ago , I think it would happen yesterday , some scenes from these days keep me busy .
Nobody will ever forget that , I promise you .
intruder : The image of Sverdlovsk ( left ) was one of the most of the attack and was immortalized as a statue ( right ) .
I remember that Sverdlovsk wanted to go to school this day , he said he wanted to hug his teacher .
I just knew that he was alive when I saw him on television .
And now there is even this statue of the weeping Sverdlovsk in San Marino .
Sverdlovsk does not like the picture , and it is hidden at home in the bookshelf .
I understand this , but I also mean that , thanks to this image , people throughout the world feel our pain .
Sverdlovsk says today : `` It is important that this can never happen again .
`` I doubt that we have ever experienced the truth .
People are constantly investigating such tragedies and never know the truth .
And now they are investigating the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine .
Will we ever know what caused him ?
This world will become a little bolder .
`` I can not understand how this is possible , because if you ask the people , no one wants a war , so what happens ?
Ten years have nothing to do with such pain .
We need dozens of years to forget it a little bit .
It attacked my health and I still feel it .
About three or four years I had a few nightmares because of the siege , but then it was better .
I went back to school later in 2004 and had a fear of every day .
I thought to my friends and classmates who had been killed .
That is why I always go into the sports hall when 1 September is approaching .
I want to pay tribute to my old Kindheitsfreunden .
It is difficult for me to go into the sports hall , but I have to do it .
I do not feel as a victim , this story is now a part of my past .
I will not forget it , but I am not ashamed .
My life goes on .
I finished school this year and visit a medical college in Vladikavkaz .
I will be surgeon .
My first choice was an education in the army .
I wanted to become a soldier , but my health was not .
I wanted to fight for my country , but that will not happen .
Sverdlovsk Fanijew , 20
The boy who survived , even though he was captured at the feet of a murderous terrorist .
A miracle : Sverdlovsk Fanijew was captured during the siege at the feet of a murderous terrorist , but he managed to survive .
During the siege , he was caught in the sports hall and was sitting next to the bomb , which was fastened on the foot of a murderous terrorist .
It really is a miracle that he has not been killed .
`` We feel as if it were yesterday , '' says Sverdlovsk , who wanted to go to the FSB , but who could not do so because of his health damage due to the siege .
It is still with me , it is not what I left behind me .
I am now older and people say that children can easily cope with bad experiences - I have to say that this is not true .
`` In 2006 I worked with psychologists and I felt a little better after that , but I can `` t forget it .
And I would like to forget .
In 2005 - in the year afterward - was the first and only time that I went back to the sports hall .
I lost consciousness .
I will never return again and do not ask me to show you where I sat in this famous picture .
survivor : Sverdlovsk Fanijew today , with a photograph of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop .
My pain is incredible and I wear it every day with me .
My friends know that I do not like to think about it or talk about it and they never asked me about the school .
I think it is a good thing .
I should be careful with my wounded knee , but I can now run well .
But because of my health I was not able to study at the Geheimdienstakademie of the FSB in Saint Petersburg , as I wanted .
I have my documents , also the medical submission and they have replied that it is not possible .
My second passion was the animals , so I went to the veterinary institute .
I have been here for two years .
He learns the treatment of all animals `` from cats to cows . ''
He said : `` I knew that I would never tell my children about my experiences .
Children should not be aware of this and , of course , they should not suffer .
His mother Marina , 42 , said : `` This pain never leaves me .
It is in my soul , worse , when the anniversary is approaching .
I will go to the celebrations .
I know that Sverdlovsk will not go .
It must be much more violent for him , because he was there and I do not .
I waited at home and could not help .
I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me , and here in Beslan all of them have been drawn .
It remains in us .
Sverdlovsk is now an adult , but this horror is still in him .
It is difficult to accept that if something is to .
He is a boy , he likes sport , but he can not take part because of his knee .
He has been operating on several occasions , he can run , but no sport .
I would say that he has overcome the horror of 50 % , but you can never completely overcome it and forget it .
This terrible experience will always follow us .
Many friends and neighbors have been killed in the siege , and this only reinforces my pain .
I have lost many people who I knew well and who were expensive .
My son is with me , and this is the greatest gift that God could make me , but my heart cries around the slain .
I know of families in which new children were born , but also of widows who never married again .
It is hard to accept that life will continue , even if you do not want it .
I will never forget how my heart jumped in me when I saw him in the hospital .
And now I see what is happening in the world - wars in other regions .
What are these people fighting for ?
Why do they kill each other ?
The war is now very close to our country , and I can hardly believe that .
We used to be a friendly country , how can it be that we are now fighting ?
People and children are suffering , I am sure that many children have been killed in Ukraine and many have been killed .
If we can only use all of these rebels and throw them out - as far as possible .
Aljona Tskajewa , 10
The baby , which has so far been carried in safety by a security specialist .
fascination : Aljona Tskajewa is brought into safety by a Russian Spezialeinsatzkommando ( left ) .
It is now ten ( right ) and does not remember the cruelties at all .
The world held its breath in 2004 when the baby Aljona was worn in the poor of a Russian policeman from the siege of Beslan .
The terrorists left them , but in their savagery they kept their 30-year mother , the 10 Sister Kristina and their brother Makhar in the sports .
Makhar , then three years old , escaped , but Aljonas mother and sister died in the murderous carnage .
Her father , Ruslan , has been married since then , and with his new wife Svetlana a little girl named him after his lost daughter Kristina .
Aljona , today ten years old , does not remember the siege and has grown to an intelligent and happy girl , say neighbours .
`` You are now a great happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children , '' says a close friend .
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to save them all the memories of the tenth anniversary .
You will understand why .

Berkeley explains the housing market again for `` normal . ''
One of London `` s most prominent architects pointed out that the housing market in the south-east of England has returned to normal levels .
Homes in the capital were hot demand and the subject of huge price increases , which led the Bank of England , owing to widespread fear of a credit bubble , to set limits on mortgage credit in June .
Tony Pidgley , founder and CEO of the high-class company Berkeley said on Monday : `` Since the start of the current Finanzjahrs the market has returned to normal Transaktionsniveaus since the peak of 2013 '' and added that this is a `` stable Handlungsumgebung . ''
The real-estate market in London was well established during the downturn , as foreign buyers pushed into the capital .
According to information from the Katasteramts , the prices in the city area alone increased by 18.5 % last year , far more than the average increase in England and Wales as a whole .
The average selling prices at Berkeleys private , cheap and student offers increased by about one-fifth in the past year and at the end of April around the 423.000 £ .
Over the past few months , however , a stronger pound has made less attractive in London for foreign buyers - some of them have been deterred by the introduction of new Immobiliensteuern and political rhetoric about a possible `` Villensteuer '' before the general elections next May .
The London real estate agent Foxtons warned last week that , in the second half of the year , the Hypothekenmarktbericht , in the second half of the year , would lead to a reduction in market growth , both at the property and at the prices .
New data from the Bank of England from Monday show a decrease in July `` s July , which also indicates that the housing market is cooling .
Hamptions International , another real estate agency , corrected its forecast for the rise in house prices in London for 2015 , down to 3 % , on the basis of an already weakness Hauspreisbewußtseins .
The transaction in the most expensive areas of London , such as Chelsea , Mayfair and Kensington , is now a quarter of a quarter , so the broker WA Ellis .
Nevertheless , the desire for a home in the capital for Berkeley is a blessing , as the amounts due to due amount to more than $ 2.2 billion .
Mr. Pidgley added : `` The demand for the right , well planned product at the best sites remained stable and as a result the Terminverkäufe remained stable . ''
In June , the company reported that it had sold 3.742 new homes in the year until the end of April - almost a third more than at the peak of 2007 before the crisis .
Annual earnings growth increased by 40 % to 280 million per year , sales by 18 % to 1.6 billion .
In a communication on Monday before the company 's Annual General Meeting , Mr Pidgley said that the revenue for Berkeley in the current year is likely to correspond to the current market expectations .
The analysts estimate the annual budget increase to EUR 450 million .
Berkeley-Aktien were stuck at £23,96 in London in the afternoon .

The socialists in France should keep their mouths and put France in order , `` said the most important ally of Francois Hollande .
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left to show 'their love ' for the controversial socialist president , who has stumbled upon disapproval with the vast majority of the French .
The President deserves everyone 's respect , he deserves our loyalty , he deserves our support .
`` It is our duty to stay on his side , '' he said with great applause .
As a comforting gesture , the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not call into question the controversial 35-hour week in France , despite fierce demands for a relaxation of the regime by Emmanuel Macrons , the new Minister for Economic Affairs .
On Saturday , Mr Hollande called for his Mitsozialisten to be `` united '' with the government .
But Christiane Taubira , the Minister of Justice , starting Sand , in which she appeared in a meeting of renegade Socialist Members and criticized the Socialist Party for taking the French 'faith in their future ' .
Marine Le Pen , the far right leader of the National Front , derided the warring factions of the socialists and said that they could not imagine that the new Valls government will endure longer than a few months .
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes , but Prince Manuel Valls has no , they are forced to form a new government if the old one did not survive a summer .
`` And the new will not survive either autumn or winter , '' said Miss Le Pen to supporters .
She repeated the call of her party after a dissolution of Parliament and said that she was confident that he could emerge victorious in early elections and be prepared to the government .
The ruling party of France suffered a defeat in the local elections in March and the right-wing National Front was the forward in May .
A poll in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Sunday showed that 76 % of the French are of the opinion that the Socialist Party is in danger of crumbling into several rival factions before the end of Hollande `` s term of office .
Pascal Link , a political scientist at the Sciences Po University , warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government did not improve the economy and the Rekordarbeitslosenzahlen .
`` There is a small window for possibilities , but public opinion needs to feel fast that things change , '' he warned .
Otherwise the situation could deteriorate further .

After election in Saxony : CDU-Vize Strobl is NPD-Verbotsverfahren
In view of the vez of the NPD in Saxony , CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl has spoken out in favour of an end to the current NPD-Verbotsverfahrens in front of the Federal Constitutional Court .
Berlin - According to CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl , the current proceedings against the German Federal Constitutional Court should come to an end .
`` The NPD is worse off than last time , '' said Strobl , who is also CDU-Landeschef in Baden-Wuerttemberg , the `` Leipziger Volkszeitung . ''
This is a welcome development in the right direction and a development that makes me more likely to be the result of a political battle against the NPD and not before the Constitutional Court .
At the time of the vote on Sunday , the NPD had failed spectacularly .
A first attempt to ban the far-right party was a failure in 2003 , because , at that time , the Görus was also in the hands of informers .
In December 2013 , the Federal Council filed a new application in Karlsruhe after a long preparation .
Federal government and the Bundestag did not join .

Merkel speaks Power Word : toll is going to be `` quite clear ''
Now the Chancellor is clearly committed to this .
It is not , however , a licence for all the complicated details .
Christian Democrats in the Christian Democratic Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats are increasingly sceptical about the Christian Democratic Party ( Christian Democrats ) and the CDU .
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken , after continuing opposition from her CDU , a power station for the introduction of a toll .
`` To make it quite clear : you stand in the coalition agreement , and they will come , '' said the Parteichefin on Monday after meetings of the CDU-Spitzengremien in Berlin .
But , for the time being , Merkel did not lay down on a detailed model .
In the black-and government program , `` certain parameters '' are called .

The NRW-CDU , however , is insisting on its ' no 'to a toll on all roads .
Merkel , as well as Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble ( CDU ) , has been constructively engaged in the deliberations of a bill .
In addition to the topic , he also talked about other possibilities to enable more private capital for investment in infrastructure , including the broadband .
`` At the end of the day , the '' Spiegel `` report was left behind , and his house is looking for a new concept to remunerate Autobahn-Investoren with tolls - after the election in 2017 .
CSU-Chef Horst Seehofer then warned against the lead minister in the Cabinet against the lead minister .
CDU-Bundesvize Armin Laschet confirmed his objections .
`` The coalition agreement never went out of all circles and highways to charge , '' said the North CDU-Landesvorsitzende .

Opposition to the plans also comes from the CDU-Landesverbänden Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate .
There are fears that a toll will affect local border traffic to neighbouring countries .
Seehofer had asked for the Mautkritik of the CDU Koalitionstreue .
The left sees the plans as a failure in the face of the dispute in the Union .
`` The Murks-Maut is dead , '' said leader Bernd Riexinger of the `` Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung '' ( Monday ) .
`` With the toll failed the minister , '' Dobrindt wants to introduce a toll on all German roads to start 2016 .
However , 8kn car owners may not be subject to additional charges according to the agreement .
Therefore , they should receive a full compensation for the toll via the motor vehicle tax .
The model must not , however , discriminate against foreign drivers under EU law because of their nationality .

The or brought the communities communities in the south of Israel a sense of joy and expectation , but the signs of fighting are still fresh .

`` We have a little fear , but are excited , '' said Ronit Bart , lives in Kibbutz Saad and the English teacher .
Many children from our area urgently need to return to a routine .

`` These were difficult times , and we did not go out of the house at all , '' she said .
President Reuven Jordanians visited the Kibbutz near the border with Gaza to offer his support .
Until a cease-fire broke the war last week , thousands of residents of the authorities , like Saad in their homes , left their homes to move away from Gaza in safer areas and escape the missile and Mörserfeuer .
Many residents of Spring Oz , a community near the border with Gaza , where a His boy was killed by a Palestinian Mörsergranate , still hesitate to return .

Their children were temporarily accommodated in other schools .

He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said `` we will ensure that their knowledge is purchased and offer you security . ''
Israel and Hamas agreed on a unbefristeteten cease-fire last Tuesday .

A new round of indirect talks is expected to start in Egypt this month .
In the war , more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed , three-quarters of them civilians , and at least 494 children according to estimates by the Palestinians and the UN .
Israel denies these claims and estimates that at least half of those killed are fighters , but there has been no concrete evidence of this information .

The report states that renters spend an average of 55 % of the amount that people spend on their garden .
The increase in people who live in high areas without gardens , the popular procedure , gardens to asphaltieren and the falling Gartengröße are other factors that threaten the industry , estimated at £5 billion a year in sales .

Smart ways to save at Uni-Lehrbüchern
As the cost of Uni-Lehrbücher for many students is more than $ 1,000 a year , the Fast-Zweitsemesterstudent Matt Schroeder pondered a clever Sparidee .
He invented a Leihsystem for books of students of higher semesters and offered a nominal compensation to delay the went .
`` My Mathematikbuch normally costs $ 180 , but I got it for $ 10 for a semester and a Chick-fil-A-Keks , '' said Schroeder , 19 , who attended the Covenant College in Georgia .
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $ 430 , he said .
He gave $ 120 .
The Collegeleitung informed the students on average more than 1,200 $ per year for textbooks and study , but for the students there were different Kostendämpfungsoptionen .
Online-Läden and creative approaches such as the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of choice for students .
The renting of textbooks is becoming more popular , so students can use a book for a semester long , often at a much cheaper price than buying .
Neebo Inc , which operates more than 250 Universitätsbuchläden , announced that the hiring of textbooks has doubled since 2011 .
Polls in the industry show that around a quarter of the books were rented in the College-Buchläden in the past semester , said Neebos Vice President Tevor Meyer .
Less than half of all textbooks are purchased by the Amalgamation National Association of College Stores in Campus-Buchläden .
Here is the multiplication for the best deals .
Buying online
Some new books cost online only one third of the price for which they are in the Campus-Buchladen .
The ninth edition of `` Calculus '' Debian Ron Larwon , Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $ 290 , but can be taken with the specialist Lehrbucheinzelhändler Chegg.com for $ 239,99 .
Used to buy
If one of the notes of other or normal usage tracks , then used books are a good option .
`` Calculus '' is needed on Chegg.com for $ 93,49 .
Matt Casaday , 25 , Abschlussstudent at Brigham Young University , says he spent on Amazon.com 42 cents for a used edition of `` Strategic Media Knova : Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business . ''
The book was sold for $ 48 .
Professionals such as Ingrid Bracey , Head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls recommended students to ask their professors whether earlier editions are admissible .
Sometimes the updates for the many are not relevant .
In such cases , older editions can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest issue .
In addition to Chegg and Amazon , Half.com of eBay Inc is a popular alternative for used books .
rent
The renting of textbooks is worth considering if you treat them reasonably well , remember to return them and do not want to keep the books after completion of the course .
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book .
For example , a student could rent `` Calculus '' for the duration of a semester for about $ 20 .
Inform yourself about the provisions of the business in which you rent , including the fines , which may apply for writing notes , underlined or usage tracks .
attention : If you do not return the book , the fines can even exceed the price of a new book .
e-books
Even e-books instead of conventional textbooks are an option .
Sometimes these books are rented de facto by providing an electronic license for a certain period of wholesalers such as Amazon.com , Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc .
At Chegg you can rent `` Calculus '' for 6 months for about $ 61 .
Bracey says that students in Literaturkursen often find the best offers , because many classics can be downloaded free of charge today , while scientific and engineer-scientific textbooks can be very expensive .
Look at each case .
Joe Gault , 29 , who will soon be attending the Pepperdine Law School , recommends the ISBN ISBN for books , because you can be sure to find the right textbook .
And before an online order you should check whether the book is actually in stock .
He learned this lesson on the hard tour .
He bought a book that had four weeks of delivery and finally paid the full price in the College-Buchladen .

Will the Burgvereine again be pulling in the same direction ?
Last but not least , there was a dispute between the two warring factions .
Now the board members are thinking about possible cooperation .
As a model for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser castle , the late Richard Dimbath , former chairman of the Wolfratshauser Burgfreunde , took the project in the French Guédelon .
A year ago , there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the Burgfreunden .
At the same time , the points of view of the history of the Wolfratshauser castle and possible reconstruction have to be dealt with in a very different way .
Now the two camps are moving : there should be discussions on a common approach in the near future .
This is confirmed by the Vereinsvorstände Torsten Stockaryd ( Burgverein ) and Herbert Piffl ( Burgfreunde ) on demand of our newspaper .
`` I phoned Mr Piffl and suggested that we could sit together , '' says Stockaryd .
In his view , all the members of the two clubs could pull together again in the future .
As a result , progress has been made more quickly .
While the Burgfreunde , the late Richard Dimbath , until the last time a reconstruction of the castle on the mountain massif , has been in the forefront for the Burgverein , the `` development und Erlebbarmachung '' of the terrain is at the forefront .
Herbert Piffl , second chairman of the Burgfreunde , has been very pleased about the call .
He has been in charge of the Burgfreunden since Dimbaths death .
A new chairman is to be found in a general meeting in the middle of September .
At the moment , the club has a population of about 40 members .
`` After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath , we have left the Portland out of respect at first , '' This `` was necessary to think about how to proceed .
According to Piffl , the new chairman should then go into the conversation with the Burgverein .
Until then , the Burgfreunde could also make a current the within their group .
There is still no candidate for the Presidency , says Piffl .
`` But I am confident that someone will find himself , '' he does not want to stand , because he has his domicile in Bad Tölz .
The new chairman should be a Wolfratshauser .
The Toelzer wanted to participate in the project `` but very much to work . ''
The various points of view on reconstruction will probably remain in the near future .
He praises Dimbath as `` missionary '' who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle .
Two similar , advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not a pipe dream .
Through a high participation of the population , as well as by volunteers from all over the world , they are a tourist .
Piffl : `` I was also sceptical at the beginning .
But in the course of time I am more and more convinced that it makes sense to advance the project .
There is nothing else there .
In addition , the project could be financed by EU , pass and potential sponsors .
`` The idea of reconstruction does not , therefore , want me to simply throw it overboard , '' he hopes that the Burgverein will perhaps be slightly moved on this point .
Their goal , first to document history , is `` is important and good . ''
After that , it could be there .

After weeks tug-of-war , Italy `` s Premier and President-in-Office , Matteo Renzi , defeated strong conservative resistance at the the last week , the nomination of his Secretary of State Federica Mogherini as the head of EU foreign policy , you will be the successor of the British , Catherine Ashton .
Renzi , as evidenced by the government-connected daily newspaper La Repubblica , the appeal of his Mogherini as a favorite of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU .
He is also expecting a boost for his `` reform package '' in Italy .
Last but not least , Renzi hopes to calm down the left grassroots , because Mogherini is assigned to it - albeit in a moderate way .
In contrast to the conservative representatives of the President of the Commission , Mr Jean-Claude Juncker and the President of the Council nominated Poland , Donald Tusk , the predominant opinion in Rome , in order to create a political balance .
After all , the EU `` s travel will become a member of the President of the Commission , Mr Juncker , at the same time .
The European Parliament is still awaiting the approval of the European Parliament .
Otherwise , President Giorgio Napolitano would not have known the nomination of the history Democratic Party ( PD ) as a `` important recognition '' of the role of Italy in the EU .
La Repubblica is showing optimism that , for nearly two decades , it has been able to show the `` enormous challenges '' of the `` enormous challenges '' that have been known for almost two decades .
The native like is married and has two daughters .
Her the started her doctorate in 1996 in the youth organisation of the then Democratici di Democratici ( left-wing ) , which in 2008 took place with the Catholic Party ( Catholic ) to today `` s Social Democratic PD zusammenschloß .
In 1999 , Mogherini was nominated for three years by the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth ( European asked ) .
With the election in 2001 in the Parteirat of the left-wing , she rose to the high party politics , worked in the Foreign Affairs Department , whose head it soon became .
They occupied traditional priorities of Italian foreign policy , such as the Middle East , was known by studies on the NATO in Afghanistan , in which Italy is involved with a contingent of troops , the contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and the Democrats in the US .
Since 2008 she has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies , in which she is an expert in defence and European and international affairs .
When Renzi became prime minister in February 2014 , he summoned Mogherini to his Secretary of State .
If the PD today has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country , which contributed to more than 40 % of the party `` s vote in May , as in PD-Kreisen , Federica Mogherini has a share of it .
The reproaches in Brussels , the new chief have too little diplomatic experience , so it lacks substance , will be in the PD mean .
In Brussels , in particular Poland and the Baltic Member States , distrustful of the crisis in Ukraine are being persecuted and defamed as a 'rußlandfreundlicher course ' .
It is in favour of the South Stream pipeline , launched by the Russian company Gazprom , to transport Russian gas , bypassing Ukraine , directly to southern Europe , which also serves Italy `` s energy .
When Renzi began his term of office in July , Mogherini went to Moscow for its first state visit to Moscow .
Photos that they showed with Putin at the Shake-hands were greeted with outrage in Brussels , just as they invited the Kremlin for October to a Milanese economic summit .

4 Tips for Better pictures and Videos
If you want to make photos or videos under water , there is a choice of devices .
The cheapest option is a waterproof waterproof , like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or a Action-Cam like the A Hero3 + Silver Edition , which are both for about $ 300 .
I recorded these photos at a family celebration with several cameras , all of which are available at a price of $ 350 .
Independently of the equipment , there are some rules for the best results .
Control your equipment twice .
Even if you have a waterproof camera , make sure that the battery pack and other compartments are closed .
Upload your camera to the photos or videos you want to capture .
Some cameras and camcorders have scene and home , with which the exposure time for the otherwise Unterwasserbedingungen is optimized .
And before you jump into it , check the depth of your equipment .
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet , others up to 50 or 60 feet .
Find in our guide and the ratings for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models .
Make NC - because many will not work .
Point-and-Shoot-Kameras have an LCD with which you can compose images , do not normally not .
Even if you have an LCD , it is difficult to see it under water , and the right Adjustment is a luck .
So you make a lot of pictures .
If your camera has a Reihenmodus with which a series of shots will be made with slightly altered exposure , you can use it .
Remain close to the surface .
The light becomes dramatically worse , the more you remove from the surface .
If possible , you will remain close to the surface if you take pictures in a pool , a lake or the sea .
This allows you to add more color to your photos ; the deeper you go , the less color you will see .
Go close to the objects .
This is also a good advice to the country , but it is all the more important because of the poor light conditions .
It is very important for you to work with a Action-Cam : these devices often have a fixed Panasonic , which means that you need to get closer to your objects if you want to complete the whole picture area .

town : German beer for Guangzhou
Hops and malt - also a popular combination in China .
German beer has an excellent reputation in China .
Frankfurt `` s twin sister in China now wants a brewery , and is also hoping for a Flug-Direktverbindung between the two cities .
German beer , brewed in Frankfurt 's twin city Guangzhou - this is the urgent wish of the officials in China .
`` We would be very pleased if a German brewery would settle in our city , '' said the Vize-Parteisekretär of the South China metropolis , Li Yiwei , this week when visiting a the in his city .
Time and again , the official official of China `` s ruling Communist Party came back in the course of the call to address this concern .
Guangzhou , which is also called the canton in Germany , is one of China `` s richest cities , , Li .
That is why people also have the purchasing power to be able to afford German beer .
The Hessen Platzeck Thorsten Paparazzi , who led the German Politikerdelegation , said to the host that he will become a partner in Germany after a possible partner for the project .
`` For beer it does not need much : good water , grain and joie de vivre , '' he added at the lunch with the Parteioberen in Guangzhou .
This joie de vivre is already in the hands of Mr. Li , he flatter the host .
As a result , the official official from Guangzhou with Paparazzi , but with a red wine that was served to eat .
The Chinese brand Tsingtao goes back to Germany .
Tsingtao-Bier is brewed according to German purity law .
More commercial transactions
A second wish of the Chinese host would be a Flug-Direktverbindung between Frankfurt and Guangzhou , said Vize-Parteichef Li .
Lufthansa had offered the flight earlier , but it was cancelled in 2012 for economic reasons .
'It would be worthwhile ' , the local councillors were convinced .
`` The business dealings between our two cities continues to grow . ''
At the moment , travellers would have to take the detour via Changsha in the province of Hunan , sued Li .
The administration of the province of Guangdong , whose capital is Guangzhou , is also hoping for flights .
The Vice-governor of the province , Chen Yunxian , put this wish in his conversation with the Social Democrats in the foreground .
`` This is a very good idea , '' replied Paparazzi - the Chinese vice-minister Li Jinjun , an intimate connoisseur of Germany , nodded approvingly .
Neat partnership
The portico-ed Vize-Parteichef of Guangzhou hopes that he will be able to visit Frankfurt in the next year .
Li Yiwei was already on the Main , but not yet in this role .
He came into office only this year after his predecessor had been promoted as a result of corruption charges .
The local leader , Wan Wan , also had to go .
The action against the officials from Guangzhou is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in the party and administration , which is being rigorously enforced by Head of State Xi Jinping .
The new leader , Li Yiwei , had worked in front of his the for an American company , which is highly unusual in the Chinese Communist Party .
Before joining Guangzhou , he worked as a propaganda in Fujian , where the VW Beetle built a large factory .
Frankfurt has officially entered into more than a dozen town-twinning activities .
The connection to the Guangzhou remote is one of those that are maintained by both sides , for example , with a student exchange .
Last year , the 25-year anniversary of the Sino-German connection was celebrated .
The China metropolis on the Dynasty is almost as strong as the whole of Hessen with its economic clout .
Next year they want to reach a gross domestic product of EUR 250 billion , reported Li .

A particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 Festdamen with their , .
Festkapelle is the band Berngau .
The patronage has taken over the Mayor Wolfgang Wild and Secretary of State Albert Füracker .
The original name `` Schützengesellschaft fir Berngau '' dates back to 1907 , when the club was founded on 21 March by the association for `` social entertainment through exercise in the Zimmerstutzen- and Kleinkaliberschießen . ''
In 1937 , the Nazi Party had led to the dissolution of the association .
Only in 1964 , there were 19 young men who , on 30 April at the inn Lukas , raised the `` new '' nearby `` Berngau '' Berngau .
Karl March and Adolf Ried led the association as a Schützenmeister through a difficult period of time , in which it was primarily a question of finding a spring and installing the Schießbetrieb .
Already in autumn 1965 the nearby started in the inn `` Leininger '' with two teams in the Rundenwettkämpfen .
In the following years , the sport shooters , which have now been organized in seven teams , were in all classes up to the 1st Gauliga .
The Vereinsrekorde prequel each year and the magic limit of 380 rings was achieved for the first time in 1980 by Rudi Meier .
As the performance of active shooters has increased , the number of members has also developed positively .
After the spring `` Leininger '' no longer satisfies the requirements of a modern marksman , the then Vorstandschaft under the leadership of Johann Rinn decided to create a future domicile in the cellar rooms of the new `` Landgasthof Härteis . ''
After a work of 2700 hours on May 8 , 1988 , the priest Strasser for the new Schützenräume was awarded the church blessing .
One of the great highlights in the history was certainly the 44th 44 , connected with the solemn consecration of the new Schützenfahne in July 1991 .
On 23 and 24 April 1994 , the nearby celebrated its 30th anniversary .
A Böllergruppe was established in 1995 .
Josef Schmalzl was Böllerreferent .

In many hours of volunteer work , the club members have modernised the rooms and the Schießanlage in the Berngauer Hof in the past year , thus bringing them up to date with the latest technology .
Eleven teams in Rundenwettkämpfen

Judges are temporarily stopping to force all Abtreibungskliniken in Louisiana to close down .
A the stopped on Sunday provisionally the implementation of a law in Louisiana , of which lawyers say that it would probably have led to the closure of all five Abtreibungskliniken of the state .
This measure , which was raised by Bobby Jindal , Governor of Louisiana , in June to the law and to enter into force on 1 January , would force doctors who perform abortions to acquire a Patientenaufnahmerecht at a hospital within a radius of 30 miles for their practice .
However , the judge 's decision means that doctors can continue to carry out legal abortions for the time being , while they are requesting such a right .
`` The plaintiffs can continue to work in accordance with the law , while they strive to obtain these rights , '' wrote federal John deGravelles in his judgment .
Within a month , a hearing will be set for judges to bring about a more lasting decision for the law .
Abtreibungsbefürworter welcomed the decision , the most recent in a series of judgments against similar measures , and said that doctors have so more time to obtain Krankenhauseinweisungsrechte .
`` Today 's decision means that the women in Louisiana escape a treacherous law that wants to deprive them of their health and their rights , '' said Nancy Northup , President and Chair of the Center for reproductive rights lodged in the name of three of the five clinics of the state to stop the law .
It was not immediately clear whether the judgment was also extended to doctors from the two clinics , who had not joined the lawsuit and had also applied for Einweisungsrechte .
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have enacted similar laws , with courts recently declaring such measures in Alabama and Mississippi for not .
key of a law in Texas , which would have forced most of the clinics remaining in the state to close down , were stopped by a federal on Friday .
Abtreibungsbefürworter and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists , as well as the American Medical Association , are saying that doctors are demanding unnecessary restrictions .
abortion believe that measures are designed to protect women 's health , although some also welcomed the effects of the closure of clinics .
Only a doctor who carries out abortions in Louisiana has Patienteineinweiserechte , divided the center for reproductive rights .
If all other doctors in the state are forced to stop abortions , this doctor would no longer be able to carry out the operation , as the group said .
In their arguments against the ruling , representatives of the state of Louisiana said that they would not penalize doctors for the execution of abortions , whereas their applications would still be pending .

Production in the Eurozone on a 13-Monats-Tief
The increase in production in the euro area slowed down in August at the lowest point in the last 13 months , so a closely observed study .
The final economics Einkaufsmanagerindex of the manufacturing industry ( PMI ) fell to 50,7 in August , after a stand of first in July .
An indication of 50 gives an expansion .
New orders went back and factories were experiencing break-ins at a time of rising tension between the EU and Russia over Ukraine .
The figures take place before the European Central Bank ( ECB ) meeting on Thursday .
Markets are expecting a clear plan from the Bank for dealing with a reluctant recovery of the eurozone , as well as the threat of deflation in an inflation rate of only 0.3 % .
There is speculation that the head of the ECB , Mario Draghi , could do more in the course of this week to consider a quantitative easing for the eurozone , according to those carried out by Britain and the US during the financial crisis .
`` Although a small growth is better than no growth , the restraining effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties have become clearer for manufacturers , '' said Rob Dobson , senior economist at economics .
The Fabrik-PMI for Germany , the largest trading partner of Russia in the EU , fell to the lowest level in 11 months with 51.4 .
In the meantime , it fell in the second largest economy of the bloc , France , the PMI on 46,9 .
France remains a problem child , as well as the descent of Italy from a solid expansion to stagnation .
Note that stimulus in the Schlüsselindustriemechanismus Germany , as well as in Spain and the Netherlands no longer resort , are also not reassuring , `` said Mr. Dobson .
The decline in industry is likely to fuel the fire of the analysts , who expect further monetary or fiscal stimulus .
A positive news came from the Republic of Ireland , where the PMI has risen to 57.3 , the highest level since the end of 1999 .
Howard Archer , Chefwirtschaftsexperte at IHS Global Insight , said : `` The best thing that can be said for the Einkaufsmanagerindex of the manufacturing industry in the euro area of August is that the sector continues to grow . ''
He added : `` Producers in the euro area are obviously difficult to find life at the moment , because the current heightened geopolitical tensions - particularly in relation to Russia and Ukraine - increase uncertainties in the continuing difficult conditions in many countries .
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular , and consumer confidence , and it is likely that some orders will be delayed or even cancelled , particularly large contracts .
He said that it is ' increasingly likely 'that the ECB should eventually embark on a kind of QE , `` though we suspect that this will be limited . ''

Lenny Henry : My father never took me into the arm .
Has never said `` I love you . ''
Henry was one of seven children of a family of a immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958 .
His father , who died as Henry 19 , worked in a factory and its relationship was limited .
Henry worked for a comedy , Rudy 's Rare Records , which was partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and was born from the series on Radio 4 .
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap , with lively melodies .
But Henry had to work through some difficult Kindheitsmomente .
He attended `` many '' therapies after the death of his mother , and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father .
It was difficult to know him .
One never seen his face , heard only his voice : `` Listen to the noise .
Leave your sister in peace .
Join us !
I want to see cricket .
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who had already grown up when I was a child - went to the pub and talked about things like the shape of the re-fills or the beauty of a Cricketschlags .
I never had such a conversation with him .
Much of my life was this serious guy in the corner who read the newspaper .
Recently , Henry opened a foundry in Dudley , and although the conditions were better than at the time of his father , he won an insight into how life had been for him .
It is now slightly brighter , but they are dark , smoky , deep Stygian labyrinth with Flammenstößen and smoke and lots of soot .
My father used to be simply in the tub and then he was able to hear him slowly , as he began to sing , because he was able to wash the foundry .
When I woke up there , it became clear to me that he had done so for years to put food on the table , and my respect for him was greater .
Nevertheless , Henry , as a child , grew up without his parents `` the .
My father never hugged me , he never said `` I love you . ''
Only when my mother died at the end of her life , we began , `` I love you , I love you , I love you . ''
With his own daughter , Billie , with Dawn French , he could share the love he had missed as a child .
Have you ever stopped with the `` I love you '' ?
Listen to me to hug me !
Dad , I am 22 !
with Dawn French .
Why should we not be friends ?
She is a great mother .
It is still with French friends , with whom he was married for 25 years .
Dawn is a good person .
Why should we not be friends ?
She is a great mother .
Henry `` s own mother was diabetic .
That contributed to her death .
So when I was very , very overweight and symptoms of diabetes showed , my doctor said `` You must be radical .
So I pulled this Fitnessding and had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms .
It is very difficult .
And it is exhausting .
No-one likes to eat carrots .
Henry professional may be seen in his elegant , kurzgeschnittenen .
Since he was praised by critics for his Othello , he is captured by the theatre .
It followed the comedy of the errors , and then fences of August Wilson .
This is a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that have filled out his busy working life .
He started with only 16 years when he worked in a factory .
A DJ discovered him on stage when he imitation and wrote to New Faces about him .
His career began in the middle of the seventies , `` I was for a fairly long time the only black singers / comedian on television . ''
He learned in the profession .
I had to learn not only in front of the eyes of the public , but also from 1975 to 1985 , how I could become an efficient Witze-Erzähl-Maschine , while I was a star on television , and that was really difficult .
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
As his manager had the Bühnenrecht at the Black and White minstrel Show , a light entertainment program in which the people `` black anmalten , '' Henry made his comedy there over five years .
My family was very uncomfortable .
I just wish that it would never happen , but I do not regret that I have done it .
It was a strange , awkward position for me , but I worked on the and learned how to deal with a large audience .
But this `` years light pillar of British television '' was also a `` grotesque parody of black people . ''
As a result of the introduction of figures depicting British black culture , Henry worked on an alternative Comedykreis in the Eighties .
The first series of the Lenny Henry Show took place in 1984 , and in the 1990s he was known as the head chef Gareth Blacklock in the series boss .
Advertising , documentaries , TV series and film roles have influenced his next decade , but after his left LennyHenry.tv 2008 he thought : `` What are you doing next , Len , because it all feels like you just have the time to sit around or play a bit on the spot . ''
Then came a Documentary for Radio 4 with the title What 's So Great About ... ?
The first episode revolved around Shakespeare .
I was allergic to Shakespeare .
I had never learned anything about him in school and kept him mostly for a domain of the middle class , white in pantyhose and a cabbage front .
So I had great fear of it .
All who we interviewed for the show , Peter Hall , Trevor Nunn , Adrian Lester , Judi Dench said `` You should try it .
Do n't be bad if you do n't know what you 're talking about .
Take a few words in the mouth , and then you will understand why we love all Shakespeare .
Henry introduced 20 lines from Othellos last speech for the documentary and he was thrilled .
I had the feeling that I was able to do that .
It was almost as if someone had finally put my head on the head .
`` Therefore it is , it is a serious thing , take it seriously , learning your text , works a bit .
The samples were brutal , and I read this piece for months before we made it .
And it was a success .
They seemed to expect a car crash , and this simply did not happen .
And soon he appeared in the comedy of the errors .
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I couldn `` t believe it .
There was a moment when I thought , `` Oh , you have changed you . ''
There was a technical error and Henry felt instinctively that he had to talk to the audience .
`` A little voice told me '' you have to bridge 10 minutes while you fix the computer . ''
Instead , the Bühnenleiter announced that the idea was order as soon as the problem was resolved .
I went from the stage and something in me said `` Oh , thank God . ''
I am not responsible .
I can leave it to someone else .
`` You play in a play , so keep in your role . ''
Henry in fences at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for fences was demanding .
Panic is very good , that strengthens the tendons .
That was also a good thing , so it is like a great sign of the gods that tell me `` this is your destiny . ''
He says this , of course , with a DONNERNDEN voice .
So I stand by it .
I really love it .
I love to be in a sample .
However , Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is permeated by humorous outbursts while he continues to imitate people .
I decided not to make first because I think that this kind of instant satisfaction from a room full of stranger is somehow dangerous .
If you are looking for what you are looking for , you are driving a wall .
I sometimes run live in the Apollo , if I want to do so , but as a whole I do not have as much as before .
I would like to ask him whether he will ever again make a Stand-up-Comedytour .
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps to form a beginning , a middle part and the end of a journey - I do not think I want to give up again .
So is this new incarnation ?
I think .
I would like an actor .
It is fun .
One always tells a story , and that is great .
I love stories .
People love stories .

Delayed diagnoses and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher levels of treatment in rural areas in rural areas .
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have set up a Videohommage for her mother , who died in 2007 at ovarian .
For women in the rural areas of Australia , there is a higher risk of dying of starvation than for women in cities .
Researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1100 Aussie , identified in 2005 ovarian , and found that only 25 % were still alive five years after diagnosis .

Krk STUDY : New drugs could slow down lung and ovarian
Researchers examined the medical care of women over seven years .
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in the diagnosis , the type of ovarian , existing previous and the social and economic status also influenced the chances of survival .
For older women and those whose cancer has already been further advanced , the survival rate was the lowest .
For those who lived in rural and remote regions of the state , the median income was 20 % higher during the study than for those in urban areas .
Although the study did not examine why , outside the city of living women with higher probability of death , Dr. Jordan is suspected of a late diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centres as possible factors .
`` This disease is best dealt with by gynaecological oncologists , and these are mostly found in larger cities , '' she said .
Despite the improvement of the telemedicine services to counter the distances , they proposed a strengthening of the service of flown doctors in order to give specialists the opportunity to provide women more densely in their place of residence , as well as treatment programmes for people outside their region .
Dr. Jordan said that the study , regardless of geographical status , showed a poor Langzeitüberlebensrate of women in the ovarian , and underscored the need for better treatment and treatment .
The study will be published in the Medical Journal of Australia today in the Medical Journal of Australia .
In March 2013 , 1919 Neave , a young mother of 33 years from the Gold Coast , had an aggressive form of ovarian .

AMAZON confirmed what was reported on Monday morning : The online - and the , and a lot of other things - buys the Videostreamingdienst minutes for $ 1.04 billion ( $ 970 million ) .
The announcement comes as a surprise , not because nobody expected a takeover of minutes , but because it was widely believed that YouTube would buy the company .
Three months ago , it looked as though the sale of minutes to the Google blog of Google for a cool billion was decided , and cooperation also seemed natural .
minutes , which was founded only three years ago as broadcasting , was launched as a general Streamingdienst - a version of YouTube .
Instead , it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to publish their favorite games in games , a `` Youtube for live games , '' so an insider .
The Twitch-Schnittstelle .
And `` let 's play , '' a Videogenre , in which knowing-better ( mostly older ) games give a painting of Geheimwissenschaftstheater , are already very popular on YouTube .
It 's just so that YouTube is often called when you want to describe minutes , so the news that YouTube minutes wanted to buy a little bored , a textbook of an established Technikunternehmens that buys a potential competitor .
It is a mystery why the deal with YouTube did not materialise , as the company reportedly was willing to pay as much as Amazon .
All we know at the moment is this statement by Fusion-Band belonging , president of minutes : `` We have chosen Amazon because they believe in our community , they share our values and long-term vision and they want to help us get faster . ''
Another secret , to be honest , is the incredible success of minutes .
For snobs like me who say that they prefer to ride sports than watching it , it is hard to understand the attraction that comes from watching other games instead of taking the Kontrollkonsole into the hand .
It is one thing to watch a friend at 3 o'clock in the morning , while she sneaks through Resident Evil , and something quite different to watch a Spinner as he shot 20 times in Call of Duty .
You could see all these games right now .
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are Ego-Spiele , so it can be a good recipe for headaches without your own control over the Blickperspektive .
I admit that the sweeps , in which the Roger Bannisters of our Elektronikzeitalters play all the games in record time , are entertaining .
But as long as it is not a game or video game , its Twitch-Kanal is probably not so interesting .
But what are sceptics like me already ?
minutes is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth-largest source of Internetverkehrsspitzen .
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money ?
It is hard to imagine that minutes will be integrated so elegantly in Amazon Instant Video , such as YouTube minutes could easily swallow .
But minutes has something that every company would have liked : thousands of young men who are being courted as advertisers .
As the chairman of minutes , belonging , said , Amazon and minutes `` both believe in the future of gaming , '' and the medium shows no signs of shrinkage , not yet - schluck - as sport .

Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobsons 's novel novel about Love and the letter `` J . ''
They were zerflossen , so it was best to describe them , they were slowly moving on like a carton that was left in the rain .
Occasionally he said a woman that he was too serious , tiring , intensive , distanced himself , and perhaps a little bit from .
And he shook his hand .
He knew he was .
He was the , as in hedgehog , yes .
The last casualty of this Stacheligkeit was a recent affair , which was more promising to ease the solitary boredom of his life than usual , and perhaps even a certain satisfaction .
Ailinn where was a Mount-Trembling delicate beauty with untamed hair and a fluttering heart from a village on the North Island , which was even more remote and rougher than Port Reuben .
She was accompanied by an older accompaniment to the south , who held Kevern for her aunt , and who inherited a land in a humid but paradisiacal valley with the proper name Paradise Valley .
No one had lived in the house for several years .
The pipes were leak , in the baths were still spiders , nudibranchs had left their traces on all windows and believed that they belonged to them all , and the garden was overgrown with weeds that looked like giant Elin .
It was like the house of a children , both menacing and seductive , a garden full of secrets .
Portrait of the author : Howard Jacobson , the novel `` J '' on the posthumously for the It Award 2014 .
The shortlist will be announced next week .
Kevern had been sitting in high grass and had an unusually warm Frühlingsnachmittag with Ailinn published in the broken in , who provided the land with soothing music and soothing messages , as the sight of their crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song of a long forgotten black entertainer that his father liked to listen to closed shutters in the house .
Your feet are too big .
Due to their innate aggressiveness , songs of this kind were no longer played on the console .
Not banned - nothing was properly banned - simply not played .
It has been successfully obsolesziert , as the word obsoleszieren .
The general taste , which decrees and rules never managed , and how people in books choose the Vom-Tellerwäscher-zum-Millionär-Memoiren , cookery and romantic , they chose the ballads in music .
In the euphoria of the day Kevern began to play a imaginary piano and in a grob-komischen serenade Ailinns great feet to sing .
Ailinn did not understand this .
`` This was a well-known song of a pianists called Roll Waller , '' he explained it and automatically put two fingers on his lips .
That had always done his father to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth .
It had begun as a game between him and his father when he was still small .
His father had been playing with his own father , he told him .
If you start a word with a J , without putting two fingers on your lips , it will cost you a penny .
It was not a very funny game at the time , and it was not very funny now .
He knew that it was expected of him , that was all .
It had to explain what Jazz was .
Ailinn had never heard of it .
Jazz was not played , even if it was not banned directly .
The improvisation was no longer modern .
It was only space for a single `` if '' in life .
The people wanted to be very safe at the beginning of a melody where they would end .
It is the same mind .
His unpredictability made people nervous .
And jazz was musically fact mind .
Although he was ten years old without having heard of Sammy Davis Junior , Kevern knew something about jazz from the half collection of old CDs of his father .
But at least he didn `` t have to explain that Roll Waller was black .
In her age , she probably could not remember a time when singers was not black .
Again , no laws or constraints .
A conforming society meant that any element of this society would be grateful to the principle of Gruppenbegabung - grateful to the fate of spared .
People with afro-karibischer origins were suitable for entertainment and sports , so they sang and ran them .
People who originally came from the Indian subcontinent were blessed by nature with electronic talent and were treated with the task of ensuring that no family remained without functioning 7629 .
What was left of the Polish community was concerned about the sewer system ; what was left of the Greeks , crushed plates .
Those from the Gulf States and the Levant , whose grandparents did not leave the country quickly as WHAT HAPPENING WAR , IF ES HAPPENING WAR WAR from fear of being accused of Feuerschürens , fearing that the flames would devour them as next - had Labneh- and Shisha-Pfeifen-Restaurants , thought and became depressed .
Each one of his abilities .
As she had heard only ballads , it was difficult to understand how the abusive words that Kevern had just had been able to be played .
Music was an expression of love .
`` They are not really insulting , '' said Kevern .
Except for people whose feet are too big .
My father never insulted someone , but he loved this song .
He talked too much , but the neglected garden gave him the illusion of security .
Nothing could overcome the soundproofing of the huge kohlartigen leaves .
Ailinn still did not understand .
Why should your father have such a thing ?
He wanted to say that it was a Jux , but hesitated to put two fingers on the lips in her presence .
She thought , anyway , that he was a little strange .
`` It appeared funny , '' he said instead .
They shook their heads and blocked Keverns .
There was nothing else to see on the whole world than her ungekämmtes bleak hair .
There was nothing he would like to see .
`` If you say , '' I mean it without conviction .
But that does not explain why you vorsingst me .
She seemed to be honest .
Are my feet too big ?
He saw it again .
Your feet are not so direct .
Maybe your ankles , a little bit ...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too fat ?
Do you hate ?
Of course I hate you .
That is only the silly song .
He could have said 'I love you ' , but it was too early for that .
`` Your thick ankles are exactly the reason why you think me , '' he tried it instead .
I am a bit perverse .
That sounded wrong .
It had to be funny .
When he tried to be funny , he often found himself in trouble because he , like his father , did not have the soothing charm needed to control the savagery inherent in jokes .
Perhaps his father wanted to be cruel .
Perhaps he wanted to be Kevern .
Despite his friendly eyes .
Ailinn where was red and rose out of her deck-chair , threw the console around and buried the wine she had drunk .
Holunderblütenwein , so drunk was not an excuse for him .
In their excitation , they seemed to tremble , like palm-branches in the storm .
`` And your Dickkopf is precisely why I feel perverted to you , '' she said ...
Except that I am not .
She was sorry , both because of the unnecessary unfriendliness of his words and the fear that appeared in her eyes when she turned against him .
Did they say that he would beat them ?
She had not told him of his life on the cold northern archipelago , where she grew up , but he had no doubt that it was essentially like here .
The same huge and icy ocean broke out here as there on the shore .
The same confused men , with still thicker skin and verdrießlicher after THE WAR , who had been their ancestors as smugglers and wreckers , moved from tavern to pub , always willing to raise the hand against a woman who refused or derided .
Dickkopf ?
They would have shown a thick fist if they were not farewells !
You only canoodle - kissing was the most frequently used word for an erotic appeal between men and women , an antidote to the vacuous ballads from the console - they only canoodle and then beat .
According to Keverns , this was an unnecessary refinement , as the kissing itself was already an act of violence .
Ailinn where gave him a sign through her body .
He rose from a deck-chair like an old man .
She also felt bleiern , but the fury of his grief surprised them .
That was not the end of the world .
They did not know .
She saw him as he departed - just like a room on the upper floor , her companion to him - a man , complaining through something he had created himself .
Adam leaves the garden , she thought .
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general , although some had raised their hands against them .
A man turned away from her , his back , embarrassed , defeated , without fighting spirit - why was it a sight that she seemed to know well , if she could not remember a single time she had seen such a thing before the day before ?
When she was back alone , Ailinn looked looked on her feet .
Several years before the recent incidents , town Nussbaum , an intelligent and enthusiastic VIENNA researcher on behalf of Ofnow , the non-legislative body for public sentiment , gave a short talk about continued violence at low and medium levels in precisely the parts of the country where their reduction , if not abolition , was most likely to be expected , given the funds and energy invested in eradicating this violence .
`` It has already been done much , and much still needs to be done , '' wrote it , `` to appease the innate aggressiveness of a people that led a thousand wars , and most of them won , especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country where the sweet breath of human kindness has seldom been felt historically despite the soaring church between hedgerows .
But some properties stand out as ineradicable .
The higher the church tower , it seems , the less the passion that it continues to awaken .
The population cries to hear sentimental ballads , intoxicated in stories about Reinvigorated difficulties and claims to believe in the virtues of marriage and family life , but still does not only maintain the former harshness the rural communities as well as our urban fabric , but there is also evidence for the emergence of a new and devious Streitsucht at home , at work , on the streets and even on the squares .
`` You have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate , '' said her mentor when he had read the whole report .
I suggest you read less novels .
town Nussbaum lowered her head .
I must also ask : are you atheist ?
`` I think that I do not have to say , '' replied town walnut .
Are you lesbian ?
Again , town appealed to her right to privacy and denial of the statement .
feminist ?
Again silence .
`` I do n't ask this , '' said Luther Rabinowitz , `` because I would be against atheism , Lesbentum or feminism .
This is a labour-intensive workplace .
We serve a unprejudiced society .
However , certain types of hypersensitivity , which are absolutely acceptable and commendable , may distort results , as you have presented them .
They themselves obviously have prejudices against the Church , and these things that you call 'deceitful ' and 'raw ' may be interpreted by others as well as an expression of power and vitality .
If you continue on the herumreitet , WHAT HAPPENING IST , IF ES HAPPENING IST , as if it had happened yesterday , would mean to take the country its essential vitality .
town walnut looked around while Rabinowitz spoke .
Behind his head repeated a LED-Schriftzug in Flamingorosa the advice that the had given to the country in the last quarter-century or longer .
smile to their neighbor , appreciate your partner , listen to ballads , visit musicals , take advantage of your phone , speak your phone , talk to you , tell you , you listen to , you agree , excuse yourself .
Talk is better than silence , the sung word is better than the written , but nothing is better than love .
`` I fully understand what you want , '' replied town walnut with a calmer voice when she was sure that her boss had spoken to the end , `` and I say nothing more than that we are not as effective as we are deceiving ourselves .
My concern is that , without warning , we may find ourselves in the process of repeating the mistakes that were made at the very first of the WHAT , IF ES HAPPENING .
This time , however , it is not the others in which we forget our anger and our mistrust .
Luther Rabinowitz shaped with the hands a pyramid .
In order to indicate a warning message .
`` They go too far , '' he said , `` if you describe acts as '' errors `` that our grandparents may or may not have committed .
They also go too far , when you say that they have left their `` rage '' and their `` distrust '' to `` others . ''
It should not be necessary to remind someone in your position that we are talking about the past , such as the protection of the present , not of 'us ' and 'other ' .
There was no `` we '' and there was no `` other . ''
It was a time of disorder , that is all we know .
`` If we are honest with ourselves , '' durst town release , `` no part of society can claim to have behaved well .
I do not accuse anybody .
Whether it has been done badly or well , what has happened has happened .
That was then .
There is no need to say anything more - we are in agreement on this .
And , just as no blame must be allocated , it must not be repaid if such a repayment is appropriate and if there is a way to wipe it out .
But what serves the past if we do not learn from it -
The past serves us to forget them .
If I may say something about this , I should like to say something about this .
Luther Rabinowitz rocked his pyramid .
`` I will consider her report , '' he said and dismissed it .
On the next day , when she went to work as usual , she was ridden by a motorcyclist who , like passers-by , was in a kind of `` brutal fury '' on the footpath .
Chance exists .

China denies Hong Kong `` s right to Regierungswahl , protesters swear retaliation .
On Sunday , the Chinese Parliament decided , despite the increased calls for democratic reforms , against the nomination of candidates for the elections in 2017 by the Hong Kong electorate .
This approach probably spurred the long announced protests in Hong Kong `` s business district , while activists initiated the planning and mobilization within a few hours after the announcement .
The decision of the Chinese People `` s Congress allows the Communist leaders to reject all not candidates .
`` This is not unexpected , but it makes us angry , '' said or Emily Lau , Chairman of the Democratic Party .
That is not what Beijing had promised .
People have lied to the residents of Hong Kong .
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime .
In his defense of China `` s decision , Li Fei , Vice-Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People `` s Congress , said that admission of public nominations in the elections to the Hong Kong government would be too messy .
Since 1997 , when Britain handed over China `` s control over Hong Kong , Beijing has promised to allow the inhabitants of 2017 to choose the Regierungsvorsitz .
The Chinese leadership presented the decision of Sunday as a democratic breakthrough , because it gives the citizens of Hong Kong a direct electoral law , but the decision also makes it clear that China `` s leaders remain firmly in the hands of a tightly controlled by Beijing .
According to a new clause , only candidates , with love for the country and love for Hong Kong , are to be admitted .
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most violent protests in Hong Kong have been taking place for a number of years .
Behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the movement Central With Love and Peace , whose organizers have threatened to insulate the financial sector if Beijing does not permit a genuine universal suffrage .
On Sunday evening , hundreds of Occupy-Central-Anhängern were gathered in Hong Kong in a few hours after the announcement .
In the demonstration , the organizers said that their movement had reached a new stage of civil disobedience and planned them in the coming weeks .
However , they did not provide any details , apparently to avoid problems with the authorities .
In a Online-Mitteilung , the organizers shared that the movement `` the occupation of the Zentralbezirks only had to be considered as last resort , an action that will only take place if all Dialogchancen are exhausted and no other choice exists .
We are sorry to have to say that all Dialogchancen have been exhausted today and the occupation of the Zentralbezirks will definitely take place .
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for the announcement of Beijing for days , and it was on Sunday before the government building tightened security measures , including police forces and barricades .
The unrest is accentuated by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control over their city .
The influx of people from the mainland increases competition for products and services .
It is also growing that the values of Hong Kong , such as democracy and freedom of speech , are beginning to crumble under the growing pressure of Beijing .
Some criticised the demonstrations demonstrations , because they risked the business operations - the lifeline of Hong Kong .
`` The protests they speak could cause major economic damage , depending on how many people are involved and how long they continue , '' said or Regine Ip , who has been criticising the movement for a long time .
We do not want to stir up fears that Hong Kong is out of control .
This impression is bad for investment .
China `` s state-controlled media also recently reported about Hong Kong `` s activists in Hong Kong as a Western subversive agent .
In this summer , activists organised an unofficial referendum on the rights , in which 780,000 people took part - more than one-fifth of the voters in Hong Kong .
In July , tens of thousands of people took part in one of the largest Demokratiedemonstrationen in the history of the region .

Putin calls for Kiev to include `` Staatlichkeitsgesprächen '' with eastern Ukraine .
Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded Russian media coverage on Sunday that the Ukrainian government suspended the fighting against the separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the `` statehood '' of the breakaway region .
His spokesman , Dimitri Peskow , later made it clear that Putin did not mean that , under the control of the separatists , the region of eastern Ukraine will become a part of Russia , but that its status with Ukraine must be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region power to represent its rights and interests .
Putin `` s call to the Kiev government to negotiate on an equal footing with the pro-Russian insurgents , however , is in line with the strategy that he has apparently pursued since the beginning of the riots over five months ago : help for the separatists of areas and pressure on the Ukrainian government to allow the newly proclaimed region Novorossija de facto independence for an alliance with Russia , rather than with the West .
In an interview with the state-run television channel , Putin condemned the Ukrainian campaign to recapture the territories of the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk , which were taken in March and April , after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on 18 March .
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently called the `` Novorossija '' or `` Khadjibey , '' a term that is reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary heyday of the Russian empire .
Putin pointed out that all those who , in the wake of the campaigns of Ukrainian politicians for the elections on 26 Okt . and during the civilian communities in the territories held by separatists , are hoping for immediate peace talks `` in their illusions , '' reported Itar-Tass .
`` We need to engage in extensive talks immediately , not only on technical issues , but also on the political organization of society and the Staatsstatus of the Südostukraine , in order to preserve the interests of the people living there , '' he said .
Peskow said that Putin `` s reference to statehood must be seen in the context of the greater autonomy that has been discussed for months by the Kiev leadership to dispel fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk .
Only the Ukrainian Government can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy , said Peskow .
This is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia , said Peskow , 'because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine , but an internal conflict in Ukraine ' .
The clarification of the `` misinterpretation `` of Putin `` s remarks underscored Russia `` s leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the East , in contrast to the direct Annexation of Crimea , on which the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians .
Moscow would have far greater difficulty in annexing the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine , as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians , and surveys from the period before the conflict resulted in a large majority for remaining in Ukraine .
The autonomy mentioned by Russian diplomats on international forums would give the regional governments in Ukraine authority to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations , and thus give the Kremlin de facto control over an area that links Russian territory with Crimea .
The peninsula , which was annexed five months ago , is the home port for most of the Russian navy , as well as an important seaport and historical coastal area .
The regions between the Rostowgebiet in Russia and the Crimea are also rich in mines , factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military .
The Ukrainian President Petro Petro proposed in his speech on 7 June that Ukrainian legislation - after new elections - should take into consideration the constitution , with which the relevant areas are given greater control over their finances and the status of languages .
But his idea of autonomy seems to be in stark contrast to those of the Kremlin and separatist rebels , whose armament and incitement to Moscow is being reproached .
Putin `` s last call to Kiev to negotiate with the Separatistenführern on an equal footing followed after another incursion of the rebels last week , after Russian troops and tanks invaded the Azov region along the Azov Sea to eastern Ukraine .
The separatists , supported by Russia , took over in the coup , which , according to fears Ukrainian security , is the first step of a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to the Crimea , control of Nowoasowsk .
For this reason , massive civilian and military preparations have begun to fortify Mariupol , a Stahlindustriehafen with 500,000 inhabitants , which is between Nowoasowsk and narrow access to the peninsula of Crimea .
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels and asked for action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine , a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years .
`` We are nearing a point where there is no return , '' warned Poroshenko .
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine .
The EU summit did not take concrete action , the leadership required the proposal for further sanctions against Russia , which should enter into force in the event of an escalating escalation of nuclear power .
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk , after two Russian columns and 1,000 soldiers last week in the Donezkregion to support the besieged separatists , said Colonel Footballers 1898-1976 , Speaker of the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Alpine-wide on Saturday in Kiev .
The first presumably 63 Ukrainian soldiers , trapped by the Russian invasion of Ilowajsk , were exchanged on Sunday against 10 Russian paratroopers , who had been captured a week ago on Ukrainian-style territory , divided 1898-1976 on Sunday .

With Falterona , the BBC might have found the great director it needs .
She meets with a proud Ruhmesschleppe from the banking world , the Institute and the inner circle of the Party .
And it has its own Fronterfahrung .
Her career began with the world `` s masses Bain and Co. , where she moved to Morgan Stanley , Bombadier , ICI , and the media world of 's .
She was Chairman of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned as the primary post of the parent company 's to a younger male colleague .
Their compensation was supposedly nearly £1 million .
Their political ranking is also solid .
She was recommended by Lord Browne , the former chairman of BP , when he was looking for more private-sector knowledge in Whitehall : she became an adviser to the Cabinet .
Her husband is a former Tory member of the Council .
In May I described the role of the chairman with a poisoned chalice .
Not only is the BBC as a huge and complex entity in the heart of public life , but there is also an internal paradox in its structure .
Confidence works in two directions : inward to the first guard of its own Managementhierarchie in the BBC , but also to the outside as a voice of public concern and restlessness when things go wrong .
This provides for an almost unsustainable duopoly , which requires full reform .
But the newly incoming president would risk taking action , on everything , and an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty , while he may be doing his job .
It is a difficult task .
And as if that were not enough , many people are still interested in seeing the BBC shrunk - power , money and status .
While competition is approaching and new technologies are threatening old , comfortable collateral , the upcoming negotiation of license fees for the BBC is fraught with particular dangers .
For the modest sum of £145,50 a year , the British public is buying the largest media company in the world .
The BBC is telling a good story : it says that it reaches 96 % of all households , costing each of them only 40 pence per day .
And it seems that the BBC is rising again at the top : 53 % support it today , compared to 31 % 10 years ago .
impaired and habits for the BBC have changed : I now get Nachrichtenschlagzeilen on my mobile phone and I see missed programs later on my iPlayer .
But it remains a very beloved and respectable institution .
She needs a considerable chairman - I hope she has found it .

Not all children in Ukraine return to school .
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday ( 1 September ) after the summer holidays .
This day is traditionally an important day for families , and , like thousands of other Ukrainian parents , Prime Minister Arsenij Yatsenyuk brought his daughter to school .
There he reported waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened , but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations :
The Septemberfeiern were not held in any school .
The sky is not peaceful throughout Ukraine .
We must fight for a peaceful sky .
The whole of Ukraine , a huge common Ukrainian Peoples ' Front , must fight for a peaceful heaven .
Aleksan Pastukhow , headmaster of the school in Slawjansk , who visited Jazenjuks daughter , spoke to Russian .
We hope that peace will finally prevail here and that the children will receive an education that will be useful to them in the future .
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated , with the children wearing embroidered shirts , holding balloons in the hands and giving their teachers flowers .

Perry from Texas says that unworthy Tweet was not authorized .
A tweet from the official account of the Republican governor of Texas , Rick Perry , on Sunday contained a belittling remark about the democratic Bezirksstaatsanwältin , which is at the heart of a criminal offense against him because of abuse of authority .
The Tweet was deleted later and replaced by another of the Perry user account , the previous one .
Just a tweet has been sent from my account , which was not authorized by me .
`` I do not accept the tweet and have deleted it , '' said it in the later news .
Mr Perry did not respond immediately to requests for comments .
Although the tweets of Perry have been the official user account , it was not clear who actually served the feed .
In the previous Tweet , a two image of the Bezirksstaatsanwältin of Travis County , Rosemary Lehmberg , was drawn , which was condemned in April 2013 for drink-driving .
Perry put a veto against financial support for their offices , as they refused to resign , leading to a charge against Perry - which could be a presidential candidate for 2016 - before a Grand Jury held this month in Austin .
The text of the tweets reads : `` I am not always drunk with the triple permissible permitted ... but if I do it , I accuse Mr Perry when he ausplaudert it . ''
I am the betrunkenste in Texas .
Lehmbergs 's office was not responsible for the investigation of the Grand Jury against Perry .
This was led by Michael McCrum , a prosecutor from San Antonio , who was chosen by a Republican judge .
Perry is not guilty and called the indictment a political trick .
His illustrious team of lawyers applied in the case of the judge who was responsible for the prosecution and argued that the law dealing with the longest-serving governor in the history of the State of Texas is diffuse .
Perry stopped 7.5 million $ public funds to the Public Integrity Unit of the state , based in Travis County , and identified in cases of state corruption in Texas , as Lehmberg refused to resign .
This veto provided a public complaint on the part of a public complaint .
Perry official user account is frequently updated - and sometimes famous .
After graduating from the rallies in Iowa during his presidential candidacy in 2012 , Perry went to speculation that he will stop by making a tweet of a photograph of himself near a lake x11 , with the words `` South Carolina , we come ! ''

Harburg : Tents for new refugees
At the Neuländer place , refugees are now accommodated in tents .
The head office for refugees in Harburg is bursting at all seams .
Now the the have set up three tents of the Red Cross .
The Bezirkspolitiker have been informed only briefly - they are not enthusiastic .
`` These Hauruck-Aktionen continue to arouse public concern and give the Bezirkspolitikern no opportunity to participate constructively in the humane accommodation of refugees , '' says Britta Herrmann , group chairman of the Greens in the Harburg Bezirksversammlung .
Their party demands that the administration Harburg are currently making unused houses available for accommodation .
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents .
The reasons for overcrowding in the initial are the onslaught of help - and the fact that the authorities are not able to provide enough places in social .
Many refugees therefore stay longer than the regular three months .

Feminists criticize race and Polizeiverhalten
The unarmed teenager was killed at the beginning of this month by a police officer in Ferguson , Mon .
The participants raised their hands in the air and sang , `` hands high , not shoot , '' while they waited before the funeral .
After three-week protests in Ferguson , Mo , because of the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown noticed the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez a change in the playing white feminists .
According to their experience , white feminist commentators put the sex before the race when it comes to raising income and income inequality .
However , while tensions in the Middle West have increased and received attention throughout the country , Perez saw that the responses of white women turned to 100 % around the race .
In comparison with the responses of black women shortly after the shots of 9 August , the personal essays with titles like `` thoughts on Ferguson of a white woman '' and `` feminism is not only about the suppression of women '' relatively late .
But for Perez , this meant an important change .
`` I do not think that in feminism there is a lot of people who speak about the white and the privileges in such a high-class way , '' she said .
People felt compelled to say something about the events .
It is characteristic of the crisis in which we find ourselves , and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnicized that they must express this .
For Englischprofessorin Koritha Mitchell from the Ohio State University , Ferguson `` s problems have come to light that black women are exposed every day , but they are not considered as `` women 's issues '' in the cultural space .
`` I can publish something funny on Facebook about me and my partners and get 150 likes from anywhere , '' said Mitchell .
If I post something about how blacks are under siege in their own country , the silence is deafening .
`` How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship , but not about security in public space ? '' she asked .
For black women like Mitchell , the race , sex , and sexuality in the history of the US , there is no dichotomy between racial and Geschlechterproblemen .
For them , black women have not had the luxury of separating the themes neatly ; they live in the combined reality every day .
While white women now associate the subjects of race and gender in feminist Mainstreamkreisen , Angela Hattery , professor of women and gender studies at George Mason University , says that their predecessors did the opposite .
`` Between 1865 and 1890 , at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the justification was almost always the rape of a white woman , '' said Hattery .
White women had to be involved in history to justify the flair .
For Hattery , the split between white and black women came to the point where white fighters for women , such as Susan B. Anthony , analyzed the country in the late nineteenth century and discovered that the fight for electoral law could only be successful for one group : women or blacks .
`` They met the decision to stand up for women 's rights , and the right to vote for blacks should come later , '' said Hattery .
When you are reminded of such things , one with power is aware of why coloured women do not trust white women .
We did not do our job well .
We never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons .
Even after women were given the right to vote in 1920 , it took a decade for white women to compete against the C in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Cruelty .
The group was formed almost 40 years after the original request for help of black women , says Mitchell .
For Mitchell is the spate of white feminist reactions to the questions raised by Ferguson - Polizeiverhalten , racial discrimination - a mirror of the time in which white feminists were `` catching '' with the problems faced by black women for generations .
`` Would it not be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms have the right to educate a child as seriously as they do with the right to Empfängniskontrolle ? '' asked Mitchell .
Feminists of the second generation , who built their careers in the struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives , are now trying to understand what that means .
The well-known white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown on Facebook and published a pithy article by Rebecca Carroll , 11636 of Guardian , calling for more protests from white Americans on racism .
`` I hope that women who have a different but parallel reason to understand one of the body 's inherent danger - and opinions on race , which are clearly different in public opinion - will lead to change , '' wrote Steinem .
Although Steinem stands for a rather intersektionalen feminism , to be addressed in the race , as well as Geschlechterthemen , some of her comments about the grounds in America are perplexed .
Christina Sommer , Researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of `` Who Stole cyberfeminsm ? '' said to The People that young men in the United States , especially young colored men , `` far more vulnerable than their sisters , '' but Steinems comments on Ferguson are in contrast to their previous criticism .
There are now hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women , but almost nothing for boys .
But as the White House recently a small program , My Brother 's Keeper , LSD , to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men , there were irritating reactions from many feminists , including Gloria Steinem .
The relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem in the foreground .
After the US-Grenzpolizei almost 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the CHEEZ-al-PEEN-o of the country this year , the theme of the reform is coming back to the surface - this time as a women .
Andrea Mercado , IESG of We the Together , an organization that mobilizes women for the reform , said that for a reconsidered of the subject as an essential women they only need to publish the stories of the women .
`` These speak for themselves , '' said Mercado .
When the vast majority of immigrant workers go to male immigrants , the women they accompany are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation .
`` These stories find an echo in women 's organisations , '' she said .

Sharif refuses to resign .
Khan and Qadri had called their followers on Sunday , channels .

On Saturday evening there was a lot of things going on in the Burggartenfest .
The concept of the organisers agreed .
Despite the strong downpours on Saturday evening , an estimated 1200 music fans came to the Open-Air-Fest in the road .
Occasionally the entrance had to be stopped .
`` That was annoying , '' said Ron Sem , one of the organizers .
Salzwedel l light and fun .
From two Spanish words , Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem have formed the name Amula .
Because the Open Air in the Salzwedeler road is supposed to radiate brightness on the day and in the evening through various shows .
Well , and the fun comes anyway alone .
This was already apparent at the early Saturday when the first visitors to the Open Air whereas .
A feast for all generations had promised the organizers .
And that is what they have been able to do .
Around the Versorgungsstände on the Burggartenwiese there were Salzwedeler , but also guests from the nearby and further surrounding .
They followed the first live performances , wippten with the foot in the clock , enjoyed cool drinks - short : pure relaxation and enjoyment were required .
And this across generations .
While there is a ceiling on the extra white sand at the beach bar lümmelten , others in a quarter of wine in the Vinothek labten , the offspring of the bouncy , which was a great attraction for the smaller guests .
But even with the painting , the volunteers in the truest sense of the word had to do their hands full , to get the crowds and to conjure up imaginative creations in the small faces .
The larger ones used the Wider or participated in a Skateboard-Workshop , which the the Goodfoot-Crew from Salzwedel .
Until the big rain came .
Shortly before 5.30 pm he down to the visitors , especially families looking for the vastness and dry .
But the attractiveness of the festival did not stop this .
`` There were more people than expected , '' said Ron Sem , who spoke of a `` success on the whole line . ''
That is why a repeat of the big party next year is not forthcoming .
Although it still needs to be worked on the content and size of the event , it was clear in a first record on Sunday to the Volksstimme .
As a nuisance , he said that the admission had to be stopped in the meantime .
Apparently the security had been booked with too little force .
As a result , some people who had already paid no longer came to the site .
The response was very good .
In a first tentative estimate , the Salzwedeler co-organizer of about 1200 visitors spoke in the road thronged .
There were problems with the sound equipment .
The Salzwedeler blocks blocks ' n 'Rox , therefore , broke out enervated .
The technicians were unable to create a reasonably reasonable sound .
The planned Shisha-Lounges could not be built because the tents could not be brought to Salzwedel because of a puncture .
`` In the next year they will be there , '' so the organiser .
The premiere of the Amula-Open-Airs was more than successful in the number of visitors .
And that in bad weather .
However , the organizers have made a number of mistakes that will still be forgiven for the first time , but have to be eliminated in the second edition .
Also in the social network of Facebook , the organizer must be criticized .
`` Sorry , but for twelve Euro you just want to be expected more , '' Melanie Meier will say on the events page .
`` You have taken a bit of it , '' says Ele Zimmermann at the same place .
Others do not look very closely at the initial problems .
I think it is very good that some people are not just stupid , but actually trying to put something on their feet .
Beware , `` writes Stephanie Jenß to the Amula .
It is now a year for the organisers to put a stop to these criticisms .

Under this Treetop
A powerful tribe we showed in our Rätselaufgabe of the Herren `` My piece of the lucky luck '' last Friday .
Several of these trees are still in the district , the illustrated copy is the `` Geißruheiche '' above Unterweißenbrunn .
A uneven footpath leads up to the 600 year old oak .
It is about fields , Basaltsteinhaufen and Basaltsteinmeeren .
A little bit below the quarry of Bauersberg , a kilometer north of the road to Weisbach , where it stands .
Vital is the natural monument , it towers over the other trees of the surrounding area , and is reminiscent of an American giant with a circumference of over eight metres .
A small Buddha on a stump indicates that it is a spiritual or mystical place .
But , despite intensive research , there were only references to the raspberries .
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has also consulted the Bischofsheim archive and asked older people from Unterweißenbrunn to know what explanation it has with the Geißruheiche .
The result of his research remained the rather sober explanation for the name .
Thus , up to about 80 years ago , the Ziegenhirten have driven their animals from Unterweißenbrunn to the laboriously cleared and stones meadows .
At the foot of the tree , the weary , exhausted by the rise , will have rested .
In the meantime , the area has regained its importance , because in the meadows it is actually grazing again .
The area has also been explained to the Grafenegg of the Reserve , Schneider has continued to find out .
When you enter the Steinansammlungen , you should be careful , because the sun basalt is also a popular place for Kreuzottern .
A footpath leads from Unterweißenbrunn to the tree , but it is hidden .
Further directions are signposted , the direction of Hochrhön and an extended hike .
Where is the Wasserburg ?
A Wasserburg that is sought in our next task , however , is rarely found in the height .
The reflection in the ditch already gives a good impression of the building , but we have some historical buildings in the district that could fit the Gebäudekonterfei .

Returning to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have introduced a legislative proposal to establish the organization of trade unions as a civil right .
`` As trade unions die , the Mittelklassejobs , '' said Ellison , a democrat from Minnesota and vice president of the Progressive Caucus Congress in Congress .
That is why I proudly present the Mitarbeiterermächtigungsgesetz with the Bürgerrechtsikone John Lewis .
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal possibilities of discrimination because of the organisation of trade unions , as in other forms of discrimination - and stops so antigewerkschaftlich .
The addition of the national anti-discrimination law , in order to create an opportunity for discrimination against vulnerable workers , in order to sue a civil court in order to sue justice - and to obtain compensation or compensation - is a sensible and necessary initiative .
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards .
In fact , the best way to understand what Ellison , Lewis and the other sponsors of their legislative proposal suggests is the connection back to a very American idea .
Despite the setbacks that trade unions have been exposed in recent years - in Wisconsin , Michigan , and other countries throughout the country - Americans have once again encouraged countries all over the world to recognise , extend and respect labour rights .
There was a time when millions of Americans still remember this country , democracy , freedom of speech , freedom of the press and the freedom of association in one breath .
When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War , General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution that would ensure that the militarized autocracy would be replaced by democracy .
In full awareness of the fact that workers and their unions took a role in creating a new Japan , they used a language that explicitly recognised that 'the rights of workers in association and common negotiation and action are guaranteed . '
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II , General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would make fascism Adolf Hitler replaced by a strong democracy .
In recognition of the fact that the workers would have to organize themselves and their voice in the new nation , the Germans added a clause that explicitly the : `` The right to establish associations to safeguard and improve the labour and economic conditions of each individual and every profession or profession .
Agreements that restrict this right or aim to reduce it are null and void ; targeted measures are illegal .
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt presided over the International Human Rights Commission , which was drawn up by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , which was adopted in 1948 by the United Nations as a global agreement , Roosevelt and the other authors have a guarantee that 'everyone has the right to form trade unions to protect their interests or to join them . '
For generations , Americans have been forced to accept that labour rights are human rights .
When this country consulted other countries on how to shape civil and democratic societies , Americans declared that the right to establish a trade union - and that this union should participate in collective bargaining as an equal partner with companies and government authorities - must be protected .
With these rights in America under attack , it is indeed very wise to recall the American ideal , which is why the working population must have the right to unite and to make themselves heard in a free and open society .
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago :
History is a great teacher .
Now everyone knows that the labor movement has not reduced the strength of the nation , but increased it .
By raising the living standards of millions of people , work has miraculously created a market for industry and raised the entire nation to an unimaginable increase .
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths , but history preserves them .
History reminds us , and we should do so .
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representatives - is long overdue .
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that America has made in the past and the promise of democracy .

Matthies means : Highest time to the great Connect
In view of the galloping technical progress that threatens to turn our cosy home into High-Tech-Schaltzentralen , our columnist Bernd Matthies is playing with a very familiar electronic accessory .
While I write this here , I have a look at the spiral that connects the listener with the phone , and I think : Boah , like retro is this ?
But there is a thought : if the cable would not be , all the listeners would fly in the house in a very short time , and that would be much more retro .
In any case , is the ekeltronischen ( ekeltronischen ?
No , typos : electronic ) sector is the rule that the world novelty of today 's electronic waste is bought - outdated .
And who , for example , still has a CRT in the living room , who simply says that he is fundamentally opposed to television .
Why are these considerations ?
Because the Andrängen of the Ifa at the radio station this week again leads us to our absolute incompetence in matters of electronics .
The layman , who used the washing machine and CD player blindly , does not even understand the purpose of the devices that are spread with incomprehensible Expertensprech before him : `` Connected Home , wearables , Health Care and Urban Technologies '' promises the press office .
Yes , is it ?
What are we talking about with people who apparently voluntarily spread this kind of Quark ?
After all , for about 20 years , it has been the case that we are going to have to interconnect our house .
In order for the yoghurt itself to be reordered so that we can tell the alarm on the Maldives that it burns in the office .
And would it not be wonderful if we came from the office out of air conditioning on our early arrival ... ?
Yes , but this requires air conditioning .
But a dream will definitely come true soon : we lift our wristwatch , say `` sucking ! '' - and at home the Staubsaugroboter goes off .
It is misleading .
Everything boils down to nothing less than a revolution : `` The borders between white and brown goods blur , '' Rum an industry expert , you can connect the washing machine with a headphones , the purchasing sends the weather forecast and the `` shows how long the pizza in the oven still needs , but that is not good because we are stuck in traffic jams .
We also know from everyday practice : if a Farmers device is really badly needed , the battery is guaranteed to be empty .
Another reason for this is that the spiral on the phone will survive the next Funkausstellungen .

Tony Stewart suffers an accident at the race track .
Tony Stewart 's return to the racetrack ended roughly halfway through his race at the Atlanta Motor Speedway .
Stewart drove for the second time against the wall , after his right front burst in round 172 and ended his evening .

He decided to return this week and win either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a place in the pursuit .
He returned to his work , during an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of the 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr .
The authorities agreed on Friday that the investigation into the cause of the accident will continue for at least two weeks .
No decision has yet been made about whether Stewart has to reckon with a charge .
The three champion was received with great applause when he was presented before the race .
After a start on 12th position , Stewart had already penetrated into the first 10 and was temporarily placed on the spot four .
After a reboot in round 122 , fell asleep .

One day in 2007 , however , he was the one whose ordeal began .
`` I did not feel , '' he wrote in May this year .
I had difficulties with me .
While he struggled with the flu-like symptoms , he remarked that he was impatient with his wife , Juliet .
`` I want to do everything better now than later , '' he recorded .
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week , Lawson felt very unusually and without reason to worry .
Something was in the air .
He asked a colleague to carry out his breast .
Only two weeks ago he was in the French Alps for skiing .
The result of the radiograph was .
He suffered from mesothelioma , an incurable cancer that attacks the Brustfell skin .
As with most cancers , the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine .
Whereas , for example , some smokers are developing lung cancer , not all smokers have been smokers earlier .
But mesothelioma is different .
In almost all cases , the trigger is a asbestos - contact with the Faserbaustoff , once known as `` Wunderstoff . ''
For most of us , mesothelioma is a disease that can easily ignore .
Asbestos is , after all , a product of the past .
The most dangerous the has been no longer used in Britain since the 1960 `` s , when the industry voluntarily committed itself to using it no longer .
Even where it was still used , only people in certain industries worked directly with the substance - plumbers , construction workers , carpenters and shipyard workers , for example .
As an industrial Gefahrstoff from a different age , it seems unlikely to be even more worrying today .
But this complacency is misplaced .
Britain , it seems , is the culmination of a Mesoltheliom-Epidemie .
There are more deaths from mesothelioma than in any other country in the world .
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year , twice as many people die of this disease than in road accidents .
Annual figures from the since 1980 and expected future deaths in the United Kingdom
The reason why we are seeing the deadly effects now , although asbestos has been illegal for years ( 1999 ) , is the fact that a mesothelioma is developing only after decades .
And the scourge of the is not confined to former workers of the construction industry .
Asbestos was , and is often still present in the houses in which we live , the offices in which we work , the schools in which we learn and the shops where we shop .
And therefore , mesothelioma does not know adapted , financial limits , professions or age .
The privileged bastions , from the elegant department stores in London to private schools , are not a shelter .
The Parliament buildings are asbestverseucht .
Even in hospitals , where we are supposed to be healthy , they have already been identified as Ausgangsherde of this deadly Karzinogens .
Andrew Lawson was not old .
He was not a plumber .
It was indeed difficult for him to imagine where he could be in contact with asbestos .
Then he found it out .
`` It looks like that in the tunnels at Guy 's Hospital , where I spent six years studying my training , a lot of asbestos was present , '' he wrote .
All - students , nurses , doctors and porter - use the tunnel .
One wonders how many of my contemporaries will suffer from the same illness ?
Unfortunately , he was able to answer this question at least in part .
`` From the four doctors who were trained at Guy 's Hospital and who were sick in the last five years , he wrote in a letter in 2010 , '' I am the last one who still lives. ``
How many of us will become ill ?
At Andrew Lawson , mesothelioma was diagnosed at the age of 48 .
When he died on 17 February this year he was 55 .
This was an unusually long period of survival .
Fifty per cent of all cancers are dying within 8 months of diagnosis .
The disease is always fatal .
So we can only repeat the Lawson question : 'How many of us will become ill ? '
Britain `` s leading expert in mesothelioma , Professor Julian Peto , assumes that , between 1870 and 2050 , when the Asbestepidemie in Britain is expected to come to a halt , a total of 90,000 of the disease will be the victim .
Most of them have no idea at the moment that they will die .

A quick look at the files of the courts , to which the people concerned frequently turn for compensation , shows the extent to which the Scourge is already rife .
In June of this year , Marks & Spencer , for example , were able to expose Janice to asbestos .
She worked for nine years for the chain , from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible for the Kleidungsabteilung at two locations - one of which was the flagship at Oxford Street .
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she started her activity at M & S .
Now she has two children in the twenties .
`` Before this thing , '' she said , `` I had never heard of mesothelioma , I did n't really know anything about asbestos .
I never thought that would affect me .
There are few people who know a lot about asbestos .
The fact is that the term asbestos is not a substance , but a group of six minerals .
The name derives from the word `` Asbestiform , '' a description of the structure , which makes the fabric resistant and flexible .
Three of the six were used in construction .
chrysotile , also known as white asbestos , is the most widely used asbestos in buildings today .
It was used for roofing , interiors , Rohrisolationen , Boilerisolierungen , even for brake pads in cars .
It is less lethal than others , but it is still regarded by the EU and the WHO as a 'major health risk ' with possible death .
However , sunscreen is the brown asbestos ( Amosit ) and the blue asbestos ( Krokydolith ) .
Britain was once the world `` s largest importer of brown asbestos , and pundits suspect that `` it was clear , but indirect evidence , that this was a major cause for the uniquely high Mesotheliomraten . ''
A staff of Marks & Spencer was suspended at Oxford Street , London , Asbestos .
Janice Allen may not be seen as a typical Mesotheliomopfer , but the work of Julian Peto suggests that their history is not uncommon .
He has presented a study of those affected , stating that `` a significant proportion of the mesothelioma , without a known suspension through work or in the House , was probably caused by environmental problems in the environment . ''
Most of these contacts are based on the `` normal use and aging '' of our buildings .
It looks as if no one can be sure of being safe .
A report by Goddard Consulting , which has investigated the palace of Westminster , shows how people might have been exposed to the substance in the heart of the government .
In 2009 , Goddard reported that the Serviceschächte and pipelines were contaminated with asbestos , whose lethal fibers could be caused by something as harmless as `` strong meta-pattern . ''
Members of Parliament are often accused of taking care of their own interests , but here it seems that the opposite is true .
While the directorate of the Parliamentary Committee insisted that the Westminsterpalast have received a 'clean health ' , it is now undisputed that EUR 1 billion is needed over several years to renovate Parliament , to modernise the electrical installations and to remove asbestos , and that , after the general elections , the Members will be more likely to meet in the near future than on the green benches in Westminster .
The Goddard-Bericht also pointed out that 'the presence of asbestos has not been handled in accordance with the relevant provisions ' .
No one can know whether this mismanagement will cost .
All you can do is wait .
A person who was never able to determine the contact with asbestos was Graham Abbott , a general practitioner .
Like Andrew Lawson , the 50-year-old Abbott predicts that he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals .
`` I worked in a hospital in which Asbestklagen was positively decided , '' he says , `` but I can not prove it in my case .
It is so difficult to remember all the places where one has worked and the data .
What he remembers is the day at the beginning of December 2009 , where he got some kind of fever .
He was 45 , and was carrying out an operation just late in the evening .
Suddenly I had chills .
It suddenly came .
I felt awful .
I thought it was no longer possible to make the trip home .
As a doctor , Abbott knew the pain of Brustfell , the skin around his lungs .
But , like Janice Allen , he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma .
He did not go to work a month .
Verwunderte doctors made X-rays of his breast and put Pleurakathether in order to detect liquid from the lungs and to test them in the laboratory .
His complaints , however , remained without diagnosis .
His health was slow , and he returned to his job .
From time to time , however , the symptoms returned , often after sporting activity and intense breathing .
In 2011 , a patient was diagnosed with similar symptoms in his practice and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma .
But , even now , Abbott did not do so with his own case .
After all , his patient was older and had worked directly with asbestos .
The link in the case was clear .
In September 2011 , Abbott condition deteriorated again and his family doctor brought his CT-Scans and X-rays to a group of experts .
In December 2011 , exactly two years after Abbott had felt ill for the first time , a probe probe was introduced into the cave between the ribs and the Brustfell .
I am an optimist .
I usually go on , `` he says .
Frankly , I have not had so many concerns .
But Rachel , my wife , was worried .
The result of the skin biopsy was in the week between Christmas and New Year : `` You told me that it was mesothelioma . ''
Graham Abbott : Diagnosis mesothelioma
Suddenly , Abbott had meetings with Macmillan-Krankenschwestern , one of which recommended him to become a lawyer .
Only now he understood the extent of the epidemic .
`` It turned out that asbestos was very widespread , especially in large public buildings where tubes were often isolated with asbestos , '' he says .
The people exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now developing .
And so , mesothelioma now meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions .
The most dangerous pipes with Asbestisolierungen in hospitals were below the earth , so patients were probably not exposed to the substance .
But many employees who moved from one building to another ( like Andrew Lawson ) or in underground canteens ( as Graham Abbott often did ) were most likely to get in touch with the poisonous substances .
It is apparent that , over several decades after the war , hospitals may have been chance for patients , but life-threatening for the treatment physicians .
It is still being removed today .
Students took their bunsenburner on Asbestmatten .
And it concerns not only hospitals .
Asbestos is often used in offices , shops , libraries and spaces due to its fabulous insulating and retardant properties .
Schools .
Indeed , many people have probably had the first Asbestkontakt in the classroom .
Everywhere in the country , in thousands of Chemiestunden , students have switched their bunsenburner to Asbestmatten .
On the web pages , the topic of asbestos in schools is now frequently mentioned .
And meanwhile , so innocent items in our homes , such as interiors or Schuppendächer , have been included in asbestos .
`` It is a Industriegift that is contained in large parts of our real estate , '' notes Andrew Morgan , the lawyer who has been representing Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy 's Hospital .
In one case was the only contact one affected by an affected woman , the demolition of a Gartenschuppens in the 1970 `` s .
So be sure how to remove your shed .
The effects of diagnosis and the knowledge that the disease is incurable is immense .
`` It takes a while to process it , '' says Graham Abbott .
I went back to work and tried to go further , but I realized that I was unable to concentrate on what I did .
I was in practice two weeks .
Then I knew that I had to go and I had to take care of myself .
Well , I will not experience another Christmas .
The greatest difficulty was the change of perspective from the position of a doctor to that of a patient .
Like countless patients before him , he remembers how overwhelmed he was with all the information he had to cope with .
`` It was very difficult to include everything , '' he says .
`` I asked my doctor '' how long I have ? ``
And there were about 12 months .
I remember that I thought , `` Well , I will not experience another Christmas .
That was the case . '
mesothelioma is especially treacherous because it is our Lebenserhaltungsmechanismus - the breathing itself - is causing the deadly cancer .
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by Asbestkontakt .
Asbestos consists of the smallest fibers .
When the asbestos is stirred and the fibres are inhaled , they can be set in the Brustfell , the skin around the lungs .
Asbestos fibres irritate the Brustfell and can trigger re-construction .
`` The problem arises with the the asbestos fibers , '' says Professor Tom Treasure , a Herz-Thorax-Arzt who moved to the Guy 's Hospital in 2001 .
Exactly the hospital , which was suspected by Andrew Lawson , that it exposed him to asbestos , is now , ironically , a leading centre in the treatment of mesothelioma .
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were likely to be exposed to asbestos during their training in hospital .
As soon as the Asbestnadeln reach the tissue , Treasure says , they are pressed from the Atemvorgang to the edge where the skin is .
It is from the very beginning that it is invasive .
The usual options for other cancers do not work well with mesothelioma .
The effectiveness of an operation is , for example , hotly contested .
Some say that it is worth trying .
Treasure denies this .
`` You can not cut the Brustfell , '' he says .
You do n't get around with the knife .
Meanwhile , the cancer is not very good at chemotherapy , `` the '' effect shows `` but not heals .
`` Sometimes there are Langzeitüberlebende , '' says Treasure .
But at the end they all die .
Fortunately , some patients actually live longer than expected .
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis .
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis , Graham Abbott is still fighting .
After he contacted mesothelioma , Abbott came in contact with Andrew Lawson who , four years after his diagnosis , had become a Ein-Mann-Unterstützungs- and consultancy for Mitbetroffene .
`` Hello , Krebszentrale , '' he met with calls cheerfully .
`` He was very positive , '' says Abbott .
He had received his diagnosis four years before and was still very active .
Originally , Abbott `` s six Chemotherapiezyklen were offered , which lasted for four months , and his life is likely to be extended only by one month .
`` I was desperate , '' he says .
I wanted to give up .
Lawson , however , managed to keep things in a slightly more positive light. ``
After consulting several doctors , Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski , Herz-Thorax-Spezialist on Guy 's .
`` We had an advantage by not having to be referred , I just shouted and got an appointment , '' there is Graham .
A normal patient would have to have a bank transfer and have to wait for the approval of the treatment .
Money is crucial in order to be able to take advantage of the best available therapies .
But if these treatments inevitably fail , many people are affected by another financial concern - about the future of the families that they leave .
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation .
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP .
`` It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous for health , '' says Morgan .
But what has changed in the 1960 `` s is that it was recognized that even a very small burden was a health risk .
And here the negligence of companies began to play a role .
Andrew Lawson and Guy 's Hospital put their case in the end , but it was not what Morgan calls a `` full compensation , '' because Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to a Asbestkontakt on Guy 's .
After the investigation into his death , a spokesman for Guy 's , however , confirmed that `` the asbestos fibres were removed in the 1990s in the 1990s . ''
That was too late for Andrew Lawson .
How to remove asbestos
In fact , it is a huge problem for those who are seeking compensation , a huge problem , the lethal Asbestkontakt of a company or a job - usually decades after the incidents .
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed .
insurance can be lost .
And those who defend themselves against claims know that the time is for them , but certainly not with the plaintiffs .
In response to this , there have been clear new legislation this year , which makes it easier for Mesotheliom-Betroffene to claim compensation even if their former employers are no longer able to find them .
The law has established a fund of EUR 350 million donated by the insurance industry , which has been diagnosed after July 2012 , can prove a contact , but can not sue anyone .
In these cases , the plaintiffs receive 80 % of what a court in a normal Schadensersatzprozess could have been able to give them - about 120,000 pounds .
Approximately 300 successful applications are expected per year .
Andrew Morgan thinks , like so many Mesotheliom-Betroffene , that 350 million pounds have been a `` very good work '' of the insurance industry .
`` This is a deal of insurers for insurers , '' he says , and indicates that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have to pay if the time had not been ignored and the companies could find them and sue them .
Mike Penning , then and Pensionsminister , also admitted that the law was not perfect .
But both Penning and Morgan have said that , in the face of seven fatalities , rapid action is needed on a daily basis .
`` People are suffering so much and need help today , '' said Penning during the second hearing in December of last year .
At that time , Graham Abbott has been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months .
After her first deliberation , Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation , which he expects to have a positive effect in contrast to Tom Treasure .
This was accompanied by a radiotherapy therapy and chemotherapy - a therapy , with which Lang-Lazdunski can present a survival rate of up to 40 % over five years .
Abbott felt stronger .
`` This is , of course , the most important thing , '' says Abbott .
This can be seen again and again in patients .
There is something you can go on .
If you software , you 'll get very quickly worse .
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012 .
At the end of August , he had the last of the six Chemotherapiezyklen .
Nachsorgescans showed no signs of the disease .
Then I had a scan in March 2014 .
There were several Krebs-Flecken around my chest .
I was just 50 .
That is not life-threatening .
That is lebensbeendend .
Again , Abbott underwent six Chemotherapiezyklen .
Now no trace of tumors is visible .
But the process is physically and psychologically very demanding .
They need to think about practical things - about the money , if I am not more , for example , or my wife show how the Boilerzeiteinstellung works .
If you receive bad news , you will be negative .
They must look forward .
As a father of modeling , 16 , and Tamsin , 14 , this is not always easy .
`` For parents , this is difficult , '' he says .
It is hard to know what to say and how much .
When I received my first diagnosis , I told my girl that I would have a disease with which I would not become old .
They reacted quite differently .
Tamsin is very sociable and impetuous .
She told her friends and we soon got a lot of calls .
modeling was more restrained .
She did not say much .
Such discussions are something that all cancer patients need to go through .
But , for Mesotheliomerkrankte , such talks are not driven by hope , not by a trail of hope for survival .
The disease ( as in the end also for Stephen Jay Gould ) is a grim security .
As Andrew Morgan says , `` mesothelioma is not life-threatening .

The tradition of the in the US is now transferred to universities , where NBA performances are offered with the private .
We are pleased to be able to respond to this demand and to offer the UK `` s first luxury services for students today .
In order to achieve a particularly impressive performance at the university , the company also offers Transportoptionen such as private , Rolls-Royce Phantom , Aston Marten or McLaren P1 .
Mr. Stewart also said that the service was a Sicherheitssparte .
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to pay their belongings in a dangerously overcharged car by the country .
Together with our new VIF-Optionen we look forward to ensuring that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury .
A Unternehmenssprecher said that no new bookings were made available , since the service was only introduced , but added that `` students would book the service in the next weeks . ''
The company also informed that , despite the tuition fees of 9,000 pounds a year , there is a market for this offer .
Students today differ in their expectations and demands from the students 10 , 20 , 30 or 40 years - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression , and with -Start you can exactly that .
The National the , however , criticized the service as a point of departure .
Megan Dunn , Vice-President of the NUS for Higher Education said : `` This offer seems completely separate from the life of the majority of students .
Many students who start studying this month are exposed to a crisis of the cost of living because the available financial assistance in the form of credits and scholarships does not keep up with the sharply rising bills for the most basic conditions of life , before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds for as little as the arrival at the residence .

Housing prices have experienced the strongest growth rate in seven years , showing a widely quoted index .
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for homes in the Australian capital rose by 1.1 percent in August , so the RP-Daten from Monday .
This increase is due to the increase in June , July and August at 4.2 percent , the biggest increase in the winter months since 2007 .
The annual price increase was 10.9 % , more than twice as high as the increase in the 12 months to August 2013 , but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country .
The research of RP Data , Tim BardCon , told Sydney and Melbourne to drive a two-part market .
The figures of RP data show that house prices in Sydney increased by 16.1 % last year , in Melbourne , by 11.7 % .
The following markets are Adelaide , Brisbane , and Darwin , where average prices rose by five and six per cent .
At the other end of the scale , Canberra has been hit hard by the cuts in government spending , and where prices rose by only 1.4 % over the year .
Mr BardCon said that , with the US rebate , there will now be an increase in the real estate market for the next few months , which would be subject to a real test of the market .
`` If you consider the constantly high rate of the , a generally fast the and the constantly low Zinsumgebung , it is likely that home prices will continue to rise in the next three months , '' he said .

Taxation of businessmen in the space of Washington is rising with economic recovery
A recovery of the economy means more customers , more sales and new jobs .
It also means higher taxes .
State and local authority for business in the country grew slightly last year , while economic recovery accelerated , so a newly published study last week , and the companies in the Washington area were no exception .
Companies in the District , Maryland and Virginia have paid $ 27.6 billion to government and local authorities in the financial year 2013 , an increase of 3.8 percent over the revenue from 2012 to $ 26.6 billion .
The state and local tax burden of business increased by 4.3 percent to 671 billion last year , compared to 3.9 % in the previous year , and it was the third consecutive year after the several years of decline in 2009 and 2010 .
State taxes increased more than the local taxes , by 4.3 % , according to the study carried out by the service Ernst & Young with the Center for State Taxation , a Steuerpolitikgruppe .
More than half of the country `` s tax revenue , 56 % , comes from corporate taxes , while 36 % of revenues come from companies .
Virginia , with 28 % , generates the lowest tax revenue from companies .
Much of the increase in tax revenues is justified in a recovery of corporate profits , say the researchers , which led to an increase of 3.7 by 3.7 % this year after the three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 % .
While a large share of these profits from large states such as California , New York and Texas , the process also appears to be the case for Washington .
Companies in the District , Maryland and Virginia have paid more than $ 10 billion in government and local Immobiliensteuern last year , compared to $ 9.6 billion in 2012 - an increase in the course of a year by 4.2 percent .
But the apparent recovery at the property in Maryland is not so effective in increasing government and local tax revenue , as the US economy is in excess of more than one-fifth of corporate profits .
Businesses in Virginia and DC pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of Immobiliensteuern .
`` In Maryland , the following : a large part of real estate , especially in the frontier area around DC , is either owned by the government or non-profit organizations that do not pay Immobiliensteuern , '' said Douglas Lindholm , Managing Director of the Center on State Taxation .
Maryland is therefore forced to rely much more on income taxes , for example , to be able to offer the same services that other countries offer .
The recent recovery in tax revenues by businesses can not be attributed solely to the recovery of the property market .
Unternehmenseinnahmen also seem to recover , so the data .
Companies in the region reported about income taxes of $ 2.3 billion , compared to 2.1 billion in 2012 .
Maryland took $ 1 billion in Unternehmenseinkommenssteuern , the highest amount in the region .
As the trend moves in the same direction , the local tax burden on businesses does not grow evenly across all three places .
The road in the district corresponded with 4.3 percent to the national average , while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher , 4.9 percent .
Only Virginia reported a subpar tax revenue of 4.1 percent .
Virginia , with 6 % in all three Amtsbereichen , has the least Unternehmenseinkommenssteuern ( in all three there are fixed rates ) .
The Unternehmenssteuersatz in Maryland stands at Dura-Flange percent and in the district at relatively high Sullivan percent .
A similar study by the US-Handelskammer at the beginning of this year showed that in Virginia , lower government and local business taxes are required , and a better environment than in Maryland .
In the study the district was not investigated .
Despite its advantages , Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbor .
North Carolina has adopted legislation to reduce its corporate-tax rate this year from 6.9 % to 6 % , the same sentence as Virginia , and the rate will fall to 5 % next year .
If the state continues to reach its Einkommensziele in the coming year , this law could reduce the state `` s state monopoly by up to 3 % by 2017 .
In the meantime , it seems to be better for small businesses in the area of Washington , and they are therefore paying more government and local taxes , so the recent study .
Corporate taxes , which are paid as a personal income tax by small businessmen - a institutions , after which most small businesses are organized - in the District , Maryland and Virginia last year increased by 20 percent to $ 2.4 billion , a significantly faster rate of growth than corporate taxes as a whole .
Researchers say that the trend and increase in corporate taxes across the country is likely to continue this year , with an increase in overall government spending for the state and local governments by 6.2 % in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year .
Nevertheless , the space of Washington could lag behind if the federal government `` s fiscal retrenchment has an impact on the labor market in the region .

In an opinion on the new press , he contradicts statements by the executive director Peer Medau and attested to this `` as a Feldherr . ''
The style of the university is not , that is , in the communication .
For example , the family family had already been informed of the request of the university in the middle of June .
The statement that the plans were only known in July are definitely wrong , `` says so .
At the same time , it points out that the plans are not 'Vorfestlegungen or even decisions ' , but there are 'preferences ' .
Also , the extension of the narrow road to the entrance to the castle is less dramatic than that of the Medaus .
It was from a nine metre wide road and is not mentioned .
It goes to the current state at 5.50 metres , which is a metre wide than before , `` explains Pötzl .
The argument of the Medau-Betreiber , that their free and inquire parking spaces in the future will only be used by students of the university , does not want to apply Pötzl .
Zugeparkt is not at all because , as with other public car parks , it has become an intelligent solution .
Thinking to the People `` s Villages
The nursery Bergwichtel , which is located on the site and , in front of its door , would have access to the parking deck , should not be affected by the `` Hochschulpräsidenten . ''
Instead , he has to bear in mind that this is not only about the crèche , but also about the residents at the entrance to the transition and the 800 students of the neighbouring secondary school .
So it is a question of much more than the special interests of Mr Medau , `` says Pötzl .
Whether the critique of the Elternbeirats of the crèche , with the expansion of the road would be lost to a `` the few natural stains of Coburgs , '' the reader can decide for himself . ''
At the beginning of October , Pötzl , together with the State Bauamt Bamberg , wants to inform the town councils about the constructional development of the University of Applied Sciences by 2020 and to address the importance of new development in this context .
Peer Medau had informed the parents of the nursery about the plans of the university last week .
As a result , access to the new parking deck is not going to take place via the Campus and the Friedrich-Streib-Straße , but via the campus .
In this way , the narrow road should be extended to approximately one kilometre length .
According to the estimates of the Medaus , the traffic in the park of Schloss castle would increase tenfold .
There is talk of about 2000 vehicles every day .
From the side of the city you have not wanted to comment on the project .

Go back to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have tabled a legislative proposal to establish the Organization of trade unions as civil rights .
`` Such as trade unions , die , die also the middle-class jobs , '' said Ellison , a Democrat from Minnesota , and Deputy Chairman of the progressive caucus in the Congress .
Therefore , I imagine the employee empowerment law proudly alongside the civil rights icon John Lewis .
This ground-breaking legislation gives workers the same legal possibilities for discrimination on the grounds of the Organization of trade unions as other forms of discrimination - and stops so antigewerkschaftlich set forces .
The addition of the national labour law , for discrimination to make a way exposed workers to organize of a trade union representative , to sue in a civil court for Justice - and to obtain damages or fines - is a useful and necessary initiative .
But it is not a radical initiative - with security anyway , according to American standards .
Indeed , is the best way to understand of what Ellison , Lewis and the other sponsors of their bill proposing , the connection back to a very American idea .
Despite the setbacks , the unions suffered in the past few years - in Wisconsin , Michigan and other States across the country - Americans have encouraged once countries all over the world , to recognise labour rights to extend and maintain .
There was a time that millions of Americans still remember when this country was called democracy , freedom of speech , freedom of the press and the right to organise in the same breath .
When after the second world war , Japan occupied the United States , General Douglas MacArthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a Constitution that should ensure that the militarized autocracy would be replaced by democracy Hedki Tojo .
Knowing full well , that the workers and their unions in the creation of a new Japan assumed a role , she used a language that explicitly recognized that `` the rights of workers on Union and joint negotiation and action are guaranteed . ''
As the United States occupy Germany after World War II , General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a Constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler 's fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy .
Should , in recognition of the fact that the workers would need to organise and raise their voice in the new nation the Germans added a clause which explicitly stated : `` guarantees the right to form associations is the working and economic conditions to secure and improve each and every trade or business .
Agreements that restrict this right or aiming to reduce it are null and void ; that targeted measures are illegal .
As the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt held the chairmanship of the International Commission on human rights , was designed by the Universal Declaration of human rights as adopted in 1948 by the United Nations as a global agreement , Roosevelt and the other authors guarantees added , that `` everyone has the right to form trade unions for the protection of his interests or to join them . ''
For generations , Americans the basic premise accept that labour rights are human rights .
As this country advised other countries as one could form a civil and democratic societies , Americans declared that the right to form a Union - and that the Union should - then participate in collective bargaining as equal partner with companies and Government agencies must be protected .
After these rights came under attack in America it is indeed wise to lead the American ideal in mind , as a result , workers have the right to unite and to get heard in a free and open society .
As pastor said fifty years ago , Martin Luther King Jr. :
The history is a great teacher .
Now everyone knows that the labour movement not restricted the strength of the nation , but increased it .
By raising the living standards of millions of people , work miraculously has created a market for the industry and raised the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production .
Those who attack the work , forget these simple truths , but the story keeps them .
The story recalls , and we should do that .
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil liberties as protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representatives - is long overdue .
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals which largely did America in the past and broke up the promise of democracy .

China denies Hong Kong right to choice of Government , demonstrators sworn vengeance
On Sunday the Chinese Parliament despite of the increased calls decided after democratic reforms against the nomination of candidates for the elections 2017 by the electorate of Hong Kong .
This approach probably fired the long announced protests in Hong Kong 's business district , while activists to led the planning and mobilization within a few hours after the announcement in the way .
The decision of the Chinese people 's Congress generally allows the Communist leaders to reject all candidates not loyal to Beijing .
`` This is not unexpected , but it makes us yet angry , '' legal expert Emily said LAU , Chairman of the Democratic Party .
That 's not what Beijing had promised .
You lied to the people of Hong Kong .
And it is clear that we have to do it with an authoritarian regime .
In his defense of the Chinese decision said Li Fei , Vice Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the national of people 's Congress , that the approval of public nominations in the elections for the Hong Kong Government would be to `` messy '' .
Since 1997 , when Great Britain control over Hong Kong back the Chinese , Beijing has promised to let the inhabitants from 2017 choose chaired Government .
China 's leaders presented the decision on Sunday as a democratic breakthrough , because there is a direct right to vote to citizens of Hong Kong , but the decision also makes it clear , that the Chinese leadership retains the flow through a Nominating Committee controlled closely by Beijing firmly in hand .
To allow only candidates `` with love for the country and love Hong Kong '' after a new clause .
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and due protests in Hong Kong were held for many years .
Behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong , the movement stands occupy Central with love and peace , whose Organisatoren have threatened to seal off the financial district , if Beijing allows no real universal suffrage .
On Sunday evening , hundreds of occupy Central trailers in the rain in front of the Government Headquarters in Hong Kong had gathered within hours of the announcement .
During the demonstration , the organizers said that their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience and protest waves , they planned in the coming weeks .
You made this apparently to avoid problems with the authorities , but no further details .
In an online message informed the organizers that the movement `` the occupation of the Central District only as a last resort drew , an action that should only take place if all chances of dialogue have been exhausted and there is no other choice .
Sorry to have to say that today all chances of dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of the Central District will definitely take place .
The authorities in Hong Kong have prepared for days to Beijing 's announcement , and there were stricter security measures including police and barricades on Sunday in front of the Government building .
The riots are reinforced by the feeling of many in Hong Kong , that they slowly lose control over their city .
The influx of people from the Mainland increased the competition for products and services .
Also , the fear that the values begin to erode Hong Kong as democracy and freedom of speech under growing pressure from Beijing is growing .
Some criticized the demonstrations of the occupy Central movement , because it threatens the business - the lifeline of Hong Kong - .
`` The protests , of which they speak , could cause major economic damage , depending on how many are involved in and how long they last , '' said legal expert Regine Ip , who criticized the movement for a long time .
We want to incite any fears that Hong Kong gets out of control .
This impression is bad for investment .
China 's State-controlled media also recently reported the democracy activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western powers .
This summer , activists organized an unofficial referendum to the discretions which 780,000 people attended - more than one-fifth of the voters in Hong Kong .
In July , tens of thousands in one of the largest democracy demonstrations in the history of the region took part .

`` Today 's decision means that the women in Louisiana escaped a sneaky law that them want to take their health and their rights , '' said Nancy Northup , President and Chairman of the Center for reproductive rights , which had sued on behalf of three of the five hospitals in the State to stop the law .
It was not immediately clear whether the judgment also on the doctors from the two hospitals stretched , who had not joined the lawsuit and also applied for admission rights .
Louisiana is one of 11 States that have enacted similar laws , courts have recently declared such measures in Alabama and Mississippi for unconstitutional .
Key points of a law in Texas that would have forced most of the hospitals in the State to close , were stopped by a federal judge on Friday .
Abortion advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists , and the American Medical Association say unanimously that permit rights require unnecessary restrictions by doctors .
Abortion opponents argue that the measures serve the protection of women 's health , though some welcomed the impact of the closure of clinics .
Only a doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana , has patient a banksman privileges , said the Center for reproductive rights .
If all other doctors in the State are forced to perform no more abortions , this doctor out of fear would no longer perform the operation for his safety , the group said .
In her arguments against the verdict , representatives of the State of Louisiana said that they would punish doctors for performing abortions , while their patient banksman real applications were still pending .

Pull the Castle clubs soon back together ?
Last , there was strife between the two Wolfratshauser Castle clubs again and again .
Now think the Board members about a possible collaboration .
As a model for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser Castle of the late Richard Dimbath , former Chairman led the Wolfratshauser Castle friends , the project in the French Guédelon .
A year ago , there was a not a good climate between the Association of the Castle and the Castle friends Wolfratshausen .
The views of how the story should be dealt with the Wolfratshauser Castle and a possible reconstruction seemed very different so far .
Now the two sides are moving each other : it talks about a common approach to be taken soon .
Board members Torsten Sjöberg ( Castle Association ) and Herbert Piffl ( Castle friends ) confirm that demand our newspaper .
`` I have phoned Mr Piffl and suggested that we once could sit down together , '' reported Sjöberg .
All members of both clubs could pull his opinion in the future again together .
Faster visible results can be so recorded .
While the castle 's friends to the suddenly departed Richard Dimbath had a reconstruction of the castle on the mountain forest in the eye until the last minute , the `` development and experience bar making '' the grounds at the forefront stands for the Castle Club to Sjöberg .
Herbert Piffl , second of Chairman of the friends of the Castle , has delighted according to own statements about the call .
Since Dimbaths death , he faces the Castle friends .
A new President is to be found in mid-September at a General Assembly .
Currently is one of the association according to the 74 around 40 members .
`` After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath have we let the club activities out of respect at first '' . This `` thinking '' phase may have been necessary , `` to consider how it could continue '' .
According to Pak , the new Chairman should then go into the conversation with the Castle Club .
Until then the castle 's friends could make a current mood image within their grouping .
Pak says , there is no a candidate for the Presidency at the moment yet .
`` But I 'm confident that someone will find '' . He himself will not run because he takes up residence in bad Tölz .
The new Chairman should be a Wolfratshauser .
The Tölzer wanted work on the project `` but very happy to continue with '' .
The different points of view in terms of reconstruction will remain in the eyes of Piffls probably in the near future .
It commends Dimbath as a `` Missionary '' , who always believed that the reconstruction of the Castle .
Two similar , already far advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is no pie in the sky .
Through a high level of participation of the population as well as volunteers from all over the world to be a tourist magnet .
Pak : `` I was skeptical at the beginning .
But in the course of time I have come more and more to the conviction , that it makes sense to promote the project . A `` unique selling proposition '' for the city of rafters could be created .
There 's nothing else here .
Moreover , the project through EU grants , tickets for visitors and potential sponsors would be fundable , believes Pak .
`` I want to personally therefore not simply jettisoning the idea of reconstruction '' . He hoped that maybe something that moves the Castle Club in this point .
Aimed initially to document the history , `` is important and good . ''

Feminists criticize race question and police behaviour after Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was earlier this month by a police officer in Ferguson mo . killed .
The participants raised their hands in the air and sang `` Hands high , do n't shoot '' , while they waited for the funeral .
After two-week protests in Ferguson , MO , due to the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown the Bloggerin Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists .
According to their experience , white feminist commentators put the sex before the race when it comes to speak right of reproduction , and income inequality .
While tensions in the Midwest but rose , and received attention across the country , Perez saw that the responses of white women turned to 100 % to the breed .
The personal essays with titles like `` Thoughts on Ferguson by a white woman '' and `` Feminism is not just about the oppression of women '' came relatively late compared with the responses of black women shortly after the shooting down of 9 August .
But for Perez , that meant an important change .
`` I do n't think that one finds many people in feminism , be about the white and privileges so high-class way to speak , '' she said .
The people felt constrained to express something to the incidents to .
It is characteristic of the crisis in which we find ourselves and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnicized , that they need to express .
For English Professor Koritha Mitchell of the Ohio State University , Ferguson brought problems to light , black Americans are exposed to every day , but not considered `` Women 's issues '' in the cultural sphere .
`` I can post something funny on Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 likes from anywhere , '' Mitchell said .
If I post something about how Blacks are under siege in their own country , the silence is deafening .
`` How it can be safe for women to not speak , but security in public spaces in public about a relationship ? '' she asked .
For black women like Mitchell , who have studied racial , gender , and sexuality in the history of the United States , there is no dichotomy between racial and gender issues .
For them , black women have had the luxury , clean to separate the topics ; they live every day in the combined reality .
While white women now connect the topics of race and gender in the feminist Mainstreamkreisen , Angela Hattery , Professor of women and gender studies at George Mason University , says that its predecessors did the opposite .
`` At least 10,000 black men were lynched between 1865 and 1890 and the reasoning was almost always the rape of a white woman , '' said hattery .
White women had to be involved in the story to justify the lynching .
For Hattery came the division between white and black women to the point where white fighters for women 's suffrage as Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late years of the 19th century and noted that the fight for the right to vote only for a group of each could be successful : women or blacks .
`` Made a decision to put women 's suffrage , and the right to vote for black should come later , '' said hattery .
If you remember such things , one realises one with power , why women of color do not trust white women .
We have done our job not well .
We have helped never black women , to protect their husbands and sons .
Even after women received the right to vote in 1920 , it took even a decade for organized themselves to white women against the lynching in the Association of southern woman for the prevention of lynching .
The Group was created almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women , says Mitchell .
Mitchell is the flood of white feminist responses to by Ferguson that black women apart contact questions raised - police behavior , racial discrimination - a mirror of the time in which white feminists played `` Catch '' with problems , for generations .
`` It not great if the right to education of a child , the activists , the platforms feminist about such traditional have to take seriously what they do with the right to birth control ? '' asked Mitchell .
Feminists of the second generation , who built their careers on the struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraceptive means , try to understand what that means .
The well-known white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown on Facebook and a pointed articles by Rebecca Carroll , columnist of the guardian , in which it demands more protests by white Americans on the topic of racism .
`` I hope that women who have a different , but parallel reason to understand a danger inherent in the body - and opinions about the breed , which are distinctly different in public polls -- will lead the changes , '' Steinem wrote .
Although Steinem stands for a rather intersectional feminism , addressed in the racial as well as gender issues , are some of their comments on the subject of race in America , but baffled .
Christina summer , researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of `` who stole feminism ? '' compared to she the people said that young men in the United States , in particular young coloured men , `` are far more vulnerable than their sisters , '' but Steinems comments to Ferguson stand in contrast to their earlier criticism .
There are hundreds of special programs for girls and young women , but almost nothing for boys now .
But as the White House recently a small program , my brother keeper , put it on , to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men , there were angry reactions by many feminists , including Gloria Steinem .
The ratio of police to the black community is not the only problem that is pushing to the fore of the Mainstreamfeminismus .
After the US border police has picked up almost 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the southwestern border of the country this year , the issue of immigration reform has re-emerged on the surface - this time as a women 's issue .
Andrea Mercado , co Chairman of we belong together , mobilized an organization , women for immigration reform , said that for a revisiting of the issue as an important women 's issue she must publish only the stories of immigrant women .
`` They speak for themselves , '' said Mercado .
If the vast majority of male immigrants work visas , are the women who support them in a position where they are vulnerable to abuse and exploitation .
`` These stories will find a finish in the women 's organizations , '' she said .

Lenny Henry : my father never took me in the arm .
Never said `` I love you ''
Henry was one of seven children in a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958 .
His father , who died when was Henry 19 , worked in a factory , and their relationship was limited .
Henry rehearsing it for a comedy , Rudy 's rare records , partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father , emerged from the series on Radio 4 .
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap , with lively melodies .
But Henry had to work through some difficult moments of childhood .
`` Many '' therapies he visited after the death of his mother , and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship to his father .
It was hard to know .
You never saw his face , hear his voice : `` stop the noise .
Leave your sister alone .
Move it !
I want to watch cricket .
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who already grow up were when I was a kid – went with him to the pub and talked about things like the shape of the glass of beer or the beauty of a Cricketschlags .
I never had such a conversation with him .
He was a big part of my life that serious guy in the corner , read the newspaper .
Recently , Henry opened a foundry in Dudley , and although the conditions are better than they were during his father 's , he won but insight into how life for him may have been .
It is now lighter , but they are dark , smoky , deep Stygian mazes with bursts of flame and smoke , and lots of carbon .
My father earlier just lay down in the tub and then you could hear him slowly as he to sing started because he could wash the Foundry itself .
As I walked around there , I realized he had done that for many years to bring the food on the table , and my respect for him grew .
However , Henry as a child without affection of his parents grew up .
My father never hugged me , he never said `` I love you '' .
Only when it went bad my mother at the end of their lives , we began to say `` I love you , I love you , I love you '' .
By his own daughter Billie , with Dawn French , he could share the love that he had missed as a child .
Could you time with the `` I love you '' stop ?
Stop hugging me !
Dad , I 'm 22 !
with Dawn French .
Why should we be friends ?
She is a great mother .
It is still a friend of French , with which he was married 25 years .
Dawn is a good man .
Why should we be friends ?
She is a great mother .
Henry 's own mother was diabetic .
This contributed to her death .
When I was so very , very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes , my doctor said `` you need to be radical .
So I pulled out this fitness thing and had to also a drastic diet , to reverse the symptoms .
It is very difficult .
And it is exhausting .
No one likes to eat carrots .
Henry 's career change is perhaps reflected in his elegant , close-cropped beard .
Since he was praised by the critics for his Othello , he is engrossed by the theatre .
This was followed by the comedy of errors , and then fences by August Wilson .
This is a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that have filled out his busy working life .
He started with only 16 years ago , when he worked in a factory .
A DJ discovered him on stage as he imitated people and wrote about him on new faces .
His television career began in the mid of 1970s . `` I was the only black impersonator/comedian in television for a long , long time . ''
He learned in the profession .
I had to grow not only in front of the eyes of the public , but also from 1975 to 1985 learn how I could become an efficient jokes tell machine while I through television was a star , and it was really difficult .
Lenny 1975 when new faces
Manager be the stage right on the black and white minstrel show had , Henry his comedy light entertainment , where people `` black painted on '' , performed there over five years .
That was my family very uncomfortable .
I kinda wish that it never would have happened , but I do not regret I did it .
It was a strange , uncomfortable position for me , but I worked on big projects and learned how to deal with a large audience .
But this 'years of award-winning light pillar of British television ' was also a `` grotesque parody of black people . ''
With the introduction of characters , the British black culture both mocked as celebrated , Henry worked in the 1980s to an alternate Comedykreis .
The first series of the Lenny Henry show in 1984 went on the air , and in the nineties he was Chief among the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series ! known .
His next decade dominated advertising , documentaries , TV series and film roles , but after his BBC series , he thought LennyHenry.tv 2008 : `` what are you doing next , Len , because it feels everything , as you bring out only the time or step a little on the spot . ''
Then there came a documentary series for Radio 4 entitled what so great about ... ?
The first episode is turned to Shakespeare .
I was literally allergic to Shakespeare .
I had never really learned something about him at school and kept him mostly for a domain of middle-class , white tights and a cabbage in front .
So I had great fear before .
All those we interviewed for the show , Peter Hall , Trevor Nunn , Adrian Lester , Judi Dench said `` you should try it .
Do n't do it badly , if you do n't know what you are talking about .
Take a few of the words in his mouth , and then you will understand why we so love all Shakespeare .
Henry performed 20 rows from Othellos last speech for the documentary and he was thrilled .
I had the feeling that I could do this .
It was almost , as if someone had set up right the head me .
`` It comes it 's a serious thing , she take this seriously , learn your lines , research a bit . ''
The samples were brutal , and I read this piece for months before we made it .
And it was a success .
They seemed to expect a car accident , and that just did n't happen .
And soon he appeared in the comedy of errors .
I was suddenly in the national theatre and I could hardly believe it .
There was a moment when I thought , `` Oh , you 've changed . '' ``
There was a technical error and Henry felt instinctively that he had entertained the audience .
`` A little voice told me '' You need to bypass now 10 minutes while they repair the computer . '' ''
Instead , the stage manager announced that the idea of were to continue , as soon as the problem had been solved .
I went from the stage and something in me said `` Oh , thank God '' .
I am not responsible .
I can leave that to someone else .
`` You play in a play , so stay in your role . ''
Henry in fences at the Duchess Theatre
It was challenging to learn the text for fences .
Panic is very good , that strengthens the tendons .
This was well received , so it 's like a large sign of the gods , telling me `` This is your destiny . '' ``
He says this , of course , with a THUNDERING voice .
So I stick to it .
I really love that .
I love to be in a rehearsal room .
Henry has still the head of a comedian - our conversation is traversed by humorous outbursts , while he imitates people again and again .
I decided to make no stand-up comedy , because I find that this kind of instant gratification by a room full of strangers is somehow dangerous .
If you are looking for all the time that , it drives it against a wall .
I perform sometimes live at the Apollo , if I want to , but overall it gives me not so much as before .
I ask him whether he will make ever again a stand Comedytour .
The fun I have in a room with a Director , which helps to shape a beginning , a middle , and the end of a trip - I do n't think that I ever want to give up .
So here is his new incarnation ?
I think so .
I 'm like an actor .
It 's fun .
It always is a story , and that 's great .
I love stories .
People love stories .

Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas in the vicinity of the Gaza Strip returned in the schools on Monday , after they had spent the summer in population during rocket and mortar attacks on their communities during the CAI war between Israel and Hamas went down and the schools in Gaza remained closed while the area recovering from the fighting .
The school launch brought a sense of joy and expectation of the communities in southern of Israel from rocket bullet hole drawn , but the character of the battles are still fresh .
In the southern city of Ashdod , employee of the `` Pashosh '' remote-kindergarten , which was hit by a rocket , before the arrival of students shrapnel from the walls and sliding .
`` We are a little afraid , but are excited , '' Ronit said beard , resident in the kibbutz Saad and local English teacher .
Many children from our area need to return to a routine .
Her 11 year old daughter Shani , Bart said it felt `` a little weird '' to go back to school .
`` Those were difficult times , and we went out of the House at all , '' she said .
President Reuven Rivlin visited the kibbutz near the border with Gaza , to offer his support .
Until a cease-fire last week interrupted the war left thousands of residents of border communities such as Saad in their homes or abandoned their homes to move to safer areas further away from Gaza and to avoid the rocket and mortar fire .
Many residents of Nahal Oz , a community near the border with Gaza , where a 4th boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar shell , hesitate with the return .
The Ministry of Education informed , about a dozen families had still not returned .
Their children were housed temporarily in other schools .
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanjahu visited a school in Sderot , a border town to Gaza , which is heavily drawn from the Palestinian fire .
He urged the children to learn a lot and said `` we will ensure that you gain knowledge and offer you safety . ''
Israel and Hamas agreed on a unbefristeteten ceasefire last Tuesday .
The ceasefire provided for an immediate end to the fighting ; important problems remain unresolved , however , as the demand of Hamas for the lifting of the Israeli Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of the air and sea ports in Gaza .
Israel calls for disarming Hamas and the handing over of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting .
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin this month in Egypt .
During the war more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed , three-quarters of them civilians , and at least 494 children according to estimates of the Palestinians and the UN .
Israel denies this information and estimates that at least half of those killed are militants , presented but no concrete evidence for this information .
66 soldiers and six civilians , including a Thai worker were killed on the Israeli side .
Hamas and other militants in Gaza 4,591 rockets and mortar shells fired during the fighting on Israeli towns and cities , most of them in the South of the country .
Meanwhile , the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks .
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in the Gaza area and about 250,000 people took refuge , have been converted into temporary shelters in more than 100 UN schools .
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the shelters and the fighting persists , the education authorities last week moved the beginning of the school year .
`` I hope the school is reopened soon , so that we can further learn like the children in the world and the Jewish children , '' said Mohammad Amara , a 13 year old boy , who currently lives in a school in Gaza City .

Amazon buys twitch for 1.04 billion $
AMAZON has just confirmed what had reported information on Monday morning : online retailers - and video producer , and a variety of other things - buys the Videostreamingdienst twitch for 1.04 billion $ ( 970 million US $ ) .
The announcement comes surprisingly , not because nobody had expected a takeover by twitch , but because it has been widely suggested that YouTube would acquire the company .
Three months ago , it looked as the sale of twitch to the video service from Google for a cool billion done deal , and the cooperation appeared too of course .
Twitch , founded only three years ago when Justin.tv was started as a common streaming service - a live version of YouTube .
Instead it quickly became a platform for players who wanted their bravura pieces in games published a `` YouTube for live games '' , as an insider .
The twitch interface .
And `` let it play '' , a genre of video in the know-it-all to a painting by secret science Theatre the ( mostly older ) games are already popular on YouTube .
It is just so that YouTube often called somewhat bored , if one wants to describe twitch , so the news that YouTube twitch wanted to buy , was recorded , a textbook example of an established technology company that buys up a potential competitor .
It is a mystery why the deal with YouTube came because the company was reportedly willing to pay as much as Amazon .
All we know at the moment about it , is this statement by Emmet shear , President of twitch : `` We have for Amazon decided , because they believe in our community , they share our values and our long-term visions and they want to help us to get there faster . ''
Another secret to the incredible success of twitch is , frankly .
For snobs like me , explaining that they prefer sports as watching , it is hard to understand the attraction that goes to watch others playing rather than take even the control console in the hand .
It is one thing to watch a friend while she sneaks through resident evil , and something else , is shot at 3 in the morning over the shoulder to watch a spinner it like 20 times consecutively in the call of duty in the head .
You could see all these games right now .
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games , so the watch without their own control over the perspective of views can be a really good recipe for headaches .
I admit that the quick passes to the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age complete entire games in record time , are entertaining .
But as long as it is not a game - or humor virtuoso , his twitch channel is probably not so very interesting .
But skeptics like I already know what ?
Twitch is called by 55 million different visitors a month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic peaks .
And how exactly will Amazon make money from it ?
It 's hard to imagine that twitch is so elegantly integrated into Amazon instant video as YouTube twitch would have to swallow easily .
But twitch has what any company would like : thousands of young men who are being wooed as advertisers .
As the Chairman of twitch , shear , said Amazon and twitch `` believe both on the future of gaming '' , and the media does n't even - shows no signs of shrinking , swallow - as a spectator sport .

4 tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you would like to make photos or videos under water , there is a selection of devices .
The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot , such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam like the GoPro Hero3 + Silver Edition , both for about $ 300 to have .
I this photos at a family feast with multiple cameras recorded , all that at a price of under $ 350 are available .
Regardless of the equipment , there are a few rules for the best results .
Inspect your equipment twice .
Even if you have a waterproof camera , make sure that the battery compartment and other subjects are tightly closed .
Set your camera on the photos or videos that you want to record .
Some cameras and camcorders feature scenes and shooting modes , which optimizes the exposure for the gloomy underwater conditions .
And before you jump in , make sure your equipment is functional in what depth .
Some cameras are approved only for up to 5 feet , others up to 50 or 60 feet .
Search in our buyer 's Guide and the reviews for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models .
Take multiple pictures - because many will not work .
Point and shoot cameras do not have action cams a LCD , with which you can compose images , usually .
Even if you have an LCD , it is difficult to see this under water , and the right image is a matter of luck .
So you make a lot of shots .
If your camera has a series mode , with the made a series of recordings with slightly different exposure settings , you use it .
Remain close to the surface .
The light is dramatically worse , the further you move away from the surface .
If possible stay so close to the surface , if you shoot in a pool , a lake or the sea .
As a result , you can bring more color in your photos . the deeper you go , you will see the less color .
Close approach to the objects .
This is good advice even on land , but he is all the more important because of the poor light conditions under water .
It is particularly important , if you are working with an action cam : these devices often have a fixed wide-angle lens , which means that you need closer to your objects used when they should fill out the entire picture frame .

Kenya registered officials to curb `` Ghost employees ''
Kenya has begun to register all State officials to remove `` Ghost employees '' from the payrolls of Government biometrically .
Employees who do not register in the next two weeks , would no longer be paid , was a Government communication .
The Government believed that thousands of people receive more salary payments even after their departure from the public service .
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised when he took office to 2013 to combat corruption in the public service .
During a test at the beginning of this year , it was found that at least 1 million $ ( £700,000 ) lost a month on payments for `` Ghost employees '' and other abusive financial practices .
Wanyama Chebusiri reported the Government suspected that salaries continue to be paid on accounts , after a person has died or leaving the public service , for the BBC from the capital Nairobi .
All officials must appear in the next two weeks at identification centres , to ensure that their data via the biometric registration are recorded , was communicated in a Government message .
All who would not do this without a credible excuse would be slashed from the payroll , the release was further .
`` Through this approach is contributed to the rationalization of the public service , by the actual number of civil servants is determined and the content list on both levels of Government will be adjusted – so the '' ghost employees '' are eliminated , '' said Anne Waiguru , the Cabinet Secretary at the Ministry of decentralization and planning .

Production in the euro zone to a 13-month low
The increase in the production in the euro zone slowed in August to the lowest point in the last 13 months , according to a closely watched study with .
The final Markit purchasing managers index of manufacturing ( PMI ) fell in August to 50.7 , according to a State of 51.8 in July .
An indication of 50 indicates an expansion .
New orders declined and factories experienced burglaries at a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia via the Ukraine .
The numbers arrive before the meeting of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) on Thursday .
The markets expect a clear plan for dealing with a hesitant recovery in the euro zone , as well as for the impending deflation with an inflation rate of only 0.3 % from the Bank .
There is speculation that the head of the ECB , Mario Draghi , in the course of this week further information could make , if he pulls a quantitative easing for the euro area into account , according to those who have been made by the United Kingdom and the United States during the financial crisis .
`` Although a small growth is better than no growth , the braking effects of the increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties for manufacturers were clear , '' said Rob Dobson , Senior Economist at Markit .
The factory PMI for Germany , the biggest trading partner of Russia in the EU fell to the lowest level in 11 months with 51.4 .
In the meantime , the PMI on 46.9 fell in the second largest economy of the bloc , France .
France remains a concern , such as the descent of Italy by a solid expansion to stagnation .
Evidence that incentives for growth in the key industrial mechanism in Germany as well as in Spain and the Netherlands no longer have access , are also not reassuring , `` Mr Dobson said .
The decline in the industry probably fuels the fire of the analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal incentives .
A positive message came from the Republic of Ireland , where the PMI rose to 57.3 , the highest level since the end of 1999 .
Howard Archer , Chief Economist at IHS global insight , said : `` The best thing you can say for the purchasing managers index of manufacturing in the euro zone by August , is that after the sector continues to grow . ''
He added : `` manufacturers in the eurozone find life currently obviously quite difficult because the current heightened geopolitical tensions - especially in Russia and the Ukraine - increase uncertainties in the ongoing difficult conditions in many countries .
This increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular , and the confidence of consumers , and causes probably that some orders are delayed or even cancelled , especially large orders .
He said that there would be `` increasingly likely '' that the ECB finally must initiate a kind of QE , `` even though we suspect that this will be limited . ''

Why `` Guardians of the Galaxy '' was not a box-office hit
`` The expendables 3 '' by Sylvester Stallone played less than $ 30 million of his $ 90 million budget in the United States , while `` Sin City : A Dame to kill for '' grossed only $ 12 million in its budget of $ 70 million .
The film tailored to Cameron Diaz `` sex tape '' grossed only $ 14.6 million on the opening weekend , while disappoint children 's films such as `` train your Dragon 2 made easy '' also in revenue .
An article in the Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that , when the children 's films , the lack of quality of the movies themselves could be the reason .
Collin described 2014 as `` the worst year '' so far for children 's films , and described `` train your Dragon 2 made easy '' as a purely `` functional '' fantasy sequel .
Films for a slightly older audience , it seems so , as if the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem .
In July , entertainment weekly compared the average cinema score and Metacritic rating for any summer film release which was shown between the American Memorial Day and July 20 , 2013 , and in the current year to at least 2000 screens .
The results are based on the opinions of movie-goers and film critic and indicate that the year 's blockbuster are equivalent to those of last year .
Some commentators think that the development is due to changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of Web-streaming services like Netflix .
Director Jon Favreau , who is currently working on Disney 's Jungle Book soon to be released film , told the Web site Hollywood Reporter : `` I think the times are changing . ''
We must accept that and not try to follow the past .
In contrast to the currently weak box office results of the Hollywood productions Netflix achieved sales recently with the streaming content in the amount of $ 1.2 billion , almost twice as much as last year , in which sales amounted to $ 837 million .
Last summer , criticized Director Steven Spielberg , the movie studios that they concentrated too much on film adaptations of comics and predicted a `` meltdown '' of Hollywood .
Seen in the light of the current downturn , some commentators argue that his gloomy prophecy could certainly contain a true nucleus .
Because of the expected the summer 2015 potential box-office hit , including Avengers : Age of Ultron , minions and Jurassic World but more optimistic are other representatives of the film industry :
The producer of X-men , Simon Kinberg , described the decline in box office results recently as simple `` cyclical '' and told Hollywood Reporter : `` the next summer will be the biggest summer at the box office at all , and nobody will see it more to the business concerns . ''

`` The achievement was terribly important , '' confirmed captain and goalscorer Steffen Hofmann , who pushed three green white square .
Schrammel dream gate brings rapid rapid on road to victory has shown the right response to the disappointment against Helsinki with the second victory of the season and goes with a sense of achievement in the international break .
`` We wanted to show a positive reaction , '' said Defender Thomas Schrammel , which has paved the way to victory , with his magnificent leadership volley from the corner of sixteen er , in the 14 minute .
`` I thought , I 'm the whole frustration Thursday in and smacked it under the crossbar '' , the 26-year-old said smiling .
Sajith 2010 met Novmember on the 13th for the most recent time in a Bundesliga game , was still for Ried .
The first championship match in the rapid dress will remain him in special memory .
`` It 's something special for me , I 'm from the rapid young , '' SAJI said .
Due to the short-term pool damage by Mario Pavelic , moved from the left to the right side of the defensive Schrammel and did also very well his thing .
He has enough experience that he can exert this position also mirrored .
He deserved the goal , he has done this year quite a few assists , '' praised Barisic .
Team shows character Schrammel supplied also the flank to 2-0 by Hofmann after over an hour , that finally brought the decision .
Because before that , also the guests could have written on .
`` Thank God we have had the luck today , '' remarked also Schrammel thus played on the gap of performance and results in the past few weeks : `` the results have not voted , but playfulness was always good in comparison to last year '' .
Baboo was even , that `` in many games previously better than today '' -- been against `` the strongest team that has played in this season in this stadium '' .
The first Dreipunkter since 26 July have therefore proved that the setbacks despite the team structure was intact : `` Today my team has shown that it has character '' .
For him no less gratifying : `` That we finally return to zero have played '' .
Much work do even more valuable during international break also the fact that with Brian Behrendt , Mario Pavelic , Christopher Dibon , Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger several failures to complain , and Srdjan Grahovac , Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger gave their starting team debuts , the victory .
`` You must remember this '' , warned Baboo , who lost in the last three days with Behrendt and Pavelic players , `` who were very stable lately '' .
The international break must therefore be used `` wounds to lick and to put a little bit in terms of physical '' , explained Baboo , who has five U21 selection players in its ranks .
One , the break is probably particularly situated , is Captain Hofmann .
He rips the team , goes beyond pain about it .
He has shown in this severe phase , that he is a very important player for us '' , noted Barisic .
Hofmann gave not only the structure the game of rapids before his substitution in the 68th minute , but scored the second gate .
For the 33-year old , who completed his 350 League match , it was the first hit of the game since 2 November 2013 ( 4:2 on the Admira ) .
Hofmann : `` must not think that now everything is good '' `` we have had also a bit of luck , but sometime the luck must come back to us .
Now it was '' high time , Hofmann said .
He warned however to concentrated work : `` you may see not always black and white .
We have not so bad played in recent weeks , as it has been portrayed .
We may not believe but also that now all is well .
He could not deny the importance of his role for the team .
It is a very young team , which at the moment I can greatly help .
That stop at certain stages in me '' , said Hofmann .
Grödig coach Michael Baur had little to throw himself and his team .
He regretted the quick goals `` of the category magic gate '' , as well as the regular gate by net in the 40th minute , which was been wrongly stripped from referee Kollegger .
The only criticism I can make the team is that we were not concrete enough towards the goal in several phases .
Because we have had too little financial statements .
It was similar to the Defender Maximilian Karner : `` it started equally bad , then we have found but pure and made even a goal .
On the whole , more would have been .

Matthies says : time to large networking
In the face of galloping technological progress , which threatens to transform our comfortable home in high-tech switchboards , our columnist Bernd Matthies with a very familiar electronic accessories consoles himself .
As I write this , my views of the spiral cable that connects the phone to the handset , falls , and I think : Wow , like retro is this ?
But behind a consideration : If the cable would not be all listeners would fly around in no time even in the House , and that would be much more retro .
Already applies to the ekeltronischen ( ekeltronischen ?
No , typo : electronic ) sector the rule that the novelty of today of electric scrap tomorrow is bought - out of date .
And who today still a CRT TVs in the living room , which merely says that he basically rejects television .
Which is why these considerations ?
Because the urge at the IFA at the radio tower again our absolute incompetence in issues of electronics in mind leads us this week .
The layman , formerly blind dominated washing machine and CD player , today not even understands the purpose of the devices , which are laid out with incredibly vain expert before him : `` connected home , wearables , health care and urban technologies '' the press office have been promised .
Yes , it 's yet ?
What should you talk about with people who apparently voluntarily spread such Quark ?
Basically it comes for about 20 years in particular that we should link our House back .
So that the yogurt even reordered so that the fire detectors in the holiday in the Maldives tells us that it just burns in the work room .
And it would be wonderful if we from the Office the air conditioner on our early arrival ... ?
Yes , but this assumes an air conditioning .
But will very certainly soon : you say we lift our wristwatch , according to `` Sucking ! '' - and home moves the dust vacuuming robot .
Astray .
All amounts to nothing less than a revolution : `` Blur the boundaries between white and Brown goods '' , whispering an industry insider , the washing machine can be combined with a headset , the steamer sent the weather report and displays the data glasses , how long the pizza in the oven still needs , but what is useless , because we are in a traffic jam .
We also know from daily practice : If times really urgently needed a fancy device , the battery is guaranteed empty .
What is another reason that the spiral cable on the phone will survive the next radio exhibitions .

Tax burden of businessmen in the Washington area increases with economic recovery
A recovery of the economy means more customers , more sales and new jobs .
It means higher taxes .
State and local tax bills for companies in the country increased slightly last year , while the economic recovery accelerated , according to a newly released study in the past week , and the company made no exception in the Washington area .
Companies in the space district , Maryland and 27.6 billion paid Virginia together $ on State and local authorities in the financial year 2013 , an increase of 3.8 percent over the revenue by 2012 in $ 26.6 billion $ .
The State and local tax burden of companies rose last year by 4.3 percent to 671 billion $ on , compared to 3.9 per cent in the year before , and it was the third consecutive year of growth after several years of declining notices in 2009 and 2010 .
State taxes rose more than the local taxes by 4.3 percent , according to the study , which was conducted by the service agency Ernst & Young with the Centre for state taxation , a tax policy group .
More than half of the tax revenues of the district , 56 percent , comes from corporate taxes , while 36 percent of Maryland 's revenue comes from businesses .
Virginia scored the lowest tax revenues from companies with 28 percent .
A large part of the increase in revenue is due to a recovery of the real estate assets of the companies , say the researchers , which led to an increase of in real estate taxes 3.7 percent this year after three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent .
While a large part of these gains came from large States like California , New York and Texas , the procedure also for the Washington area seems to apply .
Companies in the district , Maryland and Virginia together over 10 billion paid $ on State and local real estate taxes last year , compared with 9.6 billion $ 2012 - an increase in the course of one year by 4.2 percent .
But the apparent recovery in the real estate values is not as effective in improving State and local tax revenue in Maryland , because here the real estate taxes on slightly more than one-fifth of the tax assessment notices from companies amounted to .
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their State and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes .
`` In Maryland , the following occurs : a large part of real estate , particularly in the tax area around D.C. , is either owned by the Government or by non-profits , that pay no property taxes , '' said Douglas Lindholm , Managing Director of the Center on State taxation .
Maryland is therefore forced to rely to provide the same services that offer other States , for example , much more on income taxes .
The recent recovery in the tax revenue from companies can be expected to not only the recovery of the real estate market
Corporate earnings seem also to recover the data .
Companies in the region reported income taxes for State organizations of 2.3 billion $ compared to 2.1 billion in 2012 .
Maryland took 1 billion $ a in corporate income tax , the highest amount in the region .
While the trend in the same direction , the local tax burden on companies in all three places rises evenly .
The increase rate in the district was with 4.3 percent national average , while the rise in Maryland was significantly higher , 4.9 percent .
Virginia reported a below-average tax revenue by 4.1 percent .
Virginia has the significantly lowest corporate income tax with 6 percent in all three areas of the Office ( in all three , there are fixed corporate tax rate ) .
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is relatively high 9,975 percent at 8.25 percent and in the district .
A comparable study of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that Virginia require less State and local business taxes and overall a better tax climate than in Maryland .
The district was not examined in the study .
Despite the advantages , Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbour .
North Carolina has adopted the same set as Virginia laws to reduce its corporate tax rate this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent , and the rate will fall next year to 5 percent .
If the State still achieves its goals of income in the coming year , this law could reduce the corporate income tax rate of the State until 2017 at 3 % .
In the meantime , it seems better to go the small businesses in the Washington area , and they pay so more State and local taxes , according to the latest study .
Corporate taxes that is paid in personal income taxes by small businessmen - a transition structure , according to the most small businesses are organized - in the district , Maryland and Virginia rose last year by 20 percent to 2.4 billion $ at a significantly faster growth rate than the corporate taxes overall .
The researchers say that the trend and the increase in corporate taxes across the country probably will stop in this year , with an increase in the General more military tax revenue for the State and local governments by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year .
However , the Washington area could lag behind when the spending of the Federal Government affects the labour market in the region .

Andrew Lawson was a man of the kind whose Charakter changed things , even in a so gigantic organization like the NHS .
As consultant physician of the anesthesia he dedicated his career , to save both the agony of the disease and also the torment of treating the sick .
Among his patients , his wife , recalls was a MI6 employee who had to live with the ravages of torture .
Lawson knew that the diagnoses and diseases are important doctors , while the treated are mostly busy with something quite other : pain .
One day in the year 2007 he was the one , whose ordeal began however .
`` I 've not felt , '' he wrote in May of this year .
I had difficulties to pick me up .
While he struggled with the flu-like symptoms , he noticed that he eagerly reproached his wife Juliet .
`` I want it all better now than later '' , he noted .
Was as Juliet for a week on a business trip , felt quite unusually Lawson and worried for no reason .
Something was in the air .
He asked a colleague to make an X-ray of his chest .
Just two weeks ago , he had been in the French Alps for skiing .
The result of the X-ray existed .
He suffered from Mesothelioma , an incurable cancer , which attacks the pleura , so the skin pulled over the lungs .
As with most cancers , the exact trigger is usually hard to determine .
While , for example , some smokers will develop lung cancer , not all Lungenkrebserkrankten of former smokers have been .
But mesothelioma is different .
In almost all cases , the trigger is an asbestos - contact with the fiber materials , which once was considered as `` Miracle material '' but now was considered fatal .
Mesothelioma is a disease that can ignore how easy for most of us .
Asbestos is a product of the past .
The most dangerous type of asbestos no longer used in the UK since the 1960s , when the industry committed voluntarily to stop using it .
Even in places where it was still used , only people in certain industries directly with the fabric - plumbers , builders , carpenters and shipyard workers , for example worked .
As an industrial hazardous material from another time , he seems to be today hardly any cause for concern .
But that complacency is misplaced .
United Kingdom , it seems , experienced today the culmination of an Mesoltheliom epidemic .
There are more deaths from Mesothelioma here than in any other country of the world .
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year , twice as many people die of the disease than in traffic accidents .
Annual numbers of Mesotheliomtodesfälle since 1980 and estimated future deaths in the UK
The reason why we now experience the deadly impact , although asbestos is illegal ( 1999 , all types of asbestos have been banned ) for years , is that a Mesothelioma develops only after decades .
And the scourge of the mesothelioma is limited not on former workers of the construction industry .
Asbestos was , and often still is in the houses present in which we live , offices , where we work , the schools where we learn and shops , where we buy a .
And therefore , mesothelioma knows no class barriers , financial limits , professions , or age .
The privileged bastions , the elegant department stores in London up to private schools , are not a shelter .
The Parliament buildings are asbestos-contaminated .
Also in hospitals , where we are still healthy , have been made as a source herd of this deadly carcinogen .
Andrew Lawson was not old .
He was also a plumber .
It was difficult in fact him , to imagine where he could have come with asbestos in contact .
Then he found it .
`` It looks as if in the tunnels to the guy it a lot of asbestos of hospital , where I completed my education for six years , was present . '' he wrote .
All students , nurses , doctors and Porter - use the tunnel .
One wonders how many will suffer my peers the same illness ?
Unfortunately at least partially , he could answer this question .
`` Of the four doctors , hospital have been trained on the guy , and who became ill in the last five years on mesothelioma '' , 2010 , he wrote in a letter , `` am I the last one which is still alive . ''
How many of us are still developing ?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma in the age of 48 .
When he died on February 17 this year , he was 55 .
It was an unusually long survival time .
Fifty percent of all Mesotheliomerkrankten die within 8 months after the diagnosis .
The disease ends always fatal .
We can repeat only Lawson 's question : `` how many of us will still get sick ? ''
The leading expert of Britain to mesothelioma , Professor Julian Peto , assumes that between 1870 and by 2050 , if the asbestos epidemic in Britain is expected to come to a standstill , total 90,000 are have fallen victim of the disease .
Most of them have have no idea that they are going to die so at the moment .

A quick look at the files of the dishes to those affected often have recourse due to claims for compensation , shows how far the scourge of mesothelioma is already widespread .
In June of this year marks & Spencer admitted , for example , have exposed Janice of all negligent erweise asbestos .
She worked for nine years for the chain , from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible of the clothing Department at two locations - one of them the flagship store in Oxford Street .
Mrs. Their activity with M was only 18 years , as it & S began .
Now , she has two children in their twenties .
`` Before this thing , '' she says , `` I never heard of mesothelioma , I still do n't even really knew anything about asbestos .
I never thought that that would even affect me .
There are only few people who know a lot about asbestos .
The fact is that the term asbestos refers not a substance , but a group of six minerals .
The name stems from the word `` Asbestiform '' , a description of the fibre structure , which makes the material strong and flexible .
Three of the six were used in the construction industry .
Chrysotile , also known as the white asbestos is the by far most often today found asbestos in buildings .
It was used for roof panels , floor panels , pipe insulation , boiler insulation , even for brake pads in cars .
It is less deadly than other forms of asbestos , is considered `` great risk '' with possible resulting in death but nevertheless by the EU and the WHO .
However , the brown asbestos ( amosite ) and blue asbestos ( crocidolite ) is dangerous .
Britain was once the world 's largest importer of brown asbestos , and experts suggest that `` significant , but indirect evidence there , that this was a main reason for the unique high Mesotheliomraten . ''

Janice has not considered himself perhaps all typical Mesotheliomopfer , but Julian Peto 's work suggests that her story is not unusual .
He has presented a study of those affected , which shows , that `` a significant proportion of mesothelioma without known exposure probably was caused by work or in the home by asbestos contact in the environment . ''
His statement after a majority of these contacts is based on `` normal use of aging '' our building .
It looks like no one could assume , to be sure .
A report by Goddard consulting , which studied the Palace of Westminster , shows how people in the heart of the Government , unknowingly the fabric exposed have been could .
2009 Goddard reported that the service ducts and pipes behind the Committee rooms of the Parliament with asbestos were contaminated , whose deadly Fasern could be stirred up by something as harmless as `` strong air movements '' .
Members of Parliament are accused of often to worry about their own interests , but here it looks like the opposite would apply to .
While the Directorate of parliamentary work it was , that the Westminsterpalast had received a `` clean health certificate '' , it is now undisputed that 1 billion £ effort over several years to be applied to renovate the Parliament , to modernize the electrical installations and to remove the asbestos and that after the general elections by 2015 members likely meet in the nearby QE2 Conference Centre are considered on the Green benches in Westminster .
The Goddard report also pointed out , that `` the presence was handled by asbestos not according to the respective regulations . ''
No one can know whether this mismanagement will cost lives .
All you can do now is wait .
A person who could never pinpoint the contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott , a general practitioner .
As Andrew Lawson , the 50-year Abbott suspected that he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals .
`` I was in a hospital worked , in the asbestos lawsuits were decided positively '' , he says , `` but I ca n't prove it in my case .
It is so difficult to remember where you worked , and on the data for all places .
What he clearly remembers is the day in early December 2009 , where he got some kind of fever .
He was 45 , and conducted an operation just late in the evening .
Suddenly , I had chills .
It came all of a sudden .
I felt horrible .
I felt no longer to make the journey home .
As a doctor , Abbott knew that the pain resulting from the pleura , the skin around his lungs around .
But as Janice all he had no reason to suspect a Mesothelioma .
He went a month not to work .
Astonished doctors took x-rays of his chest and set Pleurakathether to remove fluid from the lungs and to test in the laboratory .
His complaints , however , remained undiagnosed .
His health improved slowly , and he returned to his job .
From time to time but the symptoms returned , often after exercise and heavy breathing .
in 2011 , came an Abbott 's patient with similar symptoms in his practice and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma .
But now Abbott not combined this with his own case .
Finally , his patient was several decades older and had worked directly with asbestos .
The connection in the case was clear .
In September 2011 , Abbott 's condition deteriorated again and his family doctor brought his CT scans and x-rays to a group of experts .
In December 2011 , exactly two years after Abbott had felt sick for the first time , introduced a probe equipped with a camera into the cavity between the ribs and the pleura .
I 'm an optimist .
I 'm moving on mostly easy , '' he says .
Frankly , I was worried not so many .
But Rachel , my wife was worried .
Was the result of the biopsy in the week between Christmas and new year 's day : `` You told me that it was mesothelioma . ''
Graham Abbott : Diagnosis mesothelioma
Suddenly , Abbott had dates with Macmillan nurses , of which one advised him to hire a lawyer .
Only now , he realized the magnitude of the epidemic .
`` It turns out that asbestos was very widespread , particularly in large public buildings where pipes were often insulated with asbestos , '' he says .
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings , developing now .
And so , mesothelioma is now younger people who have not worked in the typical professions .
The most dangerous pipes with asbestos insulation in hospitals were underground , so patients were exposed to probably rather not the fabric .
But many employees who changed ( such as Andrew Lawson ) in pedestrian tunnels from one building to another or ( as it often did Graham Abbott ) , ate in underground canteens were most likely in contact with the toxic substances .
It is evident , that for several decades after the war , hospitals for the patients were potentially life-saving , but life-threatening for the doctors .
It is still removed .
Students turned off her Bunsen burner on asbestos mat .
And it concerns not only hospitals .
Due to its fabulous insulating and fire-retardant properties , asbestos was often used in offices , shops , libraries and city halls .
Also schools .
Actually , many people have probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom .
Everywhere in the country , thousands of hours of chemistry , students have parked in her Bunsen burner on asbestos mat .
The issue of asbestos in schools is now often spoken on Web pages .
And meanwhile , as innocent items in our homes as flooring panels or shed roofs have by default contain asbestos .
`` It 's an industrial poison , that is included in large parts of our real estate , '' Andrew Morgan , the lawyer , noticed the Andrew Lawson it hospital took in his lawsuit against guy .
In one case , the only contact that occurred to a concerned woman was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s .
So beware how you tear off your garden shed .
The impact of the diagnosis , and the knowledge that the disease is incurable , is immense .
`` It takes a while to process , '' says Graham Abbott .
I went back to work and tried to move , but I realized that I could concentrate on that , which I did .
I was two weeks in practice .
Then I knew that I had to go and take care of me to myself .
Well , I will experience no more Christmas .
The change of perspective from the position of a physician to a patient was with the greatest difficulty .
Like countless patients before him , he remembers how overwhelmed he was by all the information , which he had to cope with .
`` It was very hard to take it all , '' he says .
`` I asked my doctor , '' how long do I have ? '' ''
And they gave me about 12 months .
I remember that I thought , `` well , I will experience no more Christmas .
It was then . ''
Mesothelioma is particularly insidious because it is our life preservation mechanism - even - breathing , that caused the deadly cancer .
Most cases of mesothelioma caused by asbestos contact .
Asbestos is made up of the smallest fibers .
If the asbestos is stirred up , and the fibers are inhaled , they can become lodged in the pleura , lungs , skin .
Asbestos fibers irritate the pleura and may cause cell mutations .
`` The problem arises with needlelike asbestos fibres inhaled , '' so Professor Tom Treasure , a heart chest physician , who in 2001 , hospital transferred it to the guy .
Just the hospital , by the Andrew Lawson believed that it has exposed him to asbestos , is now ironically , a leading centre for the treatment of mesothelioma .
Treasure knew Lawson and dealt with some others that also probably were exposed to asbestos during their training at the hospital .
As soon as the asbestos needles can reach the lung tissue , says treasure , `` pressed by the breathing process at the edge , where the skin is .
By nature , it is invasive from the outset .
The usual options in other cancers not work as well in mesothelioma .
The effectiveness of an operation is as hotly contested .
Some say that it was worth a try .
Treasure denied that .
`` You can not cut out the pleura , '' he says .
You get around with a knife , not a question .
Meanwhile the cancer `` on chemotherapy not reacts to very easily , '' which `` has effect '' , but does not heal .
`` Sometimes there are long term survivors , '' says treasure .
But they all die at the end .
Fortunately , some patients live in fact long , much longer than expected .
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis .
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis still struggling Graham Abbott .
After he had contacted mesothelioma , Abbott came four years in contact with Andrew Lawson , after his diagnosis a man support- and became a consulting Office for fellow sufferers .
`` Hello , Cancer Center , '' he imagined himself cheerfully calls .
`` He was very positive , '' says Abbott .
He had received his diagnosis of 4 years earlier and was still very active .
Originally Abbott had been offered six cycles of chemotherapy , which would last four months and extend his life expected to be only about a month .
`` I was desperate , '' he says .
I wanted to give up .
Lawson made it however `` to appear the things in a somewhat positive light . ''
Following the advice of several doctors , Abbott , his treatment with Prof. Loic long Lazdunski , decided it to continue cardiac-thoracic specialist on the guy .
`` We had an advantage by the fact that I not be had referred , I just called and got an appointment , '' admits Graham .
A normal patient would need to receive a wire transfer and must wait for the approval of treatment .
Money is critical for people with mesothelioma , to be eligible for the best available therapies .
But if these treatments fail eventually , inevitably , many of those affected by an other financial concerns - about the future of the families who left them .
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation .
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP .
`` It 's been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous for the health , '' says Morgan .
But what is changing in the 1960s , that it was recognized that even a very low burden posed a health risk .
And the negligence of the company to play a role started here .
Andrew Lawson and Guy it hospital put aside their case after all , but it was not what Morgan calls a `` full compensation '' , as Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma an asbestos contact to the guy it was .
After the examination to his death a spokesman of the guy confirmed it but that `` the asbestos fibers in the affected area of the cellar in the 1990s have been removed . ''
That was too late for Andrew Lawson .
How to remove asbestos
It is actually for mesothelioma ill , seeking compensation , a huge problem , the deadly asbestos contact to assign a company or a job - usually decades after the incidents .
Many of their former employer have been sold or closed .
Insurance documents may be lost .
And those who defend themselves against claims , know that the time for her , but is n't quite sure with the plaintiffs .
In response there were significant new legislation that makes it easier for mesothelioma sufferers this year to seek compensation , even if their former employer to find no longer are .
The law has a Fund of 350 million funded by the insurance industry £ for all established after July 2012 were diagnosed , can prove a contact , who can sue anyone .
In these cases , the plaintiff will receive 80 percent of what a court in a normal compensation process them would be able to speak to about 120,000 pounds .
About 300 successful applications to the program are expected per year .
Andrew Morgan thinks like so many mesothelioma sufferers , that 350 million £ represented a `` very good job '' of the insurance industry .
`` This is a deal of insurers for insurers , '' says he , and indicates if this amount to one-fourth of that what insurers would have to pay , if the time it would have gone away and was diagnosed with mesothelioma find the companies and normally could sue them .
Also Mike Penning , of work and pension Minister , admitted that the law was `` not perfect '' .
But both admitted penning such as Morgan , that given by seven deaths a day a quick action was necessary .
`` The people suffer so much and now need help , '' Paez said in December of last year during the second hearing of the mesothelioma law .
At this point , Graham Abbott was 19 months in the hands of Prof. Loic long Lazdunski .
After their initial discussions , long Lazdunski recommended an operation , which he expected a positive effect in contrast to Tom Treasure .
This was accompanied by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy with the long Lazdunski can present a survival rate over five years by up to 40 percent .
Abbott felt strengthened .
`` This is of course with the most important , '' Abbott says .
You see that time and again in patients .
It 's something that can make you more .
If you give up , you 're very rapidly worse .
Graham Abbott underwent surgery March 2012 .
End of August he had the last the six cycles of chemotherapy behind .
Nachsorgescans showed no signs of the disease .
Then I had a scan in March 2014 .
There were more cancer spots around my chest .
I was just 50 .
That is not life-threatening .
This is life-ending .
Again Abbott underwent six chemotherapy cycles .
No sign of tumors is now more visible .
But the process is physically and mentally exhausting .
You must be thinking to practical things - about the money , if I am not , for example , or my wife show how the water heater setting .
If you receive bad news , you will be negative .
You have to look forward .
As the father of Ellie , 16 , and Tamsin , 14 , is not always easy .
`` For parents , this is hard , '' he says .
It 's hard to know what to say and how much .
When I got my first diagnosis , I told my girls that I had a disease , I would be not old .
They responded quite differently .
Tamsin is very sociable and impetuous .
She told her friends and we were soon very many calls .
Ellie was restrained .
She said not much .
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to go through .
But for Mesotheliomerkrankte such talks not of hope are not crossed , by a trace of hope of survival .
The disease brings ( so as ultimately to Stephen Jay Gould ) a grim security .
As Andrew Morgan says , `` mesothelioma is not life-threatening .

Putin demanded the inclusion of `` Rule of talks '' with the Eastern Ukraine Kiev
The Russian President Wladimir Putin according to Russian media reports on Sunday , demanded that the Ukrainian Government is fighting against the separatists in the East of the country and immediately takes up with negotiations to the `` rule '' of the breakaway region .
His spokesman Dimitri Peskow made it clear later that Putin did n't mean the territory under the control of the separatists of the Eastern Ukraine to become part of Russia , but that his status against the Ukraine must be redefined , to give the power to represent their rights and interests of the Russian-speaking region .
Putin 's call to the Kiev Government to negotiations on equal footing with the pro Russian rebel suits but which by him since the beginning of the riots five months ago apparently strategy : help for the separatists in the business areas and pressure on the Ukrainian Government to the newly proclaimed region Novorossija de facto independence for an alliance with Russia instead of providing with the West .
In an interview with the State TV channel one Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recapture of the territories held by separatists in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk , which were taken in March and April , after Moscow had annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18 .
The Kremlin and the separatists have lately occupied area as `` Novorossija '' or `` New Russia '' referred to a term that the Russian Empire is reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary heyday .
Putin pointed out that those who hope for Ukrainian politician for the elections on Oct. 26 , while government groups attacking civilian communities in the areas held by separatists in the course of the campaigns early peace talks are `` trapped in their illusions '' , ITAR-TASS reported .
`` We need to record immediately detailed discussions , not only on technical issues , but also to the political organization of society and the State status of the South-East Ukraine , to protect the interests of the people living there , '' he said .
Peskov said that Putin 's reference to the rule of law in the context of the greater autonomy should be seen , discussed for months by the leadership of Kiev to allay concerns in Russian-speaking areas , that their cultural and linguistic rights are endangered .
Only the Ukrainian Government can give the necessary autonomy the eastern areas , said Peskov .
We are not talking about negotiations between the Ukraine and Russia , said Peskov , `` because it is n't about a conflict between Russia and the Ukraine , but an internal conflict in the Ukraine . ''
The clarification of the Kremlin spokesman for correcting the `` misinterpretation '' of Putin 's remarks underscore the leadership of Russia in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the East , in contrast to the direct annexation of Crimea , where ethnic Russians are the majority of the 2 million inhabitants .
Moscow would be far greater , to annex the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in the East Ukraine , since most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are Russians and polls indicate a large majority for remaining in the Ukraine from the time before the conflict began .
The autonomy that was approached by Russian diplomats on international forums would proxy give the regional Governments in the Ukraine to negotiate their own trade agreement and external relations , and de facto control over an area so the Kremlin , type that combines the Russian territory in Crimea .
The peninsula in the Black Sea five months ago annexed is the home port for the bulk of the Russian Navy , as well as an important trading port and historic coastal region .
The regions between the Rostowgebiet in Russia and the Crimea is also rich in mines , factories and foundries that manufacture important components for the Russian military .
The Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko suggested in his speech at the inauguration on 7 June that the Ukrainian legislation - should bear in mind additions to the Constitution after new elections - that greater control is given the respective territories about their finances and the status of the languages .
But his notion of autonomy seems to be their arming and incitement Moscow accused in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels .
Putin 's last call to Kiev , to negotiate with the separatist leaders at eye level , followed a further advance of the rebels in the past week , after Russian troops and tanks have penetrated beyond the previously peaceful region along the Azov Sea in the Eastern Ukraine .
The separatists supported by Russia took control of Nowoasowsk in the coup , which is according to fears Ukrainian security official to the Crimea , the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal area .
For this reason massive civilian and military preparations are underway to Mariupol , a steel industry port of 500,000 to fix , which is situated between Nowoasowsk and the narrow access to the Crimean peninsula .
Poroshenko said on Saturday at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels and asked urgently for deeds , to prevent a further Russian aggression against the Ukraine , a former Soviet Republic , which has been independent since 23 years .
`` We are nearing a point where there is no turning back , '' warned Poroshenko .
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine .
The EU Summit decided no concrete actions , the leadership demanded the draft of further sanctions against Russia , which should enter into force at an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis .
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaysk , after last week invaded the Donezkregion , said two Russian tank columns and 1,000 soldiers Colonel Andrij Lysenko , spokesman of the Ukrainian national security and Defense Council reports to support the besieged separatists on Saturday in Kiev .
The first probably 63 Ukrainian soldiers , which were closed by the Russian incursion in Ilovaysk , against 10 Russian paratroopers were exchanged on Sunday who had been captured to Ukrainian territory a week ago , Lysenko announced on Sunday .

Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatments lead to higher death rates due to ovarian cancer in rural areas .
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have put online a video tribute to her mother who died of ovarian cancer in 2007 .
For women in the rural areas of Australia , there is a higher risk of ovarian cancer to die , than for women in cities .
Researchers analyzed the medical records of more than 1100 Australians , ovarian cancer was observed where 2005 , and found that only 25 percent were five years after diagnosis still alive .
The head of research of Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote areas of the State , the mortality risk is 20 percent higher was during the study than for those in urban areas .
SMALL study : new drug may slow lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers studied the medical care of women for seven years .
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman at the diagnosis , the type of ovarian cancer , existing medical conditions , as well as the social and economic status also influenced survival .
For older women and those whose Krebs already had progressed , at the time of diagnosis , the survival rate was lowest .
For those living in rural and remote areas of the State , the risk of death was during the study to 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas .
Although the study was not why women living outside the city more likely died of ovarian cancer , Dr. Jordan suggested a late diagnosis and the lack of access to the best treatment centres as possible factors .
`` This disease is treated best by Gynecologic Oncologists , and these are mostly in larger cities , '' she said .
Despite the improvement of telemedicine services to counter the distances , she suggested a strengthening of the service of doctors flown in as a possible remedy to specialists the opportunity to provide women , closer to their place of residence , as well as treatment programs for people outside their region .
Dr. Jordan said that the study found a poor long-term survival rate in women in the ovarian cancer regardless of geographical status and stressed the need for better treatment and prevention strategies .
The Rio Tinto ride to conquer cancer funded study journal is published today in the medical of Australia .
In March 2013 , Elisha Neave , a young mother of 33 years from the Gold Coast , learned that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer .

There is a rest under this tree
We showed a powerful tribe in our puzzle task of the summer series `` My piece of the Rhöner happiness '' last Friday .
There are several of these giant of trees in the district , the pictured specimen is the `` Geißruheiche '' above by Unterbrunn white .
A bumpy walk leads up to the approximately 600-year-old oak .
It misses on coupling , pile of basalt stone and basalt stone seas .
A little below the quarry from the Bauer mountain , one kilometre north of the road to Weisbach , there it is .
Vital is the natural monument , it extends beyond the other trees of nearby and reminiscent of an American giant Sequoia with a circumference of about eight metres .
A small Buddha on a tree stump suggests that it is a spiritual or mystical place .
But despite intensive research , there was only evidence of the origin of the name .
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has extra consulted the Bischofsheimer archive and interviewed older people from white Unterbrunn to learn which circumstances did it with the Geißruheiche .
The result of his investigations was the rather sober explanation for the name .
Therefore , the goat herders should have driven until about 80 years ago their animals under Weißenbrunn from the laboriously cleared and freed from stones meadows .
At the foot of the tree the animal keeper , exhausted from the ascent should have rested .
Meanwhile , the area has regained its importance , because on the meadows , herds of goats graze actually .
The area has been declared in addition to the core zone of the biosphere reserve , has further found Schneider .
Upon entering the stone collections should be careful , but , because the basalt warmed up by the Sun is a popular place to stay for Adders .
A hiking trail leads from Unterbrunn whites to the tree , but somewhat hidden .
Other routes are signposted that climb towards Hochrhön and invite you to an extended hike .
Where is the water Castle ?
A water Castle is looking for our next task , but is in the height rarely found .
The reflection in the ditch gives a good impression of the building , but we have some historic buildings , including the building picture could fit in the district .

On the bouncy castle at the Castle Garden Festival , a lot was going on Saturday .
The concept of the organizers agreed .
Despite strong torrential rain on Saturday night , music fans an estimated 1200 came to the Open-Air Festival in the castle garden .
At times , the intake had to be stopped .
`` It was annoying , '' said Ron Sem , one of the organizers .
Salzwedel l light and fun .
Of two Spanish words , Dr. have made the name Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem .
Because the open air in the castle garden Salzwedeler should radiate brightness on the day and in the evening with various shows .
Well , and the fun comes anyway by alone .
It became apparent early Saturday , when the first visitors to the open air .
The organisers had promised a celebration for all generations .
And they succeeded .
Around the supply stands in the castle garden meadow Salzwedeler , but also guests from the nearer and further surroundings had made themselves comfortable .
Watched the first live performances , bobbed with the foot to the beat , enjoyed cold drinks - in short : pure relaxation and enjoyment were announced .
And across the generations .
While is the one on blankets on the extra angekarrten white sand at the beach bar lümmelten , others used to wine in the wine cellar at a quarter , raged the offspring on the bouncy castle , which was a great attraction for the younger guests .
But also at the face painting volunteers in the truest sense of the word had busy all hands to the crowds to become and to conjure up imaginative creations in the small faces .
The larger used Foosball tables or participated in a skateboard workshop , which directed the Goodfoot crew from Salzwedel .
Until the big rain came .
Shortly before 17:30 he pelting down on the visitors , mainly families searched for the vast and dry .
However , this did not diminish the attractiveness of the Festival .
`` There were more people than expected '' , said Ron Sem which spoke of a `` success across the Board '' .
Therefore nothing precludes next year a repetition of the big party .
Although content and size of the event still needs to work on , SEM made it clear in a first record on Sunday to the people 's voice .
He described as annoying , and that in the meantime the intake had to be stopped .
Obviously , the security firm with too little force was been booked .
As a result , Some of those who had already paid , were no longer on the site .
The response was very good .
In a first cautious estimate of Salzwedeler with co-organisers spoke of about 1200 visitors , who are busy in the castle garden .
There were problems with the sound engineering .
The hip hop band block 'n ' ROX Salzwedeler broke off their appearance so unnerved .
The technicians were not able to create a halfway reasonable sound .
The planned shisha lounges could not be rebuilt because the tents because of a flat tire could not be brought to Salzwedel .
`` Next year they will be but here '' , so the Organizer .
The premiere of Dr. open airs succeeded more than by the number of visitors .
And the bad weather .
However , the organizers have committed some error which still be forgiven the first time , but must be disposed of in the Second Edition .
Also on the social network Facebook , the Organizer must insert criticism .
`` Sorry , but for 12 euros you expected just more '' reflected Melanie Meier on the event page .
`` You have taken over you unfortunately a bit '' , ele says Zakaria at the same place .
Others see the initial problems not so tight .
I find it very good , some just do n't talk , but really try to put something on the legs .
Hats off ! `` , writes Stephanie Jenß to the Srinivas .
Now time the organizers a year , to make these criticisms .

As the 2nd table tennis district class for the purpose of streamlining the leagues Division has been deleted some time ago , it has been the a step in the right direction .
Now the German Table Tennis Federation , an additional 3 took the Bundesliga in the program .
The result : Who has not risen , is descended .
Göttingen class highest team has avoided relegation torpedo in the Premier League-relegation while , plays in the coming season but still fifth class size only .

SG Lenglern and the torpedo reserves compete in the new Verbandsliga , not Göttingen clubs are more represented in the National League .
In the women 's plays the TTV Geismar in the Verbandsliga , the torpedo-second in the National League .
What looks like a better class of district , the composition is now the new district upper League South .
Here Seulingen , VfB Lödingsen , torpedo join TSV III , Geismar , Einbeck , Hammenstedt , Bovender SV , Langenholtensen , the FC Weser and the TTC .
In the Bezirksliga , II , red white , Bovender SV II and the teams of the TTV Geismar II and III play as regional representative Dransfeld and the SC Weende , in the district class of the TTC . The Bezirksoberliga of women starts at least in strength .
Güntersen , the TTC and the TTV Geismar II here are part of the game .
In the Bezirksliga start running torpedo III and semi Hausen/Redwood Mars Hausen .
With nine teams
The SC Weende sends his girl in the small district League .
Also the district League season of the SCW-boys - there still torpedo launches II — is not complete .
In a class of district Tuspo Weende , Geismar and Bovender SV go in the season .
The two Göttingen district leagues with nine teams start in the first season of the newly formed Association of the region .

Berkeley explains housing market again for `` normal ''
One of the most prominent contractors of London pointed out that the housing market in the South East of England `` was returned to normal levels '' .
Homes in the capital were in hot demand and subject to huge price increases , which prompted the Bank of England due to the widespread fear of a credit bubble that , to put limits on mortgage loans in June .
Tony Pidgley , founder and Chief Executive Officer of the high-class construction company Berkeley said on Monday : `` Since the beginning of the current financial year the market has returned 2013 at normal levels of transaction since the peak '' and added that this offers a `` robust action '' environment .
The real estate market in London was well positioned during the downturn , as foreign buyers in the capital urged .
According to information of the cadastre office prices in the metropolitan area are skyrocketed in the past year alone to 18.5 percent , far more than the average increase in England and Wales as a whole .
The average selling prices for Berkeley 's student , private and reasonably priced offers rose by a fifth in the last year and were at the end of April at the 423,000 pounds .
A stronger pound has , however , made less attractive in recent months real estate property in London for foreign buyers - some of them are been deterred also by the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric to a possible `` Villensteuer '' before the general elections next May .
The London real estate agent of Foxtons warned last week that the mortgage market report for April , the tighter credit lending rules were introduced in the second half of the year to lower market growth both in the sale of real estate prices would lead .
New data of the Bank of England on Monday show a decline in the mortgage approval in July , which also suggests that the real estate market cools .
Hamptions international , another real estate agency , corrected its forecast for the growth of real estate prices in London for 2015 after down to 3 percent , on the basis of an already weak house price consciousness .
The transaction volume in the most expensive areas of London such as Kensington , Chelsea and Mayfair has now declined every year a quarter so the estate agent WA Ellis .
However , the desire for a home in the city of Berkeley is a blessing , since the amounts for forward sales to more than 2.2 billion £ amounts .
Mr Pidgley added : `` demand remained stable after the proper , well-planned product at the best locations and also the forward sales have remained stable as a result . ''
In June , the company reported that it 3,742 new homes - sold in the year until end of April almost one-third more than the peak 2007 before the crisis .
Annual profit before tax grew annually by 40 percent to 280 million £ , sales rose 18 percent to 1.6 billion pounds .
In a release on Monday before the annual general meeting of the company , Mr Pidgley said that revenue for Berkeley would expected to meet current market expectations in the current year .
The analysts estimate consistent annual pre-tax profit to 450 million pounds .
Berkeley shares were in the afternoon in London trading at 23,96 £ .

With Rona Fairhead , maybe the BBC has found the great Director , it needs .
She arrives with a proud glory train from the banking world , media management and the inner circle of the Tory party .
And it has its own front experience .
Her career began at the global management consulting firm Bain and co. , which moved to Morgan Stanley , Bombadier , ICI and the media world by Pearsons .
She was Chairman of the financial times for seven years and stepped down as the top item of the parent company of Pearson to a younger male colleague went .
Their settlement was reportedly nearly 1 million pounds .
Also her political ranking is solid .
She was recommended David Cameron by Lord Browne , the former Chairman of BP , when it was looking for more private-sector knowledge in Whitehall : she became the Counselor of the Cabinet .
Her husband is a former Tory Councillor .
In may , I described the purpose of the Chair with a poisoned chalice .
Not only is the BBC as a huge and complex unit in the heart of public life , but there is also an internal paradox in its structure .
The Trust works in two directions : to the inside on the first guard of its management hierarchy at the BBC , but outward as the voice public concern and unrest , when things go wrong .
This ensures an almost unsustainable duopoly , which calls for a full comprehensive reform .
But what new incoming President would risk to compete , to embark on everything and to take apart an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty , while he himself perhaps brings to his job .
It is a difficult task .
And as if this were not enough , are also still many interested is reduced to see BBC - , money and status .
While closer to the competition and new technologies threaten old , convenient collateral , it is connected to the upcoming negotiation of the license fees for the BBC with special hazards .
For the modest sum of £145.50 per year and buys up the British public in the certainly largest media company in the world .
The BBC tells a good story : she says that she reached 96 percent of all households and only 40 pence per day costs each of them .
And apparently the BBC goes on the popularity scale back upwards : 53 percent support it today , compared to 31 percent a decade ago .
The vision and habits for the BBC have changed : I get news headlines today on my cell phone and catch missed programs later on my iPlayer .
But it remains a very beloved and respectable institution .
She needs a considerable Chairman - I hope she has found him .

Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson hochgelobtem new novel about love and the letter `` J '' .
They have vanished , so one could best describe it , they dissolved slowly like a cardboard , which you left in the rain .
Occasionally , a woman told him he was too seriously , exhausting , intense , aloof and perhaps a little Crabby .
And then shook his hand .
Crabby he knew .
He was prickly , as in hedgehogs , Yes .
The last victim of this Prickliness was a just starting affair , which had been promising for a relief of the lonely boredom in his life than usual , and maybe even a certain satisfaction brought him .
Ailinn Solomons was a trembling , delicate beauty with untamed hair and a fluttering heart from a village on the North Island , which was even more remote and rugged as a port Reuben .
She came accompanied by an older South , who thought her aunt Kevern and who had inherited a plot of land in a damp but Paradise Valley with the aptly named Paradise Valley .
Over several years , no one had lived in the House .
The pipes were leaking , the bathrooms were still spinning , slugs had left its mark on all Windows and believed it belonged to them , and the garden was overgrown with weeds , looked like huge cabbages .
It was a garden full of secrets as the House in a children 's fairy tale , both threatening how tempting .
Portrait of the author : Howard Jacobson , whose novel `` J '' on the long list for the 2014 standing Booker Prize .
The shortlist will be announced in the coming week .
Kevern had sat with Ailinn händchenhaltend on the broken deck chairs in the high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon . Both had been hooked absent-mindedly in the Services console , which supplied the country with soothing music and calming messages , as the sight of her crossed legs of Brown a long-forgotten black entertainer reminded him of an old song , which his father had listened to like with closed shutters in the home .
Your feet are too large .
Due to their very own aggressiveness , songs of this kind were no longer played on the console .
Not prohibited - there was nothing really illegal - not just played .
It was successfully obsolesziert , like the Word whether sole zieren .
The General taste , managed what decrees and regulations would have done , and like the folks at books which of the rags-to select memoirs of the millionaire , cookbooks and romance novels , so they chose the ballads with the music .
In the euphoria of the day , Kevern began playing an imaginary piano and to sing big feet in a coarse comic Serenade Ailinns .
Ailinn did not understand that .
`` That was a famous song of a jazz pianist called Fats Waller , '' he told her , and put two fingers to his lips .
His father had always done that to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth .
It had begun as a game between him and his father , when he was a kid .
His father had played it with his own father , so he was told .
If you 're starting a Word with a J , without two fingers on your lips , it will cost you a penny .
It was already not a very fun game , and it was also not very funny .
He knew that this was expected of him , that 's all .
It had to explain what was jazz .
Ailinn have never had what belongs .
Jazz was not played even though he was not directly forbidden .
The improvisation was no longer modern .
There was only room for one `` If '' in life .
People wanted to be quite sure at the beginning of a melody , where it would end .
Just as the mind .
His unpredictability made people nervous .
And jazz was mind expressed in musical .
Although he had become 10 years old without having heard of Sammy Davis Jr. , Kevern knew something about jazz by the semi-secret collection of old CDs of his father .
But at least he had to Ailinn explain that Fats Waller was black .
At their age she could not remember probably at a time , where pop singers were not black .
Again was that no laws or constraints .
A conforming society meant that each element of this society gratefully agreed to the principle of talent of the Group -- grateful as spared by fate .
People of afro Caribbean origin were suitable temperament and physique for entertainment and sport , so sang and ran it .
People who originally came from the Indian subcontinent , and were blessed as by nature with an electronic talent looked after with the task to make sure that no family without working service phone remained .
What was left of the Polish community , cared for the sewage system ; What was left of the Greeks , he smashed plates .
Those from the Gulf and the Levant , whose grandparents had not quickly leave the country when what was happening , if it was done geschah-fearing to be accused of fear even , due to fire sakura_linhmc that the flames would - eat it next Labneh - and shisha pipes restaurants had opened , were given and were depressed with the inactivity .
Each according to his abilities .
Because she had heard only ballads , it was difficult Ailinn to understand how ever could be set to music the offensive words which just had sung before Kevern you .
Expression of love was music .
`` They are not really offensive , '' said Kevern .
Except perhaps for people whose Füße are too big .
My father never insulted anyone , but he loved this song .
He was talking too much , but the neglected garden gave him a deceptive feeling of security .
Nothing could overcome the soundproofing of the giant cabbage-leaves .
Ailinn 's still did n't understand .
Why would your father something should love ?
He wanted to say that it was a joke , but hesitated to place two fingers on the lips in front of her .
She already thought that he was somewhat odd .
`` It appeared it funny , '' he said instead .
She shook her head in disbelief and blocked Keverns perspective .
There was nothing else around the world consider their ungekämmtes Raven black hair .
There was nothing that he would want to see otherwise .
`` If you say so , '' they mean without conviction .
But that still does n't explain why you sing to it me .
She seemed honestly concerned .
Are my feet too big ?
He looked once again .
Your feet not so directly .
Maybe your ankle a little bit ...
And you say you hate me , because my ankles are too thick ?
Hate you ?
Of course I do n't hate you .
This is just the stupid song .
He could have said `` I love you '' , but it was still too early .
`` Your fat ankles are exactly the reason why I like you , '' he tried instead .
I 'm a little Kinky .
That sounded not right .
It had to be funny .
If he was trying to be funny , he brought up often in trouble , because he did not like his father have the soothing charm , you needed to bear the cruelty inherent in jokes .
Perhaps , his father wanted to be too cruel .
Maybe he , Kevern , wanted to be .
Despite his friendly eyes .
Ailinn Solomons was red and rose from her deck chair , knocked over the console and spilled the wine she had drunk .
Elderberry blossom wine , so , drunkenness was no excuse for it .
In her excitement , she seemed to shiver , like Palm fronds in the storm .
`` And your is exactly the reason why I 'm perverse feeling attracted to you , '' she said .
Except , that 's not me .
She felt sorry him , both because of the unnecessary unkindness of his words such as fear , which was evident in their eyes , when she rebelled against him .
She thought that he would beat her ?
She had not told him from life on the cold northern archipelago , where she had grown up , but he had no doubts that it was essentially like here .
The same huge and ice-cold ocean broke here and there on the shore .
The same confused men , with even thicker skin and verdrießlicher after what was happening as it had been their ancestors as a smuggler and wrecker , moved from pub to pub , getting ready to raise the hand against a woman who is denied them or derided .
Fathead ?
You showed a thick fist her , if she was n't on !
They first Snog - smooching was the most commonly used Word for an erotic attraction between men and women , they only make out an antidote to the meaningless love ballads from the console - and then beat .
Keverns believes this was an unnecessary refinement as the smooch was itself an act of violence .
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign to go through her body .
He rose from a deck chair as an old man .
She felt also leaden , but the force of his mourning surprised her .
That was not the end of the world .
You hardly knew each other .
She watched him , how he removed - so how from a room on the top floor of their attendant watched him - a man , weighed down by something that he himself had conjured up .
Adam left the garden , she thought .
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in General , although some had raised their hands against them .
A man turned away from her , his back bent , ashamed , defeated , without fighting spirit - why it was a sight she seemed to know well if she but not could remember at once , when she had seen something before this day ?
When she was alone again , Solomon 's Ailinn looked at her feet .
Several years before the incidents just told Esme Nussbaum worked , an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year old researcher on behalf of Ofnow , the non-legislative monitoring body for the public mood , in a short speech about the continuation of violence on low and medium level in precisely the parts of the country , where their reduction , if not elimination , on the likely will have been expected , considering the funds and energy , which had been invested in the eradication of this violence .
`` Much has been done , and much still needs to be done , '' she wrote `` in order to appease the inborn aggressiveness of a people that has fought a thousand wars and won most of them , particularly in the secluded corners and valleys of the country , where the sweet breath of human kindness was felt historically despite the soaring bell towers between the hedges rare .
But some properties prove ineradicable .
The higher the Tower , it seems , the lower the passion that he still wakes .
The population is crying drunk while listening to sentimental ballads , stories about overcome difficulties and claimed to believe in the virtues of marriage and family life yet not only the former rawness captures the rural communities as well as our urban fabric in hand , but there is also evidence for the emergence of a new and devious contentiousness at home , at work , on the streets and even on the playing fields .
`` You have an unfortunate tendency to exaggeration , '' said her mentor , as he had read the entire report .
I suggest that you read less novels .
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head .
I must also ask : you are an atheist ?
`` I think I do n't have to tell , '' Esme Nussbaum replied .
Are you a lesbian ?
Again , Esme relied on their right to privacy , and denial of the statement .
Feminist ?
Again , silence .
`` I do not ask that '' said Luther Rabinowitz eventually , `` because I would be against lesbianism , atheism and feminism .
This is an unprejudiced workplace .
We serve an unprejudiced society .
But certain types of hypersensitivity , which is itself absolutely acceptable and laudable , can occasionally have presented her results as you distort .
You own prejudice against the Church , and those things that refer to you as `` sneaky '' and `` raw '' , have obviously could be interpreted by others as well as an expression of a natural force and vitality .
If you continue riding around on the , what happened , when it happened , like it , if it would have happened yesterday happened , means to take his essential life force to the country .
Esme Nussbaum looked around , while Rabinowitz said .
Behind his head , LED lettering in Flamingo Pink repeated the advice in the last quarter of a century or longer Ofnow had given the country .
You smile at their neighbors , they appreciate their partner , listening ballads , visit musicals , use your phone , talk , explain , listen to , agree to , excuse himself .
Speaking is better than silence , the Sung Word is better than what is written , but nothing is better than love .
`` I absolutely understand what you want , '' answered with a calm voice , as she was sure that it had spoken to her supervisor to end Esme Nussbaum , `` and I say nothing more than that we are still not so effectively cured , how we fool ourselves .
My concern lies in the fact that we find ourselves without warning may be doing as we repeat the mistakes that what happened to the first place , if it is happening led .
This time but it is not the other , where we leave out our anger and our mistrust .
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with the hands .
To indicate that the patience of a Saint .
`` You go too far , '' he said , `` If you call actions as a '' Mistake '' , which may or may not have committed our grandparents .
You go too far when you say that they had set out their `` anger '' and their `` mistrust '' to `` other '' .
It should actually not be necessary , someone in your position to remind that we speak in understanding the past as in the present protection of `` us '' and `` other '' .
There was no `` we '' and there were no `` other '' .
It was a time of disorder , that is all we know .
`` Which , if we are honest with ourselves , '' Esme dared to interject , `` no part of society can claim to have behaved well .
I accuse anyone .
Whether it was done badly or well , what 's done is done .
It was at that time .
Nothing more need be said - because we are in agreement .
And just like no blame to be assigned to must , so also no debt must be blotted out , if a such repayment would be appropriate , and if there was a way to wipe them off .
But to what serves the past , if we do not learn
The past serves , we forget about them .
If I can say something
Luther Rabinowitz made his pyramid coincide .
`` I 'll consider their report , '' he said and dismissed them .
The next day , when she went to work as usual , she was run over by a motorcycle rider , passers-by described , was driven in a kind of `` brutal rage '' on the footpath .
There are coincidences .

In a statement to the new press , he contradicts statements of CEO Peer Medau and attested this to pose `` like a warrior '' .
The style of the College , was n't this it says the communication .
So was the family Medau already `` oral mid-June about the notion of higher education been informed .
`` The statement that the plans were only known in July , are definitely wrong , so PA .
At the same time he pointed out that it is not in the plans to `` prior commitments or even decisions '' , but there `` Preferences '' .
Also required for the access improving the narrow road up to the castle was less dramatic than feared by the Medaus .
A nine-metre-wide road was and is out of the question .
Is current state about 5.50 meters , which is a metre wider than ever before '' , says PA .
The argument of the Medau operators that used their free and own school parking areas in the future only by students at the University , want to leave do not apply PA .
Parked to will not ever , because that how to solve now intelligently with other public parking can be .
Think of the residents
The nursery mountain IMP , which is located on the site and on their doorstep , the access road would lead to the parking deck along , should according to the College President `` not be affected '' .
But he admits , `` that involves not just the nursery , but also to the residents at the junction to the Friedrichstraße Streib and the 800 students of the neighboring secondary school .
It therefore involves much more than special interests of Lords Medau '' , so PA .
The readers whether the criticism of the parents Advisory Board of the crèche , with the expansion of the road would was entitled a `` of the few natural spots Coburg lost '' , `` can decide for themselves '' .
Early October will PA together with the State Building Authority Bamberg 2020 inform the city councils on the development of College `` and addressed the importance of the new development in this context '' .
Peer Medau had informed the parents of nursery of the plans of the University last week .
Therefore , the access for the new parking deck not as so far about the campus and the Friedrichstraße Streib , but about the Medau mountain should lead .
Thus the narrow road on about one km should be expanded length two-lane .
According to projections the Medaus , the traffic in the Park of Schloss Hohenfels thus would increase tenfold .
The speech is of approximately 2000 vehicles a day .
Pages of the city you wanted to not be expressed so far to the project .

Often misdiagnosed genetic disorder
A British woman says she thought as a result of a misdiagnosis over many years , that she would die .
Karin Rodgers lived almost their entire youth in the belief that she have to live only a few years after she was diagnosed with other diseases .
She actually suffered the Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease ( CMT ) - a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord .
Charity CMT UK announced that misdiagnoses are a common problem in people with CMT , because so little is known about this disease is known .
Probably about 23,000 people in the UK suffer from CMT , which can lead to motor disorders such as muscular weakness , an unsteady gait and curved toes .
Ill also suffer from numbness or pain . The disease is incurable and progressive , which means that the symptoms over time are worse .
When Rodgers 13 was , she believed that she was suffering from Friedreich 's Ataxia ( FA ) - a disease with very poor survival .
Rodgers thought she would sit in the wheelchair before she would be 18 , and die before her 30th birthday .
The mother of two children , who is now 51 years old , said : `` as a child I knew that I could do the same as the others .
I fell down constantly and everything took longer for me .
I could never ride with the other kids roller skates or skateboard and was often teased at school because my way of walking and running .
Rodgers said that she saw a their medical records at the age of 13 years after several operations to the relief of Achilles tendon and stretch their legs , as her doctor had left the room and read , that she suffered from FA .
`` I felt guilty , because I was curious , so I never told anyone , but I went home and was looking for the disease in the library , wrote to the FA company , '' she said .
When I got a reply , I was shocked and terribly by panicked .
I thought that I with 18 in a wheelchair would be 25 die and lose slowly all my skills in between would .
I was all alone with me and planned my own funeral .
She said , when she was 17 , she realized that their skills not so much had taken off , as she had imagined it and questioned their doctor .
He just stood up , hugged me and said , `` my dear , I do n't think you have , or you would n't be in a wheelchair by now . ''
I think you have something far less life-threatening .

in 1951 , he made the first and 1954 after three years teaching candidate the second State examination .
As Upper Franconia had no teacher vacancy for him , he applied to Upper Bavaria and came on November 1 , 1954 , at the school in Kollbach .
The `` Miss room '' was his first `` service apartment '' in the schoolhouse .
in 1958 , he moved into a three bedroom service apartment in the newly built Lehrerhaus next to the school .

For the sake of the school , judge maintained a good relationship with the former Mayor Ludwig Götz ( CSU ) as Rector .

Ebola : The epidemic charged West African economic
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a major blow to the economy .
Markets are deserted - and international enterprises are at a distance .
The devastating Ebola epidemic dealt a heavy blow to the economy of West Africa .
The crop rotted in the fields , the mines are abandoned and orphaned the markets - the virus has added to the region difficult .
Some international companies already go on distance .
`` The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis , but also an economic '' , says the head of the African Development Bank , Donald Kaberuka .
Liberia is the hardest hit
`` It 's a total disaster , we lose a lot of money , '' says Alhaji Bamogo , who sells clothes in the second largest market in Liberia 's capital Monrovia .
Comes only on the market who food or want to buy something for disinfection against Ebola .
Liberia is the hardest hit by the virus , here alone , more than 600 people fell the fever .
Recently , the health authorities declared the disease had penetrated every corner of the country .
The virus has spread also in Guinea , Sierra Leone and Nigeria .
In total , more than 1500 people died , and thousands more contracted .
Foreign companies pull out staff
Everywhere in resource-rich countries , companies suspend their operation .
Foreign companies such as the steel group Arcelor Mittal withdraw their employees , several international airlines no longer fly to the affected regions .
Also the local merchants and farmers respond : only a few merchants leave their hometowns , yet to get supplies .
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia , who are under quarantine , including you for exporting important cocoa and coffee beans in the fields to rot .
Farmers do not dare to leave their home for the harvest .
Food will be scarce
`` People are traveling less and less '' , Paris expert on the economy of West Africa says Philippe de Vreyer .
For example , the man who normally goes on the market and sold his vegetables , remains better at home .
The population is therefore the consequences of the epidemic direct and urgent to feeling : foods are scarce .
On the markets , the supply of staple foods such as rice is dwindling .
At the same time an image - threat of damage to the strongly international company-dependent region with far-reaching consequences .
The greatest danger was that international companies generally avoid the area for a long time , says Philippe Hugon of the French think tank IRIS .
Crucial is how far and how long will the virus still spread .
Investors could create the impression `` that it is dangerous to live in Guinea , Sierra Leone and Liberia , and thus also to invest '' , warns Hugon .
The disease burden also strained national budgets of the States
The disease burden already strained national budgets of the States concerned .
The Moody 's rating agency , it feared that whose budgets are severely strained by the high costs for the health system and in addition by the deteriorating economy .
Already , the African Development Bank promised to help the health systems of the countries concerned with 60 million dollars ( 45 million euros ) .
The effects are felt even in Nigeria , where so far few Ebola cases have been diagnosed .
Although the oil-rich region in the southern Niger Delta is so far unaffected .
But many people out of fear of contagion elsewhere already at home .
Reservations in hotels go back significantly .

The hell Decade of Beslan survivors : Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of school as still suffer the children is entangled .
Ten years ago , over 1,000 people were taken by Chechen militias in a school in Beslan in southern Russia as hostages .
More than 330 people , more than half of them children , have been in the three-day ordeal , that shocked the world , killed .
We have returned to Beslan , some finding the victim who escaped death when the atrocity in the classroom .
Exactly a decade after the horrific siege of the school in Beslan in which 334 people died , including 186 children , the heroic survivors warned last night of a new Apocalypse in the Ukraine .
When fanatical Islamist terrorists children and parents took captive the beginning of a new school year , September 1 , 2004 , and killed , seemed like the most evil of evil .
The tragedy brought together East and West in disgust , and then surprisingly turned into action and hope for the future in the middle of the worst misery .
Ten years later we returned to Beslan , some finding the victim who escaped death when the atrocity in the classroom .
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance , although the memory of this terrorist hell forever will follow .
Their best hope ?
That the war , which now haunts the Ukraine - and where children die as they - now comes to an end .
The girl who was photographed attempting in the shattered brick school gym back to climb
She was photographed by the Russian Star photographer Dimitri Beliakow and famous when she tried only in their underwear , in the shattered brick school gym back to climb after a mine exploded .
Totally confused AIDA was looking for her mother Larissa , now 40 years old .
Both were held for dead , but she survived .
`` A woman told me I should run for my life , but I could not , '' Aida said .
My legs were covered in blood .
I got up and climbed into it again to find my mother .
A soldier took her to safety .
Thought she was healed up completely after a series of operations , but yesterday said : `` three months ago , the pain returned .
I 'm afraid that I must be operated on again .
Some shrapnel are still in my knee .
Its aim is now , was to be helped to help people , such as her doctors dentist .
`` This tragedy changed my life , but it has not destroyed me , '' she says combative .
`` This happened to me , and you ca n't change that .
I 'm always in the gym , that to remind me , that there were once in a year .
My friends and I try to talk to other days not .
The pain is too great .
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there .
We played together when we were kids and dreamed to go to the school together .
`` I do n't want to marry , until I finish my studies and start my career .
I am thinking of a family later .
She says that the siege will remain always a part of it , although the memory every year is something weak .
I 'm glad that many people in the world still remember to our horror and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in the UK and around the world .
When I see the photo of me online , I think how I return climb in the school , that many people see it for the first time , understand our catastrophe and to contribute that to not happen again .
The boy , who fled through the hail of bullets , hoping that his mother was dead
It was his first day of school ( Russians go to school at the age of 7 ) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara .
As a seven , he said : `` Mama told me I should lie down when there was an explosion , and hold her hand . ''
After an explosion , he thought she would die .
She said to him : `` Run . ''
Full of fear , she could be dead , he fled and saw a crying baby on the way , grabbed it by the hand and fled through a hail of bullets .
His father Vladimir , who closed his son out into the arms , said : `` Damir told me that his mother had died .
He said : `` I could not save her . ''
In reality was out there tripped Tamara after and with leg injuries in the hospital , for its part in the assumption that her son had been killed .
After their reunion , she said : `` I cried for joy .
I could n't believe it .
He ran in and hugged me .
Damir was later flown to London ( from the now defunct newspaper news of the world ) , to the then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie the title of a Barnardo children it champion to receive .
`` This horror tracks you everyday , but I wish I could stop with the recall , '' he said yesterday .
But I can say that it will pale in my memory .
I still know that I threw away all my toy guns immediately afterwards .
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes and that is not a problem for me .
`` I 'm not scared , to go back to the gym , but I 'm not thinking about myself .
I remember these children , with whom I played in the yard , and that it not out there have done .
We never say that they have been killed or are dead .
We say that they have been in the Sports Hall .
I remember very well my trip to London , especially at the toy store , where I could choose about what I wanted , and the ride in an open-top car .
But now he 's afraid to spot such as the Ukraine , where wars cause the kind of accident that he and his friends suffered .
This horror haunts you every day , but I wish I could stop to remember .
`` I 'm so sorry to all those who suffer the abominations , '' said Damir , who worked as a volunteer at a monastery last week .
I 'm so happy to help .
I want to go to the police one day and hope they will take me next year at the Training Academy .
His mother Tamara , 48 , said : `` 37 children from our neighborhood were killed , can you imagine that ?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege , there were simply no children who could call in and running around , and this silence lasted for many months .
She remembers vividly her trip to London with Damir .
The people in London were crying when I told our story .
At that time , I understood how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings , and show their support .
She was grateful for the price and the ability to travel to London in the autumn of 2004 Cherie Blair and her Foundation .
I wish I could call Cherie and you yourself say that 10 years have passed , but I still at the meeting her and her husband in London remember me , and how the Damir and me has helped .
I still remember how Damir wanted to like to eat Borscht and they called all local Russian restaurants .
I remember how he played with waiters in a restaurant . Damir shot with his water gun at them and they ran away and played with him .
And that was just one month after the horror .
I was surprised that the British so willingly shared our pain and supported us .
She said : `` I always think that this world has not improved in these 10 years .
In the Ukraine , the war goes on now , and every day people die , and I think that many children have been and still are killed .
These are just such children like ours .
I think that for many the war is a part of the news they hear when they are bored or busy with something else .
I know what these people feel the whole horror .
And I can not stop to feel that .
Nothing has changed , the people want to kill each other always and that is so sad .
Damir was great and is a very gentle and quiet boy , he is not at all aggressive or angry .
For example he does not search for revenge , he is not overwhelmed by the past horrors .
I know that he remembers not like it , but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go to the gym and light candles there .
When he was small , he suffered - I remember , how he sometimes lay on the sofa , the face turned away from us , for hours .
Not asleep , his eyes were open .
I also remember how he threw away all his weapons and other military toys . Damir is greater than I , handsome , intelligent and healthy now 17 .
I can hardly believe that I for a few hours so was sure that he was dead and I would see him again .
I myself recovering after the explosion and came on the legs , I looked around and saw the hell around me , with all surrounding parts of the body .
I was absolutely sure that my little boy in this hell could possibly have survived .
`` I remember , I cried to him , '' Damir , run , run '' , but I was so sure that he had not heard me .
But he has heard it , and he ran away .
And so life goes differently than that of many others , for us .
Georgy Ilyin , 17
The boy , whose terrible screen became a symbol of the horrors of Beslan after the siege
Consolation : The Beslan survivors Georgij Lyin with his mother , Fatima after the siege of 2004 , on the right a picture of George today
His blutüberströmtes face was marked by fear , as he ran for his life , while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates .
His picture was one of the most shocking symbols for the barbarity of Beslan .
His mother , Fatima , 54 , a doctor , had him for his first day of school dropped off , before she go hurried to bring their elder son Vladimir to the University .
`` I left the Court about two minutes before the terrorists stormed it and my little boy stayed there terrible days alone , for three , '' she recalls .
Not all alone , there was a whole family of relatives of us , but they were all killed .
Only my George managed to survive .
This date approaches , the harder it is , to think and talk about .
There is no single date at which we do not remember this tragedy .
We do n't think that it is a long time ago , I mean , it happened yesterday , some scenes from those days chasing me all the time .
No one will ever forget that , I promise you .
Urgently : The image of George ( left ) was one of the most shocking of the attack and has been as immortalized statue ( right ) .
I remember that George wanted to like go to school that day . He said he wanted to hug his teacher .
I only knew that he was alive , when I saw him on television .
And now there 's even this statue of George weeping in San Marino .
George does n't like to see the picture , and it is hidden in the Bookshelf with us at home .
I understand that , but I also think that people all over the world thanks to this picture feel our pain .
George says today : `` it is important that as something never can happen again .
`` I doubt that we will ever know the truth .
People investigate such tragedies again and again and never learn the truth .
And now they are investigating the crash of the Boeing in the Ukraine .
Will we ever know what has caused it ?
This world is something terrible .
`` I can understand how this is possible , because if you ask people , nobody wants a war , so what happens ?
Ten years is nothing in such pain .
We need dozens of years to it 's a small little forgetting .
It has attacked my health and I still feel it .
About three or four years I had a few nightmares due to the siege , but then it was better .
I returned to school later in the year 2004 and was scared every day .
I thought of my friends and classmates who were slain .
Therefore , I 'm always in the gym , when closer to the 1 September .
I should say my old childhood friends tribute .
It 's hard for me to go to the gym , but I have to do it .
I do n't feel victimized , this story is now a part of my past .
I will not forget it , but I do n't feel sorry for me .
My life goes on .
I 've completed this year of the school and visit a medical college in Vladikavkaz .
I 'll be a heart surgeon .
My first choice was a training in the army .
I wanted to be a soldier , but my health did not permit that .
I wanted to fight for my country , but that 's not going to happen .
Georgij Fanijew , 20
The boy , who survived , though he was caught at the foot of a murderous terrorists
A miracle : Georgij Fanijew was trapped during the siege at the feet of a murderous terrorist , but he managed to survive .
During the siege , he was caught in the gym and sat next to the bomb , which was attached to the foot of a murderous terrorists .
It truly is a miracle that he was not killed .
`` We feel it , as if it were yesterday , '' says George , who as intelligence officer to the FSB wanted to go , but could not do this because of his health problems due to the siege .
It is still with me , there is nothing that I have left behind me .
I am older now and people say that children can easily deal with bad experiences - I have to say that 's not true .
`` in 2006 I worked with psychologists and felt then actually slightly better , but I ca n't it not forget . ''
And I 'd like to forget .
2005 - in the year after that - was the first and only time , I went back to the gym .
I lost consciousness .
I will never again go back and not ask me please to show you where I have been sitting in this famous image .
Survivor : Georgij Fanijew today , with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is enormous and I carry it with me every day .
My friends know that I think do n't like it or talk about it , and they never asked me after school .
Physically I 'm fine .
I should be careful about my injured knee , but I can run right now .
But due to my health I could not study at the secret service Academy of the FSB in St. Petersburg , how I wanted to .
I 've submitted my documents , the medical and she responded that it was not possible .
The animals were my second passion , so I went to the Veterinary Institute .
I have already two years behind me .
He learns the treatment of all animals `` from cats up to cows '' .
He said : `` I knew that I would never tell my children from my experiences .
Children should know anything about that , and they should not suffer of course also it .
His mother , Marina , 42 , said : `` this sorrow leave me never .
It is worse in my soul , if closer to the anniversary .
I will go to the celebrations commemorating .
I know that George will not go down .
It must be heavy still much for him , because he was there and I did n't .
I was at home waiting on him and could n't help .
I am so grateful that he returned me God . Here in Beslan , all of them are drawn .
It remains in us .
George is now an adult , but this horror is still in it .
It is hard to accept that something so unfair happens to one .
He is a boy , he likes sports , but he can not take part due to his knee .
He was operated on several times , he can run , but not sports .
I would say that he has overcome the horror to 50 % , but you can never completely overcome and forgotten .
This horrible experience will always haunt us .
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the siege , and that reinforced only my pain .
I 've lost many people that I know well and who were dear to me .
My son is with me , and that is the greatest gift God could make me , but my heart cries for the dead .
I know born of families , in which new children , but also of widows who have never remarried .
It is difficult to accept that life goes on , even if they do n't want that .
I will never forget how my heart in me jumped when I saw him in the hospital .
And now I see , what 's going on in the world - wars in other regions .
What fight these people ?
Why they kill each other ?
The war is now very close to our country and I almost ca n't believe it .
We were a friendly country , how can it be that we are fighting now ?
People and children are suffering , I am sure that in the Ukraine , many children have been killed and many are killed .
If we all could - access these rebels and throw out as far away as possible .
