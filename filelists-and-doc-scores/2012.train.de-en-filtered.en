Smart crow in cities
In many places , Saatkrähen are seen as `` problem birds , '' but from the cities of the highly intelligent animals no longer drive for a long time ago , experts say .
Some people , they may want to get rid of the other very quickly : Krähen for centuries are part of the city , but in many communities there are mounting anwohner complaints about dirt and noise of the animals .
It is a means to the `` birds '' not yet in sight .
Saatkrähen are no longer out of the cities , said experts at the first crow symposium in ostfriesischen Leer .
They consulted experts from the entire federal territory on possible ways .
They are looking for alternatives in cities
Conservationists led the problems in towns and cities to the abandonment of the most protected krähes seed : the use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly the traditional habitats .
The hunt , increasingly building and the cases of typical trees breeding birds made life difficult .
Crow are under the protection of nature .
Large colonies with more than 600 breeding mate , among other things in the Westphalian Soest , in the northwest , among other things , in Jever , Diepholz and Achim in Bremen , as well as in Leer .
It was in 2005 a controversial project to mass killing of crow in the district of negative headlines .
Critics had called the trapping of animals in bird traps and deployed with cudgels described as particularly brutal .
`` The normal displacement , the Vergrämen , nothing , '' said the city and landscape Werner Klöver from Leer .
Nests with water or trees , often have undesirable consequences , said the environmental expert Manfred emperor from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg .
`` The animals are made up of large colonies divide and spread to other areas . ''
Vergrämung only as an exception to hospitals , nursing homes or schools .
`` We have to live with them , we will no longer . ''
Without the surrounding area will not solve the problem in the cities , said Mayor Wolfgang waiter from Leer .
It could be a combination of Vergrämen animals from sensitive residential areas and offers to resettle them elsewhere .
`` Information boards instead of chain saws , '' against the psychologist and Ethnologin Uta Maria Jürgens for an entirely different approach to the animals : `` a Pickel in the face , we can best endure self-confident . ''
Jürgens had in Schleswig-Holstein the ash Krähen-Lehrpfad , which notices about the lives of the highly intelligent seed krähes .
The project will now have already adopted by tourists .
In addition to the criticism of the noise of the birds Jürgens had its own opinion : `` there is a lot of communication , which have much to say . ''
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary : Saatkrähen not only use tools to come to a biscuit , but as a tool of their tool even themselves .
Behavioral researchers at the University of Cambridge tested recently at four Saatkrähen , how far the intelligence of the birds .
In one experiment the birds quickly learned that they must bring down with a structure so as to arrive at a motte larve .
Without much training , they determined the size and shape a stone to the platform collapse .
In a second attempt to solve the smart crow a trickier problem .
In a vertical set , the researchers placed a small Eimerchen with a Mottenlarve .
The birds could not reach their prey .
However , the researchers had them pieces of wire .
It shaped all four animals a snag , with whose help they will be the eimer angelten at the top of the .
Three of the four Saatkrähen were even at first .

Boeing has a record of 18 trillion in country
Airline Emirates ordered 50 two-track aircraft from the Boeing 777 with an option for 20 more aircraft .
In addition , Boeing sold six Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air , a deal worth more than $ 1 trillion dollars .
It is really a rare news that a company gets about 50 pieces of its products .
But it is a big business , if the company of the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the list price for these 50 aircraft , with a record of 18 trillion dollars .
It is also unusual for the charge of Boeing , the Middle East , a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders .
In a forecast , which was published on Monday , the Chicago company estimates that airlines from the Middle East over the next 20 years , 2,520 aircraft worth 450 trillion .
Boeing announced at the weekend , its biggest contract ever for commercial aircraft , measured by the value of the order : 50 two-track Boeing 777 jets .
The hammer was commissioned by the airline Emirates Dubai .
The airline has also announced Boeing 2011 at the Dubai air show , an option to buy 20 more planes , the entire list price to $ 26 trillion dollars .
On Monday , then ordered , according to Boeing , Oman Air six Boeing 787 - 8 , the so-called Dreamliner , fuel consumption and vastly improved passenger comfort .
The list price for six of these aircraft is more than 1 trillion dollars .
`` This is absolutely positive for Boeing , '' said Neal Dihora , stock market expert from Morningstar .
`` The quality of this particular customer is very high . ''
Many airlines of the Middle East are in possession of the oil producing countries .
Not only do they have the money to pay for the planes , There is a rise in oil prices , which usually is detrimental to the airlines , because this is one of their biggest cost items , not so harmful , because the country deserves a higher oil price .
This is important , because they are less than other airlines tend to cancel or postpone aircraft orders , when oil prices rise , Dihora said .
`` You have a natural hedge , '' he said .
The appointment of Sultanate reinforces Boeing 's leading position in the market for large aircraft and helps the Airbus competitor SAS to keep in the supremacy of the A350 .
Boeing 's victory on the air show comes four months after Airbus has announced that it would postpone the introduction of the biggest A350 , which competes directly with the 777 - 300ER .
It postponed the introduction , in order to gain more confidence , after the customers asked for a higher burden and scope .
Boeing shares rose by 1,5 % to $ 67.94 .

Scalia and Thomas dine with opponents of health care legislation , as a court accepts case
On the day of the Supreme court gathered behind closed doors to discuss the political dividing question whether it is a challenge to the health care legislation will hear from President Obama , two of its judges , Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas , at a dinner , which was gesponsort by the law firm that represented the case before the court .
The incident took place last Thursday , when all nine judges met at a meeting to discuss the petitions for review .
One of the cases was a complaint , the 26 states against the far-reaching reform of the health care system , which were adopted last year by Congress , a law that the conservative activists across the United states on the slogan .
The judges agreed with the hearing ; in fact , a 5 1/2 - hour basic discussion is expected in March , the result will probably boost the presidential campaign in 2012 , at the time , the court decision will be in full swing .
The lawyer , who stand trial and will claim that the law is to overturn , Paul Clement will probably be , once attorney General under the administration of George W. Bush .
Clements services , Bancroft PLLC , was one of the nearly two dozen companies that supported the annual dinner of the Federalist society , a group devoted to the defense of conservative legal principles .
Another company , which has sponsored the dinner , Jones Day , represents one of the Business associations , the National Federation of Independent Business , which challenge the law .
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc. , which is a huge part in the outcome of the process .
The dinner took place a few hours after the court had been on the case in a Washington hotel .
Service , among other things , Mitch McConnell , the head of the group of Republicans in the Senate and a fierce critic of the health-care reform
The guests of the dinner ? Scalia and Thomas .
This is nothing new : the two judges attend meetings of the federalist society for years .
And that does not violate moral rules .
In fact , judges freed from the code of conduct , which regulates the actions of the lower federal courts .
If they were , they would probably fall under principle 4c of the code , which states : `` a judge can participate in benefiz events because local and other organizations , with the judge is not a spokesperson , the guest or a host of such events . ''
Nevertheless , the extreme closeness of Scalia and Thomas to two of the case related firms , as well as a company with a massive financial interest in this in order to alert Moral-und-Regierungsaktivisten .
`` This startling break with morality and contrary to the code punishes the complaints of some judges lie , the court is the same rules that apply to all other federal judges , '' said Bob Edgar , president of Common Cause , a civil rights movement in the United States .
`` The judges and dinnierten during a Benefiziveranstaltung with lawyers with cases pending at the court . ''
Their appearance and their support of a fundraising effort for this event undermine any claim to impartiality and are not acceptable .
Scalia and Thomas show little regard for critics who say that they would issue judicial easily with groups who are guided by the agenda , such as the Federalist society .
And Thomas '' wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist .
By contrast , the Conservatives claim that it was Judge Elena Kagan , who have a moral problem , not Scalia and Thomas .
Kagan was general prosecutor under the Obama administration , when the first legal challenges in the first instance in court .
Their critics urged Kagan to withdraw themselves from the hearing of the case because of bias , because they are too much involved in the defence of the law , in order to be impartial .
Kagan is not about to do so .

Fire story :
The innovator IBM enters into its second century of its existence
If you are looking for a suitable word that the strategy of IBM most closely , then this would be the word `` longevity . ''
For the general public , IBM is synonymous with technological revolution , we know it as a modern company , even though a century has passed since its inception .
The basis for this longevity has been its first chief - the visionary Thomas J. Watson , .
He was the slogan , countless global problems could easily solved if people would be willing to think a little bit .
His slogan `` Think ! '' has become the hallmark , which should take the life of the future giant ( and , at the same time , the title of the company 's internal magazine , IBM in the year 1935 began ) .
This was also the basis of the Watsen thoroughly prepared corporate culture .
`` For us from IBM means that long-term thinking is a kontinuelle movement towards the future .
IBM survived and was also an entire century successful because it has remained true to its principles and not shied away changing everything else around it .
This allowed us , in the course of our first century , the technology to transform the business and society .
We hope that we will create even more in the next hundred years , `` said Samuel J. Palmisano , the current director of the company on the occasion of the anniversary .
Thought-out system
Watson was already in the 1930s social care of its employees - in a similar way , as the entrepreneurs Baťa in Czechoslovakia : IBM people had as one of the first American workers paid holidays , an insurance through the entrepreneurs , plus elegant uniforms and working clothes and a reasonable salary system for best innovators and traders .
Equally sophisticated IBM long-term relationships with their customers .
The company was brilliant from the outset in the promotion of talent - as one of the first companies worldwide , IBM any discrimination - and could pick and choose accordingly .
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy is also the current plan , the Palmisan at the head of IBM in the next year will be swapped seniority by a woman , Virginia Rometty .
It is already 30 years at IBM , so far , the position of the Vetriebs , marketing and strategy manager .
IBM makes so-called online brainstorming in recent years , from which many future strategies and innovations .
No wonder - ideas , it is enough , the company is almost half a million people .
An institution with a good reputation
Their steadfast position in the Business guaranteed the company a strong image and domestic and foreign .
`` From the outset , IBM is the concept of an institution than a mere technology company , '' said the Economist , a professor at Harvard Business School and the author of a book on IBM , Rosabeth Moss Kanter .
`` IBM is not a technology company , but a company , the business problems with the help of technology helps resolve , '' said George Colony of Consulting firm Forrester Research .
The company pointed out , there is a difference , only to be present on the market or directly through this presence .
IBM - in the states of their logos because of the family `` Big Blue , '' has grown up in a century to one of the largest companies in the world .
It is one of the militaries technology companies - IBM developed hardware and software , infrastructure , hosting and consultation services in an incredible product range - from servers to nanotechnology .
Of all the American technology companies IBM has the most patents and five of its staff were awarded the Nobel Prize .
Among his best-known inventions include , for example , bank machines , credit cards , financial swaps , bar code or the diskette .
With approximately 220 billion stock market value ( market capitalization ) this year , IBM was the second major technology company ( after Apple ) , but it was the first time since 1996 , Microsoft took over .
Looking ahead
Not all products and innovations met the tastes of the customers of today - were unhappy with its own operating system , OS / 2 , the online service , for example , or even the IBM PC computers jr .
`` Business is based on the forward movement , so we should not be emotional attachment to the past , '' said Samuel J. Palmisano .
That is why IBM has no problem to build its foundations on various platforms - and if they do not work , they also leave again .
In contrast to the rival Microsoft , which in principle with its Windows operating system Windows .
Promising technologies
The profits of IBM in the greatest degree of services , software and hardware to participate in a fifth .
It was still 1990 hardware with a more than fünfzigprozentigem share .
Since 2000 veräußerte IBM little profit abwerfend assets with a value of $ 15 billion in the same time , however , 58 billion dollars in the future technologies .
In these investments , IBM continues after 2008 , when the modern financial crisis for the first time as a storm swept over the world .
Here , too , IBM was the legacy of his first boss Thomas J. Watson , in the middle of the global economic crisis increased its investment .
So far , it appears that the company IBM today 's crisis .
The value of the IBM shares increased since 2008 rocket by 120 percent and the profit of the company kontinuell grows .
The company slogan of IBM : everything can change - not only the values .
For that reason , it is to be expected that this flexible giant pulls off the next crisis .
IBM history : from cheese Schneider to space flights
A hundred years ago , society founded in New York , IBM ( International Business Machines ) initially had a rather complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation .
According to the name IBM took until 1924 - it was originally a brand name for a plant in Canada and South America .
According to the foundation for the subsequent society IBM , the merger of four companies , whose history dates back in the 1980s of the 19th century .
They had technologies such as the famous Stechkartenuhren registration work begins and endes .
The architect of this new company was Charles Ranlett Flint , until 1930 , the chair of the board of directors .
And it was Flint , the head of the rival firm Thomas J. Watson , so that helped him with the management of the company .
This Leader , then even the founder of IBM in the shadow - Watson 's ideas based on the invincible culture and identity of the company .
Watson led the company until 1952 .
IBM began , as the name tells us , in the manufacture and distribution of all sorts of machines for the trade - -und sausage schneidern cheese to go .
In the first four decades in which Watson led the company , he has doubled its sales to nine million dollars and the company expanded gradually on all continents .
Watson was so essential to the company that he was all for forty years in the chair , he was replaced by his son , Thomas Watson junior .
Under his stewardship IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first Programmiersprache .
In the 1960s helped technicians and computers from IBM to launch flights into space - the Mercury and Saturn , and in 1969 , the famous flight of people to the moon .
Meanwhile , IBM in 1964 , the first computer family with the same computer architecture - the series IBM System / 360 .
A classic PC , the computer standard of that time came in 1981 under the name IBM 5150 on the market .
Twenty years later , IBM veräußerte computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo , on the other hand , they bought the mom-and-pop part of the company , PricewaterhouseCoopers and jumped wholeheartedly into the business with Consulting benefits and services with high added value .
The strategy , IBM is paying off in the last three years , is the concept of `` smart planet . ''
It is the intention to use technologies intelligent in hitherto not planned areas , for example , to improve the situation in transport and urban management .
In the commercial sector , IBM recently setup the platform `` Smarter Commerce , '' which is intended to help the dealers to take the whole trade cycle .
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic .
Back in 1932 , IBM founded a branch in the former Czechoslovakia - was the first country in Central and Eastern Europe .
Today , IBM ČR is , among other things , a strategic outsourcing Center in Brno .
The Centre for Central and Eastern Europe moved in Prague and is also a top world-class that deals with the technology of voting identification .

Europe 's most beautiful pools
Leap in the dark
By Julia Stanek
Planschbecken Ufo-Optik , future pools in Budapest : anyone who travels through Europe can be seen blue miracle - and after a city tour or a wandering Sprudelbädern hide behind the tired legs .
A book shows , where wellness in the water is the most beautiful .
When Iris Meder in the past one and a half years on research trip , was not lacking in their luggage : her bathing costume .
Rücklings on the water , they looked in elaborate domes , they swam Putten marble , they waited in the basin , and was meticulously restored from Jugendstilschwimmhallen .
Gefiel her a bath , she took in her notiz book - all the knowledge worth details about the design and history of the building .
More than 200 swimming pools answer architecture historian Meder in this way - and it is now in her book `` bathing pleasures : '' People 's swimming halls in Munich , historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest , `` hardcore concrete buildings '' in the Taunus .
By 13 countries , their `` journey to the most extraordinary spas in Central Europe `` : in Germany , Austria and Switzerland , it visited places in Italy , France , the Czech Republic , Slovakia , Slovenia , Hungary , Romania , Poland , and a town in Luxembourg , Serbia and Croatia .
The 46 - year-old German is a true Badekultur-Enthusiastin .
In sport , it does not have much in the , says Meder - only in the water is different .
Annoying that swimming fans come with blue Kacheln and chlorine smell , while jogger inhale the betörenden smell of Fichtenwäldern inhale or happy Vogelgezwitscher listening in the park .
`` One day I asked myself why swimming pools must always be so ugly , '' says the Meder living in Vienna .
`` So I began to collect beautiful baths . ''
Water doubled architecture
The wellness factor in bathrooms geplätscher in the basin and ethereal sauna oils - is so great , because all sense , so Meder .
And if the builders have been trouble swimming halls can be a real Augenschmaus : `` Instead of a floor in dipping water surface . ''
`` It is transparent , on the other hand , reflects the beauty of the whole building . ''
All doubled blend : high vaults , colorful Kacheln , bretter .
The kleinformatige picture band `` bathing pleasures '' gives 190 pages of knowledge about the architecture and cultural history of historical wellness oases - but above all , for a leap into the blue .
Remarkable specimens discovered the pool Sammlerin Meder with her research in Hungary .
In addition , sumptuous Heilbads such as the 100 years old Széchenyi-Bad in Budapest , they found a nitrathaltiges waters in an urigen Karsthöhle ( Höhlenbad Miskolc-Tapolca ) , as well as a Thermalbad , whose basin filled with alkalihaltigem water and are in a flaschenförmigen building ( Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény ) .
Spectacular prospects , however , offer many heated pools in Switzerland and Austria , while the Zurich Dachbad the whole city , it is an external pool Bads in St Anton on the snow-covered Arlberg look - and , in the , there is a window from which you can monitor the activities of the Ski-Piste .
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design expects bathers in length field : the Aquadome Ötztal looks like an Ufo landed in the Alps .
> From three upwards open Schales dampft in the winter , while in the background , the mountains of the Ötztals out in the sky .
Alhambra in the Black Forest
It is not in every swimming pool , the pool collector Meder the smell of chlorine in the nose .
Many thermal spas smell after sulphur in the Árpád-bath in the Hungarian Békescsaba stinks to be so much for fuel oil , which is difficult to believe in a Gesundheitsbad landed .
The smell comes from the alkali hydrogenkarbonathaltigen water , which is almost black and whose silt a stain on the skin , once you slip into the pool - a wellness experience .
In one place was Iris Meder in their search for beautiful bathing sites , however , also disappointed : When they free and sun in the Czech Bad Luhatschowitz wanted to visit , they found a cordoned off area .
The 1902 by the architect Duan Jurkovic bath has now been closed .
When Meder a glance through the verwitterten windows of the red-Weis-yellow art nouveau building , she saw how weeds between the tiles grown .
It the decline has countered , however , in a beautiful swimming pool in the Black Forest : the Palais hot springs at Bad Wildbad .
Three construction has this bad already behind ; it can detect not only neoromanische elements from the time of its establishment in 1844 , but also a maurische hall in Alhambra style , which was added in 1900 .
Since the 1995 thorough modernization is the Palais hot springs pool kennerin Lieblingsbad iris Meder - and not just because they originally comes from the Black Forest .
`` It is quite an achievement , so different Baustile at such a great unity , '' says Meder .
With such a palace is the Tauchgang in thermal pool only incidental .

''
He pointed out that under the government of Jesús Aguilar Padilla , the state has not fulfilled its obligations , which is why the community at the beginning of the government a loan of 7 million needed to borrow would be equivalent to the amount that the central government would have to pay .
`` That was already in the last parliamentary term , because the state did not have sufficient economic resources . The programmes went further and this year we have had to raise the funds , which had not raised by the state to participate in these programmes , '' he said .
Even if the state authorities are obliged to the disbursement of these funds , he commented that the minister for administration and finance , has been asked to speed up the administrative work and pay the outstanding amount as quickly as possible .
`` They must contribute almost 12 million , and even though the year comes to an end , they have given us a penny . ''

No one wants to ban our Ölmützer Quargel
Mrs Vicenová also on the agenda , according to the European Union , and intends to live in the near future .
According to the Czech Presidency of two years ago , describing it as a success .
The Czechs had overcome the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also the summit for the Eastern Partnership .
In the case of the government during the presidency , describing it as a big negative , which severely damaged the image of the Czech Republic .
The Czech representation in the EU currently has its hands full .
In the words of the ambassador said that it was not only in the presidency , but also in the subsequent crisis , which is not yet overcome quite hectic .
And since the seven-year budget must be approved by the EU , which is precisely because of the current economic situation much more complicated .
Whether it is a slim and economical budget , what industries take precedence , which countries more and less - all of this is now on the agenda .
The ambassador also recalls their own slogans with which they came to Brussels : `` understandable on Europe . ''
`` If I do not like something , then it is gräuliche acronym , foreign words and jargon that nobody understands .
How can I actually know as citizens , whether they are really in Brussels curved or round cucumbers and other large bananas or whether someone really wants to ban the Quargel .
It would have used the territory of the European Union in order to get more Czechs in European institutions .
The Europe of two or different speeds in prospect
According to the EU ambassador , the Czechs have the reputation of being Eurosceptics more negative than positive aspects of the story .
All the more galling is the weak representation of Czechs in European institutions .
There are many factors , including the reluctance of our candidates , whose inability to motivation to write letters and , last but not least the weak support for the Czech side .
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency , they also have the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad group , the so-called V4 .
`` Believe me , if a pole or Hungarian comes to me and , in the vicinity , then the Frenchman next to me : '' Hey , what is the heads together - that is your V4 ? `` and makes a pretty sour face .
Mrs Vicenové according to expect the EU in the future , especially tough rules for the budget policies of the member states .
As a much fairer , as a `` European federation '' is the concept of an Europe of two or even different speeds .
`` We have the countries of the euro zone and the countries outside the euro zone .
`` We have the Schengen area and we already have the Institute encourages cooperation . ''
`` For the first time , it was said that only those countries should work together , and it does not want to out . ''
`` It will be more and more of these institutions , which at the end of a strong '' multi-speed Europe , '' `` expects Mrs Vicenová .
In this respect , they also paid tribute to the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in the implementation of the principle , according to which all the issues with impact on the entire EU must be discussed by all member states , and not only by the countries of the euro zone .

The military is growing pressure to crack down on rape
This week , an important hearing will decide whether 28 women and men for failing to intervene in a rape to be charged before the military court .
If it does not happen , there are hundreds of plaintiffs ready for the next hearing .
Obergefreite Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and in the 11 weeks pregnant when she was raped by a fellow .
It was in October 2008 and they returned to their barracks in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when they met at a male colleague , has a 12 s Pack beer .
He asked them whether they should accompany a drink in her room .
`` My alarm bells went on , '' said Lyman .
But the Texanerin swept aside their concerns .
I thought : `` Oh , he is 19 .
He is from Texas , `` she said .
`` I wish I had listened to my gut feeling . ''
A few minutes after they had gone to Lymans Zimmer , the man behind them , put them down and raped her , she said .
This week , on 18 November , Lyman and 27 other current and former military officials anxious to a process with a historic hearing in Arlington , Virginia , which will decide whether a complaint against the former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor , Donald Rumsfeld , will be allowed in court .
The complaint alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld did not against the widespread rape within the military and in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers .
In February , Susan Burke , a lawyer in Washington , DC , the complaint was initially comprised 17 plaintiffs , but in the next few months rose to 28:25 women and three men , who all claim that they are soldiers who have been raped or sexually abused , and that the military failed to identify , to condemn or to make a proper justice after the alleged attack .
Burke says it has the top military leadership , because the problem is there .
`` The military is hierarchical , '' she says .
`` Who are the individuals who are in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation ? The leadership . ''
Burke also says that she has since February nearly 400 other survivors , many of them could be part of future claims .
Their strategy : instead that all claimants were laying their eggs in one basket , they will , if necessary , many more complaints in order to keep up the pressure .
The defence team for the Department of Defense , led by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride , has submitted a request to reject a complaint .
The files of the court , Newsweek , the defence strategy , first and foremost , that the military can not be sued by current or former soldiers for violations , in the armed forces .
On the basis of a law by the Supreme Court in 1950 , the so-called Feres doctrine , the government is not liable for violations that soldiers on active service .
`` The alleged damage caused during the military service of the plaintiff , '' the document says .
The Ministry of Defence refused any comment on this story .
Things have changed since the 1950s .
If women are still not allowed to work in the fight , the distinction lies only in the name : modern wars have rarely clear fronts .
Both in Iraq and Afghanistan , teams of female soldiers increasingly important roles , particularly in the contact with indigenous women in war zones .
The result : between these two wars killed 150 soldiers , two thirds of them in hostilities .
It is time that the military will be modernised , says Burke .
And it is not alone in their fight : three other complaints their are pending .
At Yale Law School , the veteran `` Legal Services Clinic a complaint against the four main military academies because of alleged promotion of a hostile atmosphere .
The small independent non-profit Vietnam veteran of America a complaint against the military , which focuses on the diagnosis of `` personality disorder , '' which received rape victims to dismiss them from the service - a normal procedure , according to activists like Anu Bhagwati of the service Women 's Action Network , a human rights group .
In December the group filed a complaint against the veteran administration , management of the war veterans ) , in which their discriminatory practices in its dealings with entitlements for people who have been sexually abused in the service .
Nine laws has been independently by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties in Congress , which will provide a number of leads .
In 2010 , according to the sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office , Office for Prevention and reporting sexual abuse ) of the Ministry of Defence 3,158 sexual abuse .
But most of the abuses are not reported at all , and after the Pentagon 's own estimate takes into account the number of approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases per year .
The report , which was published in March , the prosecution rates : 2010 , 20 % of the cases in the military court , only half as many as in civil law .
The plaintiffs in Burke 's case describe their attacks as only the first of a series of trauma .
In Lymans case reported the alleged rape of the military police less than a hour after the attack .
On this night , she says , she was asked 11 times , the details of her rape of a whole series of policemen , doctors and commanders .
She had a Vergewaltigungsset and the blood of their aggressor , which came from a cut on his arm , was found in her bed .
Six months later , in April 2009 , Lyman was heard by a judge during the hearing she was asked about the sex they had before the attack with her friend .
Six people said as character witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator , who was ultimately acquitted .
`` I still remember the day when the verdict was read out , '' says Lyman .
`` I thought that it would be . I ran screaming from the courtroom . ''
`` They brought me to the psychiatric ward and I remember that when I came out again , I said to my commander : this was not his procedure , and that was my trial . ''
Lyman was invited to visit a military psychiatrist , in the end , a diagnostizierte personality disorder and declared them incompetent .
In January 2010 , it was sacked dishonourable , so that they have no support .
Whether the complaint , the Lyman and the other claimants have submitted , is pure speculation , says John Turley , a professor of Law at George Washington University Law School .
Nevertheless , he notes : `` I think they should move forward . ''
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine , which has been criticised for the first time , it has been called into question .
I am a critic of the Feres doctrine .
The military is a decade later , because they do not have the same incentive and deterrence , which is a liability .
He adds : `` The odds are against them ... But it is important for them to try . ''
These things will only change if good people are ready to fight .
If the hearing does not follow their path , Burke , the lawyer for the plaintiffs , with its hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases .
`` We will continue to fight the military in this regard , until it comes to reform , '' she says .
Or until we die , whatever happens as the first .

Why is the unemployment rate for disabled people in such a high level ?
About 19 % of disabled people are searching for a job .
Today begins the 15th week of work for the disabled. ``
Despite the purposeful public policy , which was introduced in 2005 , the unemployment rate among disabled people has always been twice as high as the average value : 19 % Arbeitlosigkeit 9 % of the total population .
Discouraging ?
`` No , Éric Blanchet , director-general of the Association of Adapt '' week of work for the disabled. ``
`` The fifteen years of progress . ''
`` At that time , the unemployment rate was not twice , but three times as high . ''
`` Nevertheless , a great deal still remains to be done . ''
It must be said , however , that many obstacles remain for disabled people remain before they get a job .
More often , it is the elderly : 37 % are older than 50 years ( 17 % on average ) .
They have a low level of qualification : 80 % of them have no baccalaureate and there are only 10,000 people among the 2.3 million students in higher education .
Finally , long-term unemployment is also very widespread : 53 % of the disabled , compared with 38 % in the overall average .
In short , there are so many criteria that make a fresh start working , and the `` heart of the problem , '' says Christian Grapin , Director General of Tremplin , an association in 1992 , the company is helping to recruit disabled workers .
So much for the factual brakes .
The underlying implication , mentalities , certainly , but slowly .
A in April by the Association of IMS-Entreprendre for the magazine La Cité study , which surveyed managers have `` a weak level of knowledge about disabled people , '' the `` over-represented '' of people in wheelchairs , mentally or intellectually less well-off. ``
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees still have a long way to go to the employment target of 6 % disabled workers , which was enshrined in an Act of 1987 .
The latter , from the 2008 figures point to a ratio of 2,6 % .
`` We are now at about 3 % , '' said Pierre Blanc , Director General of Agefiph , the organisation , which is tasked with recovering contributions from companies that flout the law .
The proof : the number of `` charges '' plants has been reduced , as well as the amount of the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011 , zahlenmäβig from 59.000 to 46.000 ( and from 606 to 480 million euros ) .
`` The law of 2005 , which provides increases , created a strong pressure on the company , said Pierre Blanc . ''
`` But this improvement is also a real awareness , especially among the large firms groups . ''
According to the Ministry for work only 59 % of the plants between 20 and 49 people disabled workers , companies with 100 to 199 employees compared to 82 % .

Euthanasia and accompanied Freitod must be legalised , a panel of experts
The Canadians live in denial of death , according to a report by the Royal Society of Canada
The panel said that governments , institutions of health care and doctors about schmerzlindernder treatment worked together for the best pain relief funds , and this also goes beyond the cases of cancer .
The Canadian society is living in a state of denial about the death .
Only 9 % of Canadians are in fact , with their doctor to talk about the conditions under which they wish to die and make provisions for this purpose .
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada , in which six experts were involved in various disciplines , including ethics , law and medicine , are interlinked .
This body recommends that the government to amend the criminal law , in order to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia , where this election , and in patients who are considered to be in a position to make such a decision .
As a prelude to the experts cite a recent poll by the independent EIU society , the quality of death in 40 countries compared to the world .
Although Canada has placed on the 10th , the study noted that `` the medical care in Canada has a culture in which people are afraid to bring up the subject of death . ''
Medical care or not : 77 % of Canadians do not have access to painkillers , tell us the experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada .
And despite the overwhelming majority of Canadians to die at home , but ultimately die 68.6 % of those in hospital .
The whole country , the rate of 86 % in a hospital deaths occurred in Quebec .
In the sensitive issue of euthanasia and accompanying etem suicide , the authors of the report to conclusions that the position of the federal government , which has already geäuβert , any changes to the criminal law on euthanasia and accompanying etem suicide to .
Now , however , there are , according to the experts who have inspected all those countries whose approach euthanasia and assisted suicide were legalized or decriminalized , no evidence that such a decriminalization Miβbräuche in their application , which is the practice of euthanasia or etem suicide of unkompetenten or not consenting individuals would entail .
On the contrary , we meet considerably more cases of such violations in the countries where there is no legalized euthanasia and assisted suicide , such as Jocelyn Downie yesterday , a co-signatory of the report , confirmed in a teleconference .
`` Euthanasia is in Canada , where it is clearly illegal . ''
`` Suicide is practised in Canada , although clearly illegal , '' said Jocelyn Downie .
Canadians support euthanasia
Let us remind ourselves that had carried out in 2010 , according to an Angus Reid poll showed 85 % of Canadians in favour of euthanasia , because they are of the opinion that these people would be at the end of her career to alleviate their suffering .
And 66 % believe that the issue of euthanasia did not lead to convey the message that the lives of elderly or disabled people less value besäβe .
As for the people who have already assisted suicide , the respondents represented 41 % of the opinion that they should not be prosecuted .
As for maintenance or suspension of the funds for patients situation is less clear , as the authors of the report .
It also in their recommendation list suggests that the criminal law should be indicated that the dumping of funds , for which a legal opposition , not as a criminal .
The panel of experts also calls for professionals in the health care professionals should be trained in the task , a set of the funds at the end of life to be respected , and this without fear criminal prosecution .
The panel said that governments , institutions of hygiene and doctors worked on schmerzlindernder treatment , in order to provide the best palliative funding , and this also goes beyond the cases of cancer .
Finally , the body is calling on the Canadian health care institutions far-reaching used to pain relief or lebensabschlieβender unorthodox measures , at least to consider , because they just like euthanasia have served to reduce physical pain and bezögen on the same procedure .
Other experts reservations
Some experts in the field of health care have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the report put forward by the Royal Society of Canada .
RA Pierre Deschamps , specialist in health law , has the attitude of the berichtsunterzeichnenden experts among others described as `` extreme , '' the practice of euthanasia for patients in the final stage no borders .
`` This opens the doors for a situation in which everyone tired and older than 18 years , another person to ask him to be involved in his suicide , '' RA Deschamps , who had seen a summary of the report .
RA Deschamps also stressed that the authors of the report seemed to be the responsibility of the individual over all other values , which are involved in social knitted of society .
But now , he says , there would be `` guidelines and commitments in a society . ''
Margaret Somerville , specialist in health law , also has `` a strong resistance '' to the conclusions of the report , which they as `` per euthanasia manifesto . ''
Margaret Somerville , who is a member of the Royal Society of Canada , in particular , the report claims on the freedom of abuses in certain countries in which euthanasia and assisted suicide , such as in the Netherlands and in Oregon .

To play in Costa Rica is a dream come true for us .
This is just the second time that we in South and Central America , and until now , it has been great .
I am only on holiday in Costa Rica . It is a beautiful country , that we will stay a few days ago .
It is exciting for us to bring our music there .
I ask you this , because the fans of the band are completely ; you can see the days before the concert closest possible .
What does it to your enthusiastic fans ?
Thank you , all these years on our side .
We have spent nearly 21 years until we came to Costa Rica , and we are very sorry to have waited so long to have taken so long , until we came here .
Some people are even of the opinion that your concert will be the biggest show of the year .
This is not a little bit of pressure from your visit ?
Some of the greatest shows that we have made in the last 21 years , took place in the last two weeks .

Since we have never played , we have no borders .
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs , and we want to play a couple of songs from each album and our fans a good and varied repertoire .
It is never repeated your repertoire .
Why ?
I think that this is partly because we have nine plates and more than 120 songs can play everyone likes a different song , so that the decision , which we will play against each other , is not easy .
If we have two or three songs , which we have no longer have played into the repertoire , we can better maintain our concentration and they surprise us , because they are the reasons why we have taken this Song 's . They might otherwise be forgotten .
This makes the show more interesting for us and I think , therefore , for the audience .
With this tour celebrates its twenty years of history .
If you look back , it is hard to believe in your success ?
Yes , totally .
First of all , I believe that none of us has presented to play once in a great rock band , and more than 20 years , and it looks like a dream .

It has always been a honour to belong to this group of large bands .
We are good with the people of Sound Guards , Mudhoney and Alice in Chains .
It is surprising and very unusual , if a movement emerges from a group of friends .
Every now and then a band from a city , but it is unusual , if five or ten groups at the same time , come from the same city .
We are proud and honoured to be part of the Seattle group .
Sometimes we still play together .
Last year , we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Sound garden on their tour . We are pleased to be friendly with them all and honoured to be part of this past Seattle Sound .
It is also very unusual for a band like yours so long ago , together with the same musicians .
Yes , four of us play for 21 years and Matt ( Cameron ) came to us 13 years ago , and that It is a lot more time than many bands survive .
First of all , I believe that we are all happy to be alive and we also care about each other .
We are all close friend why musical paths have opened each individual the freedom to experiment .
One trusts the other and his music . It could not be better .
Your relationship with fame has not always been easy , on the other hand , it was thanks to your success always do what you wanted .
How do you find a balance ?
The way we have grown , it has made it easier to find a balance .
We make sure not to be too often on tour , because it is too easy to this game with huge numbers of people who love your music .
As long as we keep in mind that people have come because of the music reminds you that you have the music and what they created , must be careful not to be a famous rock star , and that has never interested .
What memories you have in your other project Mother Love Bone ?
I think we have very good songs , and at the beginning , it was great .
We were three years for a band until the death of Andy ( Andrew Woods ) never had a record .
We were disappointed to have taken so long , and we are still well with Bruce ( Fairweather ) and Greg ( Gilmore TD ) , with the band , a friend , when I hear a song or see photos , I think , what an incredible man Andy was and how he brought me , it was always a pleasure to go to work , to laugh together and music and football , and many other issues .
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him .
The domestic bond Las Robertas are responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica .
It is true that she knows her work , in particular , Eddie Vedder , and that is why you have chosen for the opening ?
Yes , the production sent us videos by various groups and the band did best , and that is why we are curious to see what robe rtas live can offer live . This is exciting .
Why does the text of Yellow Ledbetter , if you play live ?
This is an issue for Ed ( Eddie Vedder ) , I have no idea .
He sings it , and I think he sings the first thing he thinks .
Who you got to be affected as Bassist ?
So many +
Among the first to me , Geezer Butler , John Entwistle , C. J. Ramone , John Doe , Paul McCartney , Chuck Dukowski ...
There are so many that I have the whole afternoon on the bassists , which I could talk about .
As Pearl jazz Jam has managed to keep the Grunge alive , although it is no longer a fad ?
I think we all feel very connected with the word Grunge .
When I think about it , the band , which I mentioned earlier , for example , Mudhoney Sound Guards , nirvana and all the others that were at the same time , if they are still important today , I think it is great , because it is worthwhile to hear this music and bands such as Mudhoney now make better music than ever before .
Initially , their music was dark , it is now more positive .
Why ?
This is interesting , because I believe there are a few tunes created on the new album , which might seem somewhat lightly . But there are also other songs such as the End or just Breathe , which are classified as very dark Song 's , even though they also have something positive .
Both , I had the tears when I heard how Ed played , and it is very dark Song 's .
I believe that if you are older and something drastic happened in your life - for example , if a family member or a friend loses - influenced your artistic creation and your music , and these two songs embody the clear for me .
But I am also of the opinion that we have to be a happy man and can still make dark music .

Strong yen
Noda is threatened with a new intervention in currency markets .
The Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda on Tuesday warned that the Japanese authority would intervene in the currency markets if the yen should continue to rise .
`` We should see an excessive volatility '' in the exchange rate of the yen , `` we will intervene , just as we did last time , '' said M. Noda in the Senate .
On Tuesday , the yen , in turn , close to the aufgeschnellt historical levels , which the Japanese authorities had forced the intervention on 31 October .
On this day , Tokyo had sold massive yen against the dollar , in order to reduce the Japanese currency value , which is hitting a new record since 1945 against the dollar .
However , the yen has risen regularly doped by purchases by investors , the yen as a `` refuge '' in these uncertain times of global economic downturn and debt crisis in Europe .
The dollar has fallen below 77 yen on Tuesday , the euro is below the symbolic barrier of 105 yen in the vicinity of the levels slipped , the last intervention getriggert .
Before the financial crisis of 2008 - 2009 listed 120 yen to the dollar , the euro more than 160 yen .
This whimsical Japanese motto is damaging to the exports of the archipelago , as the the cost of the `` Made in Japan '' products more expensive and drawn from abroad by Japanese firms , since they convert into the national currency .
`` Japan has been struggling after the earthquake and tsunami on 11 March , the Tohoku region ( North East ) have been devastated , for its reconstruction , '' said M. Noda , who feared that the rise of the yen could kill the weak recovery in the bud .
The third world economic power , with the growth in the third quarter -1.5 % compared to the previous quarter , for the first time this year , thanks to the sharp increases in exports and consumption by the disaster , `` plombierten '' households once again gained traction .
The Prime Minister , however , estimates that the rise of the yen is not `` the economic fundamentals of Japan am reflecting . ''
The Finance Minister Jun Azumi , for its part , the Bank of Japan ( BoJ ) , which opened on Tuesday a two-day meeting of its monetary policy committee has urged to take all possible measures to weaken the yen .
Hirohide Yamaguchi , deputy governor of the institute , however , has informed the BoJ had already taken `` appropriate measures , '' which he said that no additional monetary easing on Wednesday was to be expected .
At the last meeting at the end of October , the central bank had its obligation acquisition of 5,000 billion yen ( 47 billion euros ) increased to 55,000 billion yen ( 519 billion euros ) to pay off financial sums they had spent on various purchases of securities , in order to flood the market .

Controversial plan of an oil pipeline will be reviewed after exposure to delayed U.S. approval
A few days after the Obama administration has threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to in the Gulf of Mexico , which angered the unions and environmentalists , is that the pipeline would provide companies trying to plan the project , so that we can return to normal .
Canada said on Monday evening that the planned pipeline from the ecologically sensitive area of Sand Hills in Nebraska .
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Parliament building in Nebraska .
Alex Pourbax of , said that the company was still confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved , albeit with a different course .
This came after an announcement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the last week , after which a decision on a federal approval for the project would be postponed until the new possible course would be reviewed , the area of sand Hills in Nebraska , as well as the Ogallala Aquifer , a large water supply , meide .
`` This is a real step forward , '' said the Republican Lee Terry , a Republican from Nebraska to Fox News .
The new environmental review , which the State Department has ordered , may postpone a decision until 2013 , after the elections in the coming year , even though officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision .
Obama said last week in a written statement that the decision is a task of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and said his support .
The 1700 mile pipeline , linking Canada with the Gulf of Mexico .
It would pump 700,000 barrels of oil per day from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas .
To this end , the pipeline would have to cross six states .
Environmentalists hate them , but labour markets love them , because they estimate that the pipeline will create 20,000 jobs .
But the legislators Nebraskas , who oppose the plan , weighing up the laws , a departure from the region of sand Hills and the Ogallala Aquifer , a major source of drinking water and irrigation , to force .
The current study on the impact on the environment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has found that the project would have little impact on the environment , but the source of the energy industry says that the principal investigator of the Ministry has requested a separate probe of the review process , which focuses on two issues .
One is whether a lobbyist , the by Canada , Paul Elliott , who was 2008 adviser of Hillary Clinton , is in a conflict of interest .
The other is whether a company , which has been allocated to carry out the original study was an inappropriate choice , as it is with Canada .

Experts say - a Stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article about how to learn Stylisten , I had a little bit of gemeckert that it was a bit too much for the start .
Since I was not in the least , what is to come .
Lectures by three experts from the industry , the clothing of problematic characters and a seminar on how the `` place . ''
It is worse to come .
The closer examination , more information and practical tasks ahead of us .
But even if the course is on Saturdays and Sundays , it is full .
This time we debated with director Alena ( the rate is not a single man ) , as it attracts a woman who has no ideal proportionierte figure .
And that is , after all , most of us .
Some people have a short neck , the other a young figure without proper curves and others are mollig .
It is a matter for the Stylisten to extend broad shoulders looks to extend the neck or the necessary hervorzuzaubern curves .
We also got pointers about how to make a Frauentyp like Jennifer Lopez - with a large bosom , wide hip and all slim waists - and attracts figur stressed , without being too provocative .
If , for example , the difference between waists and hips is so great that the skirt or trousers does not really fit , should be at least a piece of schneidern .
This will not regret , because good clothing is simply unaffordable .
In such a tailor-made rock you feel much better than in a bar , the high and verrutscht Taille absteht , etc .
Jungenhafte characters can , in turn , clothing with wrinkles , Bauschen , applications , embroidery or Raffung .
With this amount of information and character types , I am glad that I have a whole week time I will do everything thoroughly .
And yet , I am afraid that it is almost impossible to achieve in view of the assigned homework .
Each of the rate of a celebrity , for which it is to devise appropriate attire - day clothes and evening gown .
So we should take into account the current appearance , the fashion style of the stars and Figurtyp .
I am supposed to Miranda Kerr , '' `` you may be out of the campaign , Victoria Secret .
Inside , I juble , because it is much better for me personally , for example , Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera , who has grown in recent times , the hundred kilograms ( okay , that is a bit exaggerated ) , or even the young Selena Gomez .
The clothes we are supposed to from magazines ausschneiden or on the Internet , and then represented graphically .
`` In the Mood Board , the result is known , then our personal style and our relationship with the graphic design .
It is very important to think about the graphic side of the Stylings .
The Stylist models not only physically , but also the so-called product side in the journal ( after specific target , for example , handbags , coats , etc . ) .
They told us the Stylist and designer Mario Kameník .
But only on Sunday .
This means that a Stylist must have a good overall picture .
With information on the types of characters filled Saturday lecture was tempered by three visitors from the industry .
The Stylisten Jan Pokorný , the fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč .
Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and a Stylist should be able to exploit it .
And eingeschickter Stylist with a single piece of clothing to work in very different ways .
The magic word is variability .
You can take , for example , a Trenchcoat as usual on the jeans , a T-shirt or coat , but also on the naked body , paragraph shoes to attract and wear it as a dress .
It is enough to roll up our sleeves and and the whole look is quite different .
`` So , '' he said .
But most came the following advice : `` first of all , you know what the rules are perfect . ''
`` Only then can they violate them , '' said Jakub .
At last , it is clear to me why we need pauken all these theories , which can be combined with what and why , even if you fashion journals often quite different to see .
Not to mention of fashion schaus .
Thanks to the photographer Ben , I now know that a Stylist much more clothing variant must have prepared than he ultimately photographed .
So you have to be prepared for a Fashion story with ten pages ( read ten attire ) to stylen at least 15 .
And also that the clothing in the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes looks very different than in reality .
All of this must be expected in the form of the attire .
That image and sometimes make up half of the success , which also confirmed Jan Pokorný .
Since you need only Madonna , a not particularly brilliant singer from the image and marketing have made a world star .
In the Czech Republic , the services of a Stylisten rather reserved .
Well-known personalities , it is often wasted money ( the main thing is that I am , as I turned out secondary ) .
And if anyone stylen from us , then we should expect that he or she is very likely to be a very different ( smaller ) size than he or she needs in reality .
Then you need only turn to googlen to determine with certainty that the tabloid press , the appropriate Promi or decreased , and so on .
Jan and Mario put us on Sunday , not to believe that a Stylist to focus only on the fashion and then the cloth `` to assemble them . ''
In his work , above all , he needs to communicate with the people , he stylt and he must be a psychologist .
People judge without curry and his opinion .
`` If we have in order to sift through their clothes cupboard and to complement fine pieces , then we can not get rid of the whole storage cupboard and say - my God , this is terrible . ''
`` We must find at least a few worthy things , which recommends what you can do , '' says Mario .
He also showed us exactly what a so-called `` pocket '' must include .
So a bag of Taille zuknöpft and which carries all the necessary Proprietäten .
But such clear , such as scissors , Abroller to hair removal or safety needles , it also contains such Utensilien a nylon thread ( the Stylist helps the photographing of products , such as handbags or hats ) , specific clips with which the clothes will be accelerated if it is too big ( electric nadeln or other Klemmen are banned , so that the substance is not broken ) and , of course , Nähzeug .
This means that we must not only listen , but also can try something practical , we learned how to get it right .
In the photography studio , where the floor is , you can damage the shoe base , let alone the outside .
O klebten us and we klebten ... .
With the gap should not affect the shoes , so that they are not damaged .
So we must be really well .
Mario enjoyed , he praised my `` creation '' without restrictions .
The skill is not just my strength .
All of this was only a fraction of what we hear on the second Wochenend-Fortsetzungskurs .
One thing is now clear to me - the styling at professional level , is no pushover .

Park or mountain ?
The architects are apart from the disputes over the fees with the tender .
The urban tender on the 16 gates opened the debate about the importance of Collserola in Barcelona .
In the middle of the 1980s , at the height of the now vanished Spanish Metropolitana de Barcelona ( CMB ) , the administration published its Schmähschrift on the promotion of Collserola .
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona city .
It has even been compared in figures with the Central Park in New York .
With the sinking of the CMB in 1987 , the park in the eyes of many back to the ceiling of Barcelona , because the capital of Catalonia is one of the few who does not spreading in the south direction , but upwards ( mountains ) and down ( sea ) .
The classification Collserolas as a natural park is playing with this idea .
As a model is now no longer the Central Park , but Yellow Stone with wild boar in the role of the Yogibärs .
So far , it was when the city in September , a giant , consisting of 16 competitions , for further access gates after Collserola .
No doubt a gateway refers to the concept of a park .
Either that , or someone has to make gates in the country .
The question is : Collserola , parking or mountain ?
The tender is not only from the organizational point of view , but also in terms of a reflection on the city , the topic of discussion in the mouths of all architects from Barcelona .
It is almost a rekurrentes issue on which two members of the old eingesessenen caste , who meet in the lift .
And it is precisely this fact provides the for one of the rare similarities between the three architects from Barcelona , and some university professors who have applied to the project .
Miguel Roldán , Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona : the tender is appropriate .
For Roldán `` it is necessary , '' after the attack on the coast on the `` front of the mountains , '' as far as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda , green apples , has not been resolved .
`` It should be based on the principle that is Barcelona 's biggest park is the beach .
Among other things , because it is accessible .
Collserola is more complex , `` the architect , for which the title '' gates of Collserola lexikalische `` '' lexikalische trap `` : it must not `` as access to a park , but as a containment of areas where action must be taken . ''
Modol , like Roldán and Bayona with urban experience , viewed the proposal as a `` intellectual challenge '' that `` the number of risks . ''
Dangers arising from the `` uncertainty , the creation of a public space today '' after the experience of the 1980s , which in the area of the forum `` swan song . ''
The first fear is his own limits on what can be developed .
`` Something always means to determine the next step , '' i. e. to exceed it .
`` We need to think about new urban planning tools , because the current [ references to the plan , General Metropolitano ( PGM ) ] can lead to a real disaster . ''
Modol , closer to the question , says simplified , the side of Collserola , in the direction of Valle sana , `` can be understood as a park , not at Barcelona , '' for purely topographical reasons .
Modol reminds us that there is already a study from the Patronat de Collserola , which is not `` fallen on deaf ears , '' even though the city council is grateful that his body has given the opportunity to participate in this project `` from the very first moment . ''
He also notes that the proximity of the mountains to the city , which allows the architects to participate in the debate , even though he his `` doubts '' whether this technical profile created multidisciplinary teams ( `` exactly the right thing , `` he says ) , '' we architects should only be a tool. ``
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the title of the article is complex , because in the tender conditions a global view of Collserola : `` there have been advertised 16 contests in the sample , '' he says , `` on the axis mountain sea . but there is no Längsschnittperspektive , which considers the territory in its entirety . ''
This has , at least in his case that he is taking part in the 16 competitions .
Otherwise , the programme and the definition of a project for a goal with the architects of the Tors clash .
In his opinion , the city should guarantee that the strip directly on the Ronda de Dalt in its whole length is a soft transition between city and green zones .

The schnurrbärtige plumber is breaking with `` Super Mario 3D country , '' the third dimension
Super Mario has worked tirelessly for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser , but until now never in three dimensions : `` Super Mario 3D country , '' he fights for the love of the girls in Stereo technology .
The game , which this month on the Ladentheken all over the world , played from the beginning of the characteristics of the portable console Nintende 3DS , without special glasses three-dimensional can be played .
`` Mario is the figure who must say how the Stereoskopie works without glasses , '' assured Omar Alvarez , who is responsible for the Nintendo press specialising in Spain during the presentation of the video game in Madrid .
Álvarez said , `` Super Mario 3D country '' was `` the first video game from Nintendo , which from the outset has been developed for this console , '' because until now have been successful articles such as '' Star Fox 64 3D `` or '' Zelda : Ocarine of time 3D `` adaptations of existing titles .
The spokesman for Nintendo stressed that , even though it is three-dimensional , `` Super Mario 3D country '' is a `` affordable '' video game , which will permit a quick , liquid game .
Alvarez confirmed that `` Super Mario 3D '' two games in one : the first part is `` easy '' to the less geschckten users .
Then the experts on the various levels , which are becoming more and more difficult , a `` second round . ''
It also allows users in real time between a `` aggressive D '' or one that only the depth of the action . In order to overcome the obstacles , without the victims of the `` optical effects , '' however , must always be played three-dimensional .
This excursion Super Marios into three-dimensional world also means the return of the figure to a portable console , which is no longer the case since 2005 .
With this video game Nintendo zwinkert fans of the saga , and repeated the recipe for success of the last spending : the schnurrbärtige plumber must overcome with dangers peppered platforms in order to liberate the Princess Peach .
However , the players on news of the movements , the environment , the guises and enemies - and a `` spielbaren '' Luigi .

Patti LaBelle indicted because they allegedly forced a toddler from fear to erbrechen
A New York family claims that the disco diva Patti LaBelle in the lobby of their Manhattaner building , a Tobsuchtanfall , their small daughter in fear that they fear .
The tirade of `` Lady Marmalade '' singer was 18 months old Genevieve Monk suffers such fear that they `` personality changes , sleep disorder '' and `` increased fear of foreigners , '' said her family before the Supreme Court in Manhattan .
It was on 10 November last year , when the stagehands Kevin Monk , his wife , Anna , a kindergarten teacher , and on a family outing Genevieve wanted to leave .
While Kevin Monk , the car , Rose Anna Monk with baggage and Genevieve on the arm in the lobby in her building on the River Side Boulevard .
Roseanna Monk said that she had stopped near the door and dropped her daughter for a moment .
`` Someone was behind me and said : '' you know what your daughter is doing ? `` I said , '' yes ' , and in order to take them back on the arm , `` she said .
LaBelle warned the pregnant woman angry .
`` She said in an aggressive tone : '' You should not sell your daughter in the vicinity of the door , `` said Rose Anna Monk .
`` I said to her : '' I am not interested in what you say or think. ``
She was angry and began to shout - she used the F word and the word and was very loud ... .
She had a bottle of water in the hand and began to dump water from the bottle .
She said Genevieve would become hysterical .
`` I said to this woman : '' you see what you have done with my daughter , `` said the mother of the child .
LaBelle crashed on the mother , who still Genevieve was on the arm , and her companion had withheld and be drawn into a waiting car , said Rose Anna Monk .
The baby cried so much that it had to , she said .
Later , the family asked LaBelle in writing for an apology , but received no response .
LaBelles lawyer and representatives did not respond to phone calls in which was asked for an opinion .
The complaint is not going to some compensation , but the family lawyer , Sam Davis , said that he would not be a fee , and the family plan , the money they get , the children 's cancer aid donations .
`` We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for their behavior , '' said Davis .
`` This kind of behaviour is totally unacceptable , especially if it is a kindergarten teacher , a 18 - month-old baby on the arm . ''

Troops feel more sympathy than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala , the millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City .
Kid Rock sang a Ballade about helplessness , frustration and loss .
In a word collected themselves hundreds of soldiers , sailors , pilots and marines around him .
The crowd in black Smokings stood up and applauded .
`` The soldiers and soldiers were seen as heroes , '' said David Saltzman , who organised the fundraising effort in the spring .
A senior military officer at the gala , which , among other things , by the chief of staff and then chairman , Admiral Mike Mullen has been observed , saw the role of the troops in a different way .
`` They were introduced as orphans , '' the officer wrote in an e-mail .
I am sure the organizers have good intentions .
I know that .
But there was no respect , not really . It was pity .
The stark contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the most distant , sometimes admiring American public .
The troops are showered with praise for their victims .
But the praise has its price , service members say .
The public is increasingly behaving as if their people in uniform suffering .
`` We were not victims , '' said Brigadier general Sean B. MacFarland , who commanded the troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan .
`` But it is the only way of support , to put ourselves in the role of unfortunate souls . ''
The issue is extremely sensitive for military leaders , who do not want ungrateful or in dispute with the public they serve .
They also have recognized that the anger , the returning troops in the last few years of the Vietnam War , was far worse .
As a result there are discussions about compassion in silence and private between war veterans .
After his two sons have returned from battles with the marines , warned Colonel ex-army Mark Cancian that people outside the military world their service could be seen from two different perspectives .
Some would view them with a sense of awe , as they defeated rebels and travelled to exotic places .
Others would wonder whether a `` angry , violent veteran beneath the surface , '' said Cancian , who had fought in Iraq and a senior government posts in Washington after his return .
During his job search , he said , he felt that some of the interviewer erfragten subtle , whether he was the same after his return from the struggle to cope with the pressure of a demanding post in Washington .
`` If you are talking about your service , you must keep the negative impressions about it , '' Cancian said his sons .
The lack of ease of the military is rooted in part in the lack of interest in the war .
Services on the battlefield of a country that has little experience with the military and little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , rarely singled out as praise .
`` We as a nation , not military heroism , as it was in the Second World War was absolutely normal , '' said Lieutenant General David Barno , the U.S. troops in Afghanistan .
Instead , the praise of politicians and the public largely due to the suffering of a service member .
Troops find recognition for the number of attacks they have endured , the number of friends who have lost them , or for the severity of their injuries .

The CDU proposes that the EU president due to choose general vote
The first day of the congress of the Christian Democrats ( CDU on Monday , 14 November in Leipzig for Angela Merkel , Chancellor and leader of the Christian Democratic party , without any real trouble .
The future of Europe was not originally envisaged in the programme , but has prevailed in the autumn , especially for those activists to make the government policy regarding the Greeks today and possibly Italy tomorrow as too lax .
The presidential motion proposed by the Bureau of the European Commission was adopted almost unanimously .
Under 1001 delegates had only nine , ten had abstained from the vote .
The several minutes of standing ovation on the basis of which Interventionserlässen at first , Angela Merkel , as well as a few hours later , Wolfgang Schäuble , were not by the three European zugeneigten Finance Minister no doubt .
The main idea of the Chancellor , as well as the Antrage - the following slogan : the response to the crisis is `` not less but more Europe . ''
It is not only because Europe means peace , but also because `` nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro . ''
For the Chancellor , `` the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe . ''
This could come through the control of the European Union , reinforcing modification of the Treaty of Lisbon on the budget policies of the countries in the euro zone , as it could also be in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of general vote `` in order to give Europe a face . ''
But in any case , this is one of the amendment proposals approved by Congress , which clearly Wolfgang Schäuble godfather .
Certainly , it is unlikely that the 47 quickly agree on this revolution : Great Britain is opposed to the cause , and the chief of the CDU think to know that Nicolas Sarkozy is of the same opinion .
But the milestone is .
Similarly , the delegates in an overwhelming majority the proposal of the weighting of each country according to the executive Board rejected the weighting of the individual economies , which is obviously a strong position in Germany .
The calming the climate within their party Chancellor has therefore reference points to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl , however , it has not tried to Congress at the expense of the `` small '' or the European countries in difficulties to win immediately criticize the arrogant Germany immediately .
As far as the resolution of the importance of the `` Franco-German friendship '' a clause , Angela Merkel , France does not call on the plan .
At least not directly .
Because it reminds us that Leipzig two centuries ago , at the centre of a bloody battle .
In fact , one of the zuhöchst humiliating defeat of the Napoleonic army .

When they , along with Diane Sawyer in the ABC News `` 20/20 , '' they struggled for words and needed help in walking .
The program showed the heavy slow recovery from the damage that the bullet that divided their durchbohrt skull , the left side of her brain and its head from start to finish , has done .
Three months ago , she returned surprising in the Congress , triumphantly cast their vote on the debt .
In her first television interview after the attack in January in which six people were killed and 13 injured , smiling Gifford , laughed and sang - and described their recovery as `` difficult . ''
When Sawyer asked her how she felt , Gifford replied ( 41 ) : `` It is very good . ''
The interview with Gifford and her husband , astronaut Mark Kelly , was part of an one-hour `` 20/20 '' Specials , which was recorded shortly before the publication of the new book by the couple : `` Gabby : a story about courage and hope . ''
The Special followed Giffords recovery since the attack on 8 January .
In videos that Kelly had recorded in the first few weeks , you can see it in the hospital bed , with kahl shaved head and a long scarf on the market .
It can only one or two fingers when her husband encouraged them .
Months later , Giffords sits in a wheelchair , while therapists show how they implement simple movements .

A Zucken with the lips .
And then , her first words : `` What . ''
After a few days ago Giffords whispering another word : `` toast . '' you want to see their breakfast .
Videos taken place in the ABC show , show that music played an important role in Giffords '' recovery : you can see how the members of Congress , along with the therapists to Cyndi Laupers `` Girls Just Wan na Have Fun '' and Tom Pettys `` Free Fallin '' `` singing . ''
In the interview with Sawyer said Giffords daily spends two hours with therapy that they do not remember the day of the attack .
Her husband said that he Giffords on 12 March had read an article in a newspaper on the attack when they interrupted him and asked for the first time , the six people who were killed during the attack .
The alleged shooter Jared Lee Loughner sits in a prison in Missouri and forced medical treatment while waiting for his trial .
`` Many people have died , '' Giffords told Sawyer .
`` Tough , tough , tough . ''
In the course of the recovery of his wife , Kelly told Sawyer , she said : `` I was hit . ''
`` So , I would say : '' Gabby , you got to be unbeaten ? ' , `` said Kelly .
You just got to be taken .
And you will be , and you will recover and you will come back stronger than ever before .

Terrorist front , from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the relationship between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the sect Boko Haram .
It has long been under suspicion of relations between the terrorist group al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb ( Aqmi ) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seem to confirm .
On Sunday , the Algerian Vice Auβenminister Abdel Kader Messahel himself confirmed that Algiers now `` certainty . ''
`` The way in which both organizations , as well as the relations of the secret services point to a clear cooperation , '' he said without going into detail .
Paris seems to make a similar analysis .
The investigation on the last January abduction of two Frenchmen in Niger have promoted interfaces .
In a restaurant in Niamey by supporters of the Aqmi gekidnappten Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory are on the following day , at the same time as several of their captors during an operation carried out by the French special forces have been getöten .
French and Nigerian investigators want to be found in the rubble at the site several phone chips , which were the terrorists .
Terrorist axis
The analysis of the telephone calls leads to several interlocutors who are stationed in Mali , Niger and Nigeria .
According to Radio France Internationale ( RFI ) , the investigators particularly interested in the numbers of two interlocutors : a number leads to a Nigerian who for a long time in Maiduguri , a city in northern Nigeria , the cradle of Boko Haram had stopped ; the other leads to a man who , as the Aqmi and the sect close .
`` This is a step forward , but there is no doubt that we have to wait for clearer evidence before we can talk of an operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem . ''
`` It is conceivable . ''
`` You know for years that the sect financial and intellectual support of foreign policy , and that this is increasingly active , '' the Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo .
In these last few months this `` assistance '' in its course has become ever more obvious , as well as the speeches , as well as the operational modes of Boko Harem , which is now on the arrival of suicide bombers , as well as the use of evidence always complex explosives , which bear the same hallmarks as those used by Aqmi .
The international community to begin in Washington , has been in place since that time pressure on Abuja to be there for the problems caused by Boko Haram .
The Nigerian authorities have deemed the grouping , in fact , for a long time as a community of Illuminaten , no special attention .
Rapid success
In 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque , a school , as well as the fundamentalist Imam Mohammed Yusuf founded Boko Haram - which in Haoussa means `` Western education is a disgrace '' - the establishment of an Islamic sultanate in the Muslim north .
In this poor region , the merger of rapid success .
It is politicised and strict observance of Sharia law , while its affiliated activists in the fight against the godless central government .
The activists have first churches , bars and authorities .
In 2009 , the Boko Haram militants stepped up attacks against the stations are particularly active .
The reaction from Abuja is , however , as usual , indifferenziert .
The army surrounded the city , it is one of 800 people dead .
In captivity , Mohammed Yusuf was killed in prison .
As a result , the sect is becoming increasingly radical and leaves their strongholds in the north .
Last Christmas known to an attack in Jos , which claimed 80 lives , then another in Abuja .
In June , Boko Haram is allocated to the of Selbstmordattentates , secure police headquarters in Abuja - the first of its kind .
In August , the local headquarters of the United Nations to focus international targets .
The formation of a terrorist axis in Africa , from Mauritania to Nigeria to Somalia , since all security experts .
While the Aqmi Mali and Niger , which operates Somalis of al Shabaab in Kenya , Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the centre of the continent .
Last week , hatta Alain Juppé during a meeting with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria warned against Boko Harem and shown itself willing to `` all the evidence . ''

Europe has invented democracy , we will have to rethink the European democracy
Democracy is a valuable asset , there is also a sensitive commodity .
The European continent should remind themselves , who after their invention in Athens , more than two thousand years ago , the entire 20th century on the tragedies of the First World War , of totalitarianism , of Holocaustes , the Gulag , but also in Franco 's Spain , Salazars in Portugal and the Supreme in Greece .
Some were believed that it will be enough to exercise the right to vote , and direktest possible way for democracy once and for all to win over their enemies .
We know since Napoleon `` small '' that it was a feature of the spirit .
The general election law , the necessary condition of democracy is not a sufficient condition and may well be `` repressive instrument , '' as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot said .
No , democracy requires much more : a public space , a public spirit , values , an organisation , separation of powers and control , training , education , economic and social community spirit , a jurisdiction .
The crisis in Europe , which we find ourselves in is an economic crisis , but it is just as much and , above all , politics and democracy crisis .
The change of heart of the Greek casual counterfeiting referendum would have been doubly interesting character in this respect : the need for a powerful return of the policy , on the other hand , but also those of the disturbing sense of the impossibility of their Unangebrachtheit .
This ambivalence should be seen as outdated .
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle today , and that the Republican soldiers , or at least most of them , no longer in the right direction .
We have nothing to gain , in order to push for the success of the national referendum , which , in accordance with the requirements and has been organised in a perverse sequence .
A free ticket for the European dictator or a leap into the void of the nationalist withdrawal : a great choice for the citizen .
No , we want to Hackebeil , but a collective task , quite rightly , clear and steady , an election and democracy , this time at the European level .
There is no crisis in Greece , Italy , Spain and Portugal - you know , in fact , no longer where to put an end to the list - because there is only one crisis , and this is in Europe .
It is the whole of Europe , bowing to the dictates of the markets and the credit rating agencies , which is suffering from its impotence and his lack of solidarity .
It is the whole of Europe , which is humiliated at international level .
It is concerned about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - it is an Europe that is gradually losing its sovereignty , and every one of its affiliated nations .
The urgency is to give the popular sovereignty , the leadership of the European project .
Because it is located on the whole , whether the Europeans reduce the burden of their debts , from the markets and to build a future investment .
The exit from the crisis has taken decisions at European level on the condition , which can not be taken without complete democratic legitimacy , without us quite sure to lead to destruction .
After this proposal by Jacques Delors and the Socialists fought for a long time , it is now pushing the European economic governance .
I agree .
But this without political integration and greater democracy - as they have in mind - that would be a renewed folly and another impasse .
We need a new stage of European integration .
In order to create the Republic in France , it took the Republicans to `` create . ''
The revolution of interests alone was not enough .
This instruction remains valid .
We need to a better economically integrated Europe .
This can only be achieved by creating a politically more democratic Europe , a truly European popular sovereignty .
We need Europeans to build Europe .

Agricultural speculation
German bank leaves commodity business
Christian Teevs
The Deutsche Bank business with agricultural commodities ?
According to online information , Josef Ackermann has appointed a working group to examine the impact of speculation for the poor of the world .
In January , the CEO 's wants to draw conclusions .
Hamburg .
The matter is clear : 84 percent of Germans for the German citizens find it unacceptable , according to a study that banks with agricultural commodities such as wheat or corn .
Two thirds of respondents want the Deutsche Bank and other lending institutions out of this business , because it exacerbates the problems of the poorest people in the world .
This is the result of a Forsa survey commissioned by the consumer organisation Foodwatch .
The study is based on a report that Foodwatch in mid-October .
It shows the author Harald Schumann , betting on the global commodity markets prices soar - and the banks are partly to blame for the global hunger problem .
The campaign of consumer protection is directed specifically against Deutsche Bank chief Josef Ackermann , even if big banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley .
Commodity bets were originally intended for traders hedge against price fluctuations .
But now , most experts agree that the gamblers have decoupled from supply and demand - and at the expense of the poorest profits .
Unlike the U.S. competitors Ackermann responded to the criticism : he promised to investigate the allegations and said that no business is worth it `` the good name of the Deutsche Bank to gamble . ''
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE an International working group is currently examining the allegations from the Foodwatch Report .
By the end of the year is expected to be completed , then the results will be presented to the board of Deutsche Bank , with a recommendation on how to deal with it .
At the end of January , the head of the bank wants to tell us what consequences .
In the end , could be a reduction in the commodity business , or even the complete departure .
Ackermann fusses over his image
Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode welcomed the news , but at the same time , however , his criticism of the financial industry : `` the betting on rising prices of food particularly dramatic shows how reckless banks today , the common good . ''
Ackermann stand as a top bank lobbyist now , especially in the duty .
`` The Deutsche Bank must remove all assets from its portfolio , where money will be used for betting on food prices , '' said Bode .
`` No matter whether it is Mr Ackermann hunger suffering people or the reputation of the German Bank . ''
The insight of Ackermann is surprising at first glance , it is clear , however , that the CEO 's just a few months before his departure from office would like to make a perfect picture .
On Monday , the Deutsche Bank announced that the CEO differently than planned will not change in the supervisory board .
In a move away from the controversial agricultural speculation he could improve his image .
And it needs for possible losses to be little fun - after all , his successor would have to do so .
Every second would cancel commodity crops
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager .
So far , more than 30,000 Internet users took part in the campaign of the organisation .
On Tuesday , Bode published the poll , for which the institute Forsa on 7 and 8 November has interviewed 1001 people .
Just 11 percent think it is legitimate that the Deutsche Bank facilities , where bets on food prices .
Many bank customers would also draw personal conclusions when they learn that their bank is involved in such transactions : Every second , according to the survey would terminate all installations where money is flowing into commodity speculation .
43 % would advise friends of such a bank , 49 percent said they consider to terminate their accounts and to switch to another institution .

Athens casts doubt again
Papadimos says the austerity measures would be adopted , but the Conservatives will sign a written agreement
With the risk premiums in the peripheral countries and insecurity among disruptive Greece strays in the labyrinth that of the great European debt crisis .
The impression that the `` consensus '' of the new Greek interim government is more likely is a response to pressure from Brussels as a genuine conviction of political forces , slowly by the facts .
While the new Prime Minister , Lukas Papadimos , pointed out yesterday that there were no alternatives to the structural reforms and that the agreed at the time of his appointment a hundred days may be too short for their implementation , assured the leader of the Conservative Party Nueva Democracia , Antonis Samaras , that the new austerity measures and support and in any case , his call for new elections on the planned date of 19 February , will be back .
`` The most important task of this government is the implementation of the decisions taken at the summit of 26 October , '' assured Papadimos yesterday at the opening of a parliamentary debate tomorrow with the vote of confidence for the new government will reach its peak .
A package of 24 programmes to promote employment , the reform of the disciplinary law for civil servants and new measures against tax evasion are the first initiatives .
Nevertheless , Samaras communication acknowledges the doubts about his position : `` We have committed to support the transitional government , but otherwise nothing . ''
The conservative leader was a step too far with his challenge to the EU and the IMF , the body of the 8 000 million Athens urgently needed entsperren , and he made it clear that he would not be undertaking on the implementation of the austerity measures .
But the European Commission , because of the impact of the poker game with Papandreu referendum is still irritated , yesterday reaffirmed its demand was not changed : the economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties `` a clear written agreement as soon as possible '' to sign .
The spokesman of the Ministry of Economic Affairs , Amadeu Altafaj , said that the inspectors of the troika `` very soon '' to return to Athens , in order to discuss with the new government , `` for the payment of the sixth section of 8000 million euros '' is needed , `` although there is still no final date .

The possibility of the ballots in Michoacán individual auszuzählen will be considered
According to the information provided by PREP , the difference between the first and second place in the election of the governor just 27 percent , with 879 votes from a total of 6074 have not yet been counted .
The possibility of individual counting of the ballots in this year 's elections in Michoacán a reality , because the Preliminares oral Programa de Resultados Electorales Preliminares ( PREP ) issued data is the difference between the first and second place in the gubernatorial elections nearly 27 percent , with 879 votes not yet counted a total yet been counted .
In this sense , the President of the Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán ( IEM ) , María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza , recalled that just adopted last November 9 , the election of a series of regulations on the harmonisation of local rules with the reforms of the federal states in Electoral matters .
It should be remembered that Michoacán neither his political constitution nor his electoral law nor its law on the election of justice had adapted to the reforms adopted by Congress , so that they in this round were in force , but the governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided their publication in the Gazette within the deadlines with the argument that have any objections .
On 9 November , the Supreme Court of Mexico ( SCJN ) on the constitutional complaint filed by the local legislature and , the voice of the State Ombudsman on the constitutional reforms as `` invalid and illegal '' because it does not have the right to `` decide or a veto against it . ''
María de los Ángeles Llanderal said in an interview about the possibility of a single count of the votes that , thanks to the adoption of the directives by the Consejo General del IEM now the possibility that the local election authority , the ballot papers partially or completely auszählen .
Under the following conditions in one or more electoral packages contained votes will be counted partial results in the protocols do not agree ; the protocol on the counting of and calculation is not an excessive or it is not in possession of the chairman of the electoral commission or there are obvious errors or amendments in the protocols .
In addition , the total count of the total ausgefüllten ballot papers will be carried out if there is a difference between the presumed winner and the second place is the same or less than one percent , provided at the beginning of the session is an explicit request from the party or coalition chairman , the second of the candidates .
The counting of votes can also be carried out in its entirety , if it is after completion of the proper calculation that the difference between the presumed winner and the candidate on the second place equal to or less than one percent , provided that there is an explicit request from a representative of the party , whose candidate has become the second . In this case , the election packages were exposed to a partial recount were excluded .
It is worth noting that the elections in Morelia in the same situation , where , according to PREP the difference between the first and second place just under 0.16 % , even though the votes of 129 of a total of 923 election protocols have not yet been counted .

V Need for steroids : `` the run '' - the illegal race across America
Recession
The original careless journey through a series of completely preventable , amateurish mistakes routine journey to the early class .
It was able to meet the ambitions for the most part , but what is the point , though obviously had no desire to do a bit more .
Even before he came to the counter , the new part with the subtitle `` the run '' high expectations .
He promised to postpone the game series '' Need for speed `` bejahrte into a new dimension and in the spielbaren demonstration examples seemed not only one of many Action Rennspielen .
We were also curious as to how the eingepassten passages , in which the main protagonist is rising from the car and on foot .
But how it is used in NFS , is much different than we had expected .
Sure , there are potentially quite decent Arkade race , but overall , the game will be diminished by some unnecessary mistakes in this series , more or less for a few years .
So there are no more mistakes , but rather signs of unbegreiflichen laziness in principle laziness of the games developers .
The adventure begins very well .
Firstly , it will be introduced into the story , whose main character , Jack certain problems of a personal character ; the only solution seems to be in an illegal race across America .
In San Francisco , on the west coast , to the steering wheel - with the task , as the first in New York .
The basic idea involves a number of interesting elements .
The entire route is divided into 10 stages and more than fifty individual race .
This means that each race will be fought on the other route and that the various stages in different degrees , sufficiently different and interesting environment .
There is no moment the impression that the game would continue to offer the same thing .
Some areas are still very nicely , even though the technical level of graphics on the earlier parts of the series .
So nothing to write home about .
But the journey through the desert , autumn landscape or high through deep snow landscape we visually very pleasant .
Every now and again bring atypical elements a little change in the individual race .
In the desert , for example , will be surprised by a desert storm , which is the point of view .
In the mountains , in turn , must be extremely careful that we will not be buried by an avalanche .
Incidentally , are fairly well in the individual race .
Only a few , but they are .
For a while trying to overtake the mandatory number of opponents ( in principle , a classic race ) , then you have time to catch up ( classic race against the stopwatch ) , then expect a personal duel with a single opponent .
And also the police , who wants to blow the whole thing .
A novelty are passages in which Jack leaves the car .
This is more about certain interactive animation , in which Jack fleeing anybody else , and where he must help the players , the right button at the right moment .
So nothing complicated .
It is surprising , however , that there is much less such passages in the game , as one would expect ( actually only three ) .
Ultimately , it is more likely to advantage , because this element has at least a chance to be boring - it is in the context of the above mentioned on the elements that make the game more .
The Fahrmodell is progressing in the Fußtapfen of previous parts .
In other words , from today 's viewpoint , no trees , on the other hand , you could not claim that it would be a bad thing .
Anyone who seeks realistic simulations must look elsewhere .
But an aktionsgeladenen Rennfahren , the European Fahrmodell will continue quite well , although we could be in the competition .
In the meantime , so far , everything is fine .
Real problems only after a certain time .
In contrast to the driving model the collision model is not quite OK .
> From a game of this type , it is hard to expect that it is difficult to calculate deformations and collisions , but if you virtually no impact on any idea how the car is , then it is obviously not everything is in order .
A typical example : the close or passing of oncoming cars `` touched upon '' the other car in some places only slightly in the other , almost identical situation but tailspin and wild performance .
Or the Karre to scrap .
Thanks to the Restart-Systems is nothing more , it is annoying .
The remaining Arts are resolved : if you write-off or far away from the route , then the game back to the last point of reference .
Only - in every race has only five restarts .
If they are exhausted , everything is going on .
The restarts are more such as a tool for the event that something does not succeed , but rely on it should not .
Sometimes , however , does not help the Restart , there is nothing else helps to learn the critical section from the head .
It is extremely unfortunate that the same things often happen in the same places .
Some curves must be , for example , in a very specific way , otherwise it is not easy .
Elsewhere , the appropriate place `` civilian '' cars are always in the same configuration , no matter whether it was the first or fifth , five seconds sooner or later a minute .
This is particularly galling in situations when we see that the opponent before a romped to two oncoming cars , but even there , the cars are already in such a position that they must avoid or delay .
And it does not matter when you arrive , everything is designed so that this situation is always close to your nose .
The opponents have other advantages .
In the game , there are a few places where you are always in the same place will be overtaken by the same opponents , and again without regard to the timing .
The most madman 's is at the end of the game on the long bridge , which is happening in the opposite direction .
The opponent must seem hell bent on overtaking .
And if he is already facing a , then he is the point of view , of course , so that they their own car a few times in Klump .
Clearly , we want to make the game simply more exciting and exciting but this intention is so clear that they quickly spoiled the joy of the game .
And that is a pity , because despite einfacherem model is the game as a whole rather entertaining and sometimes action that you almost no longer know where it is one of the head .
And , in principle , no matter what `` guilt '' - the concept of fifty unique routes , the Order of the race in a way that no boredom can boredom , or something completely different ...
An unusual idea is also the change in the course of the race .
We must not overlook garages , because it is precisely here that we can change the car , even though in most cases , the car is enough .
The cars are divided into three categories .
The sports cars are well suited for urban areas , the strong American limousines for the highways and exotic sportwagen for the technical crews , for example , on the Serpentinen in the mountains .
Hand in hand with the history of the game is also the aufgaben mode ( challenges ) - the race in the individual which we know from history .
This is not just medals , but also to gain experience points for their own profile , the common tasks ( challenges ) and history .
In order to achieve higher driver , must be open to various objects : from the car to the baker 's grounds for the profile .
This is at the same time , the role of online Autolog which , among other things , its own results compared with those of other players , and also provides for more collective functions .
One of the other incomprehensible Schnitzers is a situation in the last race of the story .
This is the car in a subway tunnel ( a ) , where in the dark on the rails long ( a ) .
On the tachograph paragraphs between 150 200 km/h ( say ) , but there is an underground and an uncompromising to scrap .
In our editorial , we will still argue about whether this was a blackout of game makers , or whether the authors for so stupid .
The technical side is nothing Überwältigendes but at least the visual overall impression is , in most cases , appealing , and here and there , even brilliant .
It is all the more galling is that in a few exciting moments , the wiederhol rate is slower , and sometimes quite dramatically .
This is particularly the accidents with greater numbers of do , where a continuous FPS anyway .
The Tonwiedergabe is OK , and the sound track is a matter of taste .
In a bid to such a broad as possible rather young audience , a sound track a lá `` of all things '' - but who is buying such a game because of the music ? !
The overall impression of Need for steroids : The run ? The feelings are more mixed .
If the game does not mention totally unnecessary mistakes , we would have been able to argue with a true ring of conviction that the run is the best piece of NFS in recent years .
But the game somehow unfinished .
For a great pleasure , but we should be prepared for the fact that these mistakes with the power of airport lights in the eye .

Queen Sofía : `` These are instruments for progress and hope ''
The Queen stressed the `` dominant '' position in Spain in relation to this type of financing
Spain `` has world a dominant position in the role of the public financing . ''
The Queen Sofía of Spain reminded yesterday that Spain is in the last two decades around the world for the second donor to this means of international cooperation . The `` essence '' is based on the fact that it was a `` tool for social progress , justice and hope for a better future for the whole of humanity on the basis of trust in the people . ''
The Queen yesterday inaugurated the fifth world summit on micro-credit in Valladolid . She was convinced that there is `` no doubt '' that this type of business would be `` absolutely essential '' to the United Nations by the year 2015 to achieve the millennium goals and `` especially the goal , the number of people with incomes of less than a dollar a day , below the poverty line . ''
Spain `` will continue to work on the expansion of the network '' until the last corner of the world , and it does this task responsibly , `` said the Queen Sofia , who hopes that the initiatives and contributions from the summit , which lasts until Thursday , will be '' the creation of new capacity and better opportunities for the poorest people , and especially for women , `` as the main beneficiaries of these loans are guaranteed .
`` We have many successes recorded '' and `` face many challenges . ''
The summit on micro-credit is not only a forum for debate , but also a platform to push `` two fundamental goals . ''
The Queen said that it will be that by the end of the year 2015 , 175 million poor families have access to these financial services and that 10 million of these households will exceed the poverty line .
The concept of micro-credit in Spain and the rest of the world Muhammad Yunus , `` a few years ago initiated way back '' to the Queen Sofia as a `` act of justice and recognition . ''
The father of this financial instrument described it as a `` admirable idealists committed to the fight against poverty '' and whose work they have known for 15 years ago , when the Queen visited Bangladesh to learn about the lending strategy on the ground .
This experience was followed a year later the first world summit in Washington and further meetings in the Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006 . In all , `` we are witnessing a steady development , '' said the Queen , whose commitment to this project yesterday the assessment as `` the head of the family '' in Valladolid and as a `` advocate of the poor . ''
Finally , the Queen Sofia ended her speech by the people to participate in the debate and to search for solutions in the fight against poverty .
`` Ethical imperative ''
The Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity `` an ethical imperative '' for the whole of the democratic state .
In this sense , he said , it was a mistake to link development aid in times of economic boom , because it was a `` lasting commitment . ''
Jiménez was of the opinion that the micro-credit is a `` serious and rigorous policy to eradicate poverty , '' and that the governments of the industrialized countries are now `` more than ever , '' would have to work for solidarity criteria , and not to allow the solidarity of the crisis .
For Spain , microcredit is one of the most important forms of development aid. ``
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation , Soraya Rodríguez , applauded `` success , '' '' marginalized `` people , '' the are always closed doors `` to give '' hope `` and the mayor of Valladolid , Francisco Javier León de la Riva , the present in a city , '' its doors , infected by the spirit of solidarity .

Darina Rychtářová over their forsaking Gatten :
Iveta - this donkey can keep you , I do not want him more !
Darina Rychtářová ( 53 ) says - now is over .
After her husband Josef Rychtář ( 53 ) from the protector of Iveta Bartošová ( 45 ) , their lover , Darina still hope that Josef from his rosy dream and come home .
But it is now , finally , with the patience and for the life she has clear rules .
`` Josef can come home , but not more than my partner , '' said D. Rychtářová .
When Darina Rychtáová singer I. Bartošová refuge in her own house , she would probably not even dream , like that with her husband .
As Iveta at their urging , after 30 days and back to Říčany , Josef was the same .
Indeed , he confessed publicly that they love .
At the time Darina resigned , it even seemed as if she wanted to reconcile with her relinquishing man - but it gave him the sack .
Rychytář it does not matter , with whom his wife is sleeping

Anti-Islamic crimes and offences have increased by 50 %
The directed against Muslims crimes and offences have increased from 2009 to 2010 by 50 % , whereas other racially or religiously motivated crimes of violence , according to the FBI statistics published on Monday in the same period either slightly decreased or increased slightly .
According to this data is the total number of violent crimes committed against Muslims from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010 , has risen by 49 % , whereas a 13 % increase in the number of acts of violence against Catholics , a 4 % drop in crimes against Jews , as well as a global increase of 14 % of religious crimes and offences .
The total number of `` hate crimes '' in a very weak Maβe 6628 cases , including 47.3 % racial differences and 20 % motivated by religious differences crimes , such as the FBI .
`` After a slowdown in 2009 , it is disturbing that these crimes and offences will grow again , '' said the human rights organisation human rights First , `` the rise of anti-Islamic violence is particularly significant , '' the organisation added in a statement .
`` Human rights First , had been stressed that the violence directed against Muslims , as well as all forms of hate crimes as a serious infringement of human rights should be considered , '' added Paul Legendre , a representative of the organisation .
`` The American government can and should do more to combat these attacks , '' he added under assessment that this improvement in the police attitude towards the `` hate crimes '' could be carried out .
The `` hate crimes '' is in the U.S. federal law as a legacy from the era of the struggle for civil rights .
This legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King , in order to punish acts of violence directed against race , colour , religion or ethnic origin , and now also offences of sexual identity .

Walls have eyes : how researchers watching you on Facebook
Before he became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe was Anders Behring Breivik , only one of many boys , their anti-immigration views online .
On Monday , Breivik , who has been on a killing spree in Norway in July , in which 77 people were killed , its first public hearing before the court .
Although Breivik may have acted alone , he is far from alone in cyberspace : he has spent much time until his attack before his computer and with some of the millions of gechattet nationalists , the extreme right-wing groups on social networks .
After the tragedy of this summer , researchers wanted to find out more about these people .
But , as we find them ?
This is easy - you need only log on Facebook .
`` We have found that it was not difficult to come to them , '' says Jamie Bartlett , the main author of a recent report by the British think-tank DEMOS on the digital populism in Europe .
Were books hiding place of personal data is so enzyklopädisch , Bartlett says that the researchers simply must use the promotional tool of their desired demographic data to determine exactly with scientific accuracy - as do retailers for years .
Bartletts team found half a million supporters of far-right groups throughout Europe and visierte them with Adds , but instead with a new band or to connect a new diet product Adds invited users to a poll in which , according to their level of education , their attitude towards violence and the assessment of their own future .
Thanks to Facebook Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview more than 10,000 followers of 14 extremely right-wing parties in 11 European countries - without that they had to leave their office .
`` It is a fairly new research method , '' says Bartlett .
Some of the results are hardly surprising . Online promoters of extreme-right groups are mostly young , male and resent the immigration .
But in a way surprising meanings are `` those who combine their online activism with an offline activism more sensible , more democratic and less violent than those who sit behind their computer screens . ''
Demos work is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists .
Factories , medical researchers and political scientists use the side in order to study everything from health issues to social trends , such as `` Likes '' text messages and status updates .
With more than 800 million active users , on average three content per day , were books generated `` data supernova explosion , '' a research boom , the number of scientific work with the name of this side of the title in the last five years by almost 800 % increase .
For some researchers is the beauty of Facebook , the fact that you can study this side of people not normally with his Clipboard on the street .
`` If you previously tried to consult the British National Party , it was very difficult to identify them . ''
`` They had to first inform the party and they would never have access , '' says Bartlett .
`` Facebook is everything away - you go directly to them . ''
Others say that the side offers an opportunity to identify and solve social health problems .
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin , Madison , and her colleagues found that students who discussed their full binge on Facebook , are significantly more problem than students who remained silent on this issue .
Moreno suggests that equal students , for example , residential adviser , monitor and help a student if they postet too many status updates .
`` You ca n't solve a problem if you have not recognized it , '' said Dimitri Christakis , Morenos Ko-Autor and head of the Child Health , Behavior and Development at the Children 's Research Institute in Seattle , the Washington Post .
`` We have found a way to identify vulnerable children who would not have been found in a different way . ''
Facebook also zapft the data of its own people .
The data team has statistics on the relationship status and Valentine 's Day , turnout in the mid-term elections in 2010 and a national happiness index ( primarily used primarily on the only Facebook access - master of digital freedom have a long time that the side of their large data treasure trove for others available for research purposes . )
But the users of Facebook know that the side they watched , whether they like it or not . with a friend , thousands of miles away , to be able to play Scrabble , the side 's own personal data .
But what if the users of Facebook , part of a survey that they do not even know something ?
While researchers have strictly defined guidelines , such as their offline data collected online , everything is permitted .
`` I do not believe that many users have thought about the fact that researchers could study their profiles , '' says Neil Selwyn , a sociologist at the London Knowledge lab , a study from the year 2006 , in which he looked side of students on Facebook .
`` What they are concerned , it was only about them and their friends . ''
Then there is the question of methodology .
Even offline , there is no guarantee that a research is absolutely honest .
On Facebook , it is impossible to know how many of the claims are true in an user profile and in speeches .
`` What we say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook , are two completely different things , '' says Selwyn .
Therefore , Selwyn thinks despite his years as technology researchers that a Clipboard and a pencil are still the best research tools , anyone can use .
`` There is no substitute for it to go into the real world and to speak with real people , '' he says .
`` Social research must take care of the social dimension - and plenty of social life is still offline . ''

7 lessons of interviews with the late Steve Jobs , which was shown this week in a theatre
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5. some compared him with Henry Ford and stressed the engineering genius as a great modern inventors .
What Apple fans , but perhaps the most telling in the recently discovered jobs interview , which this week dusted off special film displays on the major markets , is how this creative head understood business processes and workflows .
He was certainly a designer , a dreamer and self-proclaimed Hippie , but he was also a meticulous organizer , the zealous Diagrams bastelte - a man who believed that many business leaders suffer from `` a disease of thought , '' '' a really great idea accounts for 90 percent of the work ... [ but ] there is an enormous amount of craft art between a great idea and a great product. ``
In 1995 , Bob Cringely the TV series `` triumph of the specialist idiots '' on the departure of the personal computer , and he sat for more than a hour with jobs , in a rare , detailed discussions .
At this stage than 10 years since Jobs have been forced out of Apple , and he has worked hard on his new computer company NeXT , and looked forward to the widespread adoption of the Internet .
While a small part of Cringleys interview was used in specialist idiots , he says that the Kopiervorlagen of interviews in the delivery .
Only after jobs death we discovered a complete VHS copy in the garage of the director .
This slightly revised footage forms the basis for the 68minütigen film `` Steve Jobs : the lost interview , '' this Wednesday and Thursday in the Mark theatre .
For someone who is known for his extensive interviews , jobs here seems surprisingly eager to explain its technological philosophies and business strategies .
And incredibly thoughtful .
In the course of the interview , it is four times longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds , in which jobs clearly his thoughts and accuracy .
There are also moments in which Jobs '' perfect day comes when he seemingly impatient to Cringelys issues and anschubst , faster on issues or actions of greater importance .
Before the era of Pixar , iPod or iPhone included the lost interview somehow seems eerily prescient when jobs evaluated what other companies in his opinion is right or wrong , and his own vision for the future of the computer .
It is one thing , posthumous awards for career jobs , but jobs are to be seen as the eager dreamers on the leap to the grandeur , is something quite different , original and inspiring .
He has a vision of how things could and should .
Shortly after he had said that everything , he set off and made it .
A quick glance at seven remarkable sequences of Verlorenen interviews :
As he learned to run a business :
`` During the years I always ask : '' Why are you doing things ? `` and the answer you get is , '' Oh , it is made easy. ``
No one knows why he does what he does . Nobody in the business really carefully about things .
I have noticed that .
Jobs will continue its efforts to streamline the accounting for Apple .
Amazed costs were recorded - usually began with `` standard costs , '' which were estimated at a mere suspicion and then adapted with '' deviation `` - he developed an automated factory , which ensured that the business costs in minute .
As the Pope was veralbert :
Jobs told of the `` Blue Box , '' which he has built with Steve Wozniak , a device with which to creep into the telephone company and long-distance calls in vain .
The device has already been written , but jobs enthusiasm when he describes the Blue Box as an act of Selbstbemächtigung is contagious .
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a telephone to make a phone call and then from an AT & T network in another , while so many satellites as possible .
`` We sent half a dozen times around the globe , and if you grölte into the telephone , there was a minute later in the telephone next door , '' kichernd told jobs .
`` We were young and we learned that we can build something that trillions of dollars of infrastructure can control throughout the world . ''
Both of us , we did not know much , but we were able to build this small thing that can control a gigantic thing , it was an incredible lesson and I do not believe that it would be without Apple .
Jobs have been told from a glorious stroke , Wozniak and he almost pulled out when they are in the middle of the night via the Blue Box in the Vatican , and wanted to talk with the Pope , while they are so good they were Henry Kissinger .
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy in the middle of the night were called in to speak with the American diplomat , the two loslachen before the Pope himself came to the telephone .
As he is in the technology ( and unprepared Bill Hewlett ) :
In the age of 12 years ago , when he looked for spare parts to build a radio meters , he was looking for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called on him .
Shortly after her 20 minutes telephone call received jobs for the summer a Hewlett-Packard Teilzeitjob .
`` This has had a remarkable influence on me . it was the only company that I had seen in the age , and it shaped my views about what a company was and how well it treated its staff . ''
Later jobs was one of the HP workers visited the research laboratories of the company in Palo Alto , where he was `` the first desktop computers ever produced . ''
He was as big as a suitcase , had a small screen with Braun tube and I fell in love with him .
I would like to HP as a teenager climb and hang on to this machine and programmes to write for them .
How innovation improves :
Several times in the interview speaks about how we invent new products .
Early in his career , when he einbaute some platinum , he was asked by a customer to assemble the entire computer .
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to both the assembly processes and the extradition of the finished equipment .
Later , when Apple reminds him of the problems in the development of a computer mouse :
`` I remember resounding arguments ... You shouted at me , that it would take five years to build a mouse , which would cost $ 300 ] and I stood up , went out and found a manufacturer . ''
Ninety days later we had a mouse , which we are building for $ 15 . it was incredibly credible .
On large companies .
Long before he saw Apple revived , jobs are the ways in which so many industrial giants came with their visions and lost control of their shares .
`` We say that you are working with IBM or Xerox , so you make a better photocopying or printer , well ? ''
They have the monopoly on stock , so the company is no longer successful .
Sales and marketing make it successful , in other words , there are such people , which ultimately lead the companies and the product , in which people are being squeezed out of the decision-making process .
The product genius that has led to this monopoly enjoyed by the people who have no concept about good products versus bad products , eradicated - craft art .
This happened at Xerox ...
Xerox would have been able to have the entire computer industry .
It could be ten times greater , the Microsoft of the 1990s ...
They have caught the defeat from victory .
On innovation as an art form :
`` It is a lot of craft art between a great idea and a great product ... If you develop this great idea , they change and grow . ''
You learn a lot about its subtleties .
We must make votes , certain things that you can do , but electrons , glass , robots , factories .
We must note 5000 cases , these concepts , and they all bring together ... .
Ultimately , it comes down to the taste , it is to that an attempt is being made , with the best stuff that people have created , and then tried to get these things together , which makes it possible .
Picasso said that good artists copy , great artists steal .
We are always shamelessly in stealing grand ideas .
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who work there , musicians , poets , artists , Zoologen , historians , who happen to be the best computer scientists in the world .
It would not have been the computer industry , they would create fantastic things in other areas .

As a lie unmasks
A glance at the current headlines shows how serious and widespread deception and lies in daily life .
The Republican presidential nominee for president , Herman Cain , is dealing with the allegations of sexual harassment on the part of several women . Both sides accuse each other of lying .
The leadership of Penh State is accused of the President 's , since it has allegedly withheld reports , according to which a retired football coach boy sexually abused .
In the past week has been mitangehört on an open microphone , as the French President Nicolas Sarkozy , the American President Barack Obama , the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar .
Lies destroy careers and shake countries .
The New York congressman and Internetexhibitionist Anthony Weidner was kidding when he brought renunciations in circulation , which were quickly refuted by incontrovertible evidence .
The former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of violations in the campaign financing in connection with the cover-up of an extramarital affair .
And then , of course , no one forgets that it has seen the media circus , President Bill Clinton has triggered when he during his second term in the Oval Office about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky lied .
Stories about Schummeln at school and college tests are widespread .
There have been incidents in which teachers their students test answers , so that they themselves well in their performance reviews .
Mentors , who should teach the opposite , send a message that lies and Schummeln .
How much deception we see ?
As studies show that we are lying every day between 10 and 200 times .
Many of these lies , but as Notlügen .
Another study shows that strangers to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting .
Lies , or `` lies '' is one that is important for every human being , and that both personal and professional reasons .
Far from a parlor game such as , for example , in which it is the goal , `` you ! '' is the Enttarnen of a deception , a serious knowledge based on scientific data over the past six decades have been collected at prestigious universities , which had carried out extensive research projects , particularly in the fields of psychology and physiology .
As a result of the research is that most of the old myths about the lies were revealed .
Look lies in the eye .
They stammeln falters , blush and zappeln not always .
As a result , we can not conclude that these liars difficult to identify and treat .
An experienced Lügenenttarner can penetrate the truth , something about the structure of the opinion that the subtle facial expressions , and timing .
I have spent several years , the scientific findings of the comprehensive and steadily growing area of the in exposing , and it is clear that the Enttarnen of a deception is a modern ability , which is easy to learn and help us find in our complex world , especially if the closing or the questioning of people or negotiations or administration belong to their own professional responsibilities .
Good liars are very good to other people to raise their interest and to control their own emotions . And they intuitively sense how they are perceived by others .
Thanks to the research , we know that extrovertierte people are more often than introvertierte people that men are more than women , `` lies '' selbstorientierte whose lies more `` other '' - usually they want to protect the feelings of others - that married people anlügen their partners less often than unmarried people ( but the lies they tell are mostly `` fat lies `` ) .
We also know that if a person has been exposed as a culprit , others feel less guilty , this person to have lied .
As you can tell whether someone is lying ?
First , by watching the normal behaviour of this person .
This is called `` Baselining , '' the starting position .
It is a point of reference for the subsequent assessment of changes .
A the attitude , the laughter , the quality of their participants .
They should know better , when someone is normally standing trippelt with the foot , so that they do not unfairly when he trippelt during a meeting with the foot .
Then you look at accumulations more startling verbal and nonverbaler behaviour .
Consider these accumulations as alarm bells ring , not as proof of an exposing .
People who are , perhaps , if they try to remember their history , and perhaps their feet in the door or they are in the outcome , change their position on significant way or show a `` relaxation after the recruitment interview , '' this deep , entspannende Ausatmen and the change in attitude , if all the hard questions are over .
Interrogator often mistakenly signal that a recruitment conversation is over , only after this detente after the recruitment interview .
You also pay attention to the language of your participants .
The slip-up by Scott Peterson is famous , when he used the past tense , when he claimed that his wife was still on life and triggered a national search for her .
Deceptive individuals can also use a distance language : `` I have not had a sexual relationship with this woman ... Miss Lewinsky '' or if you have a tricky question repeated in its entirety .
The most frequent verbal signs are subtle .
Some people use `` qualifying language '' when it is a vexed question : ... '' in order to tell you the truth ... As far as I know ... In good faith. ``
This is the answer wahrnehmend rather than factual , which often the alarm bells .
There is no magic remedy for Enttarnen of lies , but they can learn skills , thanks to an exposing is possible .
Thanks to these skills can be the victims of fraudsters , both in private and professional life .

Libyan victory
The history of the Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion knows about their losers .
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in an unknown location in the desert and without him , the war is over .
Now it is just to define the winner .
As the region usually win in the elections , Islamists , the only question is what the moderate or radical .
The National Transitional Council committed itself to the common law of the ( a ) , of which it is now God has a certain idea .
Libya would become a country without crime , because for theft peck in the hand .
Women should also be concerned about emancipation as soon as possible , any faith apostates executed , and so on .
Instead of a single dictator society united feuding tribes from the Koran .
In short , in Libya an order will prevail over here barely conceivable and , above all , is hardly desirable .
Only - our lifestyle is not the only and objectively , is probably not the best and would hardly fit the aforementioned Libyans. ``
In this respect , it is rather strange that the Muslim fighters from the infidel dogs help .
Her apology may only serve the fact that the NATO air strikes are not by any General from America , but guided by Allah , whose omnipotence was praised after every successful hit .
The winners in Libya ? The West is not to do so .
We only took part in a gun battle , served the interests of Islam and our politicians sought in the person of the dictator of a political ally , without any advantage .
After the fresh and bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq , we prefer a military occupation of Libya .
As a result , the Hiesigen a concern - namely the expulsion of the crusaders .
The oil companies but also without occupation the black gold price derision ?
Hardly , and so can boast the West once rightly his selflessness in the protection of human rights .
If they do not spoil the Scharīʿa representatives .

Climatic adversity blocking the economy
In the first year in which Mario Lopez took part in the government , unemployment rose in Sinaloa and the black economy , while the foreign investment and the economy stagnated .
In 2011 , the in economic history Sinaloas remembered , and it is the first year in which Mario López Valdez , who described himself as the initiator of change and fueled great hopes on the economic growth , the government is , however , as a result of the climatic adversity can be growth , but on the contrary , deteriorated the most important economic indicators .
The low temperatures in February not only caused losses of millions of dollars in agriculture , but also the growth of the state economy close borders and caused in the first quarter of a general decline in economic activity by 3.6 % this is mainly on the historic dismantling of agricultural development at 31.16 percent , allowing other sectors of the economy .
According to a by the Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable ( . Mexican Council for sustainable agricultural development ) report on the impact of the frost , there were 582 000 hectares of arable land damaged , of which 78.03 percent and the remaining 21.07 percent were partially destroyed , all of the vegetables , maize and chickpeas .
The decline in economic activity until November , in the Mexican state unemployment to rise steadily , and the Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía observed in the first quarter of a rapid rise in unemployment , from January to March had 55 053 Sinaloas inhabitants no employment , which is 4,53 percent of the working population . The unemployment rate to 5.28 percent in the second quarter , from July to September to 6,19 percent , which is about 74 000 unemployed in Sinaloa . These are more than 18 969 people in the first quarter of the year .
Lower liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa in the year to several factors : the economist Gerardo López Cervantes , dean of the School of Economic and Social Sciences at the University of Autónoma ( UAS ) , commented on the policy of public institutions indirectly declare growing unemployment .
`` What we are seeing now is a rise in unemployment , which has to do with several factors . Among other things , with the loss of liquidity in the market as a result of the cuts by the legislation , which was adopted to combat money laundering in Congress , because for those who accumulate stashed dollars , it is not easy for them to work , to invest or otherwise use anything , '' he said .
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that the increase in unemployment is also a demographic factor .
`` The number of people in the country to look for work abroad , especially in the United States , has fallen . This is due to the entry of problems and , on the other hand , on the one hand , because it is difficult to find work , and these people remain here and looking for work , unemployment rise , '' he says .
Undeclared work
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious , if one takes into account the high proportion of undeclared work . This includes , according to INEGI 60.38 percent of the country 's employees , who work without paying into the coffers of the social security system .
With regard to unemployment and undeclared low wages , the lowest in Mexico , according to the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social ( Mexican Social Security Institution ) and the Secretaría del Trabajo y Previsión Social ( governmental authority for work and Social welfare in Mexico ) .
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa until September 5352 pesos ; that is very much less than the national average , which stands at 7375 pesos .
Decline in FDI
As well as the reduction of economic activity and rising unemployment will be in 2011 , the sharpest decline in foreign direct investment ( FDI ) in the last ten years , according to Secretaría de Economía ( state economic authority ) , FDI from January to June 630 597 dollars , a loss of 87.74 percent compared with the 5,143,312 dollars in the same period in the previous year .
The Secretaría de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno ( governmental authority for economic development ) , for its part , recorded a total investment of EUR 17,280,000 pesos in 2011 , the company mainly comes from the tertiary sector .
The debt
In the face of the economic crisis , the provincial government in July at the National Congress , a loan of 3000000000 pesos , the reactivation of the economy in infrastructure projects should be invested in the 18 communities . The National Congress approved an amount of EUR 200,600,000 pesos , but until November no positive effects of the debt on some of the economic sectors in the country .
Reactions
For the representatives of the people , the first year of government , Mario López Valdés government incompetence .
Miguel Loredo López , chairman of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación ( state chamber of manufacturing in Mexico ) , argued that in 2011 no efforts to harmonize the views of different sectors , including the federal government , have been made .
`` The economic activity in Sinaloa was really very poor in this year , and it needs to be worked hard to regain lost ground in this year and 2012 we must exert twice . The efforts of all , and in particular the progress of the already government teams have not been sufficiently coordinated , '' he said .
Slow economic development
Loredo López said that events such as the frost at the beginning of the year , the country 's economic development and growth slowed .
`` The economic flow is the result of a number of events , including the Frosts . One of the most important impact is a slowing economy , which is not enough to an economic dynamism , which generate a reasonable flow of processes , products and services . That is why we will finish the year far below our expectations , '' he said .
Redefine
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte , chairman of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana ( Mexico ) employers '' association in Sinaloa said the state should be more dynamic productive activities .
`` In general , we have seen that work has been done , and we believe that it is necessary for a long-term programme to redefine the economic appeal and to develop the country , because it is important that all the material and human resources to activate Sinaloas , '' he said .
There is much to be done
The chairman of Coparmex stressed how important it is to develop a vision of the future , which draws the efforts of the government in a better direction .
`` In general , I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas , but the economic development has come forward , but it is important to develop a long-term programme , '' he said .
He stressed that the current government is making progress in the government .
`` There are areas in which we can say that the government has acted more fully . What I can say is that work has been done and that the government is aware that there is a lot of work lies ahead of it , '' he said .

Energy policy :
Facts should prevail over dogma
There is an issue that can not be treated on the basis of short-term considerations or emotions , so it is certainly the energy policy .
Availability and cost of electricity in direct impact on the purchasing power , as well as the competitiveness of enterprises .
It is reasonable to take an election for a reason , on this issue and think about the position of nuclear energy .
The debate will only bear fruit if they explored all the economic , social and environmental consequences of the proposed options .
The French should have their opinion on objective facts , rational data .
Although 7 billion people on this planet , the demographic evolution a doubling of electricity demand by 2050 , is not a huge proportion of the world 's population on a vital element .
At the same time , we must reduce the scarcity of fossil resources to continue to produce steady electricity without the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , an issue disappeared from the environmental debate , to forget , in order to fight against climate Unregelmäβigkeiten .
The Fukushima accident changed any of these parameters .
That is why blebt Germany remains isolated in its decision to abandon nuclear power .
This is not the case in Belgium , which makes its decision on the need to find a replacement substitutionsfähige source in Switzerland , which is just to build nuclear power plants in the last generation .
Britain , Finland , Poland , the Czech Republic , the Netherlands , Sweden , South Africa , China , India and Brazil , to name just a few states to pursue their projects against it with determination .
For its part , the United States have decided after Fukushima , their park another unit , the plant shut down after the nuclear accident at Three Mile Island in operation .
Even if the renewable energy sources , German model is sometimes as a model , but contradicts the reality of the discourse .
The election in Berlin will be an increase in the price of electricity prices , by the increased use of Importgas increased energy dependence on Russia , in particular , an increase in carbon dioxide emissions caused by gas and coal-fired power plants .
The of these unpleasant effects will be felt within a few months .
The case of Denmark is cause for reflection .
Denmark is an European leader in wind energy , from which it derives 30 % of its electricity , on the other hand , the country is one of the biggest users of coal and gas , alternating with wind energy ; so there are its CO2 Ausstösse , as well as its electricity prices by 65 % and 50 % higher than the European average .
Thanks to the consistency of our energy policy , our neighbours in contrast to our French households by 40 % higher electricity bills .
As the price of energy in the globalised economy a key element of competitiveness , as well as a measure of stability in the industry on national soil , the French companies have an advantage because of the cheapest electricity in Europe .
Any significant reduction in the nuclear power would be a strong increase in the price of energy , which the noble statements about the reindustrialisation of our country and defending the purchasing power of illusion .
Polls showed that a price that the vast majority of French people , and neither is prepared to pay , as opposition to the principle of this energy source .
Let us remind ourselves that the energy policy of our country has made it possible to build an industry with 125.00 direct and 410,000 induced jobs .
Due to its strong export nature it brings a host of specialized small and medium-sized enterprises on the international markets and makes these creators of countless jobs .
If France decision to get out of nuclear power , it would be a large part of these SMEs fall victim , and the annual eur 6 billion euros in capital goods and nuclear energy exports would shrink more and more .
What electricians would be an EPR designed to operate at 60 years if the decline of its producers is inevitable ?
In order to solve the energy equation , we must acknowledge that just a little bit like a devil , a miracle cure for the production of electricity .
The company Areva , low-carbon solutions to the use of nuclear power and renewable energy from the complementarity of energy sources .
To maintain the highest possible level of safety for nuclear power is an absolute imperative .
In France , we have a safety authority , uncompromising and transparent controls in existing plants such as , for example , is carrying out the construction in Flamanville .
Their teams , who have made a name to their professionalism , are the security obsessed .
Within 50 years , the nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents .
Only a single , and Three Mile Island , under normal operating conditions ; it was without consequences for humans and the environment .
In Chernobyl was the drama of reactor construction , as well as unendschuldbares , human error .
In Fukushima seem to forget that some of the accident of two natural disasters on an unprecedented scale , which caused the deaths of several tens of thousands of people .
The nuclear industry will learn its lessons from this accident , as well as after the two previous had done .
As a result of this approach , as well as a cooperation between the security authorities of the French and German operators and designers of nuclear power stations , the EPR is a draft of its resilience in the face of such phenomena possible .
Because it is considered among the electrical engineers as desirable to build a nuclear power plant , it would be a freeze in Flamanville a legendary gift to the competition from Areva and EDF , giving them free rein to the leading position in the inevitable nuclear power development .
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best energy bouquet for our country , but it would be irresponsible to dominate a debate emotions , dogmas and Parteimanöber , as well as economic , social and financial situation of our country .

A large part of the eviction order and changed his location in a nearby park .
The members of the movement Ocupy Wall Street on Tuesday , the authorities of New York when they tried again with a court warrant to enter the Manhatten Square after they had been removed from the room and had tried a different place in the Big Apple .
Hundreds of demonstrators huddling in the Zuccotti Square , in which they are with a court warrant , the `` Empörten '' once again allowed tents at this point , to gain access . Meanwhile , another part of the movement of the eviction order and occupied a park further north in the city , where it came to nine arrests .
`` Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to campen on the Square , we find ourselves in a different place , and the battle with legal means to return to the Zuccotti , with sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations , '' said Mark Bray , a spokesman for the movement `` Ocupy Wall Street . ''
Bray said that the response of the `` Empörten '' on the evacuation of their tent camp , which directly by Michael Bloomberg , the mayor of New York had been ordered to court , where judge Lucy Billings issued an injunction banning the forced evacuation of the place and the demonstrators to the tents .
In addition , occupied the `` Empörten '' a New park , which is at the crossroads of central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue in the vicinity of the entrance to the Holland Tunnel , the New York and New Jersey , and the property of the Trinity Church .
They were able to place at least one hour , but then the police arrived and arrested some of the demonstrators , although no precise figures Bray . He assured the Efe agency that he saw including several journalists in handcuffs .
The organisation said it had joined hundreds of people at this point , in which a delegation of religious leaders as a sign of their support of the members of the movement and communicating with the police .
In the meantime , the Zuccotti Square ( a site in private property ) closed in anticipation of a court hearing is scheduled for this Tuesday , and with which the legality of the evacuation took place in the night to be analysed .
Some of the demonstrators wore photographic copies of this court warrant and distributed them ; they gave them some of the policemen guarded the place , `` some small clashes , '' as reported Bray , who had indicated that some police officers , had beaten demonstrators .
The judicial order prohibits the authorities to remove members of Occupy Wall Street to remove from the room , as well as the use of `` laws , which were adopted after the occupation and to prohibit the demonstrators with their tents and other things that they had already been used to return to the park . ''
Mayor Bloomberg is clearly in front of the press , which as a result of this court orders the reopening of the place for the public transport and the demonstrators had been lifted , and the demonstrators , he pointed out that the city laws did not allow them to return to this place with tents and sleeping bags .
The mayor defended himself in his grey conducted evacuation of the Zuccotti Square , in which nearly 200 people were arrested , and it was decided , because the demonstrators '' contravened the law. ``
Bloomberg said that he had given the order to the evacuation of the place , because he `` had turned into a place where people were not Demonstrieren , but to break the law and , in some cases , other people to harm , '' because `` some shops have received threats '' and the residents began to `` about their quality of life . ''
`` The evacuation of the dawn was sickening and shows that Bloomberg is essentially on the protection of financial interests and is not interested in protecting the interests of the North American workers , '' added the spokesman of the movement , the mayor anschuldigte `` not to respect the freedom of the press . ''
The leaders of `` Occupy Wall Street informed that they thought about it , '' major actions `` to organise for Thursday , together with community organizations and unions in the two months , the protests since 17 September now .

Mission ended , Congress prepared to Libya
Ultimately , it is as if Republicans and Democrats in Washington would have to agree on the riots in Libya .
All that was needed to was the success of the revolt , the arrest and assassination of the longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi and ending the American interference .
On Thursday , the Committee on International Relations of the Senate resolution , which the Chairman John Kerry ( Massachussetts ) , along with Senator John McCain ( Arizona ) and Joseph I. Lieberman ( Connecticut ) , with Libya for the successful rebellion and the U.S. troops for their `` courage . . ''
`` This resolution is a tribute to the courageous people of Libya , which began with the reconstruction of their country , '' said Kerry .
`` It is a confirmation of the support of their democratic efforts by two parties . ''
The language may sound innocent , but so far nothing has been easy in the debate .
This summer , lawmakers of both parties and the White House over the wording of a number of resolutions for approval or disapproval of the role of the U.S. military in the Libya mission to NATO .
In June , Kerry and McCain a resolution of the United States , which limited use of military force in Libya .
The law has been in the Senate by a broad fringe of both parties , and there was no vote .
But on the same day , this bill in the Senate . The chamber also overruling a decision to cut funding for American operations in Libya .
The U.S. mission ran into a kind of legislative purgatory - with Congress , which was enough to criticize Obama 's approach in the framework of the mission , but not angry enough to pull the rug from under our feet .
Then the indecisiveness of Congress overtaken by events .
Tripoli fell in August by the Libyan rebels and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October .
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October .
Now the Senate may be ready for action .
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations `` congratulated the people of Libya to their enormous courage and their extraordinary perseverance in their self-liberation '' and `` praises the men and women of the U.S. military and its coalition partners , who support the military operations to protect the people of Libya , for their extraordinary courage and professionalism . ''
The resolution also reaffirmed `` the national interests of the United States to a successful and irrevocable Libya 's transition to democracy . ''
The new measures will receive the full support of the body for foreign relations or they will divide the legislators , as it did the law in June ?
The latest version of the resistance of Senator Richard G. Lugar ( Indiana ) , the spitzen republikaner of the committee .
Lugars spokesman said on Monday that he had not seen the final version of the new law .
According to the Capitol , it is up to the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional amendment , which calls for a balanced budget , a top priority in almost every congressional term , Republicans and some Democrats .
The measures under the leadership of the Republican Bob Good bar ( Virginia ) will be the first constitutional amendment of the budget or any other area at the time to vote in the Senate or Congress .
Other legislators have so far tried unsuccessfully to bring their amendments to the vote , although they tried often enough .
Goodlattes change is only one of 68 constitutional changes , which were presented to the Congress and include a whole range of issues .
Some are double - the same law was presented to both the Congress and the Senate - others differ only slightly .
There are at least 15 versions of balancing the budget in the Senate and another dozen `` federal spending control . ''
Some of the laws are identical , but they give their customers - particularly rookie with the Republicans , who want to burnish their CV - the opportunity to boast that they have such a measure `` written . ''
The Budgetary Control Act , which was adopted in August , requires that both the Senate and Congress vote on an amendment to the budget is balanced .
In March , 58 senators voted for a non-binding resolution , which supports the idea of such a change .
In addition to the budget , some members want the number of provisions that members of Congress can present limit , while the Republicans José E. Serrano ( New York ) , the limit of two terms of office of the president wants to lift .
The Republican Jesse L. Jackson ( Illinois ) has proposed a series of amendments , which , among other things , the right to a good education and health care .
An amendment , which prohibits a marriage under Gleichgeschlechtlichen , as well as an amendment , which prohibits the burning of flags , a recurring presentation .
Some lawmakers also want to allow the repeal of federal laws , if two-thirds of the states they reject .
For example , how to move the changes so much faster than in the past few years .
In the 111th Congress legislators 77 such changes , presented in the 110th Congress 66 .
The pace pales in comparison to that of the early 1990s , in which members regularly more than 150 amendments proposed every two years , according to the figures , which the Senate library is available .
But they were not much more successful than today 's .
The last amendment added - 27 - was ratified in 1992 , but was actually proposed to the Congress in 1789 .

The Bank of Zürisee
The abenteuerlichste bank in Europe is not in Italy or France , but in Switzerland .
The UBS was almost bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since stumbled from one crisis to the next .
Now it is to be a German .
It was not thought Axel Weber .
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank was reported in July that he 2013 , an almost equally spectacular new job : President of the Swiss bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step .
Axel Weber was celebrating publicly praised Switzerland their beauty and UBS whether their newfound solidity and kind remarks about the future colleagues .
`` The UBS has managed the Turnaround . ''
`` I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel . ''
But in September , it became clear that everything would be quite different .
A trader of UBS in London had bypassed all security systems of the bank and approximately 1.7 billion euros .
UBS Chief Executive Oswald Grübel , not only in Switzerland praised bankers had to go .
President of the board of UBS , since also - and all ask : when will finally Axel Weber ?
It became known that Weber , the bank of February 2012 .
And the administrative presidency in May - not only in 2013 , as the bank announced on Tuesday .
For Axel Weber will be hard .
He is not a banker , economics professor and central banker , and would have had an apprenticeship period certainly needed .
At a stroke , he assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank , which has just once again that they have long been the title `` the greatest scandal bank of Europe . ''
On the one hand , the UBS is huge - until recently it was the largest asset manager in the world - and on the other hand has been reeling for years by a scandal in the next .
Nothing , it seems , is the once proud Swiss bank .
It started in the financial crisis .
Until 2007 , UBS had an excellent reputation .
The image of the secretive and solid , but also ausgebufften Swiss Vermögensverwalters she had combined with ambitious goals : they also wanted to be in the investment banking is a very large number .
The UBS managed in 2007 with $ 1.6 trillion more money with significant customers than any other bank in the world .
And , on the other hand , it was as investment bank proceeded into the league of the world 's largest banks .
This made sense .
The former banker and subsequent long-standing banking professor in Zurich Hans Geiger told : `` I have the UBS was regarded as a model of a good bank . ''
`` From today 's perspective , one wonders : how could I be wrong ? ''
He was wrong .
In 2007 , it was the first time that something went wrong in the UBS .
In the middle of the year , Chief Executive Peter Wuffli , which was , as highly intellectual and equally brilliant bankers .
A few months later , suspecting , why he was gone .
The investment division of the bank had been gambling found with subprime securities and had to write off billions .
In order to shoulder , UBS announced a capital increase of as much as 13 billion francs .
But was actually investors , however , some of which until shortly before the nose would have been gerümpft : an obscure Asian sovereign wealth funds from Singapore and an Arab sovereign wealth funds , which was so quiet that not even his name .
But that was only the first blow .
In April 2008 , there have been worse .
The bank had to announce new billion-dollar losses , board President Marcel Ospel , 2006 , the second-best paid board of Switzerland , resigned .
In October 2008 , followed by the disaster : the UBS was given its bad investments in the financial crisis before the collapse and had to be rescued by the state .
The National bank of UBS bought problematic securities for tens of billions , the Swiss Confederation was six billion francs for a mandatory convertible loan , on which it could be Miteigentümerin of the bank .
The whole of Switzerland was shaken - because she saw how dramatic it is for a small country , if it is so big banks .
Finally , the balance sheet of UBS in 2007 , more than five times as large as the economic performance of Switzerland ( see chart ) .
`` Once again , we could not save the UBS , '' banking researcher says .
The first disaster was the second .
A few months later surrendered the UBS tax dispute with America and agreed to publish the data high-net-worth customers who may have evaded taxes with the help of the bank .
They also agreed to a payment of 780 million dollars as repayment of unjustified profits from this business , including criminal premium .
In doing so , the UBS known more or less open to have helped in terms of tax evasion .
At the same time she lost something that has always been their capital was in the competition for wealthy clients : the aura of secrecy .
After the scandal was the Swiss banking secrecy is no longer the same .
It was followed by the resignation of CEO and board President .
And the exodus of customers '' money .
For example , the bank within a few months their credibility lost in two key portfolios : investment banking through speculation and asset management with the help of tax evasion .
And it was a little calmer , just when it was thought the UBS will now have to get it again , there is this unfortunate dealer history : an individual trader EUR 1.7 billion , before the bank notes that something is amiss .
And it is obvious that the risk management in the investment banking , it is still not clear .
`` With the case Adoboli has found that the risk control too little has changed , '' says Martin Janssen , an economist and professor of finance at the Institute of the University of Zurich .
The financial chief of a large German bank is safe : `` the problem of UBS is that it does not have the risk control under control . ''
It was is the idea of the caution with which the Swiss bankers were lined up for a long time , the guardian of the great wealth of the world : no great risks for safety for money - may want to collapse the world on the other side of the Alpine republic .
The vaults of Swiss banks had become the symbol of steadfast reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly noble chocolate .
The UBS headquarters in Zurich still fits the stereotype of the upright Swiss private bank - it is just a little bit bigger .
The situation is classic .
The bank has its headquarters in Zurich station road , which leads from the main train station from directly to the Zürichsee , flanked by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains .
The buildings are magnificent , the shop rents are among the highest in Europe .
Juweliere like Tiffany is taking place here between Swiss traditional shops such as the Confiserie Sprüngli .
For centuries the Swiss banks : the National Bank on the palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks like Julius Bear .
The UBS reception hall enters through a heavy revolving door .
Inside the walls are Drinnen marble , thick leather armchairs , alongside the bank logo is a great sign for the `` safe . ''
The UBS knows what the customer wants : security .
This idea of the Swiss bank have both Swiss big banks , UBS and Credit Suisse , but at some point - or betrayed , as the head of a small Swiss private bank .
His name , he would not like to read in the newspaper , finally , does he , like all Swiss bankers , even with the two big banks .
The UBS had become far too big , he is taking place - particularly in investment banking , where the Anglo-Saxons .
The Swiss had nothing more to say .
`` And if they have long been adapted to the habits of the Anglo-Saxons . ''
In fact , it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking , UBS , its first high profits and then the debacle : no European financial institution has lost in the jungle lost so much money as the big Swiss bank .
On 15 October 2008 , the disaster was visible .
`` On that Wednesday , the coalition government of the small Siebenmillionenlandes the biggest bailout in the history of their nation , '' writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book `` the UBS-crash . ''
Up to 68 billion francs , or roughly EUR 45 billion devoted to the politicians , in order to save the big bank facing bankruptcy .
How did it happen ?
When you talk with Swiss bankers , they see the problem , especially in the size of UBS .
In June 1998 , two of the three Swiss big banks , with a huge corporation .
It was a bank in the merger was too big for the small Swiss - and grew more and more .
It helped that the two different precursor banks UBS : a rich , but verschlafene bank with a focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer , but more internationalized .
Suddenly the internationalised favourable investment bankers at a lot of money with which they were able to turn a huge wheel .
Two names are associated with the rise of the UBS : Peter Wuffli , from 2001 to 2007 , head of UBS , Marcel Ospel , chairman of the board .
`` I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team , '' says banking researcher Hans Geiger .
`` Wuffli , higher intellectual , modest , understands a lot of models and statistics , and Ospel , the hard man of the bank and has worked at the top . ''
But in the end Ospel relied on Wuffli .
And Wuffli have probably made a crucial mistake at the end : `` He thought his models are the reality , '' He says .
`` This is a tragic case . ''
Tragic , perhaps .
It is clear : frolic came before the case .
UBS staff clearly remember the meetings at which CEO 's Wuffli the same slogan : Goldman Sachs Dethrone .
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world .
They led the League Tables , `` rankings , which documented the success of the banks of the time .
In the meantime , the UBS , according to the top .
Some steps have already been achieved it .
In the foreign exchange business and equity trading , she played at the top .
Business advisers who have been charged , but stressed a weakness : in the international business interest in the bank `` Fixed Income , '' there is a huge gap with the largest banks .
The UBS have gaps in U.S. mortgage products .
In order to close this gap , UBS went into an adventure that they almost claimed the existence .
Hungry for growth , both the bank itself , as well as a confirmation of hedge funds in the U.S. sub-prime assets .
It became a huge machine , the securities on American mortgage loans packaged and did so at - but also risks .
Also , as other banks have long sought .
`` Even in the summer of 2007 , when the U.S. housing market was going up in flames , UBS has bought there , '' says banking expert Geiger .
The euphoria , so deep .
A manager after the other had to go to clean up the trials more difficult than expected .
UBS has become the weapon and are still shaky .
Anyone who now leads the large bank now has an almost impossible job .
He must find a strategy for a bank , which are all obvious business models .
Banking researcher has an idea : stop the investment banking , concentrating on asset management , return to the Swiss roots .
So far , the bank does not want to ( yet ) .
But the investment banking is expected to shrink , so much is already clear .
On Thursday to present the new bank chief Sergio Ermotti of the world its future strategy .
The 51 years old schweizer Italo was only intended as a temporary solution , as the bank surprisingly separated from predecessor Grübel .
Meanwhile , he has asserted that he is to lead the business of UBS , told the Zurich bank on Tuesday .
Ermotti wants the investment bank in the back in the 1990s .
It is 3500 jobs .
But this will not be enough .
The UBS needs a vision .
Who is it ?
What they want to earn money ?
These are the questions that Axel Weber sure now .
Publicly he says only that he will with his wife once an apartment in Zurich .
Next year .

Asphalt from the UNAM prevents potholes
Rafael Herrera , researchers at the School of Chemistry in the Mexican University UNAM developed with Polymeren modified Asphalte to mix more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
The which stem from the road surface , respected , it would not be required to repair nearly 200 000 potholes , when the rainy season in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México ( city area of the valley of Mexico ) breaks out , said Rafael Herrera Nájera , researchers at the School of Chemistry ( FQ ) at the University of UNAM , warning and assured that if the laying and maintenance of the Asphaltbelags happen , the number of potholes significantly reduced or avoided altogether .
`` Potholes from a technical point of view , '' he in his speech on the occasion of the International Year of Chemistry , he announced that the laboratory , for which he is responsible , with Polymeren modified Asphalte was developing , in a similar mixture , but the asphalt mechanical resistance in both high and low temperatures .
Herrera Nájera said that this type of modified Asphalte in areas with extremely hot climate , such as , for example , in some cities in the north of the country , should be used to improve the behaviour of the road surface and to avoid the appearance of blow holes .
He said that the asphalt - the hardest part of oil - a hydrocarbon link , which is part of a high molecular weight - the so-called Asphaltene - and the other part of a low - the so-called Malthene . Together they give the road surface his characteristic zähelastisches behavior .
Zähelastisches behavior Asphalts means that this high temperatures of nearly 180 °C behaves like a liquid at 120 ° C , it is very liquid and 50 ° C , while he is fragile at very low temperatures .
`` This means that the resilience of the asphalt is not uniform on the streets , but on a day in accordance with the changing weather conditions and temperature fluctuations , '' said the chemical engineer .
The researchers said the FQ , the streets of Mexico City would have a majority of a flexible road surface , which is composed of six layers of material , which included the last three asphalt .
Between the upper classes is a wear layer of asphalt , which is made up of small and then solidified stones bathed in asphalt .
Each piece this decay class , was bathed in asphalt .
If the vehicles to move and forces produced this situation is a good distribution of forces in the road surface .
`` If it is modified asphalt , the forces would be even better , '' said the chemical engineer .
`` The erosion , '' he said , `` is being interpreted in a recent class , the so-called Tragschicht , which consists of tiny stones , from sand , which was also in asphalt .
Since this situation in contact with the car tyres , they need greater mechanical strength than the wear layer and they must produce friction .
The road surface receives the most forces and distributed , the Tragschicht also needs an appropriate thickness and the material from which it must be maintained .
The weather conditions , especially humidity and temperature fluctuations , are more important to take into account factors , above all , the water , `` he said , '' because it affects the behaviour of the wear layer .
If the site is damp , water in the class and only difficult , and this is a dilution of all sections of the road surface and as a result , the incidence of stroke holes .
If a pothole , `` he said , '' will initially cover layer worn out , while the wear layer that will be affected , but the damage is not immediately , but it is a process that the first signs of adequate maintenance programmes should be maintained. ``
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores ( National research system Mexico ) said that the burden of another important reason for the appearance of blow holes . It is therefore crucial that the thickness of each layer of the surface is always in relation to the vehicle and it must be ensured that frequent potholes with this rule will be met .
Rafael Herrera pointed out that many research to achieve Asphaltemulsionen , for example , which in other countries are already on the market , and with which the bumps simply and without application of high temperatures .

What was missing from the candidate del Valle , the new Miss Colombia ?
Analysis of the factors that played that Melina Ramírez Serna was the crown of Miss Colombia .
El Valle gets its 14 title .
Once again , Valle del Cauca empty in the awarding of the crown of Miss Colombia .
This time had to Melina Ramírez Serna content to stand on the podium , a silver crown and the band , which they regard as the new Miss Colombia to flaunt .
With this night received result in Cartagena , where Miss Atlántico took the crown and the cedar , the Department is already at 14 and Melina to the legion of women from Valle del Cauca , who had been kept the crown almost in the hands of the proclaimed Misses : Miriam Ospina Benoit ( 1947 ) , Clara Domínguez Borrero ( 1949 ) , Patricia Bellini Ayala ( 1979 ) , Lorena Alvarez ( 1981 ) , Rose Mary Alzate ( 1983 ) , Olga Maria Arenas ( 1987 ) , Leila Blanque ( 1988 ) , Mónica Evers ( 1989 ) , María Consuela Pinedo ( 1990 ) , Diana Isabel Romero ( 1993 ) , Giselle Garcés Aljure ( 2000 ) , Catalina Giraldo ( 2007 ) , Stephanie Garcés Aljure ( 2008 ) .
The big question many are asking is : What was missing ?
The result is in line with the decline of a great favorite in any demonstration had shown that they had anything new to be Miss Colombia , but it was not in vain to the Queen of the police and the Mejor Rostro Jolie elected by Vogue , titles , including the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro had received , and the crown of Miss Colombia home .
The first factor , which is regarded as crucial to the decision of the panel to appoint the first failure , is that the answer to the question `` what book has most influenced and why ? '' of Martín Murillo Gómez Carreta aria Leamos , was not convinced .
The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the questioner :
`` I read a lot , I think pretty much of the literature , I think it is a kind of civilised way , ultimately , I believe that the book , which for my childhood , '' the little prince `` is a very profound book .
At the moment I read `` guilt and atonement . '' it is a book of universal culture , which we should all read , but I just read a book by Irene Nemirovski , a Russian girl , a beautiful book , which says'passions ' .
An answer , which was met with skepticism , firstly because of the term'civilised '' and , secondly , because it had not explained how each of the book had affected them .
But after the conclusion of the ceremony said Melina to feel calm and happy with the result : `` the universe is wise , it happens , what needs to be done .
And for all people : please read a little bit of `` The small prince ' ; it is a great book .
Among other things , it is said that the favorite of El Valle is charred .
A journalist from Bogota indicated that the fact that it was the , all Beifälle einheimste and had all prices in the runup to Easter gastronomy competition , public vote on the best handgeschneiderte costume and Reina Madre ) , `` the other candidates had made jealously what the Queen stresste , who could not shine on the stage . ''
And it noted in its first presentation in a bathing suit on the beach of the Hilton hotel and its two elevators in the coronation ceremony .
Although it appeared in both safe , it lacked the strength and momentum , the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico displayed .
Ariel Osorio , a journalist of the programme `` Como en casa '' on the channel RCN said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss , `` shows that the candidate who wins the most prices during the competition , but will not be queen . ''
In addition , Valle was at the end of the press - a mistake .
Another hypothesis is that Valle can not convince the Jurie regarding their interest in social work , which is the essence of the national beauty contest .
It is a reason that two days before the composition of the international jury Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman who stood up for the social affairs of their country .
`` Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia . We must look beyond the Körperliche and focus on the social perception that they participate in the competition had been involved in projects , '' she said .
There is also speculation that Valle with their Derriere and fibrosis defects found in the stomach area , has said that he had sinned , but this is contradictory , because the jury chose it as a candidate for `` natural beauty '' with a healthy body , good eating habits and good physical work .
The coach of the queens , Jorge Hernán Orozco , admits that Melina did not have the best body , that there would be better , `` but the problem with the fibrosis in the back , which for me to be honest , it was hard to say , put their score on the last day . ''
Meanwhile , the journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos magazine , the fault of the woman from Valle del Cauca the surgery , which she had undergone .
`` The operations are OK , but Valle did not know how they get it right .
Her body has never been their strong side , and they had to pay. ``
As a result of this prize , which is the first time will be awarded by the National beauty contest , after the appearance in a cruel prediction , which should be true in the night , and it was getuschelt that Raymundo Melina a consolation prize was given to them not to come to the enjoyment of the crown .
Regardless of whether it is true or not , the fact that Melina today assumes its domination of the year , not as a queen , but as a princess , a position that offers the opportunity to the appointment of the Colombian national beauty contest in one of the international competitions .
It is , However , as one of the queens , despite its overwhelming appearance for Cartagena the crown had escaped , go down in history .

Mass slaughter on a personal level
Sensitive and generous begins Peter Englunds new book `` beauty and horror . A history of the First World War , tells in nineteen fates '' with a long list of players to heart .
Here is a tip on how to proceed : Cut off the side of caution and make it to your readers .
They are the people in Englunds romanhafter narrative know each other very well , and these people as your GPS function as a beacon in these few moments , in which you as Englunds men and women lost in the fog of war and are deprived of your illusions .
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist .
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy , which determines the Nobel Prize for literature .
He has written an unusual book that he was not incorrect as `` a work of anti-history . ''
It contains only a few big names , important contracts or famous battles . There is little ambassadors , racing reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment .
It is less a book about what happened , he says , but rather `` a book about how it was . '' it is about `` feelings , impressions , experiences and sentiments . ''
`` Beauty and horror '' almost war experiences of 20 more or less concealed men and women on both sides of the war of school girls and Botanikern to mountaineers , doctors , ambulance drivers and office workers .
Some of these people are heroes .
Some prisoners of war , lose limb , crazy or die .
Each of these lives flackert such as the Votivkerzen in a church , some , while others lapse .
Englunds book differs from the usual history books .
It also corrected the idea that the First World war was just the devastating war on the Western Front .
`` Beauty and horror '' with experts on other war zones : the Alps , the Balkans , the Ostfront , Mesopotamia , East Africa .
The soldiers in this book are bees baskets , celebrates Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt , tsetse flies are an insoluble problem .
This is a very moving book almost from the outset .
The war flooded the lives of these people as a natural disaster like a hurricane Katrina , which reeks of Kordit .
Imagine that you are a woman who is at home with their children , and cannon fire in the distance . You or you take the flight ?
Who is at all ?
Hardly anyone understands what is happening or why this war is being waged at all .
`` There is a lack of facts , '' Englund says , `` with assumptions , assumptions , hopes , fears , fixed ideas , conspiracy theories , dreams , nightmares and rumours . ''
`` Beauty and horror '' individuals such as Florence Farmborough , an English nurse in the Russian army , and Richard root , a young German ship sailors .
Their stories were mainly memories , letters and other already published material .
Their reports can be frightening or simple , but they are very vivid in Englunds of the accumulation of small moments losing in .
Many of them act of shortages and Behelfen .
In the history of a German school girl , he told : `` spare everywhere . ''
`` Spare coffee , wrong aluminium , false eraser , paper , wood buttons . ''
He tells us of the dinner in Germany .
He describes `` meat made from pressed rice and Hammelfett ( and most recently was served with a false bones from wood ) , tobacco , which was made from dried roots and dried potato bowls , shoes , which were besohlt with wood . ''
There was , as he noted , `` 837 registered food substitute foods that were allowed in the manufacture of sausages , 511 registered coffee substitute . ''
Some stories act of honor and bravery .
An American acknowledges his own drive for ferocity and says about the war : `` one feels that this is , after all , what was planned for men rather than to sit on the Lehnstuhl , with the evening tide or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whisky in hand , and to do so as a front civilisation and as if there were no barbarism behind its own strengthened and keeper shirt breast . ''
Conversely , a British soldier acknowledges that he will probably die and nobody notice or will be done .
`` If the idea to sacrifice themselves , we would like to think that this is happening before an audience , '' he writes .
Instead , it is so terrible as `` a condemned man , who was hanged in secret . ''
Other observations of the old Europe , which falls apart , and on new types of terror .
`` The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition , '' Englund writes , `` a war between the factories . ''
He starts the arrival of what he calls `` a new species in the Bestiarium of the young century `` : '' the word and ideologically committed mass murderer in the yardstick of the slaughter , while he sits behind a desk. ``
People behave in unexpected ways , and there are also appears behaviour such as Heroismus .
Englund is discussing the soldiers who actively sought a prostitute being infected with a sexually transmitted disease , in order to escape the front .
`` The grotesque expression can be found in trade with Gonokokken-Eiter , because soldiers bought and grease on their genitals , in the hope to come to the hospital , '' he writes .
`` Those who were really desperate , rieben him in the eye , which meant that they were blind to the rest of their lives . ''
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves Englunds poetry is sleek , but intrusiveness and fits perfectly with its human task .
In dozens of small scenes he starts the way , as the war `` in an unique way of uncontrollable forces : extreme nationalism , social revolution , religious hatred . ''
People are beginning to ask themselves why their leaders fighting them .
The best books about the First World War were distorted were distorted as Paul Fussells `` Great War and Modern Memory '' or novels such as Erich Maria Remarques `` nothing new '' in the West as a comprehensive history books .
Englunds band is an unconventional glory hall .
His book has the most devastating end , which I have ever read in a book .
I admit that there is no longer .
But it is as if he would have with his book this side of the main people in the nose and lit with a match .

21er house in Vienna
The umgezogene pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural history with ups , downs and happy ending : the Austrian World Expo pavilion from Brussels in 1958 prices , was in Vienna for the museum , was empty and descended .
Now , he is being reopened as an exhibition house .
If dreams of modern postwar architecture , clear forms , glass halls , courageous swings and new building materials , which are typical of the belief in the technical progress , then the Austrian pavilion of Karl Schwanzer architects for the Brussels World Expo 1958 is a good and famous example .
Schwanzers pavilion at the Eurovision Song Contest Architecture for his easy and steel glass design .
The building is seen as a milestone in contemporary architecture .
He made the architect so well known that at the next World Expo in Austria pavilion built .
With his legendary BMW Vierzylinderhaus plus schüsselartigem Nebenbau in Munich , he became internationally famous .
His temporary Ausstellungsbau planned pavilion of the world Expo in the Swiss garden at the Vienna South station converted and in 1962 opened a museum of the 20th century - the `` 20s home '' has been called it .
This was the building but neither physically and technically as a museum - no walls on the slopes of the art , not a good climate .
Nevertheless , it has been used for so long , until the contemporary art in Vienna , a new house .
Since 2001 , the building was empty and more and more .
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz converted the pavilion , he is now `` 21er House '' and will in future be used as a museum of contemporary art .
On Tuesday night , the museum opened Belvedere , which includes the house , where the first exhibition - a stroke of luck in every respect .
The new start Agnes Husslein-Arco , the 2007 new director of the Austrian gallery Belvedere .
Husslein-Arco , doctorate art historian with considerable career , among other things , in the youth as Eiskunstläufererin later with Sotheby 's , the Guggenheim museum and founding director of the museum of modern Salzburg , strongly defended the with politicians and conservationists monument , they acquired public funds and private sponsorship money and use .
Besides contemporary art works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba should be issued by the eponymous foundation , a café and a bookshop , it should be , and an office house had to be built .
Strict supervision , small budget
The implementation was Krischanitz the ideal occupation .
It is not only because he Joseph Olbrichs Secession in Vienna sensitive converted and enlarged and had won the competition , but because he Schwanzer has studied at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion for him , `` enormously important place , '' where he '' almost every weekend `` the exhibitions .
He knew the draft , and he knew the problems of the building , which was already in his transfer to Vienna and his Umnutzung of generosity and easily lost .
In the current restructuring , there were far greater problems : the building was `` an Energieschleuder , '' says Krischanitz .
The profils windows were replaced outside glass fibre verstärktes insulating glass and the glass roof replaced by special security glass .
Kältebrücken steel girders have been strengthened or replaced , and asbestgefüllte blankets have been refurbished .
Two shells made room for the new use , an abgesenkter light gap between house and road for the Belichtung , a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building , but still the easy Schwanzer pavilion .
The original exterior doors are left , the house is removed in the old rotbraun Rostschutz-Farbton .
And the cinema is even exactly as it was before .
And all this under strict supervision of the monument authority and with a small budget .
`` Often a material had to be found , which is a good thing , and it is cheap and Denkmalschutzamt liked , '' says Krischanitz and highlights an abrasive soil in - .
Despite all the constraints , problems and to the building is flexible and easy .
It would have been difficult with the pavilion , `` the came from Brussels , '' said Krischanitz recently , a typical `` drop in history . ''
So an architecture is `` always in the wrong place '' and still wants to `` create a real awareness . ''
In this case , the 21er house but not in the wrong place , because it is an urban fluke : if the Swiss garden is completely new planned `` Central Station Quartier , '' with office and residential buildings .
And another stroke will occur : the 21er house could increase by another Krischanitz construction , because the Sammlerin Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin temporary art hall , and we hear that they have been negotiating with the city a neighbourly location in the Swiss garden .

MSS announces a research protocol for the location of the gene for obesity in
Social Security Institution , Mexico 's leading a research project for the location of the gene for obesity among children and young people , which will be supported by specialists of the IPN .
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS ( Social Security Institution of Mexico ) announced that a research project on the discovery of the gene for obesity among children and young people under the title `` genetics of obesity in childhood and youth , '' with which the genetic markers associated with obesity are to be .
Miguel Cruz López , head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica ( department for medical research , focus biochemistry ) at the clinic Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI stated that a multidisciplinary team consisting of doctors , health workers , food specialists and social workers .
This team will be supported by specialists and students of the postgraduate degree course at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública ( INSP ) and Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados ( Cinvestav ) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional ( IPN ) .
The public is invited to take part in the study . Interested parties can come to the sports fields of the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico , where every Saturday from 8.00 am tests with children and young people .
He stressed that the investigation on the sports ground of Cuauhtémoc ( in the west of the state México ) began since 8 October at the sports ground of Nezahualcóyolt ( in the east of the Federal state México ) will continue .
If the goal of 500 to 600 individuals is achieved , the study on the sports ground of Independencia ( in the south of the main urban bezirks ) continued and Morelos ( in the north of the main urban bezirks ) .
He said that the aim of the study is the understanding of the factors and the role of genetics in connection with the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors of Mexican children and young people to the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases .
On the occasion of the global day of diabetes , he said it would seek three thousand children and young people aged from six to 14 years with the consent and under the supervision of their parents should fill nutritional questionnaires .
They are also questions about their physical activity and their family illness history , risk factors , diabetes or renal insufficiency , to control .
He also led to the aforementioned Samstags investigative subjects measured ( weight , size , Taillenumfang ) , controlled their blood pressure and blood values such as the glucose levels , Triglyceride , Cholesterol , insulin and genetic factors ( attempt to identify genes associated with obesity in childhood ) .
Cruz López stressed that the investigation would take advantage of the health workers concerned about the alarming weight of young people .
`` The health surveys from the years 1999 and 2006 showed that in less than six years , the proportion of obese boys 77 percent and the girls with obesity had increased by 47 % , while obesity has risen dramatically , '' said the expert of the IMSS .
He admitted that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of Mexico 's population of the differences in other nations .
He admitted that a ( e ) Mexicans ( in ) to 65 % on average indianisch American , European and 30 to 5 percent of African descent in the genes , which is associated with diabetes and obesity , .
More generally , he said , the genetics of obesity in the inability to burn the surplus of energy ( calories ) burned , so that this will be stored in the form of fat .
The researchers said that the direct benefits for the research participants would be in a comprehensive study of the children , which would determine whether they had a degree of obesity or obesity .
It would even the appearance of dark skin wrinkles in the neck and arm of the Innenarm ( Akanthosis ) on the likelihood of metabolic disorders and diabetes at the preliminary stage .
All the information would be kept confidential and told the parents in writing by the doctors . The doctors say parents all measurements and propose lifestyle changes , which are for the prevention of diseases .
Cruz López said that there would be three basic factors that are responsible for obesity , obesity and other chronic diseases : lack of exercise , the lack of movement on a daily basis , most of the time of the day in front of the television and means of transport to go , rather than short routes .
The high caloric intake , which means an increased consumption of gezuckerten drinks and Kohlenhydraten ( Tamales , bread , pizza , hamburgers , etc . ) , along with a high fat and protein , as well as genetics , which is to be analysed in this research project .

The world according to the Republican presidential candidates
Mitt Romney , Herman Cain and Rick Perry competing in simplification and ignorance about China , Iraq , as well as the provision of aid to Israel .
Can a krisengeschwächtes America a complex world with simple , not to say : silly ideas ?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidate , the voters could almost get that impression .
Over the past few days Mitt Romney , Herman Cain , Rick Perry , and their supporters in their thundering declarations and statements on foreign policy , traditional Republican priorities , said repeatedly .
On China , Iran and Israel aid - often based in any way - slogans .
With regard to the appointment of the `` Grand Old Party '' at the top of the course Mitt Romney threatened to cite the Chinese before the WTO and the `` currency manipulation '' - leading issue in an America that the exodus of entire industries to Asia strongly prefer not to blame .
Stupid , if this is to imply the introduction of a trade war , he said .
Jon Huntsman , a former ambassador to China under Obama , and the only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of foreign policy , almost about his schmeichelnden behavior strangled .
He had a firm , but constructive talks with Beijing ( also the current position Obama 's ) .
But Huntsman will not be heard , because he has stagnated in the depths of the opinion polls .
Reagan 's image
Romney had also praised military strikes against Iran if sanctions fail to halting the nuclear programme .
`` If I am elected , I commands Iran , '' he was on hearing .
`` Obama is re-elected , they get the bomb . ''
In addition , Israel has increased military aid promised and Obama accused his partners on commitments to be .
The entrepreneur Herman Cain , zweithöchst platzierter candidate , for its part , has a shameful acts of ignorance .
Recently , he called on the Chinese military threat against , because Beijing is `` trying to develop a nuclear power '' - and seemed to be the fact that China is already been in place since 1964 in possession of military nuclear weapons .
The Texas governor Rick Perry supports Israel and calls for military strikes against Iran , for its part , is to be ready to take the American army in Mexico against drug cartels in service .
The Obama 2009 prohibits the use of torture against suspected terrorists was also of Cain , Perry , as well as the Kandidation Michele Bachmann advocates .
It is a far cry from John McCain , the Republican candidate in 2008 , a foreign policy heavyweight .
The current presidential opponent , Reagan had also simple ideas and won the Cold War .
They recall that Obama selbstein amateur and water in his wine had to pay , which was the subject anti-terrorist .
They are right to insist on the failure of his naive Zwiegespräches with Iran , the hasty withdrawal of his `` boys '' from Iraq , his indecision in Libya , which he is also the reputation of the weakness .
This hostility , however , is not quite so straightforward .
The population estimates the positive assessment of the national security under Obama , Bin Laden has switched off .
Since the Iraq asserted against military intervention , which lead to paralysis .

The carers union will lodge a complaint against the city because of layoffs
The union , the hundreds of school mentors who have lost their jobs last month , plans to sue the city on Wednesday , as the redundancies because of their disproportionate influence on the schools , which teach poor students , are not necessary and discriminatory .
The complaint is probably the last chance , the union , District council 37 , in their efforts to make the redundancies , is still open .
Sechshundert seventy-two school helpers , care coordinators and other staff , among the lowest paid employees of the city , and on October 7 in a move had lost their jobs , the trade union leaders described as a political revenge for that in the last year , the city access to a health fund , the working groups , had with which the budgetary gap should be closed .
This accusation has been categorically rejected by the authorities .
At a hearing of the city council , said Dennis M. Walcott , director of the schools in the last month , the redundancies were part of the budget that was passed in June .
A member of the council shot back and told him that spezifiziere nothing in the budget that the school aid workers would be laid off .
Officials from the City Council 37 said they have warned the Ministry of Education in a complaint , and there will be a press conference on the submission of the case before the Supreme Court in Manhattan will formally announced on Wednesday .
The complaint is Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education of the city as a defendant and eight laid-off workers count as plaintiffs , all of which are coloured or Latin American women , like most of the workers who have lost their jobs .
Elizabeth Thomas , a spokesman for the Ministry of Justice of the city , said that the city would not be the complaint and therefore could not comment on their individual claims .
According to a draft complaint , the New York Times , the union has been on the number of redundancies at the schools in poor neighborhoods of the city , in order to support a complaint for discrimination ; they claim that poor schools have lost more workers , because they are chronically underfunded .
It states that , while there are no redundancies on Staten Island , and only a few redundancies in the schools of the Upper East Side or TriBeCa , 17 school workers in District 23 in Ville , Brooklyn , have lost and 46 workers in the districts of 8 and 9 in the South Bronx were .
With the loss of five of eight school who , in the 36 public school in Harlem , where 68 percent of the students live in poverty , were employed , the complaint says : `` This is not a neighborhood worried-but-wealthy parents can organise the donations to offset budget cuts . ''
P. S. : the budget of the 36th Distrikts this year has been cut by 3,26 percent , but it also lost money when the city of its calculation method for the extra funding for any Armenschuleneinschreibung changed .
The union also complained that the head of the high schools by the language in a memo , which approved the dismissal of the care coordinators .
The memo used the English word `` excess '' to describe the act , even if `` excess '' ( German ) in the United States usually the change of a teacher from the payroll describes a school in a pool of available workers who are paid by the central office .
`` Sechsundsechzig care coordinators have been laid off , '' says the draft .

What represents the fraud in health coverage ?
After the family benefits UMP and government health reports .
Nicolas Sarkozy will on Tuesday , 15 November arrive in Bordeaux to visit a family aid fund and a speech on the - has already been in place since 2007 , the recurring theme of the fight against social fraud , as well as to raise economic dependence on the state .
In order to accompany this attack , which comes from the desire to take the economy in a tough test , on the other hand , however , no less a harbinger of an axis of right-wing presidential campaign , the majority wants to focus on employee health reports .
The First haushaltswirtschaftlichem goal : the government is aimed at the introduction of a fourth Karenztag before taking a health care speech Krank workers in the private sector .
In plain English , this means that a sick worker without the approval of the specific company would lose the wages of four days , so at least 15 % of his monthly income .
A measure which , according to the newspaper `` Les echoes '' threatens to provoke anger , would help to bring in 280 million euros .
And with a different measure more symbolic nature : the state officials in an unvergüteten Karenztag in sickness ( so far there is for them , in Gegensatze on the three days of waiting in the private sector , no waiting period ) .
Meanwhile , these issues in the debate , sparked by the majority of the fraud , and this time the abuse associated with labour shortage .
`` Checks will be much more important , and they are also rückzuvergüten , if that is required , '' warned Xavier Betrand on Sunday , 13 November before the microphone of the station RTL .
As in other cases , the effects of this reporting about the reality of fraudulent activities in the field of health information is a little unproportioniert .
This is , in fact , has already been the subject of permanent observation since 2002 , as well as political offensive operations , which have borne the most fruit .
The French are no longer ill more often than people elsewhere in Europe .
We are , however , with the nationwide figures .
According to the national health insurance fund CNAM , in 2006 , more than EUR 237 million daily compensation paid .
According to the Economic Research and Documentation Institute of health care , the daily compensation in 2008 with 11.3 billion euros , 5 % of health spending .
Under this amount fell 46 % on maternity leave and occupational accidents and 54 % on sick leave , heiβt EUR 6.2 billion .
And , therefore , 2.5 % of health spending .
In 2010 , the French compared to the 17.8 days in 2009 , according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group on average only 14.5 sick days .
An average , which masks some differences : a different monster in 2007 , the website for career planning , has been published , showed that 75 % of the 40 000 French workers claimed to have taken a single Krankentag .
Another , this time by the health insurance study makes it clear that 37 % of health coverage in 2010 of shorter duration than 8 days ; 22 % between 8 and 14 days , 15 % between 15 days and one month , 15 % between one and three months and 11 % .
Compared with their European neighbours , the French workers tend not more than elsewhere , to work .
One in 2010 by two researchers from the French national Centre for Scientific Research ( CNRS ) conducted long-term study showed that between 1994 and 2001 , the global absenz ratio ( the reduction or otherwise ) oszillierte in France between 10 % and 11 % to 20 % and 28 % in Denmark , 15 % in the United Kingdom , or 16 % and 18 % in the Netherlands .
The fraud in health coverage represents a very small proportion in terms of undeclared work .
With regard to the fraud will be achieved only a weak Ausmaβ .
Encouraging the legislation since 2002 means that there are systmatische controls on health coverage exceeding 45 days .
In 2008 , the CNAM ( public universities for education and training of technicians and engineers ) below 1.5 million checks found that 13 % of the 285 000 of the short-term health coverage , which means in 37 050 cases , `` unjustified or too long . ''
When it comes to the systematic controlled cases of more than 45 days duration was 11 % from 1.2 million in `` unangepaßt or unjustified '' cases , which means 132 000 .
This is a total of 169,000 cases of `` unjustified '' several million workers who have been , in force .
A paragraph , which is only a weak Ausmaβ against , for example , the black economy .
According to the UMP-Abgeordneten Dominique Tian , author of a report published in July on this issue , it is between 9 and 15 billion euro tax loss per year , i. e. more than the total cost of daily expenses , and thus far more than the Defraudation in the last .

This was the work of the doctor , who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A Lophoskopist from Cali as the man who `` Alfonso Cano '' identified in history .
The work of these officials plays a key role .
On 4 November , a Lophoskopist the investigative unit of the Public prosecutor 's Office ( CTI ) from Cali as the man who the identity of the leader of the FARC ( Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ) confirmed : `` Alfonso Cano '' by comparison of the fingerprints .
Of the seven Lophoskopisten in the department of CTI , this week Eliazar González on-call time , a man from Puerto Tejada for 21 years is cooperating in criminal investigations and proceedings .
At the beginning of his career working in communities of Chocó , where he had to go often five days in the jungle to reach the place where the bodies were found , he should identify .
2000 siedelte after Valle on and after the completion of the necessary specialized courses on Lophoskopie , which is the investigation of the skin is exposed to the friction , i. e. the hand and foot .
In the week of the campaign against the so-called Alfonso Cano Eliazar pointed out , put clothes for at least three days .
Great things expected of him .
Friday night he flew in the helicopters from Palmira to Cauca .
He knew that he should identify two corpses , and that there was a suspicion that the man who had guided the oldest guerrilla in the world , and that is why he should Guillermo León Zehnfinger-Abdruckblatt Sáenz ( his real name ) .
However , when he reached with the Untersuchungste the place where the body was , he could not identify because of his physical appearance , because this resembled the images he had seen in the mass media , not in the least .
He had no beard , was dressed like a farmer in the area , no glasses and was much thinner .
But fingerprints do not lie .
Armed with a magnifying glass , ink , a Pflanzkelle and a pocket lamp Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those on the vote .
He was right : it was `` Alfonso Cano . ''
The same night was responsible for this man from Puerto Tejada for the defence minister , Juan Carlos Pinzón , to say that it was the head of the FARC .
In the track
For a Daktyloskopen from Sijín in Cali was that the President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar Gonzalez at a press conference on the use of `` Cano , '' very important .
Many people do not know our work .
The Daktyloskopie is an exact science without error rate , which can be a key factor in the dissolution of a criminal offence .
Lophoskopisten identify not only corpses , they also support an investigation into murder and robbery and confirm the identity of the arrested persons .
In their arrest , many criminals are false identity papers or they do not .
We are taking fingerprints and look for them in the database .
The researchers told us that he had to grab a theft of a piece of wall from a house , because the thief had aufgestützt exactly at this point , with his hand when he stuffed with jewelry and money herauszog safe .
`` The walls are difficult , because their surface are unsuitable for fingerprinting , but in this case , we have been able to take the shot in the hand and the offender , who had participated in several thefts , identify , '' he recalled .
With the help of fingerprints murder suspects can also be relieved or contaminated .
Recently , one death , surrounded by bottles of spirits .
During the investigation , it was suspected that a family member could be tatverdächtig and a fingerprint actually agreed on the bottle .
Although this does not guarantee that the murderer , but he will be the place where the crime was committed .
A Daktyloskopist of CTI stated that `` the fingerprints with chemical or physical Reagenzen were taken away from the object . ''
If they appear , a Pflanzkelle or a band will be used for the carriage .
After that , the prints are sent to Asif , that is the criminal database , or Personenstandamt .
`` The problem is that there are still many Colombians without papers , '' said the expert from the CTI .
He said that not everything is as it was portrayed in the TV series SCI .
Just as it is not all gold that glitters is not everything it touches , a fingerprint .
But it can be used if an appropriate comparison .

A statement from the presidential palace announced that on Sunday appointed Monti would meet on Wednesday with the president , Giorgio Napolitano , in order to confirm the formation of the government .
It is expected that he will present a cabinet by the majority of technocrats , although it is not yet clear when the new prime minister will take up his office .

`` We believe that the efforts of professor Monti are destined to achieve good results , '' said Angelino Alfano , secretary of the centre-right party .
The support of the PDL , Italy 's largest party , is essential , because until now , many of its members against a majority of technocrats government , particularly the .
Support from Parliament
The new government of Monti needs a strong parliamentary support for the implementation of the likely unpopular austerity measures .

The menu of a fettsüchtigen child : it is not eating breakfast and eats supper sausage
More than a third of children from 9 to 13 have problems with obesity , with 9 percent of all pupils and 5 percent of all children are overweight .
Recent surveys have shown - obese children usually come from families with unhealthy lifestyles .
This shows once again how important for the healthy development of a human environment , where he breeds and the examples are surrounded .
On the tables of adipöser children sausages were up to half more often on the table than in families in which normalweighty children live .
More than 19 percent of overweight children were on the eve of the information campaign under the slogan `` obesity is not a coincidence '' chips for dinner .
In families with Dickerchen also sport not exactly the favorite activities , but also , the majority of today 's students - only 15 percent said that their parents at least once a week to find time for active movement .
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place last year at the end of the school year , nearly 900 children from primary schools in the Czech Republic .
It was the second year of action `` obesity is not a coincidence , '' which will be supported by the general health insurance company and the company Unilever .
So far , the project is more than 12 thousand pupils from 4th and 8th classes .
Unhealthy diet and lack of movement in the family are key factors that are responsible for the alarming increase in the number of children who are overweight or obesity .
`` Only half of the surveyed children , for example , five times a day , the modus zweites frühstück Frühstück-Mittagessen-Vesper-Abendbrot - one of the main conditions for a healthy diet , '' is one of the survey results .
No breakfast and sausage for dinner
Experts point out that even relatively minor matters , such as the regular breakfast time of the family are important for the healthy development of a child .
In the Czech Republic have breakfast but only 23 percent of the families of the students .
And , in most families , everyone frühstückt for themselves .
The worst was the fact that is not gefrühstückt in every tenth family .
The breakfast is the cornerstone of a healthy daily diet .
The survey test , among other things , the that the families of overweight children consumed more often unhealthy chips .
And almost everyone - regardless of weight - drink every day sweet soft drinks ( 70 % )
Although more than 40 percent of the children surveyed sport , but only less than half of their parents do - only 15 percent .
Just think your own menu together
Another part of the survey allowed selected children ( 204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools ) , offered opportunities for appetite and view their own menu .
`` As far as Czech children between 12 and 15 in terms of nutrition , is a far cry from the ideal of a healthy diet .
Among their favourite foods were many flour foods , meat dishes and , of course , fresh food .
`` What is alarming is the great popularity of sweet fizzy drinks , '' in the final report on the survey .
At lunch , the main court , pasta just before poultry .
Pulses liked children virtually nonexistent and the popularity of fish and vegetables courts as lunch was very low .
Hinkehr health
At the same time , the survey showed that the children are quite willing to change their eating habits , if they get the right information .
`` In the control group of survey participants , the questionnaire after the informative lecture '' obesity is not a coincidence , `` in many cases , was a significant shift of preferences to principles of healthy diet , '' is in the results of the project .
This was , for example , in the sweet Limos , where many children began to give priority to ordinary water .
The U.S. military in the questionnaire is also much more chicken or fish as a main course of the day and were ready to eat less dumplings or sweet foods .

Nord Stream , new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline , which is at the bottom of the Baltic Sea and Western Europe unites directly with Russia , has been put into operation .
It is intended to provide gas for the equivalent of 30 million households .
The Russian Gasriese Gazprom wanted to celebrate this event with pomp and ceremony .
More than 500 invited guests , including four heads of state and government , last Tuesday on the Baltic coast under Orchesterbeschallung and gourmet buffet the inauguration of the new gas pipeline Nord Stream , Russia and Germany under the sea links directly with each other .
The German Chancellor , Angelika Merkel , Russian President Dmitry Medvedev , the French Prime Minister Francois Fillon and his counterpart Mark Rutte from the Netherlands have symbolic joint turned the steering wheel of the channel , which the Russian gas transported into the Western European network .
With the new gas pipeline to 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas per year through an initial pipeline of 1224 km , which the region of st. Petersburg in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania , will be delivered to Western Europe .
A second pipeline , which has a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas - the equivalent of the French total consumption - is to be completed by the end of 2012 .
And the possibility of building a third pipeline of themselves .
For Gazprom , the timely and accurate completion of this vast edifice as a victory .
The project was in Poland and the Baltic states strongly disputed .
The Nord Stream pipeline will provide a direct gas supply to Germany , avoiding any route , through third countries ( Poland or Ukraine ) in the country .
For this reason , these two countries are losing a little of its power : it is now more difficult For them to exert pressure on Russia by threatening to close down access to western European markets .
Warsaw , most involved in the debate , has not shied away from the Nord Stream pipeline with a `` new deutsch-sowietischen pact '' in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the occupation of Poland in 1939 .
This means that the issue is politically sensitive .
Western Europe has won the endorsement of this Russian project an even greater security of supply .
This , however , at the expense of starvation of European energy , because the project has a rift between Western and Eastern Europeans .
Russia has managed in barely five years ago , his vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich , Western countries , which have strong Gasverbrauche and its gas reserves are becoming exhausted .
`` This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia , it is a new artery that connects us to organic way , '' said François Fillon confirmed during the inauguration of the gas pipeline by pointing out to what extent the groβen contracts from political and economic side are important .
All of this explains the broad smile in Lubmin number of Gazprom managers in terms of Gaszuleitung .
The construction of this gas pipeline is also a prominent technology .
The underwater pipeline consists of steel and concrete casing , which is intended to protect them from ships berth .
It rests on the seabed around 200 metres deep .
Its construction had to be avoided from the Second World War previous minefields .
`` Some hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed , as a precaution , '' Jens Müller , spokesman for the company Nord Stream .
We also had to be taken more measures to protect the fauna and flora .
The line is a long queue of metal , difficult as 242 Eiffel towers over the entire length is interrupted by nothing : neither valves , or maintenance stations .
A control platform was off the coast of Sweden , but the project leaders have refrained from it , as the Swedes were little eager to a Russian state company in a permanent way to their coasts .
`` In the event of an accident , we are Gasdurchlass in less than a minute , '' Jens Müller clarified .
In the case of a leak gas in the gas pipeline escapes , into the air .
This case comes from the designers , however , as the approaches to the consistency of a leak was estimated per 100,000 years .
The state surveillance of the gas pipeline will be guaranteed by an underwater robot , controlled by an of from external virtue purposes , as well as a device that circulates in the pipeline .
It has the form of a cigar , miβt a metre diameter , will be introduced into the pipeline and moved by the pressure .
After three full days of the movement by the leadership at a speed of 3 meters per second , the device when it arrives very specific information about possible deformations of the metal .
The pipeline was designed to operate for 50 years , without even the slightest repair .
The Gaszirkulation will simply by pressure .
This is 200 cash to the access , 100 cash to the exit .
Five companies have combined their efforts to achieve this project .
The senior leadership , however , remains in the hands of Gazprom , which holds 51 % of the shares .
Furthermore , the German companies E. ON and BASF ( to 15.5 % ) , as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French company GDF Suez ( to 9 % ) .
These five companies have formed a business community that Nord Stream , which is charged with the construction and operation of the pipeline .
It has its headquarters in train in Switzerland , where the tax is particularly favourable .
Gazprom then this society has rented the entire capacity of its Gastransportes and renewable 20 year contract .
`` Gazprom will pay for the overall capacity , no matter how great the real from transporting volume , '' added Mr Müller .
The financing of the baus gas pipeline to 30 % of shareholders , as well as 70 % backed by bank loans .
The total labour costs should amount to 7.4 billion euros for both pipelines .
For GDF Suez , the total investment , for example , 240 million .
The minority shareholders are , however , gewiβ to recoup their expenses , as Gazprom alone bears the risk of liability .
The gas pipeline is a sandy , with pine forested coastal strip in Lubmin from the Baltic Sea .
The 4.5 metres high valves are the Gasaustrittspforte .
Sensors to measure pressure , temperature and other indicators of the arriving gas before it is forwarded to the German gas pipelines .
Since last Tuesday , this terminal with one million cubic metres of Russian gas supplies per hour .
At full capacity would be 3 million cubic metres per hour , as well as 6 million in 2012 .

Urgent warnings from the Pentagon against possible cuts in the defence
Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta fueled the Congress on Monday , when he warned that automatic budget cuts would weaken national security unnoticed , so he set off a financial chain reaction from the halls of the Pentagon to the chessboards in Afghanistan and civilian conveyor belts .
The Pentagon already rethinking cuts of $ 450 trillion dollars over the next decade , but now fears that further cuts 600 trillion or more will be needed if the Congress can reach a conclusion in the spending .
`` The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry , '' Panetta wrote in a letter to the Republican Senators John McCain , Arizona , and Lindsey Graham , South Carolina .
He said that a failure of the Congress in reaching a budget agreement , which will lead to a so-called seizure , would lead to 23 % across-the-board cuts , as well as a halt numerous new projects .
`` Such a large cut , carried out in such a way that would make most of our shipping and construction projects unfeasible - you can not buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and other modernization efforts seriously harm , '' Panetta wrote to the senators .
`` We would be forced to separate us involuntarily from a large part of our civilian personnel and , since the reduction would be implemented quickly , we would have almost certainly kinds of civilians , in order to be able to achieve the goal . ''
`` These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and our alert seriously damage . ''
The cuts were in the end , the combat troops , `` said Panetta .
`` During the war time quotas in the fight against terror are not directly affected by the seizure , the serious interference would adversely affect the war effort in the budget , '' Panetta warned .
`` Recruitment has been cut , leading to delays in the recruitment and hiring supervision , support the war . ''
`` The salaries of the staff would be cut , which leads to late payments to dealers and the legal and political support would be disrupted . ''
The two senators said Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details regarding the potential influence of the automatic cuts to the Ministry of defence .
`` The consequences of a seizure of the Ministry of Defence would be a rapid decline in the United States as the leading military power in the world . ''
`` We are vehemently opposed to this draconian action , '' the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon , when she Panettas letter published .
`` This is a result that we can not live with , and it is certainly not one that we should impose . ''
`` The seizure is a threat to national security interests of the United States and their commitment should not be allowed . ''
Whether Panettas letter and the new warnings of the senators will increase the pressure on a compromise in the budget or will strengthen demands to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen .
Panetta has become increasingly outspoken about the possible cuts , although he has many years of experience with the budget in Congress and the White House , before he came to the top of the Pentagon , and knows that he faces difficult choices .
At a press conference in the last week , the defence minister , painting a gloomy picture , which could face a military shell , but without a core .
`` It is a ship without sailors . ''
`` It is a brigade without ammunition . ''
`` It is an air Force squadrons without sufficient trained pilots . ''
`` It is a paper tiger , an army barracks , buildings and bombs without adequately trained soldiers who are able to fulfil the mission , '' Panetta said in his opening speech at the Pentagon .
`` It is a force , there is a lack of morality and alert , and is not in a position to compete with potential opponents . ''
`` You can be angry . ''
In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham , Panetta new details of how reductions `` creates significant operational risks : delays in times of crisis , conflicts and disasters , serious restrictions on our global commitment and response capacity , which leads to an unacceptable risk in future military operations . ''
And Panetta said that some of the removal of the largest defense projects could fall victim , including those who have already been tested and are already in the early stage of planning .
This list also includes Fighter planes F35 Joint Strike Fighter , a planned new aircraft bombs , the next generation of ballistic submarines , the new litt oral combat Ship and the new ground combat vehicle , the Army and Navy need to replace the Humvee .
We would stop the further development and testing of the F35 , it would in the next 10 years to save up to 80 trillion dollars , but supporters say that it can be an important next step in the buildup , so that the possible dangers posed by China and other opponents .

The threat is real
After the discovery of the `` Zwickauer cell '' Turkish media cast doubt on the German rule of law .
A newspaper speaks of a `` bloody ideology , '' which is now auflebe again .
The murders of eight Turkish and a Greek small entrepreneurs in the years 2000 to 2006 had a right-wing extremist background .
This news will be in Turkey and in the Turkish population in Germany reacted with fear and concern .
For many German türken returns with a long totgeglaubtes ghost : Since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993 , there has been no comparable violence with extreme right-wing background against Turks .
The fact that in Germany , there is xenophobia , however , was never in question .
The right-wing extremist network reveals , however , reveals proportions , whose dimension is still a long way .
`` The bloody ideology ? '' the headline on the Internet edition of the Turkish newspaper Haber Turk. ``
The newspaper Sabah , however , stressed that one of the perpetrators has been a V-Mann of the constitutional protection , and expresses concern that German authorities could be involved in the far-right quagmire .
Besonnen responded to the Turkish community Germany : remembered at the weekend with a vigil at the Brandenburg Gate to the victims of racist violence .
Only two weeks earlier had thought the Turkish community in Berlin with German and Turkish politicians in a ceremony of the 50th anniversary of the Turkish anwerbe agreement .
The was orchestrated in cheery colours - as a history of success .
As a slap in the face , because the reporting of some Turkish media : `` Germany 's gift to the umpteenth '' is the title of an article in the Turkish Internet platform `` Haber X , '' which cites the background of the series of murders .
The German edition of the `` Hürriyet '' it is not to be linked .
`` It starts to stink , '' is the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci .
He stressed that people have been murdered , the taxes paid and with their work is an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany had done .
It will be extremely critical in Germany 's Turkish Internet forums , the actions of the police and their later investigative success .
Why the German authorities would not have much more to look in extreme right-wing circles for suspects , the authors were surprised .
Some shows , at least rhetorically committed to drastic measures : `` will continue to be done carelessly , the migrants do nothing other than the defense and the armed forces . ''
`` This will probably be the best protection . ''
`` The quality of the Enlightenment and the appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network depends very much on the internal peace in Germany , '' writes `` selenium . ''
What does it mean if the internal peace in Germany is in danger , the attacks demonstrated by Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s .
The photograph of the fire ruins of Solingen is deeply embedded in the German and Turkish memory .
Because no other event showed the Turks living more clearly that there is a tangible threat , and the Germans that can lead to mistrust and distance in right-wing violence .
The attacks , however , the attacks we sense on the Turkish side .
The mistakes of the past are not repeated
In the Turkish press was particularly at the time , above all , the failure of German policy after the attacks : Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln .
After the arson attack in Solingen he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish President , however , represented by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel at the funeral in Cologne - Kinkel was in his speech on how many charges , the local Turks .
So , as berechne the value of a human being , according to the size of its tax revenues .
The current reporting of the Turkish media once again shows how deep the distrust of many German Turks in the rule of law .
In addition to the efforts of an extensive education and re-evaluation of the extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany needs open words .

The court approved for 2015 , the transition to digital television in Mexico
The switchover from analogue to digital signals in the world in recent years , the most important changes .
The Supreme Court of Mexico ( SCJN ) , the constitutional claims , which the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies were lodged against the presidential decree , and the switch from analogue to digital signals must be brought forward from 2021 to 2015 , due to a lack of eight votes are needed for the legal challenge .
A minority of four ministers , including the President of the Supreme Court , Juan Silva Meza , was of the opinion that the President Felipe Calderón has not exceeded his powers when he decree-law with the details of the switch to the terrestrial digital television .
With this decision was rejected by the Senate 's constitutional dispute , because he did not have the necessary qualified majority of eight votes , so that the court could decide the constitutionality or the constitutionality . So the law remains in force .
In the project for the complaint , which the Minister Olga Sanchez Cordero has been proposed to explain the decree law unconstitutional because , for the radio and television regulations affecting the Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones ( Cofetel ) ( Federale telecommunications Commission in Mexico ) is responsible , which is why the decree-law hierarchical principles and the law would contradict .
In favour of the project , only Zaldivar , Jorge Mario Pardo , Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero .
With this argument , both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies constitutional complaints against the decree-law . After the adoption of the complaints , the Minister Sánchez Cordero decree-law no longer and all activities to create the digital transmission .
The Council of Ministers also rejected the complaint filed by the Chamber of Deputies , without entering into the debate on the project , for which the Minister Sánchez Cordero was responsible .
In his speech , the Prime Minister , not to agree with the arguments of the project , in the sense that the national government is not with the general provisions of the measures , which should take the public administration must regulate .
`` I do not believe that , if we were to do , that would undermine the independence of the regulator . '' you recalled that the planning of strategic policy areas , such as the telecommunications sector , the central state government is responsible for constitutional reasons , because it is the state affairs .
The replacement of analogue signals by digital is one of the most important changes that have taken place in recent years around the world , and it leads to a better use of the elektrischen spectrum , a higher quality of the signal and more channels .
The delay in the changeover , she said , was a postponement of the gain of digitisation , which is a decision in the public interest , not just a technical point of view , `` because they include economic , social , political and security aspects . ''
These matters , she said , `` the action of the entire system , in accordance with the principle of economic management by the state had a group of characteristics , which the Constitution in the hands of the central government . ''
She called that many countries around the world , the digital conversion have already carried out , and the government , even though they have highly specialised facilities .
It could not conclude that the government with the publication of the contested law decree in the powers of the Congress , because the laws passed by the legislature would be respected , `` he said .

The main assembly is to find a new chairman - a stalemate .
Almost five months , the Czech football no chairman and that the successor of Ivan Hašek will be at the head of the Czech football Association ( FAČR ) , not even after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk known .
To date , there is still no agreement on how the electoral law is to be elected .
And without , there is no vote on the three potential successors .
Three interested parties want to manage the Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl , Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík .
In June Hašek resigned from his post , and his colleagues in the departure had to reach an agreement and to find a strong personality , which could lead to the football in the future .
However , in the era after Hašek broke the old squabbles between the two chambers were once again , unable to agree on a joint candidate .
This was clearly on 16 September , when the new chairman should be chosen .
The delegates of the main assembly were in vain in the People 's House in Prague Smíchov quarter , because the trial produced no result , and it was not just about the election itself .
You could not agree on who is entitled to vote in the full collection - only the statutory representatives or officials equipped with a power .
In this single point reached at least partial agreement , including the recommendation of the Institute for state and law , whose opinion a representation at full power base was not admissible .
The disputes over the electoral law , however , continue to persist .
The executive committee did not bring more clarity on the issue in meetings - no matter whether ordinary or extraordinary , in principle , nothing else on the agenda .
Even if the views in relation to the election of a few times - the worst point remained the same .
The question is : what should we do in the third round , in order to avoid a stalemate ?
`` The issue is the question of whether we should proceed in accordance with the Statute , or whether a different model must be found , '' said dušan Svoboda , one of the three vice-chairmen of the FAČR , which in the management of the professional football .
According to registered model prevails in the third round of the one candidate who receives the greater disposable support in the chamber , for which he is standing .
Moravia is supposed to be ready to respond to the compromise that candidate win the higher number of votes from both chambers .
The Czech side , in turn , is on the condition that the victor in this percentage vote count at least a two-thirds majority .
`` The two Vorrunden make no sense , this modus operandi would , the entire bicameral concept in question , '' Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side , it would be best not to bend the electoral law , but to choose under current statutes .
Surprisingly , this is also true Tomáš Paclík , even if it seems that the statutory order of all the candidates most likely Pelta .
`` My wish is that as much as possible will be in accordance with the statute . ''
`` This is no nonsensical ersatz variants to be invented , as in the last general meeting , '' said the owner ( of the football clubs ) Victoria Plze , who is standing for the first time , above all in its opinions from to Pelta .
Pelta , however , remains optimistic .
In his opinion , will be known in Nymburk the new chairman , and he believes that the candidates will cooperate constructively in the future .
`` The possible qualification of the national team for the European football championships today would certainly help to calm the emotions . ''
`` If the football on the euphoric wave , it is also the willingness to cooperate more , '' said the official from Jablonec by all three Adepten has the most experience on both professional and regional levels .
Rajchl is more restrained .
`` I hope for an agreement , but the situation is , unfortunately , ambivalent . ''
`` It is not a matter between the people from Bohemia and Moravia , but there are certain efforts , the rules for their own purposes '' fudge . '' ``
`` That is why it is not ruled out a new blockage in the main assembly . ''
`` I hope that common sense prevails in the end , '' said Rajchl .
Only - a lot of time for the agreement of all sides .
Some negotiations should take place allegedly directly in Montenegro , but who knows whether the football generals until the qualification will be at all .
The charter plane , which , among other things , Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl should fly Podgorice , could not start in the morning in Prague because of a technical malfunction at all and so feverish for an alternative option as a part of the executive committee to get to the site of the Barrage-Hinspiels .
Ultimately , it is surely the meeting at ministerial level crucial to which it is supposed to come on Wednesday .
Josef Dobeš , the minister for education , youth and physical education would have liked to have , the divided parties within the largest sports associations in the country to reach an agreement .
There is a lot at stake : state grants , the Vertrauungswürdigkeit of Czech football and also the forthcoming general assembly of the ČSTV , the Czech sport in the financial problems of Sazka 's new direction .
Paclík goes in the battle for the position of the chairman , because he sees no suitable candidate
If Tomáš Paclík , the head of the Pilsner footballer before the extraordinary general meeting would be able to make a strong candidate all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic ( FAČR ) have been met , he would have nothing to do with the battle for the top position .
`` If there would be a good candidate , then I would fight for him and give up the election . ''
`` But in the current situation , it is not managed to find an Adepten , '' said Paclík ČTK .
The main reason for Paclík to go into the match with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl , so it is to prevent the supposed favorites of the election , Pelta , arrived at the top of the FAČR .
Paclík also stressed that he if he wins the role of chairman , only one year , until 2013 , until the date of the extraordinary general meeting .
In the position of the chairman , he would like to see an experienced `` not too much involved in the football .
`` With some of the people I have spoken personally . ''
`` Hard to believe that some people said that they do not want to identify with the Czech football .
`` Such views would have liked to have changed , '' he said .
The most of all Paclík alleged Pelta links with the chairman of the Pilsner District Football Association , Roman Berbr , a man with a controversial reputation behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist , with the ability to delegate votes at general meetings .
For Paclík it is unacceptable for this reason that Pelta the position of the chairman .
`` His victory would einkonserviert today and in the Czech football , it is not at all . ''
`` The support of Berbr , a cleverem Businessman , would be doubly bad football , '' said Paclík .
Here he plays that Pelta 's name some time ago in connection with phone taps on the investigation in a corruption affair , but from the Pelta unpunished .
`` I do not know what the prestige of a victory of Pelta ( tsch ) should play football . ''
`` And how we would in the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA , '' said řekl Paclík , his previous statement , `` he will sell the Pilsner football club , if Pelta chairman will be , '' but it looks a little more calmly .
If Paclík in Thursday 's election , he could imagine a future cooperation with Pelta .
Similarly , another candidate - Rajchl , had supported the Paclík before the General Assembly in October , which ended with a fiasco .
`` He ( Pelta ) would be the first to which I would go . ''
`` He has great skills . ''
`` I could imagine him well , for example , as head of the national team . ''
`` But I do not believe that he is able to lead the association as a manager . ''
`` I am not my nose in matters , which I understand , '' said Paclík , who was in September for attention that he was behind the recall of the referee Commission with Luďěk Macela at the helm , Dagmar Damková replaced .
Paclík claims that he felt the role of the association chairman .
And holding up his skills in the management of private firms , since last summer , he is also head of Pilsen , celebrated with his support in May , the first triumph in the league .
`` I have the power to do something to change in the football environment , and to a certain cultivation of this . ''
`` In order to limit the influence of certain interest groups that tend to the disciplinary and appeal commissions , which descends into horrific situations , '' which makes no secret of his antipathy for example , to the Sparta leader Daniel Křetínský .
As one of his priorities would be the strengthening of relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee , in which he would evoke the political leaders to ensure that more money from the lottery tax in sport .
`` This is one of the key things that the new chairman should pay . ''
`` When it comes to the taxation of happiness , such as the political parties , then I understand their reasoning , but they must also be clear where the money is going , '' he said .
His link to the Pilsner club Paclík is also not a handicap , although he pointed out , the chairman of the FAČR must be `` bipartisan . ''
Pelta , in turn , is linked to Jablonec , Rajchl with the Prague Dukla .
`` It is not ideal . ''
`` It is not my opinion but much sense to transfer my shares in Pilsner club hypocritical to a third person to return after one and a half years , '' said Paclík clear .
Pelta promised new statutes of the FAR ausschlössen a stalemate in the future .
Two days before the general meeting of the Football Association promised one of the candidates for the chairman , Miroslav Pelta , he will be in the case of his election , that the FAČR gets new statutes in future disputes over the electoral law to exclude from the outset .
The official from Jablonec is confident before the Thursday hearing in Nymburk and believes that the election campaign will defuse a possible success of the Czech selection .
Pelta had not realized election in September , he wants to focus in the case of his election to the national team and the extraction of financial resources .
He decided at the last moment to participate in the election before the last general meeting , and it might help him the two-month break , to defend his ideas on the management of football and in a broader context .
`` People at all levels dedicated to football , they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman on Thursday is known . ''
`` He feels that it is high time that the association is led by someone who believes the man who is associated with the Jablonecer club , but also for many years in Sparta and acted in the executive committee .
He also believes that he has sufficient experience to guide the Czech football .
He is convinced that the current problems with the election of the euphoria is at the time of Ivan Hašek .
`` Unfortunately , were approved at the general meeting in June , which were not as complete as it had adopted .
If they do not allowed to different interpretations , we would have had a chairman , `` said Pelta .
It is the revision of the most important document of the citizens '' association he used as bait for the delegates .
`` I should be president , then I take it personally , and I am ready to take personal responsibility if it does not work . ''
`` It is a matter of principle , without which he can not be , '' said Pelta .
In addition , he is not trying to define his opponents .
He had previously announced that he could imagine a cooperation with Jindřich Rajchl , which he recognizes because of his legal education , and he knows well that his opponent would be his first deputy .
It also Tomáš Paclík attack , for a long time , which has no dry thread Pelta .
In football , he has more than a year and can already point to some successes. ``
`` His attacks were herabsetzend , and many people were shocked by his election campaign . ''
`` This is also why many doubt its true nature , '' adressierte Pelta his opponent , who will remain faithful to its proclamations , which he has already expressed in September .
In his opinion , his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest divisions , to the national team .
And this should be the flagship Czech football .
`` I would also like to try to put an end to all Affairen - from the fog Bohemians , to the halls of the corruption scandal last year . ''
`` I would like to negotiations with the private and public sector , in order to ensure sufficient funds for the whole of football , '' said the sechsundvierzigjährige candidate ČTK two months ago .
At that time , he also promised that his arrival at the top of the Czech football will mean no human cleansing .
`` I would have been familiar with the content of all employees , '' he said in Strahov direction , where there is understandably nervous because of the long anarchy .
Despite the dezeitigen katastrophischen scenarios , which accompany the forthcoming general assembly , he believes that the delegates are not in vain on Thursday to go to Nymburk .
`` If you really ought to be the only point of contention in the third round , then we will . ''
`` Football needs credibility and he is the only if he finally has a new leader , '' remains Pelta two days before the potentially decisive day of his official career optimistic .
Rajchl promises that the FAČR below him to work hard begins
If the current deputy chairman Jindřich Rajchl at the General meeting on Thursday as the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic should be elected , would this supposed vermiesen many people in the mood .
Rajchl promises that in the event of his election will begin to work hard .
He wants to introduce systemic changes , and the members of the executive committee responsible for individual football fields .
He also promised to resolve the case Bohemians to improve relations with UEFA and FIFA to bring more money into the football and otherwise to continue the work of the previous presiding Ivan Hašek has begun .
`` As chairman , I would like to focus on the football as a whole . ''
Starting from the international contacts with UEFA and FIFA , on the national selection , professional football , football for the young people. ``
`` I do not want to say that I want to do everything alone , '' said Rajchl in talks for ČTK .
`` I am a team player and would therefore like to distribute the powers of the executive committee that each member pays a certain area . ''
And I will be distributing tough tasks , so that the football in every segment is moving forward. ``
Moreover , many not just delighted , because they , rather than to criticize the work of others , should begin to work really hard , `` he added .
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement have not to stand at all .
`` I know that I am working 20 hours a day . ''
`` But I must know that it makes sense and that people are behind me , I do not use a stick between the legs and every step that I am put into question , '' he said as an explanation of why he hesitated .
`` Many people told me that I should not give up , because otherwise others would do it . ''
`` This is confidence that we must not squander , '' he said .
It is allegedly motivated him , should be able to continue the work he has begun under Hašek .
`` In two years we have accomplished a great deal of work and I will not just throw away . ''
`` There have been trials started only in a few years to play , and I would like to see someone cut off , '' he said , and expresses its concern at the fact that in the event that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta elected , the situation could return to the days before Hašek could return .
`` I believe in systematic approach , and that is something that does not Mirek Pelta . ''
`` Behind him , above all , people who would make the football so that he would be only for exclusivity . ''
I think we can accuse some , but not that I would be biased. ``
`` I am trying to be objective . ''
`` I want football for everybody , because it all goes well , and not just the man , '' said Rajchl .
It also contradicts the assertion that he was only a leader of the Czech Republic .
`` Even if some people say the opposite , I have to do what is best for Moravia . ''
`` For example , it is time to consider whether the league should not be divided into a Czech and Moravian part , whose winners in each of the first league . ''
`` Then it could not happen that today only three Moravian clubs play in the league , particularly for the young players in Moravia is a problem , '' said Rajchl .
Because the head of the Pilsner club Tomáš Paclík joined the battle for the post of chairman , Rajchl does not have the courage to assess his chances that he will be elected .
`` I feel a strong support in the Czech Chamber , which has been elected to its deputy chairman and now recognises that clear successes are behind me , '' Rajchl led to the saving of tens of millions of kronor on unfavorable contracts , the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations with the lottery law as its success .
On the other hand , it is partly the fault of the association was not in a single direction .
While Pelta , he says , `` he was disqualified from the outset , the Czech football with greater confidence , '' he considers the second rivals - Paclík for a strong candidate , the football really have something to offer .
`` No one can question that he Pilsen in just one year has done an excellent job . ''
`` He should be elected , he would probably things continue , Ivan Hašek has begun , and the personnel in the commissions he would obviously not fundamentally change . ''
He would certainly not want to altered just on his favour , `` Rajchl ruling on his rivals .

Immigration is a burden or opportunity for the economy ?
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized for a variety of perspectives - congestion by police , judicial and administrative bodies because of the figures derived policy , this policy , this policy with the status of a `` country of human rights , '' as France had itself .
Recently , the harassment directed against foreign students was marked by the authorities '' side , the weekly schaus , the Interior Minister had in passing ( see Libération on 23 May ) announced that France `` no talent , masons or waiters from abroad . ''
But this policy was only rarely from the economic point of view .
On this issue , there is a broad consensus between right and left .
> from the right side , the tone of Jacques Chirac , who had declared in 1976 that `` 900 people , including more than 2 million immigrierte workers , will pose no problem for a country , '' from left side by Michel Rocard , who had set out in 1990 , France `` could not take the whole poverty in the world . ''
The only difference is the level of generosity
The fear of invasion of national territory by hordes of Polish plumber was divided in 2005 , both from the right and the left .
Both camps , the immigrants were seen as a burden for the economy and the French society .
The only difference is the degree of generosity towards the immigrants who are willing to admit .
Francois Hollande is limited in its programme to which it to , partnership development , to solve our problems of migration . ''
This idea of immigration as a burden , as a problem , can have an impact on the elections ; however , it is economically costly .
As the economists Ian Goldin and Mr Cameron in a recent work , which the latest findings on the immigration ( Exceptional People : How migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future , May 2011 , Princeton University Press , 352 pages ) , a broad consensus among the specialists about the positive impact of the flood of immigrants on economic growth , wages and jobs in the countries of immigration .
The immigration would invalidate the growth and the labour market situation .
The fears about the influence of the migrants are based on the idea that they are threatening the indigenous workers , especially the less qualified to replace by exerted pressure on their wages .
However , experience shows that immigrants are in fact essential complementary than the local wage workers , because they focus on the jobs in sectors that are unausgelastet the job .
The low skilled immigrants work in sectors , local wage workers poking little talented among immigrants working in dynamic sectors in which the training is not aligned with the labour supply .
Positive wage effect
As a surgeon would have difficulties to work in a country where there is a lack of Anästhesisten , this complementarity between locals and migrants have a positive effect of immigrants immigration on wages and domestic labour market situation .
Giovanni Peri has calculated in this way , that a 1 % increase in the flood of immigrants is a miteinbezogene , long-term increase in real wages between 0.6 % and 0,9 % .
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of ideas put forward by the immigrants , as well as the economic growth is conducive to ( high proportion of immigrants naturalized immigrants under American Nobel Prize winners ; Google , Intel , Paypal , eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants ) .
The migrants also contribute to the social systems in European countries , on average , for example , in an amount of 1 % of the total budget .
The International Labour Organisation estimates , for example , that at the age of 30 years after Germany sea person the public budget on average , about his life a net contribution ( revenue minus expenses ) of around 150,000 euros .
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to start his mandate , the lack of intersection `` with the teeth . ''
These teeth , which should deter immigrants , but achieved exactly the opposite effect .

ADB urges Asia to help in the rescue of the euro zone
The Asian Development Bank ( Asian Development Bank ADB ) calls on India and China to support the rescue of the euro zone in its heavy debt crisis , in order to prevent a long-term downward trend , which will slow down the growth of the economy in Asia .
Rajat Nag , administrative director of the ADB headquarters in Manila , said that the two fastest growing economies in the world `` must do '' everything in your power to the recovery of the currency bloc , either by the International Monetary Fund to speed up or through direct mutual agreements .
He warned of the BRIC countries ( Brazil , Russia , India , China ) , the `` dispassionately '' look at the difficulties in Europe , and said that the financial support of the European leadership and European resources through Asia to prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy .
`` We are all in the same boat . ''
`` So everyone is helpful , which can help Europe out of this crisis , '' he told the Financial Times in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai .
`` Asia may be protected to a certain extent , but it is not immune . ''
`` If China and India can help , then by all means . ''
Europe 's monetary union was in the past few months in a severe debt crisis .
In the last few days , Italy rose dangerously interest costs , and the Prime Minister , both Italy and Greece have resigned .
The heavy debt crisis in Europe is fuelling fears that the global economy could plunge into recession and led to calls , the leading emerging countries must unite to support the euro zone .
Mr Nag said that any support in Asia will be channelled through the IMF , but said that mutual agreements - such as the purchase of bonds of the EU rescue fund , the European Financial Stability Facility ( EFSF ) - the European partners in Asia , greater bargaining power .
Anand Sharma , the Indian trade minister , said that `` India will do everything in its power '' to help the euro zone , as the domestic economy is suffering from falling exports and the drying up of foreign capital flows .
`` No one wants to see that the euro zone remains unstable and turbulent , '' he said .
`` We are facing great challenges and we need to maintain a high growth level . ''
`` It is not an option , it is a task , because where else we find work for our millions of young men and women . ''
Others argue that emerging economies such as India have no reason to help the rich Europeans , even if they are facing major economic challenges .
Ashutosh Varshney , a professor at American Brown University , said that it would be politically very difficult to sell the 1.2 billion people in India , aid for Europe , of which more than 800 million of $ 2 or less a day .
`` At some point they will find that the Greeks with 50 retire and holidays are on the beach , and then you have a problem , '' he said .
Lee Howell , executive director of the World Economic Forum , asked why India 's reserves should be used in Greece , the numerous and well paid employees to keep in the public sector , with jobs in bad geleitetet losses einbringe nden institutions such as the railways .
Mr . Nag said that the crises in the euro zone `` significant knock-on effects '' on the whole of Asia .
The ADB forecast an economic growth at 7.5 percent in Asia for the years 2011 / now threatens `` the risk of escalation , '' because of the threat from Europe .
He said that vulnerable emerging markets must `` contingency plans '' to prepare themselves for a downward trend and a significant outflow of capital Wortschaften .

The worst female vices : what is it with you ?
If the men to give some typical female vices , they invariably shake some promptly from the sleeves .
The women , you see in the following lines , in which a few Unsitten review , the men 's blood in the cold ?
Shopping addiction
If her husband to be shopping addicts ?
Do you have to buy at least a weekly ?
Do you like to shop and to be a little more ?
It is in your case a weakness .
Some women are at least aware of this and try to keep their shopping to or less under control .
But hand on heart , what is already in the search for a good clothes from a clothes shop on bummeln , and not all ( in every possible colour combinations ) in the booth ?
Even if the shopping is a hobby for most women for the men , it is often the pure hell .
They have , but how often she said her husband - you really be outside ...
Constant discontent
`` I am not too fat ? ''
`` I would have to buy at least five kilos - I should start to go jogging or Gymnastik ? ''
`` I liked you ? ''
If they sounds familiar ?
Yes ?
Then you belong to the women who are obsessed with how they look .
This is not a long time ago that you should go , but many men have an allergic reaction , if their wife whinges about their appearance .
The stronger sex is agreed - with increasing frequency of complaints are women always unverträglicher .
Order and cleanliness in first place
It is a fight against windmills .
Windows , tiles and dust , the bath scheuern - and this at least twice a week .
Schimpfen you with their partner , because he once again with dirty shoes trample on clean tiles , you chastise the children , because it gescheuerte washing basin is already an and because the glass door in the living room cabinet has been fingerprints that extrapolate so much trouble ?
If you are under this kind of `` Devianz , '' then you should know that we should not exaggerate and order and cleanliness in family life does not in the first place .
This excessive Reinheitsfimmel can harm the mutual relations and , above all , the rest in the family .
Sticheln
`` Dirty Turnhosen in the laundry basket . ''
`` Do you want to attract the old socks really attract tomorrow ? ''
`` A watery towel is not simply on the floor . ''
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade , you should not be surprised that he brings to the Palme .
It is not a bad thing , but they want all his order .
If the men knew this , then the women may not be so much to grumble .
Gossip and novelty
Some women clap and tratschen , behind the backs getuschelt or even slandered or forge alliances .
Women are now focused on relationships , so they like to make such issues , such as , for example , - who , where , with whom , how and why .
I think each of us has a little harmless gossip and novelty at camp .
Hand on heart , that is all women .
But this is not to be confused with gossip aunts gross calibre , whom nobody and nothing is sacred , I think everyone in their environment , and particularly for women pose a significant risk .

Development of the travel prices since 1989
Until 1989 , there were only five in the then ČSSR authorized state travel agents : Čedok , Sporturist , CKM , Rekrea and Autoturist .
The travel agents at the time , above all , sold only travel in the socialist Eastern bloc countries in the West at that time were chosen .
And so Czech tourists travelled to the Baltic Sea ( in the German Democratic Republic ( GDR ) , in the Soviet Union ( Sochi on the Crimea peninsula on the Black Sea ) , to the Black Sea to Bulgaria and Romania and Hungary to the Balaton .
A silver exception was the period from 1962 to 1972 , when it was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia , then Yugoslavia proposed a pro-Western course , and that is why were severely restricted the trips to Yugoslavia .
It was a great paradox of the socialist times that it was not even citizens of the Soviet bloc ( including the Tschechoslowaken ) was allowed to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries .
If a citizen of the ČSSR individually to Poland , for example , or even wanted to travel to the Soviet Union , then he needed a so-called invitation letter , otherwise were individual travel was not possible .
Even then , the travel agencies offered trips to the West , but had to be huge queues or even in the sleeping bags before the travel office , or at least `` good friend '' in the travel office .
So the matter was still a long time .
The so-called foreign exchange commitment - the condition for an exit in the West - was only `` politically reliable '' people - the others were not allowed to travel at all .
The czechoslovak currency was not free umtauschbare currency without foreign exchange promise , it would have been impossible to make the necessary financial resources ( Western currency ) for a trip to the West .
The long journey most Czechs therefore spent their holidays at home , it is no wonder that the Czechs countless weekend bought homes and dachas - a habit that has lasted until today .
The Velvet revolution of 1989 was followed by a travel revolution of the Czechs on the foot .
While until 1989 a holiday in the GDR or in Bulgaria , the measure of all things , the Czechs spent last year , 4.5 million of their foreign holidays in countries of the world .
An enormous paradox today is no longer conscious at all is the fact that the currently popular holiday destination of the Czechs - Croatia until 1989 could not travel at all , because it was part of the former Yugoslavia .
> from the beginning of the 1990s in the last century , the foreign exchange requirement lifted in the neighbouring countries of Western Europe , a huge wave of short visits to Vienna in Austria and Germany .
The Tschechoslowaken could have a long time of their trips to the West simply enough , everyone wanted at least a few days there have been .
For example , the Czech holidaymakers travelling to Paris in the tent in the park , because who would have the money for a shelter in the hotel or in a pension .
A typical feature on foreign travel by Czechs was a with canned beer and sausages , etc . vollgepackter boot .
Another important milestone was the introduction of the free umtauschbaren Czech crown - after decades our tourists were finally free to buy the Western currency .
Our standard of living and the average salaries rose to 1997 , which einmündete in another important moment .
Thanks to the increased demand for travel began to travel agents after 1997 regularly travel by charter flights , which makes the air travel , thanks to the ability to negotiate volume discounts , compared to the past .
At the end of the 1990s , the Czechs , with the exception of the United States , already devisenlosen payments with all the advanced countries in the world , which travel more easily .
Another interesting moment in the history of the `` velvet '' travel came in the year 2000 , when , thanks to the high demand for the first direct charter flight was processed in an exotic country - after Thailand .
Since then , every year to fly direct charter aircraft with Czech passengers in far-off sunny countries ; this year it flies directly from the Czech Republic twelve exotic destinations .
The 100 Tsd . Czechs travel each year in exotic countries !
Another important moment in the era that our `` post-revolutionary '' marked development came in 2008 .
On 17 November 2008 , the U.S. visa requirement for Czech tourists , making our country brutalized for daring definitely among the advanced countries in the world .
In 2008 , the first time , the Czechs spent more than half of their holidays abroad ( 50.3 % ) and for the first time in its history for a single holiday residence , including the cost of the holiday more than 15 CZK per capita .

`` I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a temple knight of Norway , '' he said before a courtroom with more than 500 people .
`` I object to the court , because you have received your mandate of organizations supporting hate ideologies and because it is supported by the multiculturalism . ''
`` I recognise the laws , but I plead not guilty . ''
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue , because he `` Breivik did not want to give the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which he can express his views . ''
For the same reason , he refused to Breivik , a pre-written speech permits at the end of the hearing to go to the families of his victims .
Nesheim also ordered that the police Breivik for 12 more weeks in custody , he will be four weeks has no access to the media , he said that the authorities all visits and all correspondence about eight weeks .
Around 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing .
Some came in the hope of being able to see Breivik in the eyes , others wanted the confirmation that he remains behind bars .
All took part with the aim that everything on a Wegschließen .
`` I thought he is cold and inhuman , '' a survivor of Utoya told the Norwegian broadcaster NRK .
`` It was unpleasant , but for me it is a bit further , after I have seen and heard the suspects . ''
Breivik was wearing a dark suit and a blue tie and worked throughout the hearing calmly and professionally . He looked journalists and survivors in the eye when he entered and left the building .
Despite Breiviks bizarre reference , he would be part of a larger `` resistance '' movement , the judge came to the conclusion that he was not mentally ill and said that there was no evidence that he had accomplices .
It may be some that the attacks of 22 July , apparently the work of an individual extremists and not a group of radicals .
But that automatically the sadness and confusion , of a whole nation still ?
`` I wish he would look like a monster , but he does not do this , '' said the relatives of a victim .

The new , the former European Commissioner Mario Monti - led government needs to adopt a tough austerity package by the Europolitikern was called for the struggling to regain confidence in Italy .
The pressure to rush to Monti , reinforced by the volatile market situation , as a result of the italian government bonds for 10 years with 7 % interest burden . this is in line with the state , in which Greece and Ireland will be forced to apply for the european rescue package .
Emma Marcegaglia , president of Confindustria , the italian trade associations told the press after a meeting with Monti with : “ we said we would this government to support . ”
We believe that this government is the last chance to make Italy from this state of emergency .

A bailout of Italy , with a public debt of 1.8 trillion euros , would be too much for the EU 's current rescue package .
Monti has said that his government had until the next elections , which is expected to be held in 2013 , take , despite the predictions that the politicians give him time to implement the reforms , instead of bringing forward the elections .
Monti has said that he would like to politicians in his cabinet , but the major parties insist that this only from engineers should be a reference to their concerns in the face of pressure from the financial markets imposed procedure .
Political sources point out that the mutual mistrust and disagreements between the parties , the inclusion of people from the political life difficult .

Nord Stream , new gateway to russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline , at the bottom of the Baltic Sea and the western Europe directly with Russia , has been in operation .
You should gas for the equivalent of 30 million households .
Russia 's Gazprom Gasriese wanted to this event with pomp and circumstance .
More than 500 geladene guests , including four Heads of State and Government , last Tuesday on the baltic coast under Orchesterbeschallung Feinschmeckerbuffet and in the opening of the new Nord Stream gas pipeline , Russia and Germany below sea level .
German Chancellor Merkel Angelika , Russian President Dmitry Medvedev , French Prime Minister Francois Fillon and his counterpart Mark Rutte from the Netherlands have symbolischerweise together the tax the Ventils , which the russian gas to western european network .
With the new gas pipeline to additional 27.5 billion cubic meters of russian gas a year by the first pipeline of 1.224 km to the region of St. Petersburg in Mecklenburg - western Pomerania , to Western Europe .
A second pipeline , which is a Gesamtlieferung of 55 billion cubic metres of gas - the equivalent of the french total consumption - allowed , to the end of 2012 will be completed .
And it has the possibility of the construction of a third line of which led to themselves .
For Gazprom , the timely and pinpoint completion of this huge Bauwerkes as a victory .
The project has been in Poland and the Baltic States strongly contested .
The Nord Stream pipeline is a direct flow of gas to Germany , and in preventing any Trassenverlaufs through third countries ( Poland and Ukraine ) on the continent .
For that reason , these two countries a little of their power : for them , it is now more difficult to put pressure on Russia , by threatening to gain access to western european markets , to close down .
Warsaw , most in the debate , was not to be avoided , the Nord Stream pipeline with a “ new german - sowietischen pact ” in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to the occupation of Poland in 1939 .
This means that the issue is politically sensitive äuβerst .
Western Europe has to support this russian project an even higher security of supply .
But at the expense of starvation of a european energy , because the project is blazing a trail between West and East Europeans .
Russia has it in barely five years ago , to bring his vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich , western countries , the strong Gasverbrauche and its gas reserves are running out .
“ This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia , it is a new artery , organic way links , ” François Fillon confirmed at the inauguration of the gas pipeline by pointing out , to what extent the groβen Gasverträge , also of political and economic is important .
All of this explains the broad smile in Lubmin number of Gazprom 's managers about the Gaszuleitung .
The construction of the pipeline is also a prominent technology .
The Unterwasserleitung is made from steel with Betonummantelung before Schiffsankern to protect .
It lies at the bottom of the sea , in about 200 metres deep .
In its construction had from the Second World War previous minefields to be tackled .
“ Around hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution , ” Jens Müller , the spokesman for the society Nord Stream .
Auβerdem had increased Maβnahmen for the Protection of flora and fauna .
The line is a long line of metal , difficult as 242 Eiffeltürme over the entire length of nothing is interrupted : “ neither outlets , still Wartungsstationen .
A Kontrollplattform was off the coast of Sweden , but the project have refrained from taking , as the little Sweden were eager , a russian public company on permanent way to settle their coasts .
“ In the event of an accident we close down the Gasdurchlass in less than a minute , ” stated Mr Müller .
In the event of a leak in the pipeline leaks out of the gas in the air .
This case is of designers , however , is likely to be seen as a little , since the Schweiβnähte on consistency of a leak per 100,000 years been estimated .
The state surveillance of the gas pipeline , both by a robot submarine , the external Observationszwecken by a Seeschiff from is managed , as well as by a device , in the heart of the pipeline is circulating .
It has the form of a cigar , miβt a metre diameter , is in the heart of the pipeline and gas pressure by the move .
After three full days of the movement by the leadership at a speed of 3 meters per second , the device when they arrive very specific information about possible deformations in the metal .
The pipeline was designed to 50 years to work , without the slightest repairs will be subjected to .
The Gaszirkulation will simply by pressure .
This 200 cash to the access - 100 cash to the Austrittsstelle .
Five companies have to implement this project their forces .
The Leitungsführung , however , remains in the hands of Gazprom , the 51 % of the shares .
Still , it is the german companies E. ON and BASF attached to the ( 15.5 % ) , as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the french Firmengruppe GDF Suez ( ever to 9 % ) .
These five companies have formed a business community that Nord Stream , which with the construction and operation of the pipeline .
It has its headquarters in train in Switzerland , where the tax is especially effective .
Gazprom has this society , then the whole of the capacity of their Gastransportes rents out , on renewable twenty - year agreements .
“ Gazprom will pay for the overall capacity , no matter how groβ from transporting the quantity of gas is real , ” stated Mr Müller .
The financing of the Gasfernleitungsbaus was to 30 % to 70 % of shareholders and by bank loans .
The total labour costs should be to 7.4 billion euros for both pipelines .
For GDF Suez , the investment , for example , 240 million .
The minority shareholders , however , gewiβ , their expenses to recoup , with Gazprom alone the liability .
The pipeline is on a sandy , with Kiefern forested coastal strip in Lubmin from the Baltic Sea .
The 4.5 - meter - high outlets are the Gasaustrittspforte .
Sensors measure , temperature , pressure and other indicators of the gas , arriving before this in the german gas pipelines will be passed .

The Skandalbank by Zürisee
The abenteuerlichste bank in Europe is not in Italy or France , but in Switzerland .
The UBS during the financial crisis was nearly bankrupt and since then has been reeling from one crisis to the next .
Now it is a german .
It had thus Axel Weber is certainly not intended .
After his dramatic departure from the head of the Bundesbank was in July 2013 honourable , that he almost as a spectacular new job candidates : Verwaltungsratspräsident UBS , the swiss banking - unexpected and lucrative Karriereschritt .
Axel Weber was public , praised the Switzerland whether their beauty and the UBS whether their newly acquired solidity and friendly comments about the future colleagues .
“ The UBS has the Turnaround managed ” .
“ I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel . ”
But already in September , it was clear that things in an entirely different way .
A trader of UBS in London all security systems of the bank violated and around 1.7 billion euro gambling found themselves .
- UBS CEO Oswald Grübel , a not only in Switzerland vaunted bankers , had to go .
The Verwaltungsratspräsident since then as the UBS is also wounded and all ask : when will finally come Axel Weber ?
Already , it became known that Weber 's February 2012 to discuss .
And the Verwaltungsratsvorsitz takes it back in May , not only in 2013 , as the bank on Tuesday told us .
For Axel Weber will be tough .
He is not a banker , rather Ökonomieprofessor and central bankers and have an apprenticeship period certainly needed .
At a stroke , he will take over the responsibility for the strategy of a bank that has just once again has demonstrated that they have long the title of “ Europe 's biggest Skandalbank deserves . ”
Because the UBS has one huge - until recently , it was the largest asset managers in the world - and slides , on the other hand , for years by a scandal in the next .
Nothing , it seems , is the once proud swiss bank .
It began in the financial crisis .
Until 2007 , the UBS an excellent reputation .
The image of the secretive and solid , but also ausgebufften swiss Vermögensverwalters they had combined with ambitious targets : you also wanted to , the investment banking business is a very large number .
So managed the UBS in 2007 , on the one hand , with 1.6 trillion dollar high - net - worth customers more money than any other bank in the world .
And , on the other hand , was it as an investment bank in the league of the world 's largest banks huddle .
That made sense .
The former banker and subsequent long - standing Bankenprofessor in Zurich Hans auditions told : “ my students , I have the UBS then always as a good bank . ”
“ From today 's perspective , one wonders , how could I just so wrong ? ”
He was wrong .
In 2007 , for the first time , it would appear that something substantial schieflief in the UBS .
In the middle of the year , Chief Executive Peter Wuffli surprising back until that as hochintellektueller and ingenious bankers .
A few months later , suspecting it , how he had taken .
The Investmentsparte the bank had with sub - papers gambling found themselves and had to write off billion .
In order to absorb the UBS announced a capital increase to the tune of as many as 13 billion francs .
For investors , it was , in fact , however , what , on some until shortly before the nose gerümpft : a non - transparent asian sovereign wealth funds from Singapore and an arab sovereign wealth funds , so the silence was that they did not even his name .
But this was only the first blow .
In April 2008 , there were worse .
The bank had to announce new Milliardenverluste , Marcel Ospel Verwaltungsratspräsident , is still the second - best - paid on board of Switzerland , resigned .
In October 2008 , followed by the disaster : the UBS was given its bad investments in the financial crisis and the collapse of the state had to be rescued .
The National Bank bought the UBS for tens of billions of problematic securities , the Swiss Confederation , six billion francs for a Zwangswandelanleihe they Miteigentümerin of the bank .
The whole country was shocked - because she has said , as dramatic for a small country , if it is so large banks .
After all , the balance sheet of the UBS in 2007 , more than five times as large as the performance of the Switzerland ( see chart ) .
“ Once again , we could not save the UBS , ” says Bankenforscher auditions .
In the first disaster joined the second .
A few months later , surrendered the UBS in the tax dispute with America and declared that it was prepared to make the data high - net - worth clients , perhaps with the help of the bank had evaded taxes .
Moreover , they pay a 780 - million - dollar as repayment of unjustified profits from this business and Strafaufschlag .
So that the well - known UBS more or less open to tax evasion .
At the same time it lost something that has always been their capital was in the competition for rich clients : the aura of secrecy .
After the scandal was the swiss banking secrecy is not the same thing .
It was followed by the resignation of CEO and Verwaltungsratspräsident .
And the exodus of Kundengeldern .
The bank within a few months of their credibility in two key portfolios lost : in the investment banking and wealth management in the speculation errors made by the aid to tax evasion .
And just when it was a little calmer , just when you thought , here 's UBS will get it back , there is this unfortunate traders - history : an individual traders gambling found themselves 1.7 billion euros before the bank notes that something was wrong .
And it appears to be : with the risk management , the investment banking business it operates are obviously still not .
“ With the case of Adoboli , we find that the risk controls too little has changed , ” says Martin Janssen , economist and Finanzprofessor on banking institution of the University of Zurich .
The Finanzvorstand a major german bank is sure : “ the problem of UBS is that it will contain not under control . ”
It was just the idea of caution , with the swiss bankers for a long time was launched , guardian of the major assets of the world : not too much risks , for security for money - went beyond the Alpenrepublik times the world would collapse .
The coffers of the swiss banks were a symbol of steadfast reliability as Lindt and especially noble Sprüngli for chocolate .
The UBS 's headquarters in Zurich still fits the stereotype of the sterling swiss private bank - it is just a little bit bigger .
The situation is standard practice .
The bank has its headquarters in Zurich Bahnhofstraße by the Central Station from directly to the Zürichsee leads by the covered summits of the swiss mountains frames .
The buildings here are magnificent , the Ladenmieten are among the highest in Europe .
Jewellers as Tiffany 's will be here as the swiss Traditionsgeschäften Confiserie Sprüngli .
For centuries , the swiss banks , the National Bank of the palace of the Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Bear .
The Empfangssaal the UBS enters one by a heavy revolving door .
Inside , the walls are thick marmorverkleidet , empty chair , in addition to the bank - logo is a great sign for the “ safe ” .
The UBS know what the customer is looking for here : safety .
This idea of the swiss bank have both swiss banks , UBS and Credit Suisse , but at some point out - or betrayed , as the head of a small swiss private bank .
His name , he preferred not to read in the press , after all , like all swiss bankers , even with the two big business .
The UBS has become far too big , it will , especially in the investment banking business , which is also the Anglo - saxons have spread .
The Swiss have there is nothing more to say .
“ And if you are , they have a long time ago the habits of the Anglo - saxons . ”
Indeed , it was the Anglo - Saxon investment banking , the UBS changed its high profits and induced then the debacle : no european financial institution in the sub - prime jungle so much lost money as the swiss banking .
On 15 October 2008 , the disaster .
“ On that Wednesday decided the coalition government of the small Siebenmillionenlandes the biggest bail - out in the history of their nation , ” writes the author Lucas Hässig in his book “ the UBS - crunch . ”
Up to 68 billion francs , or roughly 45 billion euros for the politicians to the bankruptcy of the large bank to save .
How could this happen ?
When you talk with swiss bankers , they see the problem , especially in the size of the UBS .
In June 1998 , two of the three swiss banks to a huge corporation .
There was a bank that has been in the merger was too large for the small country of Switzerland and continue to grow .
It helped that the two different precursor , the banks UBS supplemented : a rich , but verschlafene bank with the focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer , but even more internationalised .
Suddenly , the investment banker internationalised favourable to a great deal of money , with a huge wheel .
Two names are with the rise of the UBS : Peter Wuffli , from 2001 to 2007 Konzernchef of UBS , and Marcel Ospel , then chairman of the board of directors .
“ I always thought that Wuffli Ospel and were a Traumteam , ” says Hans Bankenforscher auditions .
“ Wuffli , the Hochintellektuelle , the modest , and a great deal of models and statistics , and understands the Bauchmensch Ospel , from the top of the Banklehre heraufgearbeitet . ”
But Ospel has finally Wuffli leave .
And Wuffli was probably at the end of a fatal error : “ he thought his models are the reality , ” says auditions .
“ This is a tragic case . ”
Tragic , perhaps .
It is clear : an excess came before the fall .
Staff of the UBS will remember clearly to the leaders - meetings , on which Konzernchef Wuffli again and again on the same slogan : Goldman Sachs Dethrone .
The american bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world .
She led the “ League Tables ” rankings that the success of the banks that time documented .
Then , after UBS wanted to the top .
Some of the steps were her deals .
In the Devisengeschäft and in the trading in shares , she played with top .
The consultant , were called , but a weakness : in international Zinsgeschäft , in the “ Bankersprache fixed income ” , there is a huge gap on the biggest banks .
The UBS have gaps in american Hypothekenprodukten .
To close the gap left UBS in an adventure that they almost the existence of cost .
Hungry for growth , both invested by the Bank itself , as well as a before her established hedge funds in american subprime assets .
It has become a huge machine , the securities on american packaged mortgage lending and passing - but also risks even maintained .
Also , as other banks for a long time out .
“ Even in the summer of 2007 , when the US housing market in flames , the UBS bought there , ” says Bankenexperte auditions .
The euphoria , so deep the case .
A manager after the others had to go , the attempts to clean up are more difficult than had been thought .
Item in the UBS , for this and to date have been shaky .
Who now leads the large bank , has an almost impossible job .
It needs a strategy for a bank to find all the obvious abhandengekommen business models .
Bankenforscher auditions has already an idea : put an end to the focus on investment banking , asset management , return to the swiss roots .
Quite so far to the bank while do not ( yet ) .
But to shrink the investment banking firm , it is already clear .
On Thursday , will the new Bankchef Sergio Ermotti the world its future strategy .
The 51 - year - old italian - swiss was really a temporary solution designed , as the Bank is surprising of predecessor Grübel .
Now he has pushed through : he is the business of the UBS , shared the Zurich Bank on Tuesday .
Ermotti wants the investment bank to the levels in the mid - 1990s .
He cut 3,500 jobs .
But that will not be enough .
The UBS needs a vision .
Who is it ?
And they want to make money ?
These are the questions that Axel Weber sure now .
Publicly he says so far , only that he and his wife once a home in Zurich .
Next year .

Libyan victory
The history of the libyan liberation or libyan rebellion knows about their losers .
Col. Muammar el - Qaddafi , in an unknown location in the desert , buried and without him , the war is over .
Now , only the winners to define .
As usual , this region , islamists win in the elections , the only question is what the moderate or the radical .
The National Transitional Council is well - known to the common law Scharīʿa , which it is now , God for a certain image .
Libya would become a country with no crime , because for theft peck it in short , the hand .
Women should also thought of emancipation as soon as possible to forget any Glaubensabtrünnige are executed , and so on .
Instead of a single dictator will society from each other feuding tribes in future the Koran united .
In short , in Libya , an order that hard to imagine here at home and , above all , hardly be desirable .
Only , our way of life , however , is not the only , and objectively , probably not the best and would change the said Libyans hardly fit .
Seen in this light , it is rather astonishing that the Muslim fighters at all of the infidels dogs help .
In their defence , may well serve only the fact that the air strikes by NATO not by any General from America , but by Allah even led the omnipotence after every successful hit was praised .
The winner in Libya ? the West is not one of them .
We took in only in a gun battle , served the interests of Islam and our politicians were in the person of the dictator of a political ally , without any benefit .
After the fresh and bad experience in Afghanistan and Iraq , we saw would prefer a military occupation of Libya .
As a result , the Hiesigen going on , which is a concern for the expulsion of the crusaders .
But even without the 's occupation of black gold to the song ?
Hardly and so can the West long right of its generosity in the protection of human rights boast .
If they do not spoil the Scharīʿa representatives .

Energy policy :
Facts about dogmas should win
There is a matter that is not on the basis of short - term considerations or emotions can not be dealt with , it is , of course , the energy policy .
Availability and cost of electricity influence in direct Maβe purchasing power , as well as the competitiveness of the companies .
It is reasonable to Wahltreffen a reason to take on this issue , as well as on the position of nuclear energy .
The debate will only bear fruit , if they all the economic , social and environmental consequences of the proposed options explored .
The French should their opinion on objective facts , rational data footing .
Although 7 billion people on the planet , the demographic evolution a doubling of the electricity demand by the year 2050 , is not a huge share of the world 's population at a vital element to give up .
At the same time , it must be the scarcity of fossil resources , in order to continue consistently produce electricity without the pressing need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , of course , from the environmental debate lost subject to forget to combat climate Unregelmäβigkeiten .
The Fukushima accident changed any of these parameters .
Therefore blebt Germany continue in its isolation , on nuclear power .
This is not the case in Belgium , which his decision , the need for a substitutionsfähige Ersatzquelle , nor in Switzerland that is barely intends to only nuclear power plants in the past generation .
Groβbritannien , Finland , Poland , the Czech Republic , the Netherlands , Sweden , South Africa , China , India and Brazil , are just a few of the States , to continue to pursue their projects against it with determination .
The United States , for their part , have decided their Park after Fukushima , another , by after the Three Mile Island nuclear accident set aside to work again in operation .
Even at the renewable energy sources , and german model occasionally as an example , is , however , the reality of the discourse .
The election in Berlin will be in the form of a rise in the passed , one by the increased use of Importgas increased energy dependence on Russia in particular , an increase in the gas - and coal - fired power stations - made CO2 emissions .
The whole of this unfortunate effects will be within a few months .
The case of Denmark is a cause for reflection .
Denmark , on the one hand , european Tabellenführer on wind energy , from which it is 30 % of its electricity , on the other hand , the country is one of the strongest users of coal and gas , in turn used with wind energy , which are its CO2 Ausstösse , as well as his Elektrizitätspreis around 65 % and 50 % higher than the european average .
Thanks to the consistency of our energy policy pay our neighbors in contrast to our french households by 40 % higher Elektrizitätsrechnung .
As the price of energy in the global economy a key role of competitiveness , as well as a Stabilitätspfand industry at home ground , the french companies because of the cheapest electricity in Europe an advantage .
Any significant reduction in the use of nuclear power would be a strong increase in electricity , which the noble statements about the re - industrialisation of our country and the defence of the purchasing power of the illusion will liesse .
Polls showed that a price is the very broad , the majority of the french nor is prepared to pay , as opposition to the principle of the energy source .
Let us remind us that the energy policy of our country has made it possible to an industry with 125.00 direct and 410.000 inferred jobs .
Because of their strong Exportcharakters brings it a whole lot of specialised of small and medium - sized enterprises on international markets and makes these authors of countless jobs .
France should the decision to exit from nuclear power , as would a Groβteil these SMES are victims , and the annual 6 billion euros of capital goods and Kernenergieexport would be more and more greatly reduced .
What an electrician would work to sixty years designed EPR if the decline in its producers is pre - ordained ?
The energy equation to resolve we must accept that it was also a little like the work of the devil a miracle cure for the production of electricity .
Developed by the company Areva , low - carbon solutions on the use of nuclear power and renewable energy is proof of the complementarity of energy sources .
The highest possible level to maintain for nuclear power is an absolute imperative .
In France , we have a safety authority , the clear and transparent controls in existing works such as the construction in Flamanville .
Their Arbeitsteams , which , because of their professionalism made a name , are from the Sicherheitsvorstellung just obsessed .
In 50 years , the nuclear industry has three serious accidents .
Only one , at Three Mile Island , is under normal operating conditions ; so was he without consequences for people and the environment .
At Chernobyl , the drama and Reaktorkonstruktion unendschuldbares , human error caused .
In Fukushima some seem to forget that the accident of two natural disasters of unprecedented scale caused the deaths of several tens of thousands of people .
The nuclear industry is also the lessons to learn from this accident , as it did after the two previous had done .
As a result of this process , and the cooperation of the security forces of the french and german operators and designers of nuclear power plants , the EPR , a draft of the resistance to such things .
Under the Elektrotechnikern as desirable is considered a nuclear power plant to build , it would be a freeze in Flamanville a legendary gift to the competition by EDF and Areva , giving them free rein liesse , the lead in the inevitable Kernkraftentwicklung to reissen .
It is necessary and legitimate , the best Energiebouquet for our country to seek , however , it would be irresponsible , emotions , dogma and Parteimanöber a debate to dominate so economic , social and financial situation of the country determined .

Intelligent Krähen broad in cities from
In many places , Saatkrähen as “ Problemvögel ” : but in the cities , the highly intelligent animals no longer drive , say experts .
The one they may be , the other , they want to get rid of very quickly : Krähen belong to the erased from for centuries , but in many local authorities are more frequent Anwohnerbeschwerden on dirt and noise of the animals .
It is a remedy for the “ Problemvögel ” has so far not in sight .
Saatkrähen are from the cities not to get out more , experts said the first Krähensymposium in ostfriesischen Leer .
There we consulted experts from the entire Bundesgebiet on possible ways out .
If you are looking for alternatives in the cities
Conservationists have led the problems in towns and cities to the exodus of overprotected Saatkrähen back : the Chemieeinsatz in agriculture destroying increasingly the traditional habitats .
The hunt , increasing building and the cases of typical Brutbäumen made life difficult for the birds .
Krähen are under nature conservation .
Large colonies with more than 600 Brutpaaren there is , among other things , in the westphalian Soest in the north - west , among other things , and Jever Diepholz Achim in Bremen , as well as in Leer .
In 2005 , a controversial project to mass killing of Krähen in the district for Negativ - headlines .
Critics had the trapping the animals in Vogelfallen and Erschlagen with clubs as particularly brutal .
“ The normal displacement , the Vergrämen , nothing , ” the town and Landschaftsplaner Werner Klöver from Leer said .
Nests with water wegspritzen or trees , often have undesirable consequences , also said the emperor from an expert on Manfred Lahr in Baden - Württemberg .
“ The animals from soft , large colonies split on and is spread to other areas . ”
Vergrämung is just as an exception to hospitals , nursing homes and schools .
“ We have to live with them , we will get them away . ”
Without the surrounding area will solve the problem in the cities not resolve , said Mayor Wolfgang waiter from Leer .
It could be a combination of Vergrämen the animals from the sensitive Wohnbereichen and misleading them in other places again .
“ Instead of chain saws Infotafeln ” campaigning against the psychologist and Ethnologin Uta Maria Jürgens for an entirely different way of dealing with the animals : “ in the face of a Pickel , we can finally best self - confident . ”
Jürgens had in Schleswig - Holstein the Ascheberger Krähen - Lehrpfad co - founded , in the notices about the lives of the highly intelligent Saatkrähen information .
The project will now have already adopted by tourists .
The criticism of the noise of the birds had Jürgens think : “ there is a lot of communication , which have a lot to say . ”
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary : Saatkrähen use not only tool to in a biscuit , but , as their tools even itself .
Animal behaviorists Cambridge University tested recently four Saatkrähen , how far the intelligence of the birds .
In one experiment , the birds learned quickly that it with stones , a structure to overthrow , in order to a Mottenlarve .
Without a lot of training they realized single - mindedness , the size and shape of a stone must have the platform collapse .
In a second attempt , the smart Krähen then kniffligeres a problem to solve .
In a vertical cylinders , the researchers set up a small buckets with a Mottenlarve placement .
With the Schnabel , the birds do not achieve their prey .
However , the researchers Drahtstücke them off .
It was formed between all four animals a catch to help them the buckets on grip from the bag angelten .
Three of the four Saatkrähen manage even right away .

Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank leaves raw materials business look
By Christian Teevs
Deutsche Bank is their business in agricultural commodities ?
After mirror - ONLINE information - Josef Ackermann has a working group responsible for the consequences of speculation for the world 's poor .
In January by the president of the company himself will then draw the consequences .
Hamburg
For the Bundesbürger it is clear : 84 % of Germans find it , according to a study is not acceptable , that banks with agricultural commodities such as wheat and maize speculate .
Two - thirds of respondents are calling for even that Deutsche Bank and other lenders from the trade off , because the problems of the world 's poorest people .
This is the result of a Forsa poll commissioned by the consumer organisation Foodwatch .
The study is based on a report that Foodwatch presented in mid - October .
It shows the author Harald Schumann , the betting on the global commodity exchanges pushing up prices , and the banks therefore complicit in the global hunger problem .
The campaign by the defender is targeted specifically against Deutsche Bank , head Josef Ackermann , even if big banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly .
Originally , Rohstoffwetten intended for traders to hedge price .
But in the meantime , most experts agree that the gamblers from supply and demand have - and at the expense of the poorest profits .
Unlike the US competitors , Ackermann responded to the criticism , he promised to to investigate allegations and said , “ there is no business worth , the reputation of the german bank to put at risk . ”
According to information from looking into a mirror ONLINE international working group is currently the accusations of the Foodwatch Report .
By the end of the year , will the consideration to be completed , then the results of the Board of the Deutsche Bank - with a recommendation , as to how it will be handled .
At the end of January to the top of the Bank will say what consequences it attracts .
May , in the end , a reduction in the Rohstoffgeschäfts , or even the complete departure .
Ackermann tinkering with his image
Foodwatch leader Thilo Bode welcomed the news , but at the same time , reiterated his criticism of the financial industry : “ the betting on rising food prices shows a particularly vivid , as reckless banks today the common good . ”
Ackermann is the ultimate Bankenlobbyist now particular duty .
“ The german bank must all sites from its portfolio , in which money for betting on food prices will be used , ” Bode said .
“ Regardless of whether Mr Ackermann hunger suffering people or the reputation of the german bank is concerned . ”
The insight of Ackermann is at first glance a surprise , however , it is clear that , by the president of the company himself a few months before his departure from the office of a perfect picture .
On Monday , the german bank , announced that the CEO is different than planned not to its Board of change .
With a move away from the controversial agricultural speculation he could improve its image .
And possible reductions he needs is unlikely to do so , after all of his successor .
Half of raw materials would terminate plants
Foodwatch , the pressure on the manager .
So far , more than 30,000 internet users in the campaign of the organisation .
On Tuesday , the survey published Bode , for which the institute Forsa on 7 and 8 November 1001 people interviewed .
Just 11 per cent of therefore believe that it is legitimate to the german bank facilities offering in the price of food bets .
Many customers would also personal consequences if they know that their bank to such complicit : every second , according to the poll , all facilities , in which money in the commodity speculation .
43 % would acquaintances of such a bank would not do so , 49 % to think about their bank accounts , and another to institute change .

The general meeting to find a new chairman - again threatened a stalemate .
Almost five months , the Czech football no chairman and there is that the successor of Ivan Hašek at the head of the Football Association ( Czech FAČR ) not even after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk will know .
To this day , there are still no agreement on the electoral law would be elected .
And without that , there is no vote on the three potential successor .
Three interested parties want to manage the Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl , Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík .
In June , Hašek of his role , and his colleagues in the departure of inviting had come to an agreement and a strong person to find the football to follow .
Only - in the aftermath of Hašek broke the old spat between the two Verbandskammern once again , which is not on a joint candidate can agree .
This was clearly on September 16 , as the new chairman should be chosen .
The delegates to the general meeting were free of the Volkshaus in Prague quarter Smíchov come , because the trial led to no result and it was not only about the election itself .
One could not even agree on who in the Vollsammlung actually vote - are only the statutory representatives or with a power - wielding officials .
In this one point reached at least partial agreement , including the recommendation of the Institute for the state and the right , whose opinion representation in Vollmachtbasis not admissible .
The disputes in the electoral law , however , continue to take in .
The executive committee did not have more clarity on the issue , in whose meetings - regardless of whether ordinary or extraordinary , in principle , nothing else on the agenda .
Even if the ideas about the choice of a couple of times changed - the nerve centre remained the same .
The question is : how can we in the third round , a stalemate to avoid ?
“ The bone of contention is the question of whether it is in line with the statutes of action , or whether a very different model must be found , ” said the Dušan Svoboda , one of the three vice - chairman of the FAČR , which in the management of the professional football .
According to a registered model prevails in the third round one candidate , the greater the prozentuelle support in the chamber , for which he is standing .
Moravia is said to be ready to compromise on that one candidate wins out , the higher the number of votes from both chambers .
The Czech Republic , in turn , is on the condition that the winner of this percentage vote count at least a two - thirds majority .
“ Then , the two Vorrunden make no sense , this way , all the Zweikammerkonzept in question , ” Svoboda understands the objections of the moravian side , the best there is , the electoral law not tweaking , but under current statutes to choose .
The true surprisingly Tomáš Paclík to , even if it is apparent that the statutory election rules of all the candidates most likely to be Pelta meet .
“ My wish is that as far as possible after the statute is elected . ”
“ So that no nonsensical Ersatzvarianten up , as in the last general meeting , ” said the owner of the Victoria ( clubs ) Plzeň which , for the first time , standing in his opinions and , above all , to Pelta abgrenzte .
Pelta but remains optimistic .
In his view , will be in the new chairman Nymburk be known and he believes that the candidates in the future will work constructively .
“ The possible qualifications of the national team for the Euro today would be sure to reassure the people . ”
“ If the football until the euphoric wave ride , it is also the willingness to cooperate more , ” said the official from Jablonec by all three Adepten the most experience and both at professional , and regional level .
Rajchl there is more circumspect .
“ I hope to reach an agreement , but the situation is , unfortunately , is ambivalent . ”
“ It is not a matter between the people from Bohemia and Moravia , but there are some efforts , the rules to witness the “ baseline ” . ”
“ That is why a new block in the General Assembly is not excluded . ”
“ I hope , however , that the common sense prevails in the end , ” said Rajchl .
Only - a lot of time on the agreement of all parties is not .
Some negotiations must be supposedly directly in Montenegro , but who knows if the Fußballgeneralität until its qualification at all will be completely .
The Charterflugzeug , amongst other things and Dalibor Kučera Rajchl after Podgorice fly should , in Prague in the morning because of a technical disorder do not start and so it sought urgently for a Ersatzvariante , as a part of the executive committee , but are still on the site of the Barrage - Hinspiels .
At the end of the day , then surely the meeting at ministerial level is essential to the supposedly it on Wednesday .
Josef Dobeš , the minister for education , youth and physical education , the divided parties within the largest Sportverbands the country would like to reach an agreement .
There is a lot at stake : benefits of the Czech Vertrauungswürdigkeit football and the forthcoming general meeting of the czech ČSTV , the sport after the financial problems of Sazka 's new direction .
Paclík is in the fight for the position of the chairman , because it is not a suitable candidates
If Tomáš Paclík , the head of the Pilsner footballers before the extraordinary general meeting of a strong candidate would have picked up , all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic ( FAČR ) met , he would do not relate to the fight for this position of concessions .
“ When there is a good candidate , then I would strive for it and to the election . ”
“ But in the current situation , we did not succeed in such a Adepten to find , ” said Paclík ČTK .
The main reason for Paclík , into the match with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl to go , it is to prevent the alleged favourites of the election , Pelta , that the head of the FAČR .
Paclík also stresses that it if he wins the function of the chairman of just one year plans to exercise , so until 2013 , until the date of the ordinary shareholders ' meeting .
In the position of the chairman , he would like to hear a top managers , not too much in the Fußballgeschehen is involved .
“ With some eligible people in person . ”
“ Hard to believe that some people have said that they want to do is not currently with the czech football .
“ Those views would like to have changed , ” he said .
Most of all , disturbs Paclík supposedly Pelta 's link with the chairman of the Pilsner Bezirksfußballverbands Berbr novel , a man with kontroversem reputation , the behind - the - scenes as a powerful lobbyist , with the ability to Delegiertenabstimmungen at general meetings to influence .
For Paclík is , therefore , that it is unacceptable that Pelta , held the position of the chairman .
“ In his victory would today 's state einkonserviert and in the czech football is not making any progress at all . ”
“ The support provided by Berbr , a cleverem Businessman , football twice badly , ” said Paclík .
Now he is also essential that Pelta 's name some time ago in connection with Telefonabhörungen to identify in a Korruptionsaffaire fell from the Pelta , however , emerged with impunity .
“ I do not know what the prestige of a victory by the Pelta ( tsch . ) football should get involved . ”
“ And as we would in the eyes of the FIFA and UEFA off , ” said řekl Paclík , his former utterance , “ he will sell the Pilsner football club , if Pelta chairman will ” , but something more coolly .
In the Donnerstagwahl Paclík should win , he would , however , be a future cooperation with Pelta quite imagine .
Just as thinks another candidate - Rajchl , the Paclík before the General Assembly in October had supported with a fiasco .
“ He ( Pelta ) would be the first , on which I would go . ”
“ He has great ability . ”
“ I would have him well , for example , as head of the national team . ”
“ But I do not think that it is capable of , the association as a manager . ”
“ I caught my nose but not in issues that I do not understand , ” said Paclík in September that raised eyebrows – that he was behind the dismissing the Schiedsrichterkommission with Luďěk Macela at the top , was the Dagmar Damková replaced .
Paclík claims that he felt the role of the Verbandsvorsitzenden increased .
And holding up his skills in the management of private companies , since last summer , he is also head of Pilsen which , with its support in May , the first triumph in the league .
“ I have the power to do so , something in the Fußballmilieu to change and to a certain degree of cultivation of this . ”
“ In order to limit the influence of interest groups , which tend to disciplinary and Berufungskommissionen to influence what by in - bound descends into situations , ” led to the Paclík , no secret of his antipathy , for example , to the Sparta 's leader , Daniel Křetínský .
As one of his priorities would be the strengthening of relations between the FAČR and the czech Olympic Committee , with the help of the political leaders to live that more money from Lotteriesteuer in the sport .
“ This is one of the key things , to which the new chairman should pay attention to . ”
“ If it on the taxation of Glückspielen , as the political parties declare , then I understand their argument , but there must be clear where the money is going , ” he said .
His connection to the club Paclík Pilsner is also not a handicap in , even though he stressed , the chairman of the FAČR need to “ bipartisan ” .
Pelta , in turn , is associated with Jablonec Rajchl , with the Prague Dukla .
“ This is not ideal . ”
“ It makes my opinion but also not much point in my shares in the club to a Drittperson Pilsner hypocritical to after a year and a half back again , ” said the Paclík clear .
Pelta promised new statutes of the FAČR , the stalemate in future ausschlössen .
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association promised one of the candidates for the Vorsitzendenamt Miroslav Pelta , namely that he would do in the event of his election campaign for the new statutes FAČR gets in the future disputes over the electoral law , rule out .
The official from Jablonec is before the Donnerstagsverhandlung in Nymburk confident and believes that the campaign would be in the event of success of the Czech selection sure .
Pelta had not carried out before the election in September promised that he wants to do in the event of his election to the national team and the collection of funds .
He decided at the last moment , in the election before the last general meeting to participate in the two - month pause it might help to put his ideas on the leadership of the football to defend and in a wider context .
“ People at all levels are devoted to football , they are impatient and therefore expect the president on Thursday is known . ”
“ He feels that it is high time that the Association of someone who is headed , says the man who , in particular , with the club Jablonecer is linked , but also many years in Sparta , and in the executive committee .
Also , he has said that it has sufficient experience , the Czech football .
He is convinced that for today 's problems with the election of the euphoria is responsible , in the days of Ivan Hašek .
“ Unfortunately , in the shareholders ' meeting in June approved statutes , which do not fully , as it had all assumed .
If they are not allowed to different interpretations , we should have , as of September , already had a chairman , ” Pelta said .
The review of the most important document of the residents ' association he used as a sweetener to the delegates .
“ I should be president , then I will accept the me personally and I am personally prepared to take responsibility if it does not work . ”
“ It is a matter of principle , without which it can be , ” Pelta said .
In addition , he did not try to stand up to his opponent .
Earlier , he had announced that he can work with Jindřich Rajchl imagine , because of his legal education recognises and he knows well that his opponent in his first deputy .
He also Tomáš Paclík , it has been for a long time , which , in turn , no dry thread to Pelta .
In football , he is more than a year and can already in some successes . ”
“ His attacks were herabsetzend , however , and many people were shocked by his election campaign . ”
“ Also doubt now many of his true nature , ” Pelta addressed his opponent , the most faithful to his proclamations remain , for which it has in September .
In his view , the most powerful weapon is his knowledge of football of the lowest divisions , to the national team .
And this should be the hallmark of Czech football .
“ I would try to do all Affairen to end - of fog Bohemians , up to the Nachhallen the Korruptionsskandals last year . ”
“ Afterwards I on negotiations with the private and public sector to sufficient funding for the whole of football ” , said the candidate sechsundvierzigjährige ČTK two months ago .
At the time , he promised that his arrival at the tip of the Czech football no human cleansing would mean .
“ I would have to start with the monitor all workers get to know , ” he said in the direction of Strahov , where due to the length of the anarchy understandably nervous .
Despite the dezeitigen katastrophischen scenarios , which the General Assembly , he believes that the delegates on Thursday after Nymburk not in vain .
“ If there is really the only point of contention is how , in the third round , then we will get over that . ”
“ The football needs credibility and that wins it will only back when he finally has a new Leader ” Pelta , two days before the potentially decisive day Funktionärskarriere optimistic .
Rajchl promises that the FAČR below him hard work begins
If the former vice - chairman of Jindřich Rajchl at the General Assembly on Thursday as the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic should be elected , it would supposedly many people in the Association of the whim of vermiesen .
Rajchl promises that in the case of his choice to work hard to begin .
He wants to introduce system changes and the members of the executive committee for individual Fußballbereiche .
He also promised to resolve the case of Bohemians , relations with UEFA and FIFA to improve , more money in football and otherwise , to continue the work of the previous chairman , Ivan Hašek has begun .
“ As Chairman , I would like to football as a whole . ”
From the international contacts with UEFA and FIFA , on the Nationalauswahl , professional football , up to and including the Leistungsfußball for young people . ”
“ This is not to say that I want to do it all , ” said Rajchl in talks for ČTK .
“ I am a Teamspieler , and therefore the powers of the executive committee , so that every member of a certain area . ”
And I will work hard so that the football in each segment at moving forward . ”
There were many enchanted , because they , rather than the work of other to criticise now itself really began to work hard , ” he added .
Because of the critical atmosphere in the Fußballbewegung have considered , no longer standing .
“ I know that I am working 20 hours a day . ”
“ But I must know that it makes sense and that people stand behind me , I did not constantly put spokes and every step I make , in question , ” he said as an explanation as to why he hesitated .
“ A lot of people told me that I should not give up , because otherwise there other . ”
“ The trust is that we should not waste , ” he said .
Allegedly motivated him to continue the work , which he suffered Hašek has begun .
“ In two years we have a great deal of work done and I will now not simply throw away . ”
“ It processes have been launched , the only in a few years to play out , and I would hate to see that they stop someone , ” he said , and now his concerns to saying that , in the event that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta elected , the situation in the days before Hašek could return .
“ I believe in systematic approach and that is something that Mirek Pelta not . ”
“ Behind him , especially people who made the football would make that he only for exclusivity is there . ”
I may be some of the accused , but not that I would be biased . ”
“ I am trying to do , to be objective . ”
“ I want football for all of them , because it then all is well and not only the specially selected , ” said Rajchl .
He also rejects the claim that it was only a chairman of the Czechs .
“ Even if some people claim the opposite , I really did , what is best for Moravia to do . ”
“ For example , it is time to consider whether the League is in a czech and part of a moravian should divide , whose winners will each in the first League aufstiegen . ”
“ Then it might not happen that today only three Moravian clubs in the league play , particularly for the young players in Moravia is a problem , ” said Rajchl .
Because it is now up to the head of the Pilsner clubs Tomáš Paclík the fight for the office of the chairman , has joined dares Rajchl not to assess his chances that he is elected .
“ I feel a strong support in the chamber , the Czech me on her vice - chairman has chosen and now recognises that clear success stand behind me , ” led Rajchl with saving tens of millions of kronor disadvantageous for contracts , the agreement of Fernsehverträgen and the negotiations on the Lotteriegesetz as his success .
On the other hand , it is partly blamed for the fact that the Association of not in a single comes together .
Whilst Pelta says , “ he was disqualified from the outset , the czech football with greater confidence ” , he thinks of the second - Paclík rivals for a strong candidate , the football really have something to offer .
“ No one can question in Pilsen in just a year ago , has done an excellent job . ”
“ He should be elected , he would probably things continue Ivan Hašek has initiated and also the personnel in the commissions it would obviously not fundamentally change . ”
It would make things certainly not in his favour altered just want , ” judging from Rajchl on its rival .

The worst female vices : what 's with you ?
If the men calling on some typical female vices , then shake it would invariably some paint from the sleeves .
Women , you would see in the following lines , in which a few Unsitten review , which the men the blood wallen ?
Einkaufssucht
Raises them their s husband , einkaufssüchtig ?
You have to be at least one reunite on a weekly basis ?
Do you like to shop and in operations there must also be a bit more ?
Then it is in your case is really a weakness .
Some women are at least aware and try their Einkaufslust reasonably under control .
But hand on heart , which Ms believes it has already , in search of a well - seated Oberbekleidung only through a Kleidergeschäft to bummeln and not all ( in all kinds of Farbkombinationen ) in the booth to try ?
Even if the shopping for the majority of women is a hobby , for men , it is often the pure hell .
Consider it just as often , her husband said , it is better you out there …
Constant discontent
“ I am not getting too fat ? ”
“ I should at least five kilos of decline , should I start to go jogging or Gymnastik ? ”
“ I Gefalle you ? ”
They sounds familiar ?
Yes ?
That will take you to the women , the obsession of them are , how they look .
That is by no means that you will be allowed , but many men respond allergic to when their Mrs constantly about their appearance upset .
The stronger sex is agreed , with increasing frequency of the complaints are the women are unverträglicher .
Order and cleanliness in first place
It is a tilting at windmills .
The spills Fliesen windows , and dust , the Wanne scheuern - and it at least twice a week .
Berate you with their partner , because he once again with dirty shoes on the clean Fliesen trample , chastising the children , because it just gescheuerte Waschbecken dreckig once again , and because the Glastür on Wohnzimmerschrank again fingerprints , which the whitening so much trouble ?
Should you under this kind of “ Devianz ” , then you should know that there is no exaggeration , and the order and cleanliness in family life not in the first place .
This excessive Reinheitsfimmel can at the end of the day , the mutual relations and , above all , the peace in the family .
Sticheln
“ Dirty Turnhosen come in the Wäschekorb . ”
“ You want the old socks really tomorrow again attract ? ”
“ A watery throwing is not simply on the floor . ”
If her partner such a tirade is exposed , you may not be surprised to see him at the Palme .
Clearly , this is not bad , but they want to do just that everything is in order .
If the men know this , then took the women may not be as much to meckern .
Gossip
Some women like to clap and tratschen , as is behind the backs of getuschelt or even be vilified or forging alliances .
Women are now focused on relations , therefore , they would like to such issues by , for example , who , where , with whom , how and why .
I think any of us has a harmless bit of gossip to camp .
Believe me , this is all women .
But that is not to be confused with the major Klatschtanten calibre , which nobody and nothing is sacred , who are all in their area and contempt for the particularly Frauenkollektive represent a significant danger .

What represents the fraud at Krankmeldungen ?
After the family benefits take ( UMP ) and the government now Krankmeldungen in attack .
Nicolas Sarkozy on Tuesday , November 15 in Bordeaux , arrive for a visit Familienbeihilfekasse and made a speech on the already - since 2007 has always recurring theme of the fight against social fraud , as well as economic dependence on the state .
This attack to accompany the of the will , the economy in a Härteprobe , on the other hand , not just as a harbinger of the axis of the right - wing presidential campaign , will the majority on Arbeitnehmerkrankmeldungen focus .
First , with haushaltswirtschaftlichem objectives : the government seeking the introduction of a fourth Karenztages before taking into account a Krankmeldung by workers in the private sector .
In plain English , this means that a sick workers without approval of the specific company the pay of four days , would lose , so at least 15 % of its monthly income .
A Maβnahme which , according to the newspaper , “ Les echoes ” threatens to provoke anger , however , would help , 280 million euros .
And with a different Maβnahme more symbolic nature : the state officials were accompanied by a unvergüteten Karenztag in Krankheitsfalle give ( so far they have , in the Gegensatze to the three Karenztagen in the private sector , no Karenzfrist ) .
Meanwhile , these questions in the debate , sparked the majority also anew the Betrugsthematik , this time at the Arbeitsabsenz associated with abuse are targeted .
“ Inspections will be much more important , and furthermore , these rückzuvergüten , if this is called for , ” Xavier Betrand warned on Sunday , November 13 before the microphone to the station RTL .
As in other cases , the effects of this news about the reality of fraudulent activities in the areas of Krankmeldungen a little unproportioniert .
This is , in fact , already since 2002 , the subject of permanent observation and political offensive , the most common have borne fruit .
The French are not more ill more often than those elsewhere in Europe .
However , our first in the nation - wide paragraphs .
According to the Landeskrankenkasse CNAM were in 2006 , more than EUR 237 million Tagesabfindungen paid off .
The Gemäβ Wirtschaftsforschungs Dokumentationsinstituts - and the health system , the Tagesabfindungen in 2008 with 11.3 billion euro 5 % of the health - care costs .
Under this amount fell 46 % on maternity leave , as well as industrial accidents and 54 % on Krankheitsurlaube , the heiβt 6.2 billion euros .
And so , 2.5 % of health spending .
In the year 2010 , the French to the 17.8 days in 2009 , according to a study of Alma Consulting group , on average , only 14.5 Krankentage granted .
An average of certain differences covered up , a different , in 2007 of monster . com , a website for career planning , was published , showed that 75 % of the 40 000. surveyed , french workers , not a single Krankentag had .
Another , this time from the health insurance covered study makes it clear that 37 % of the Krankmeldungen in 2010 of shorter duration than 8 days ; 22 % were between 8 and 14 days , between 15 % and 15 days a month ago , 15 % of between one and three months and 11 % over .
Compared with its european neighbours , the french workers is not more than elsewhere to disability benefits .
A in 2010 by two researchers of the french state , Centre for Wissenschaftsforschung ( CNRS ) - led long - term study showed that between 1994 and 2001 global Absenzquote ( away - or otherwise justified ) oszillierte , in France , between 10 % and 11 % to 20 % and 28 % in Denmark , 15 % in the United Kingdom or 16 % and 18 % in the Netherlands .
The fraud at Krankmeldungen is a very small proportion on the black market .
On the fraud is only a weak Ausmaβ achieved .
The encouraging the legislation since 2002 , means that it controls on systmatische Krankmeldungen are 45 days .
In 2008 , the CNAM ( public college education and training of technicians and engineers ) below 1.5 million checks that 13 % of 000 of past , short - term Krankmeldungen , the heiβt in 37.050 cases ” , abusive or too long . ”
In the systematically controlled Krankmeldungsfällen of more than 45 days the long term if you were among 1.2 million 11 % of “ unangepassten or unjustified ” cases , heiβt 132.000 .
Overall , this is 169.000 “ unjustified ” cases to millions of workers , a Krankmeldung .
A paragraph , the only a weak Ausmaβ against , for example , that of the undeclared work represents .
According to the UMP members Dominique Tian , author of one published in July Sachberichts with regard to this issue , this is between 9 and 15 billion euro Steuergewinnausfall per year , i. e. more than the total cost of Tagesvergütungen , and thus far more than the Defraudation that .

Mission ended , Congress ready to agree on Libya
At the end of the day , it looks as if Republicans and Democrats in Washington , already on the uprisings in Libya to communicate .
All that was needed was the success of the revolt , the arrest and murder of the long - time dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the end of the american interference .
On Thursday , the Committee for international relations of the Senate a resolution , which the chairman John Kerry ( Massachussetts ) , along with Senator John McCain ( Arizona ) and Joseph I. Lieberman ( Connecticut ) , and Libya is for the successful rebellion and the US troops for their “ courage ” praises .
“ This resolution is a tribute to the brave people of Libya , with the reconstruction of the country have begun , ” said Kerry .
“ This is a confirmation of the support of their democratic efforts by two parties . ”
The language may sound was innocent , but so far nothing easy in the Libya debate .
This summer arguing legislators of both parties and the White House on the wording of a series of resolutions for approval or disapproval of the role of the US military in the Libya - the NATO mission .
In June , Kerry and McCain a resolution , which the limited use of military force by the United States in Libya approved .
The law has been in the Senate by a wide fringe of both parties rejected and there was no vote .
But on the same day , this law in the Senate and the House by overruling a decision to cut money for american operations in Libya .
As a result , the US mission in a kind of purgatory legislative - with a Congress that found enough , Obama 's approach in the context of the mission to criticize , but not angry enough to him once the rug from under their feet .
Then the indecision of Congress overtaken by events .
Tripoli fell in August , among the libyan rebels and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October .
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October .
Now the Senate may be willing to take action .
The resolution of the Committee for international relations “ congratulates the people of Libya to their enormous courage and perseverance of the extraordinary in its self - liberation ” and “ commends the men and women of the US military and its coalition partner , the military operations to protect the people of Libya support for their exceptional courage and professionalism . ”
The resolution also “ reaffirmed the national interests of the United States to a successful and irreversible transition of Libya to democracy . ”
Will the new measures the full support of the board to foreign relations received or are they the legislators divide the law in June , has done ?
The latest version to the opposing the Senator Richard G. Lugar ( Indianapolis ) , the leaders of the Republican Committee .
Lugars spokesman said on Monday that it has the final version of the new law have not seen .
According to Capitol Hill , the onus is on the Senate , this week on a constitutional change that a balanced budget that calls for a top priority in almost every Kongresslegislaturperiode of Republicans and some Democrats .
The measures under the leadership of the Republican Bob Goodlatte ( Virginia ) will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or any other area to be time to vote in the Senate or the Congress .
Other legislators have so far failed to do so , the changes are being put to the vote , even though they are often enough tried .
Goodlattes change is only one of 68 constitutional changes , which were presented this Congress and a whole range of subjects .
Some are twice - the same law was both the Congress and the Senate before other soft only slightly .
There are alone in the Senate at least 15 versions of the Ausgleichshaushaltsänderung and another dozen , the “ federal control ” .
Some of the laws are also identical , but they give their customers , especially rookie with the Republicans , who want to burnish their CV - the opportunity to boast about that any such action “ written ” .
The Haushaltskontrollgesetz , which in August was adopted , that requires both Senate and Congress on a revision of the Haushaltsausgleichs vote .
In March , 58 senators for a non - binding resolution that favour the idea of such a change .
On the budget , to some members of the number of the rules , the members of Congress can come up with that limit , while the Republicans José E. Serrano ( New York ) the limit of two terms in office , the president wants to tear up .
The Republicans Jesse L. Jackson ( Illinois ) has proposed a number of changes , including the right to a good education and health care .
An amendment , a marriage under Gleichgeschlechtlichen bans , as well as an alteration to the burning of flags from a recurring presentation .
Some legislators also want the removal of federal laws when two thirds of the states vote against it .
So keen , as the members suggest changes , so poorly they move more quickly , as in previous years .
In the 111th Congress , legislators 77 such changes in 110 . Congress 66 .
The pace of pales in comparison with that of the early 1990s , in which members regularly more than 150 proposed changes every two years , so the figures that the Senatsbibliothek available .
But they were also not much more successful than today 's .
The last change that needs to be added to the 27 - , was ratified in 1992 , but was in fact already in 1789 , the Congress proposed .

The menu of a fettsüchtigen child : it not to eat for dinner and breakfast sausage
More than a third of the children of 9 to 13 have problems with obesity , with 9 % of all pupils and 5 % of all children are overweight .
Recent opinion polls - obese children come mostly from families with ungesundem lifestyle .
So once again , how important it is for the development of a healthy people the milieu in which it grows up and the examples that surrounded him .
On the tables adipöser children sausages up to half of more often on the table than in families in which normalgewichtige children live .
More than 19 percent of overweight children , on the eve of the Aufklärungsaktion under the slogan “ obesity is not a coincidence ” for chips for dinner .
In families with Dickerchen include sport is not just to the Lieblingsbeschäftigungen , but also the majority of today 's students , only 15 percent said that their parents are at least once a week on time for active movement .
Survey of 900 children
The survey found last year against the end of the academic year , were almost 900 children from schools across the Czech Republic .
This was the second year the action “ obesity is not a coincidence , ” by the general insurance company and the society Unilever is supported .
To date , the project more than 12 thousand students from 4 and 8. classes .
Unhealthy diet and lack of movement in the family are key factors for the alarming increase in the number of children with obesity or even obesity are responsible .
“ Only the half of children , for example , five times a day , in the mode of breakfast - second breakfast , lunch - Vesper - to eat for dinner , one of the main elements of a healthy diet , ” is one of the survey results .
No breakfast and the sausages for dinner
Experts point out that relative small things , such as the regular Frühstückszeit the family , important for the healthy development of a child .
In the Czech Republic frühstücken but only 23 percent of the families of the students .
And , in most families breakfast alone .
The worst was the fact that in every tenth family is not eating any breakfast .
Breakfast is the foundation stone of the day - to - day healthy diet .
The Umfragetest brought to , among other things , the day that the families of overweight children more frequently to unhealthy chips consumed .
And nearly everyone , with no regard to weight - drink every day sweetened soft drinks ( 70 % )
While driving more than 40 per cent of children sport , but fewer than half of their parents are doing this - just 15 percent .
Just think your own menu together
Another part of the poll , made it possible for selected children ( 204 boys and girls from 172 13 schools ) , from opportunities offered after appetites and believe their own menu together .
“ What czech children between 12 and 15 in terms of nutrition , is a long way from the ideal of a healthy diet .
Among their favourite foods were many Mehlspeisen Fleischgerichte , and , of course , Süßspeisen .
“ Alarmierend is above all the great popularity of sweet fizzy drinks ” , will be in the final report on the survey highlights .
At lunch , the main course , triumphed pasta just before poultry .
Pulses , liked the children almost not at all and the popularity of fish and Gemüsegerichten as lunch was very low .
Hinkehr on health
At the same time , the survey showed , however , that the children are willing to change their eating habits , if it is right for information .
“ In the control group of the Umfragebeteiligten , the questionnaire following the conclusion of the aufklärenden lecture “ obesity is not a coincidence , ” filling out was , in many cases , a significant shift preferences to principles of healthy eating there , ” is in the results of the project .
For example , this was evident in the sweet Limos , where many children began to ordinary water to give priority .
The children crossed in the questionnaire , more often chicken or fish as a main course of the day and were prepared to less dumpling or sweet food to eat .

Development of higher fares since 1989 .
In 1989 , there have been only five in the then ČSSR approved state travel agents : Čedok , Sporturist , CKM , Rekrea and Autoturist .
The travel agents sold at the time , above all , only travel in the socialist eastern bloc countries , in the West , at that time only on the select few .
And so went czech tourists in the Baltic Sea ( in the German Democratic Republic - the German Democratic Republic ( GDR ) ) , in the Soviet Union ( Sochi on the Korean Peninsula , Crimea , on the Black Sea ) , Bulgaria and Romania , the Black Sea and Hungary to use it .
An exception was the light of the period from 1962 to 1972 , when we travel to Yugoslavia , then Yugoslavia a pro - western course and that is why the trips to Yugoslavia severely restricted .
A great paradox of the socialist times it was that it is not even citizens of the soviet bloc ( including the Tschechoslowaken ) was , in the context of the socialist countries to travel freely .
If a citizen of the ČSSR individually to Poland , for example , or even in the Soviet Union to , then took a so - called Einladungsbrief , otherwise Individualreisen were not possible .
Even then , the travel agents also travel to the West , but then had to be huge queues at , or even in the hot - water bottle in the travel agency sleep , or at least good “ well - known ” in the travel agency .
Even so , the issue has not gone .
The so - called Devisenzusage - the condition for an exit in the west , has only been “ politically reliable ” people granted to the other could not travel .
The czech currency was not free umtauschbare currency without Devisenzusage , it would be impossible to have the necessary financial resources ( western ) currency for a trip to the West finding .
The Czechs weither therefore spent most of their holidays at home , it 's no surprise that the Czechs and countless Wochenendhäuser dachas bought - a habit still continues .
The Velvet Revolution of 1989 , followed by a Reiserevolution the Czechs in the foot .
Until 1989 during a holiday in the GDR or in Bulgaria , the measure of all things were spent the Czechs in the last year of their Auslandsferien 4.5 million in countries around the world .
A huge paradox , of which one is now no longer is aware , is the fact that you are currently in the most popular holiday destination enjoys the Czechs - Croatia to 1989 , is not being able to go , because it is part of the former Yugoslavia .
From the beginning of the 1990s , the last century to the Devisenpflicht in neighbouring countries of Western Europe , which is a huge wave of Kurzbesuchen above all to Vienna in Austria and Germany .
The Tschechoslowaken able for a long time , of their movements in the West simply can not get enough of , everyone wanted to at least a few days there have been .
So slept the czech tourists in travel to Paris in the tent city in the park , because who would have the money to stay in one of the hotel or in a pension .
A typical feature on foreign travel by the Czechs then was a with tins , beer and Dauerwurst etc . vollgepackter boot .
Another important milestone was the introduction of the Czech - free umtauschbaren crown after decades could be our tourists the western currency finally free to buy .
Our standard of living and thereby also Durchschnittsgehälter rose , in 1997 in another important moment einmündete .
Thanks to the increased demand for travel began the travel agents after 1997 regularly travels through the charter flights to prepare the air travel , thanks to the possibility of Mengenrabatte negotiate , than in the past , incredibly cheap .
At the end of the 1990s , the Czechs , with the exception of the United States , already devisenlosen payments on all of the advanced countries in the world , as the travel even easier .
Another interesting moment in the history of the “ post - velvet ” travel has occurred in 2000 , when thanks to high demand the first direct charter flight in an exotic country handles - to Thailand .
Every year since then fly direct charter aircraft with czech passengers in distant sunny countries ; this year it flies directly from the Czech Republic twelve exotic destinations .
Of the 100 Tsd . Czechs travel each year in exotic countries .
Another important moment in the era of the “ post - revolutionary ” development marked , came in 2008 .
On 17 November 2008 , the US visa requirements for czech tourists on , which is the country most definitely in the advanced countries in the world have brutalized .
In 2008 , spent the Czechs , for the first time more than half their holidays abroad ( 50.3 % ) , and for the first time in its history , they spent for a single Urlaubsaufenthalt destinations , including the cost at more than 15 Tsd CZK per capita .

Airline Emirates ordered two - track 50 Boeing 777 aircraft , with an option for a further 20 aircraft .
Boeing also sold six Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air , a business worth more than $ 1 trillion .
It is a rare news that a company a contract 50 on some of its products .
But it is a big business , if the company the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the Listenpreis for these 50 aircraft overall in a Rekordsumme of 18 trillion dollars .
Equally unusual is the parent of Boeing : the Middle East , a growing gold mine of future Flugzeugbestellungen .
In a prediction that was published on Monday , the Chicago company that airlines from the Middle East over the next 20 years 2.520 aircraft in the value of 450 trillion dollar needs .

The Listenpreis for six of these aircraft is running at more than $ 1 trillion .
“ This is absolutely positive for Boeing , ” said seeking Dihora , Börsenfachmann of Morningstar .
“ The quality of this particular customers is very high . ”
Many airlines of the Middle East are in possession of the oil - producing countries .
So they have not only the money to pay for the aircraft , but a rise in oil prices , which normally airlines damages , as this is one of their biggest cost items , is not harmful , because the country is on a higher oil price .
This is important , because it will be less than other airlines tend to Flugzeugbestellungen to cancel or postpone , when oil prices rise , said Dihora .
“ You have a natural hedge ” , he said .
The order from Emirates confirmed Boeing 's leading position in the market for large and helps the Airbus SAS competitors at bay , the supremacy of the A350 .
Boeing 's victory on the Luftfahrtschau comes four months after Airbus announced that it would delay the introduction of the largest A350 , which directly competes with the 777 - 300er .
It postponed the introduction of more confidence after the customers and reach a higher Nutzlast had asked for .
The Boeing - shares rose 1.5 % to $ 67,94 .

That was the work of the doctor , the body of Alfonso Cano identified
A Lophoskopist from Cali , as the man who “ Alfonso Cano ” identified in history .
The work of these officials is playing a key role .
On November 4 , a Lophoskopist the fraud investigation unit , the Public Prosecutor 's Office ( CTI ) from Cali as the man who the identity of the head of the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de FARC ( Colombia - Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ) confirmed : “ Alfonso Cano ” by comparing fingerprints .
Of the seven Lophoskopisten in the department of CTI , had this week Eliazar González on call , a man from the Puerto Tejada for 21 years in criminal investigations cooperate .
At the beginning of his career , González was working in communities of Chocó , where he often spent five days in the jungle had to go , the place to achieve , in which the bodies that were he to identify .
2000 siedelte after Valle on and after the completion of the necessary specialized courses he Lophoskopie , that is the study of the skin , the friction is exposed , i. e. the hand and Fußflächen .
In the week of the action against the so - called Alfonso Cano was Eliazar pointed out , clothing for at least three days only .
Nothing much - awaited him .
Friday night , it flew the helicopters after Palmira of Cauca .
He knew that he should identify two bodies , and that was the suspicion that one of the men , the oldest of the guerrillas of the world saw , could be why it should Zehnfinger - Abdruckblatt of Guillermo León Sáenz ( his real name ) .
He , however , with the Untersuchungste the place , in which the body found him , he could not identify because of his physical appearance , because this resembled the pictures , which he had seen in the media , not in the slightest .
He did not have a beard , was like a farmer dressed , the area was no glasses and was much thinner .
But fingerprints don 't lie .
Armed with a magnifying glass , ink , a Pflanzkelle and a Taschenlampe Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the body with the Abdruckblatt .
He was right : it was “ Alfonso Cano . ”
The same night , this from Puerto Tejada , the man in charge of defence minister , Juan Carlos Pinzón , say that there is , in fact , the head of the FARC .
On Spurensuche
For a Daktyloskopen by Sijín in Cali , the tribute that the President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González at a press conference about the use of “ Cano ” against that very important .
Many people are aware of our work is not .
The Daktyloskopie is an exact science without error rate , which is a key factor in the break - up of a crime can be .
Lophoskopisten identify not only corpses , they also support in murder investigations and Raubsachen and confirm the identity of those arrested .
When they were arrested , many criminals false papers before or they do not .
We are taking the fingerprints and looking for this in the database .
The researchers told us that , when it comes to a theft of a piece of wall from a house down , as the thief had just at this point with his hand aufgestützt , one with jewellery and money fully gestopften Safe herauszog .
“ The walls are difficult , because its surface for fingerprinting are inadequate , but in this case , we were able to carry the imprint of the rest , and the criminals who participated in a number of thefts , identify , ” he reminded himself .
With the help of the fingerprints can also Mordverdächtige or discharged .
Recently , a death surrounded by Schnapsflaschen found .
The investigation was suspected that a family member tatverdächtig could be , and actually voted a fingerprint on the bottle .
Although this is not guaranteed that it is the murderer , so it is with the place where the crime was committed , in context .
A Daktyloskopist the CTI declared that , “ the fingerprints of chemical and physical Reagenzen taken by the object . ”
If it appears , is a Pflanzkelle or a bond for carrying used .
Then the prints to Asif sent , that is the Verbrecherdatenbank , or to Personenstandamt .
“ The problem is that there are still many Colombians are undocumented , ” declared the expert of CTI .
He said that not everything is so , as in the tv series SCI them out to be .
As gold is not all that glitters is also not everything that touches , a fingerprint .
But it can be used , if you have a relevant comparison .

21er House in Vienna
The pavilion umgezogene
By Mrs Wiensowski
A Architekturgeschichte highs , lows and happy endings — the austrian Weltausstellungspavillon of Brussels in 1958 , was won by prices in Vienna for the museum , was empty and verkam .
It is now as Ausstellungshaus re - opened .
If of modern post geschwärmt will clear forms , glass halls , courageous swings and new building materials , the typical of the belief in the technological progress , then the austrian pavilion of the architects of Karl Schwanzer for Brussels ' World Expo in 1958 and famous is a good example .
Schwanzers pavilion at the time was the Grand Prix d 'Architecture for his easy and float - looking - glass - steel construction .
The building has , to date as a milestone in contemporary architecture .
He made the architects so well known that the and at the next World Expo austrian pavilion built .
With his legendary BMW Vierzylinderhaus plus schüsselartigem Nebenbau in Munich , he was in 1973 , after all , internationally renowned .
His Ausstellungsbau planned as a temporary pavilion had been following the exhibition in the swiss garden at the Vienna Südbahnhof established in 1962 , and converted to a museum of the 20th century - opened the 1920s “ House ” it was called .
Lift the building but not physically and technically as a museum - no walls on the slopes of the art , not a good climate .
It was , however , so long used by the contemporary art in Vienna , a new house .
Since 2001 , the building was empty and more and more .
Now , the architect Adolf Krischanitz the pavilion rebuilt , he is now “ 21er House ” and will , in the future , as a museum of contemporary art .
On Tuesday night the Belvedere museum , which the House , where the first exhibition , a stroke of luck in every respect .
Won the restart Agnes Husslein - Arco , 2007 , the new director of the austrian gallery Belvedere .
Husslein - Arco , qualified art historian , with considerable career including the young people as Eiskunstläufererin , later at Sotheby 's , the Guggenheim Museum and the Museum of the modern era than Gründungsdirektorin Salzburg , converting to politicians and Denkmalschützern by , they provided public funds and private Sponsorengelder and established the use .
Except Gegenwartskunst should the works of the Bildhauers Fritz Wotruba of the eponymous Foundation issued a café and a bookshop , and it should be a Bürohaus had to be built .
Strict supervision , small budget
For the operation was then Krischanitz the ideal person to work .
Not only because it Joseph Olbrichs in Vienna Secession sensitive converted and extended and won the competition , but also because he is in Schwanzer in the technical Vienna University and has studied the pavilion for him a “ incredibly important ” was the ground when he felt “ almost every weekend , ” the exhibitions considered .
He knew the Ur - draft , and he was very familiar with the problems of the building , which at its transfer to Vienna and its Umnutzung of generosity and easily lost .
At this restructuring , there was far greater problems : the building was “ a Energieschleuder , ” says Krischanitz .
The Fensterprofile the outside glass of have changed , glasfaserverstärktes Isolierglas set up and the Glasdach by special security glass .
Kältebrücken - damaged are more or been replaced , and asbestgefüllte blankets have been refurbished .
Two Untergeschosse made room for the new use , a abgesenkter Lichtgraben between House and road will ensure the Belichtung , a bridge leading to the entrance - almost a new building , but still the easy Schwanzer - pavilion .
The original Außentüren have remained , the House is in the old rotbraunen Rostschutz - Farbton removed .
And the theatre is even more closely as it used to be .
All under strict supervision of Denkmalbehörde and with a small budget .
“ Often had a material are found , it is good and proper , and also the Denkmalschutzamt liked , ” says Krischanitz and points to a raw ground in Untergeschoss .
Despite all the pressures , problems and improvements to the building is flexible and easy .
It is difficult , with the pavilion , “ the came from Brussels , ” Krischanitz recently said that a typical “ rates - in - the - City - history . ”
So a architecture is “ always in the wrong place ” and wanted to give a proper still “ awareness ” .
In this case , the 21er House but not in the wrong place , because it is a stroke of urban happened : the swiss garden is emerging around the entirely new planned “ Hauptbahnhofsquartier ” , with office and residential buildings .
And another stroke of luck may be happen : the 21er House could increase by another Krischanitz - construction , because the Sammlerin Francesca von Habsburg , the Berlin temporary Kunsthalle bought , and we hear , they have negotiated with the city for a neighbourly location within the swiss garden .

EU Ambassador Vicenová :
The Czechs have the reputation of Negativisten eurosceptics and
“ The Lisbon Treaty , the balance between the various institutions felt from the order . ”
I would not have expected that such a hard war flares . ”
“ There will be five to six years , until the dust settles and all with their new role have become used to be , ” began girl Milena Vicenová , the czech ambassador to the European Union , quite strongly their lecture at the law school .
How seriously it the motto “ understandable and openly about Europe ” , it has shown in the first part of their lecture , in which it was able to the various EU institutions and their mutual relations in such a clear and understandable way to describe that some of his editor , the faculty of the Karlsuniversität therefore have envy .
Mrs Vicenová also praised the new permanent Chairman of the Council of Europe , Herman Van Rompuy .
“ Initially , according to criticism that it is too quietly - a grey official who is such a role not up , but I have to say that it has all the short , how well it is the issue .
“ He is a person of the 27 member states , it will listen patiently , communicate with and the particularly clear idea of , as it is with the EU is to continue .
The new position of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy said the answer to the question : who is the really - the European Union ? what number should I call ? ” , in other words , as an important step to agreement and better visibility of the EU 's policy towards states , such as China and India .
No one wants to our Ölmützer Quargel ban
Mrs Vicenová dedicating the agenda , in accordance with the European Union , and lives in the near future to live .
The czech presidency of two years ago , describing it as a success .
The Czechs had the financial crisis and the faltering and gas crisis summits for the Eastern Partnership .
The fall of the government during the presidency describing it as a great Negativum , the image of the Czech Republic much damage .
The czech representation in the EU currently has its hands full .
In the words of the ambassador said , it was not just the presidency , but also in the subsequent crisis , which has still not been overcome , quite hectic .
And there is still the seven - year EU budget is approved , but the matter because of today 's economic situation is much more complicated .
Whether or not it is a slim and Thrifty budget , which industries take precedence , which countries more or less will all of that is now on the agenda .
The ambassador also recalls their own slogans , with which it came to Brussels : “ understandable on Europe ” .
“ If there is one thing I do not like , then it is gräuliche acronym , concepts and technical jargon , which no one understands .
How can I as citizens actually know whether Brussels really curly or round cucumbers and variable invented just bananas or whether we actually someone Quargel wants to ban .
It would have the soil of the EU also would like to be used more Czechs in european institutions .
The two - speed Europe or different prospect in
According to the EU Ambassador the Czechs have a reputation for eurosceptics , to be , the more the negative , the positive side of the matter .
Even more galling is the poor representation by the Czechs in european institutions .
There are many factors , including the restraint of our candidates , their inability to Motivierungsbriefe to write and , last but not least , the weak support the czech side .
In addition to the successful czech presidency , they also have the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group , called the V4 .
“ Do you think if a Pole or hungarian come to me and a Slovak in the vicinity , says the Frenchman next to me : “ Hey , what is it because the heads together - is the back your V4 ? ” and will not make a fairly acid straight face .
Mrs Vicenové according to expect the EU in future , especially hard rules for the budgetary policy of the member states .
As a much fairer , as a “ european ” is the idea of a Europe of the two , or even at different speeds .
“ We have the countries of the euro zone and the countries outside the eurozone .
“ We have the Schengen area and we already have the institute a bestärkten cooperation . ”
“ For the first time , it was said that the only countries to work together who want it and those who do not want to let stand aside . ”
“ There will be more and more of these institutions , which , in the end , on a strong “ a multi - speed Europe ” , ” Mrs Vicenová expected .
In this respect , it also paid tribute to the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in the enforcement of the principle , according to all the issues with the impact on the whole of the EU by all member states must be discussed and not just by the countries of the euro zone .

But making it easier to automatically the sadness and the confusion that an entire nation still feels ?

For more than 20 years , they have been expected , but the band , rest assured that , it is not a dream when they play in Costa Rica .
The assured the Bassist Mitgründer and the group , Jeff Ament , the Viva last week by Brazil in an exclusive interview .
The band is in the south american part of their tour to celebrate their 20 - year existence , and on Sunday , 20 , they make their only stop in Central America .
On this day , they are from 7.30 p. m. in the national stadium , together with the band the X in Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica .
You read an extract from the conversation , the full transcript in the online edition of La Nación .
For your costaricanischen fans made a dream if Pearl Jam in Costa Rica is : are you aware of what that means for your fans ?
In Costa Rica to play is a dream , which can also be implemented for us .
This is just the second time that we are in South and Central America , and so far it has been great .
I am only once on holiday in Costa Rica . it is such a beautiful country , that we have a few days will stay there .
For us , it is exciting , our music out there .
I ask you , because the fans of the band completely . you see the closest days before the concert .
What tells her your begeistertesten fans ?
Thank you , all these years on our side .
We have almost 21 years , until we needed to Costa Rica . thank you , waited so long to have and we are very sorry to have taken so long , until we got here .
Some people even believe that your concert the biggest show of the year .
Is it not a little bit of pressure from your visit ?
Some of the greatest shows that we have in the last 21 years off to have occurred in the last two weeks .
We have a few Riesenshows in Sao Paulo played and we hope that the us fit for this concert in Costa Rica .
Really , we have an appetite there to play .
We love this country , we like to surf and are from the jungle enthusiastic . in favour of Costa Rica to the best country in the world .
How did you Costa Rica and his surfing waves to come to know ?
Many of our friend , kayak and I have a great friend in Tamarindo , where the waves simply unimaginable .
My friends are always on the surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua . along with Mexico are excellent places to surfing . in this way , people who love the surfing , we have heard about it .
With a look at the tour 's Riesenshows with many songs .
What do you have plans for the event in Costa Rica ?
Because that is where we never have played , we also have no borders .
We are going to try to make the best show to give with many different songs , we want a few songs from each album and play our fans and a good variety of repertoire .
Her repeatedly never your repertoire .
Why ?
I think this is , in part , because we have nine records and more than 120 songs can play each other like . a song , so the decision as to which we will play , is not easy .
If we have two or three song , which we have not played the repertoire , we can maintain our focus better and they come as a surprise to us , because they remind us of the reasons why this song 's fallen , otherwise they could be forgotten .
That makes the show more interesting for us and I think , therefore , for the audience .
With this tour celebrating your twenty years of history .
If it looks back , you find it hard to believe in your success ?
Yes , Total .
First of all , I think that none of us has advocated once in a great rock band to play , and this for over 20 years , which looks like a dream .
We are also to this blessing and it is great to still be able to make music together .
We love and we are thrilled to music .
We are in luck , to the places in the world able to travel , which we have always wanted to visit again .
Things could not be better .
Which meant it for you , in the birth of Grunge participated actively ?
It is always a privilege to this group of large band .
We are good with the people of Soundgarden , Mudhoney and Alice in Chains friends .
It is surprising and unusual , if a movement from a group of friends .
Now and again , a band from a city , but it is unusual when five or ten groups at the same time from the same town .
We are proud and honoured to be part of the Seattle - group .
Sometimes we are still together .
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden on their tour . we look forward , still with all of them to be a friend of mine and it does us credit , part of this that have arisen Seattle - Sounds .
It is also very unusual for a band like your with the same musicians so long zusammengeblieben .
Yes , four of us play for 21 years together and Matt ( Cameron ) , 13 years ago to us , this alone is much more time than many band in time .
First of all , I think that we are all happy , still alive , and also let us care about each other .
We are all close friend , which is why the musical ways have opened up for all the freedom to experiment .
A familiar to the other and the music , it could not be better .
Your relationship with the glory has not always been easy . on the other hand , why didn 'thanks to your success always do what their wolltet .
It will take place as a balance ?
The way we are up to it has been made easier to find a balance .
We are safe , not too often on tour , because it is too easy to this game with huge numbers of people who love your music to decline .
As long as we keep in mind that the people because of the music , reminds you of the fact that you get the music and what it has set up must respect , without keen to be a famous rock star to be ; that has put us in any case never interested .
The memories you have in your other Mother Love Bone ?
I think we have a very good song written at the beginning and it was great .
We were three years a band , until the death of Andy ( Andrew Woods ) never had issued a record .
We were disappointed , took so long to have , and we are still well with Bruce ( Fairweather ) and Greg ( Gilmore TD ) with us the band built , a friend of mine when I hear a song or photographs see , I think of what an incredible man Andy was and how he me laugh . it was always a pleasure to work together to laugh and on music and football and many other topics to talk .
It was an extraordinary person and we miss him .
The domestic bond Las Robertas are for the opening of the show in Costa Rica .
It is true that their work is aware of , in particular , Eddie Vedder and the band for the opening of selected have ?
Yes , the production sent us videos by several groups and this band liked best and that is why we are curious to see what Las Robertas live can offer , which will certainly exciting .
Why change her the text of Yellow Ledbetter , if you live ?
That is a question for Ed ( Eddie Vedder ) , I have no idea .
He sings it , and I think he sings the first thing he can think of .
By whom you be as Bassist influenced ?
By so many +
Among the first that come to mind are Geezer Butler , John Entwistle , C. J. Ramone , John Doe , Paul McCartney , Chuck Dukowski …
There are so many that I all afternoon on the Bassisten , I like to talk .
How has it , Pearl Jam , which did Grunge to keep alive , even though it is not a fad ?
I think we all we do not feel very connected with the word “ Grunge .
When I think about it , the band fall to me , which I have mentioned before , for example , Mudhoney , Soundgarden , nirvana and all the other came up at the same time , if they still are important , I think that is great , because it is worthwhile to hear this music and band as Mudhoney now make music better than ever before .
First of all , it was their music blacker , now it is positive .
Why ?
This is interesting , because I think there are a couple of songs on the new album , which could prove a bit lightly , but there are also other songs as the end or just Breathe , as the song 's very dark , even though they also something positive .
Both were in tears when I heard how Ed it played : they are very dark song .
I believe that if you are older and a little Traumatisches in your life happens , for example , if you have a family member or a friend loses - influenced the your artistic creation and your music , and these two song embody the clear for me .
However , I also believe that it is a happy person and still dark music .

“ This is a step forward , we must , however , there is no doubt await clearer evidence before it from an operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem can speak . ”
“ However , it is conceivable . ”
“ We know for years that the sect of financial and intellectual support of Auβen , and that this is becoming increasingly active ” shows , moderates the nigerian Kunle Amuwo researchers .
In the last few months , that “ assistance ” in the course of ever more obvious , as is the speeches and the Operationsmodi of Boko Harem , now on the Hinzuziehen of suicide bombers , as well as the use of always complex explosives , the same mark as those who Aqmi have been used .

It would be too wide - ranging to claim that this was a covert agreement between them , but the symbolic image speaks volumes .

Five months after the spirited gesture of his Angriffsspielers against Turkey , the belgian soccer have nothing but praise on his person picked .

Hazard after Saint - Denis , brought on Friday against Romania on the Matchs against France , at last , “ to shine . ”

Europe has a democracy , so it remains , european democracy to rethink
Democracy is a valuable asset ; also a delicate asset .
The european continent itself should remind you who is after its invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago , the whole of the 20th century the tragedies of the First World War , of totalitarianism , of Holocaustes , the gulag , but also in Franco 's Spain , Salazars in Portugal and the colonels in Greece has had to endure .
Some were believed that it would be sufficient , the right to vote , to representative possible way to democracy once and for all of their enemies will prevail .
We know since Napoleon the “ small ” that it is a feature of the state of mind .
The general right to vote , the necessary condition of democracy , is not a sufficient condition and can just as well for the “ repression ” , as the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot said .
No , democracy requires much more : a public space , a public spirit , values , an organisation , separation of powers , and control a training , education , economic and social spirit , a jurisdiction .
The crisis in Europe , in which we find ourselves , is an economic crisis , but it is also very much and , first and foremost , political and democratic crisis .
The attitude of the greek Wahr - wrong - referendum would have been in this regard twice : once the insightful nature of the need for a strong return of the policy , on the other hand , but also those of the alarming sense of their inability to deliver their Unangebrachtheit .
This ambivalence should be seen as outdated .
Truth is that the front lines of the democratic fight today have shifted , and that the republican soldiers , or at least most of them , no longer moving in the right direction .
We have nothing to gain , to the success of the national referendum , which , depending on the needs and in or order was organised .
A Freischein for the european or a giant leap with their eyes in the hollowness of the nationalist withdrawal : a groβartige choice for the citizens .
No , we want Hackebeil , but a collective task , from right , clear and steadily , a choice and democracy , this time at the european level .
There are no crises in Greece , Italy , Spain and Portugal - you know , incidentally , has already no longer , where the list to end - as it is only a single crisis , and that there is in Europe .
It is the whole of Europe , the dictates of the markets and rating agencies prevents that under his impotence and his Solidaritätsmangel suffers .
It is the whole of Europe , which humiliated at international level .
It is concerned about Souveränitätstransfers towards Europe - it is the whole of Europe , which gradually loses its sovereignty , and every single one of the nations connected him .
The urgency is the sovereignty of the leadership of the european project back .
Because it is on the set , whether the Europeans the burden of debt reduction from the markets to a future through investment at hand .
The exit from the crisis has decisions at the european level on the condition that is not complete without democratic Rechtmäβigkeit can be passed without sure to destruction .
After this proposal by Jacques Delors and the Socialists for a long time to tackle , today , one in the european economic governance .
I agree .
But this without political integration and greater democracy , as they have in mind - present , would be a new folly and another dead end .
We need a new stage of european integration .
In the Republic of France to create , it took the fact that Republicans to “ create ” .
The revolution of the interests of alone , it is not enough .
This instruction is still valid .
On the economic front , we need a more integrated Europe .
This can only be achieved by a politically democratic Europe , creating a truly european sovereignty .
We need Europeans to Europe .

He stated that a ( e ) of Mexicans ( in ) on average to 65 % indianisch - american , european and 30 % to 5 % of african origin is in their genes with diabetes and obesity , reflected .
In general , he said , the genetics of obesity , the inability of the surplus to us , the prospect of Energy ( calories ) to burn , so that those in the form of fat stored .
The researchers said the direct benefit to put research participants would be a full investigation into the children , in the states , whether this a level of obesity or obesity .
It would even the existence of dark Hautfalten on their backs and on Innenarm Akanthosis ( ) , on the likelihood of Stoffwechselstörungen and diabetes at the preliminary stage , investigated .
All information would be kept confidential and the parents in writing from the doctors told the doctors say the parents all measurements and beat them lifestyle changes for the prevention of disease are appropriate .

Story : fire
The innovator IBM enters into its second century of existence
They wanted to find an appropriate word that the strategy of IBM most closely , then this is the word “ longevity . ”
For the general public , IBM is synonymous with the technological revolution , it is known as a modern businesses , although since its establishment in a century has passed .
On this basis the longevity , already their first chief visionary behind Thomas J. Watson Sen .
Already he was of the slogan , countless global problems could be solved easily , if people were prepared to make a little bit of thinking .
Its slogan “ think ! ” has been a hallmark of the life of the future giants place should ( and , at the same time , to the title of the internal magazine on IBM as long ago as 1935 began issuing ) .
This was also the basis of Watsen well prepared business culture .
“ For us from IBM , this long - term thinking a kontinuelle movement towards the future .
IBM survived and was also an entire century successful because it has remained true to his principles and not shying away from everything else all around it to change .
The allowed us , in the course of the first century , the technology , the business and society to transform .
We hope that in the next 100 years , creating even more , ” said Samuel J. Palmisano , who is now director of the company , marking the anniversary .
Educational system
Watson was already in the 1930s social care of its workforce , in a similar way , as the entrepreneurs Baťa in Czechoslovakia , the IBM - people had , as one of the first american workers paid holidays , an insurance by the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as Arbeitsbekleidung and a thoughtful set for best creators and distributors .
As more sophisticated , the long - term relationship of IBM with their customers .
The company was , from the beginning , the brilliant in the Talentförderung - as one of the first companies worldwide , IBM on any discrimination , and could be scheduled to pick and choose .
In line with this Antidiskriminierungsstrategie is also the current plan , the Palmisan at the head of IBM next year by a woman will invariably - of Virginia Rometty .
Is the only 30 years at IBM , has adopted the position of the Vetriebs , marketing and Strategiechefin .
IBM makes in the last few years , so - called online Brainstormings , from where many future strategies and innovations .
No wonder - ideas there is enough in the company is almost half a million people .
An institution with a good reputation
Its strong position in the business guaranteed the company a strong image and this inside and outside .
“ From the beginning , IBM had more of the concept of an institution , as a technology company , ” said the Economist professor of Harvard Business School and the author of a book about IBM , Rosabeth Moss Kanter .
“ IBM is not a technology company , but a firm Geschäftsprobleme through technology helps solve , ” added George Colony of - Consulting firm Forrester Research .
As the company has stressed , there is a difference in the market only to be present or it with this presence directly .
IBM in the states of their logos for family “ Big Blue ” is in a century to one of the largest companies in the world have grown .
It is one of the most diverse technology companies at all - IBM developed hardware and software , infrastructure , hosting and Konsultationsleistungen with incredible - purpose of servers to nanotechnology .
Of all american technology company IBM most patents and five of its staff members were awarded the Nobel Prize .
His best - known inventions include , for example , ATM machines , credit cards , Finanzswap bar code , or even the Diskette .
With around $ 20 billion stock market value ( by market capitalization ) IBM during this year , the second - largest technology companies ( right after Apple ) , and for the first time since 1996 Microsoft obsolete .
Looking ahead
Not all products and innovations , the taste of the customers of today - were unfortunate , for example , the attempt to their own operating system , OS / 2 , the online service Prodigy , or the computer IBM pc Jr .
“ Business is based on the moving forward , so we should not be emotionell to the past ” , according to Samuel J. Palmisano .
That is why IBM is not a problem , his ground on various platforms to build , and if they do not work , they also must leave .
In contrast to the rival Microsoft , which in principle with its Windows operating system stands or falls .
Promising technologies
In the profits of IBM committed to the greatest extent services , software and hardware to participate in each one - fifth .
It was still in 1990 with a hardware fünfzigprozentigem share more than most .
Since 2000 veräußerte IBM little profit abwerfende assets at a value of $ 15 billion , at the same time , however , it has invested $ 58 billion in the purchase of the future technologies .
In these investment goes IBM after 2008 , as the modern financial crisis for the first time as a storm on the world fegte .
IBM also was the legacy of his first boss Thomas J. Watson faithful , in the midst of the Great Depression of its large scale of investment .
So far , it appears that the company IBM today 's crisis emerges unscathed .
The value of the IBM shares rose since 2008 raketenartig by 120 percent and the profit of the company is growing kontinuell .
The Unternehmensslogan of IBM is : everything can change - not only the values .
It is to be expected that this flexible giant also the next crisis .
IBM history : from Käseschneider to Weltallflügen
The one hundred years ago in New York - based IBM society ( International Business Machines ) initially a very complicated names - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation .
The name of IBM , she only 1924 - it was originally a brand name for a branch in Canada and South America .
The foundation for future society IBM , the merger of four companies , whose history until the 1980s of the 19th century .
You had technologies such as the famous Stechkartenuhren on the registration of work and , at the end of the day .
The architect of the new company , Charles Ranlett Flint , until 1930 , the chair of the board of directors .
And it was the Flint , the head of the Konkurrenzfirma Thomas J. Watson stopped him , so that this in the management of the company helped .
Those leaders , the founder of IBM in the shadow of Watson 's ideas based invincible and today , the culture and identity of the company .
Watson started the company in 1952 .
IBM , began , as the name suggests , in the creation and distribution of all sorts of machines for trade - of sausage and Käseschneidern , to coffers .
In the first four years of Watson , he led the company doubled its sales to nine million dollars and the company expanded gradually on all continents .
Watson was for the company so essential that it whole forty years in Chefsessel sat , only then he was by his son , Thomas Watson junior replaced .
Under the leadership of IBM began in the development of artificial intelligence to work and also developed the first Programmiersprache .
In the 1960s helped engineers and computer from IBM NASA flights into space to head - on Merkur and Saturn , and in 1969 , the famous flight of the man on the moon .
Meanwhile , developed by IBM in 1964 the first Rechnerfamilie with equal Rechnerarchitektur - the number of IBM System / 360 .
A classic pc , the computer - standard that time , certain came in 1981 under the name of IBM 5150 on the market .
Twenty years later his Rechnerproduktion veräußerte IBM to China 's Lenovo society , on the other hand , they bought the Konsultantenteil the company PricewaterhouseCoopers and rose now fully in the business of Consultingleistungen and high - value - added services .
The strategy , which IBM in the last three years , pay is the concept of “ smarter planet . ”
It is the intention of technologies to wise way in so far not even planned areas , for example , to improve the situation in transportation and Städteverwaltung .
In the commercial sector , IBM introduced recently , the platform “ smarter commerce ” , the dealers to help the whole commercial cycle .
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic .
1932 - based IBM has a branch in the former Czechoslovakia , the first country in Central and Eastern Europe .
Today IBM ČR , among other things , a strategic outsourcing Center in Brno .
The Centre for Central and Eastern Europe take up residence in Prague and here is a top team of world - class that , with the technology of the Stimmerkennung .

The threat is real
Following the discovery of the “ Zwickauer cell ” doubt turkish media in the german state under the rule of law .
A newspaper speaks of a “ bloody ideology ” , which is now again auflebe .
The murders of eight türkischstämmigen and a greek entrepreneurs from 2000 to 2006 , an extreme right - wing background .
This news will be in Turkey and within the deutschtürkischen population in Germany with fear and concern .
Because for many german - türken in a long time totgeglaubtes spectre : since the burning in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993 , there has been no similar violence with more extreme right - wing background against Turks .
In Germany , xenophobia , however , was never in question .
The right - wing extremist network uncovered reveals , however , proportions , whose dimension still is not clear .
“ The bloody Lebt ideology back on ? ” , , the Internetausgabe the turkish newspaper “ Haberturk . ”
The newspaper Sabah , on the other hand , pointed out that one of the perpetrators of a V - man of Verfassungsschutzes may have been , and expresses concern that german authorities in the extreme right - wing swamp might be involved .
Calmly responded the turkish community of Germany : it reminded the weekend with a vigil in front of the Brandenburg Gate to the victims of racial violence .
Just two weeks earlier , the turkish community in Berlin , together with german and turkish politicians in a ceremony of the 50th anniversary of the german - turkish Anwerbeabkommens thought .
In joyous colors was the co - existence staged as a history of success .
As a slap in the face , as the reporting of certain turkish media : “ Germany gift on the 50th ” is the title of an article in the turkish Haber Internet platform “ X ” , to which the background to the series of Will .
The Deutschlandausgabe the “ Hürriyet ” we can not take this spiritual connection .
“ It starts to stink , ” is the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci .
It underlines the fact that people have been murdered , the taxes paid and with their work is an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany have done .
Most are critical in deutschtürkischen forums , the actions of the police and their later Fahndungserfolg discussed .
Why the german authorities not long ago came to my mind is , in extreme right - wing circles after suspects to surprise the authors .
Some people , at least rhetorically to drastic measures prepared : “ will continue to live here , it remains the migrants do nothing other than the self - defence and the armed forces . ”
“ This will probably be the best self - defence . ”
“ The quality of the education and the appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network depends very much the inner peace in Germany , ” writes , “ selenium . ”
What it means , if the inner peace in Germany is in danger , shows the attacks of Mölln Solingen and in the 1990s .
The photograph of the Brandruine Solingen is deeply rooted in the german and turkish memory .
Because no other event showed the Turks living more clearly that there is a real threat , and the Germans that suspicion and distance in right - wing violence could result .
The attacks , however , sharpened the we - feeling on the turkish side .
Not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the turkish press at the time , in particular , the failure of the german policy after the attacks , criticizes , Helmut Kohl refused , the survivors of Mölln to visit .
After the fire of Solingen he sent a telegram of condolences to the turkish President , at his funeral in Cologne but his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel was at the time in his speech on how many charges but Turks .
As berechne is the value of a people for the level of its very .
The current reporting the turkish media shows once again how deeply the suspicion of many Turk from Bremen in the abandonment of rule of law since then .
In addition to the efforts of a comprehensive education and re - evaluation of the extreme right - wing terrorism in Germany needs this time it openly .

On a personal level , mass slaughter
Einfühlsam and generous begins Peter Englunds new book “ beauty and a history of the First World War , told in nineteen destinies ” with a long list of main people who contribute to a to heart .
Here , a piece of advice about how we could : you are raising this side of caution and you make it to your Lesezeichen .
You will see these people in Englunds romanhafter narrative very well to get to know each other , and these protagonists than your GPS function , as the beacon in these few moments , in which you as Englunds men and women in the fog of war and lost your illusions are deprived of .
Peter Englund is a swedish historian and journalist .
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy to win the Nobel Prize for literature .
He has an unusual book written , which he did not incorrect as “ a work of the anti - history ” .
It contains only a few big names , important contracts or famous battles , there is little ambassadors , racing reporters or discussions on tactics and equipment .
It is less a book about what happened , he says , but rather “ a book about how it was . ” it is about “ emotions , impressions , experience and moods . ”
“ Beauty and the experience of war of terror ” almost 20 more or less unauffälligen men and women on both sides of the war of schoolgirls and Botanikern to mountaineers , doctors , Krankenwagenfahrer and clerks .
Some of these people to be heroes .
Some are prisoners of war , to lose Gliedmaße , be crazy or die .
Each of these lives truce as Votivkerzen in a church that some will add , while others fade away .
Englunds book is different from the usual history books .
It also revised the idea , the First World War was just the devastating entrenched position in the Westfront .
“ Beauty and horror ” moves with Expertenblick on other war zones : the Alps , the Balkans , the Ostfront , Mesopotamia , of East Africa .
On the soldiers in this book , a fall Bienenkörbe celebrates Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt , Tsetsefliegen are an intractable problem .
This is almost from the beginning , a very moving book .
The war has flooded the lives of these people as a natural disaster , such as a hurricane Katrina , the following Kordit smell .
Imagine you are a woman who at home with their children , and the cannon 's fire in the distance , you hear or take the flight ?
Who is at all ?
Hardly anyone understands what happened or why this war in the first place .
“ A lack of facts , ” Englund said that “ were on assumptions , assumptions , hopes , fears , hare - brained ideas , conspiracy theories , dreams and nightmares , rumours treaty . ”
“ Beauty and horror ” follows individuals like Florence Farmborough , an english nurse in the russian army , and Richard root , a young german Schiffsmatrosen .
Their stories were mainly memories , letters and other things have already published material removed .
Your Lebensberichte can be terrifying or simple , but they are very alive in Englunds the details in that collection of small moments .
Many of them act of shortage and Behelfen .
In the history of a german Schulmädchens tells it : “ a substitute , replacing everywhere . ”
“ Ersatzkaffee aluminium , wrong , wrong , eraser Papierverbände , Holzknöpfe . ”
He told more of the Ersatzessen in Germany .
He describes “ the meat from large compressed and rice cooked in Hammelfett ( and least with a false bones from wood served ) , tobacco , from dried agricultural roots and dried Kartoffelschalen , shoes , with wood besohlt . ”
There was , as he noted , “ 837 Nahrungsersatzmittel registered in the manufacture of hot dogs were allowed , 510 - registered Kaffeeersatzmittel . ”
Some stories act of honour and bravery .
An American acknowledges its own rush towards the ferocity and says of the war : “ one feels that in spite of everything that is , more for men than in Lehnstuhl to sit with the Abendblatt or the best - seller and a cigarette and a whiskey in the hand , and to do so , as such a façade of civilisation and as if there were no barbarism behind the own strengthened and beschlagenen Hemdbrust . ”
Conversely , a british soldier recognises that it is likely to die , and no one notice or would be done .
“ If you by the idea of self - sacrifice , is backing away , you would think that this is happening in front of an audience , ” he writes .
Instead it is so terrible as “ a convicted man who was hanged in secret . ”
Other observations act of the old Europe , the fall apart , and on new types of terror .
“ The conflict has been a growing economic competition , ” writes Englund , “ a war between the factories . ”
He catches the arrival of a what he “ a new species in the Bestiarium the young century ” : “ the word - looking and ideologically committed mass murderer in the yardstick , the slaughter , while he is sitting behind a desk . ”
People behave to unforeseen way and there is also frivoles behaviour such as heroic acts .
Englund is discussing the soldiers who actively trying to a prostitute with a Geschlechtskrankheit contagion to the Frontdienst to escape .
“ The bizarre expression can trade with Gonokokken - Eiter discovered , as soldiers and bought their genitals grease , in the hope that the way to enter the hospital to come ” , he writes .
“ Those who really desperate , rieben him in the eye , which led to them the rest of their lives were blind . ”
In this translation from a Peter Graves will Englunds poetry and elastic but intrusiveness and fit perfectly in his human task .
In dozens of small scenes he the way , as the war “ in unprecedented fashion uncontrollable forces unleashed : extreme nationalism , social revolution , religious hatred . ”
The people are starting to ask why their leaders for fighting .
The best books about the First World War were mainly a distorted as Paul Fussells “ Great was and Modern memory ” or novels as Erich Maria Remarques “ nothing new ” in the West as a comprehensive history books .
Englunds bond is an unconventional Ruhmeshalle .
His book , the most devastating , at the end of which I ever in a Sachbuch read .
I am no longer .
But it is , as he would have us with his book with this side of the protagonists in the nose and snapped with a match on fire .

Euthanasia and assisted Freitod must be legalised , a panel of
The Canadians live in denial of death , according to a report by the Royal Society of Canada shows
The panel said that governments , institutions , health care and doctors about schmerzlindernder treatment worked together for the best allows funding , and this , too , of the cases of cancer alone .
The canadian company is living in a recipe to the death .
Only 9 % of Canadians who are , in fact , with their doctor to speak on the conditions under which they would like to die and make arrangements for this purpose .
This is one of the conclusions of a magnificent report of the Royal Society of Canada , to the six experts were involved in various disciplines , among other things , ethics , law and medicine , are related to each other .
This panel recommends the government , so the penal code to amend assisted suicide and to allow euthanasia , where this election , and in patients than in the situation , to make such a decision .
As a prelude to the experts cite a recent survey of the independent society EIU , the Todesqualität in 40 countries of the Erdballes compared with each other .
Although Canada is in the 10th grade centers , the study noted that “ the medical Sterbebetreuung in Canada has created a culture where people are afraid to broach the subject of death ” .
Medical care or not : 77 % of Canadians have no access to painkillers , so tell us of the Royal Society of Canada appointed experts .
And despite the desire of the majority of Canadians , at home to die , die , however , ultimately 68,6 % of these in the hospital .
The whole country standpoint , the rate of 86 % of deaths that have occurred in the hospital in Quebec .
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and begleitetem suicide , the author of the report 's conclusions that the position of the federal government , which already has geäuβert , no changes to the criminal law on euthanasia and begleitetem suicide to make , entgegengerichtet .
But now we have , according to the experts , the gleichermaβen all those countries have inspected , the approach of euthanasia and legalised assisted suicide or have decriminalised , no evidence that such a decriminalisation Miβbräuche in its application , so the Praxisdurchführung of euthanasia or begleitetem suicide of unkompetenten or not consenting people .
On the contrary we encounter much more cases of such breaches in the countries in which euthanasia and legalised assisted suicide is not , as yesterday Jocelyn Downie , a signatory of the report , in a teleconference confirmed .
“ Euthanasia is in Canada , where it is illegal . ”
“ Also assisted suicide is in Canada , although it clearly illegal , ” says Jocelyn Downie .
Canadians are in favour of the euthanasia
Let us remind us that , according to a 2010 carried out - Angus Reid poll already 85 % of Canadians in favour of euthanasia geäuβert had , as they are of the opinion that these people would like to make it at the end of your career , to alleviate their suffering .
And 66 % believe that the issue of a euthanasia does not have to deliver the message that the lives of the elderly or disabled people less value besäβe .
In terms of the people who have an assisted suicide , represented the 41 % of respondents to the view that this should not be prosecuted .
What maintenance or suspension of funds in patients , as the situation is less clear , as the author of the report .
Similarly it in their Empfehlungsverzeichnis suggests that in the penal code should be indicated that the possibility of making the funds , for the rejection of a legal have been before , not a criminal .
The panel also calls for health care professionals in the job training should be a possibility of making money on the end of life to respect , and that without fear of prosecution .
The panel said that governments , institutions , health care and doctors about schmerzlindernder treatment worked , for the best allows funding , and this , too , of the cases of cancer alone .
Least calls for the body to the measures already in the canadian institutions to far - reaching health - care means used to pain relief lebensabschlieβender Maβnahmen or , at the very least , to consider , as these nor the euthanasia served to physical pain to reduce and this on the same procedures bezögen .
Other experts reservations
Some experts in the area of health care have expressed reservations about the conclusions of the Expertenberichts the Royal Society of Canada .
RA Pierre Deschamps , specialist in Gesundheitsrecht , the attitude of the berichtsunterzeichnenden experts , among other things , as “ an extremely ” , because this Euthanasiepraxis in patients in the final stage of no borders .
“ This opens the doors for a situation in which everyone , the lebensmüde and older than 18 years , is a different person to ask him in his suicide to help , ” RA Deschamps , the yesterday a summary of the report looked at .
RA Deschamps also stresses , the authors of the report , the ownership of the individual over all other values , in the social Gewirke of society are involved .
But now , he says , there would be “ guidelines and commitments in a society . ”
Margaret Somerville , specialist for Gesundheitsrecht , also has a “ strong opposition ” to the conclusions of the report expressed , which they call the “ pro - euthanasia - manifesto ” described .
Margaret Somerville , even a member of the Royal Society of Canada is , in particular the Berichtsangaben casts doubt on freedom of abuses in certain countries in which euthanasia and legalising assisted suicide , such as in the Netherlands and in Oregon .

According to the data of PREP is the difference between the first and second place in the election for the governor of nearly 27 % , with 879 votes out of a total of 6074 are not counted .
The possibility of Einzelauszählung the ballot paper is in this year 's elections in Michoacán a reality , because the Programa de Resultados Electorales Preliminares ( PREP ) spent data is the difference between the first and second place at the governor just 27 % , with 879 votes out of a total of 6074 are not counted .
In this sense , the President of the General Consejo del Instituto de Electoral Michoacán ( IEM ) , María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza , remember that just last November 9 , the Wahlstelle a number of rules to harmonise the local rules with the reform of the federal states in by parliamentarians adopted .
It is important to remember that Michoacán neither his political constitution and electoral law nor its law on Wahljustiz to the reforms passed by Congress , so these in this round of not come into force , the governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided their publication in Staatsanzeiger within the allotted time with the argument , nor any objections .
On November 9 , the Supreme Court ruled Mexico 's ( SCJN ) on the local legislature submitted Verfassungsklage and gauged the voice of the Staatsbeauftragten to the constitutional reforms as “ invalid and unlawful ” , because this does not have the right to “ decide or a veto it . ”
María de los Ángeles Llanderal said in an interview on the possibility of Einzelauszählung the voices that , thanks to the adoption of the guidelines by the Consejo General del IEM is the possibility that the local authorities the ballot papers partially or completely auszählen .
So can under the following conditions in one or more of the votes counted Wahlpaketen contained some of the results in the protocols do not agree ; the protocol on the count and calculation is not aktenmäßig before or it is not in possession of the chairman of the electoral commission , or there are obvious mistakes or amendments in the proceedings .
In addition , the Gesamtauszählung the full ballot papers Friday if there is a difference between the winners and the alleged , in second place are the same or less than one percent is provided at the beginning of the session is an explicit request from the party - or Koalitionsvorsitzenden , the second of the candidates .
The count can also in their entirety , if after the conclusion of the proper calculation is found that the difference between the alleged winners and the candidates in the second place equal to or less than one per cent , provided there is an explicit request by a representative of the party , whose second candidate , . in that case , the Wahlpakete , a partial count were suspended , excluded .
It is worth noting that the elections in Morelia in the same situation where , under PREP the difference between the first and second place just 0.16 % , although the votes out of a total of 129 923 Wahlprotokollen are not counted .

The “ indignant ” call on the authorities in New York out
Hundreds of demonstrators were in tents on the 's Zuccotti Square .
A large part of the Räumungsbefehl came after and changed its location in a nearby park .
The members of the movement Ocupy Wall Street demanded this Tuesday , the authorities in New York , when it with a court order again tried to the Manhatten - place to enter , after the morning after the place had been evacuated and have tried to another place in the Big Apple .
Hundreds of demonstrators pushed the 's Zuccotti Square together , to whom it is with a court order , the “ indignant ” the renewed tents at this point , allowed to gain access to. , meanwhile , is another part of the movement to the Räumungsbefehl and occupied a park further north in the city , where nine arrests .
“ Our idea is that , if the court does not allow us , in the square to campen , we are in a different place come together and the battle with legal means at the return to the 's Zuccotti continue , with sit - ins and peaceful demonstrations , ” said Mark Bray , a spokesman for the movement “ Ocupy Wall Street . ”
Bray said that the response of the “ outraged ” at the evacuation of its Zeltlagers directly by Michael Bloomberg , the mayor of New York , had been ordered to court , where Judge Lucy billings and symptothermic and other provisions , the forced evacuation of the square and prevented the protesters ' tents approved .
In addition , occupied the “ indignant ” a new park , which is at the crossroads of the central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel , the New York and New Jersey , and property of the Trinity Church .
You could place for at least one hour . but then met with the police , and arrested some of the demonstrators , although no precise figures Bray . he assured the Efe Agency , including several journalists have seen handcuffed .
The organisation assured me it would have been hundreds of people at this point returned , in which a group of religious leaders as a sign of their support of the members of the movement and communicating with the police arrived .
In the meantime , the 's Zuccotti Square ( a compound in private property ) closed pending a court hearing , which is scheduled for Tuesday , and the legality of the morgengrauen that have taken place in the evacuation of analysis .
Some of the place - fueled protesters wore photocopies of this court order to themselves , and distributed it . you have made it even some policemen guarding the square , with “ some small clashes ” has resulted in Bray , as reported , the appropriate , some police officers have beaten protesters .
The court order prohibits the authorities , members of Occupy Wall Street by the place to clear and the use of “ laws , which were adopted after the occupation and ban , the protesters with their tents and other things that they had already used in the park return . ”
Mayor Bloomberg is in front of the press , clearly the result of this court order the re - opening of the square for the separation , and the protesters lifted . the demonstrators , he pointed out that the Stadtgesetze did not allow them to return to tents and Schlafsäcken in this place .
The mayor personally defended the morgengrauen carried out in the evacuation of the - 's Zuccotti Square , the almost 200 people were arrested , and it was decided , because the demonstrators “ not against the law . ”
Bloomberg said that he had the order to clear the square because this is “ in a place that had turned to the people not the Demonstrieren came but to break the law and , in some cases , in order to damage other people ” because “ some deals have received threats ” and the “ bangten residents about their quality of life . ”
“ The evacuation in the early hours of the morning was very attractive and shows that Bloomberg , in fact , the protection of the financial interests and not on protecting the interests of the north american workers is interested , ” added the spokesman of the movement that the mayor anschuldigte “ not to respect the freedom of the press . ”
The “ Occupy Wall Street ” informed that they thought about it , “ firm action ” on Thursday to organise , together with Gemeindeorganisationen and trade unions to the two months that the protests since the September 17 now take to commemorate .

Japan after the earthquake is reborn
The GDP growing by 1.5 % , thanks to the Inlandskonsums and stop the cycle of a free fall from the beginning of March
Since the last March , the japanese economy paralyzed , which are still in the recovery after the devastating earthquake , which in a nuclear crisis einmündete , and the worst catastrophe that Japan is the second world war had seen .
The initial estimates of the government in Tokyo rated the material damage to 300 000 dollars , a blow , despite the difficult global economy to weaken .
After three quarters of case , the details of the gross domestic product from July to September , finally close this chapter : GDP grew by 1.5 % in the previous quarter and by 6 % on the year hochgerechnete quota .
In the second quarter , as value - in Japan marks the beginning of the financial year in March 2012 , is also the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010 .
The recovery is partly due to the Maschinenverkauf for rebuilding from the earthquake and subsequent tsunami devastated areas .
In fact , the company increased its investment by 1.1 % compared to the decline of 0.9 % for capital investment , from January to March was recorded , the first decline after six months of relentless increases .
However , the real change to the japanese economy not only from keynesian incentives , the advantage of the crisis to build infrastructure or build new ones .
Woke up Japan in particular , thanks to the development of the Inlandskonsums , the current 60 % of Japan 's GDP .
This variable rose by 1 % , launched by the increased spending on vehicles , travel and leisure activities .
The stigma of yen
Tokyo has been entrusted to the domestic market , after the yen , Japan 's currency , in one of the “ Zufluchtswährungen ” of investors ' from the debt crisis in the euro zone and the dire predictions for the U. S. a. , a privilege as a tombstone one day in the accounts of exporting companies .
With a stronger currency are the products more expensive abroad , a serious problem for a country whose economy on the health of the great Technologieproduzenten is based .
Toyota and Sony , for example , led their weak business results from July to September at the quotation of the yen .
While the markets continue to the peripheral european countries under siege , remains the government Yoshihiko Noda vigilant .
“ We must pay attention to the ongoing risks , for example , the deterioration in certain foreign economies , the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen , ” said yesterday the Secretary of State for economic policy , Motohisa Furukawa .
The prospects are not really very aufheiternd .
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) said that most member states in September clearer signs of a slowdown in economic development there .
The indicator that the turning points in the world economy vorausnimmt , brought to light that , in the largest Wirtschaftspotenzen put the brakes .
Because he fell by four - tenths to rid 100,4 points compared to the 100,8 in August .
The eurozone is even below the average rate of 100 is , after eight - tenths on 99,13 points has fallen .

Asphalt of the UNAM prevented bumps
Rafael Herrera , researchers at the School of chemistry in the mexican UNAM university developed with Polymeren Asphalte modified to the mix more resistant to weather and temperature changes to make
In the message , the road surface , respected , would it not be necessary , nearly 200 000 bumps to repair when the rainy season in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México ( Stadtbereich in the valley of Mexico ) breaks out , said Rafael Herrera Nájera , researchers at the School of chemistry ( FQ ) at the University of UNAM , warning and assured that if the laying and maintenance of the appropriate Asphaltbelags were to happen , the number of bumps significantly reduced or even fully be avoided .
In his presentation “ bumps from a technical point of view , ” he at the International Year of Chemistry , that he was aware that the laboratory , for which he is responsible , with Polymeren modified Asphalte developing a similar to the asphalt mix , but more of a mechanical resistance in both high and low temperatures .
Herrera Nájera said that this type of modified Asphalte in areas with extremely hot , such as in some towns in the north of the country , should be used to the behaviour of the surface of improving the incidence of Schlaglöchern to avoid .
He said that the asphalt - the hardest part of the oil - a Kohlenwasserstoffverbindung is , part of which has a high Molekulargewicht - the so - called Asphaltene - and the other is part of a low - the so - called Malthene . along the road surface to be typical zähelastisches behaviour .
Zähelastisches behaviour of the Asphalts means that this is at high temperatures of nearly 180 ° C as a liquid , 120 degrees , it is very zähflüssig and almost 50 ° C , while he is in very low temperatures is crumbling .
“ This means that the resilience of the Asphalts on the streets is not uniform , but one day , depending on the weather and temperature change ” , the engineer .
The researchers FQ said , the streets of Mexico City would have a majority of a flexible road surface , which is made up of six Materialschichten zusammensetze , of which the last three asphalt .
Between the top layers are some Verschleißschicht from asphalt , from small , in asphalt gebadeten and then entrenched stones .
Every single piece of this Verschleißschicht , bathing in asphalt .
If the vehicles to travel and forces are produced , allows for this class is a good power in the road surface .
“ If it would be modified asphalt , would the forces is even more to distribute , ” said the engineer .
“ On the Verschleißschicht ” , he tells us , “ is a final layer , the so - called Tragschicht , from the tiny stones , i. e. of sand , also in the asphalt bathing .
Since this shift is in contact with the tyres are , they need greater force than the mechanical Verschleißschicht and friction .
The road surface this most forces receives and distributed , needs the Tragschicht also a proper thickness and the material from which it is , will need to be maintained .
The weather conditions , in particular , humidity and temperature , are other important factors taken into account , and above all the water , ” he said , “ because it undermines the behaviour of the Verschleißschicht considerably .
If the terrain is wet , water in the class and is just back from difficult . created the weakening of all sections of the road surface and , as a result , the incidence of Schlaglöchern .
If a pothole ” , he said , “ will be the first Deckschicht flattened , while the Verschleißschicht only then will be affected , but the damage is not immediately , but it is a process that at the first sign of appropriate Wartungsprogramme maintained . ”
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Mexico 's innovation Investigadores ( national ) said that the Fahrzeuglast another important reason for the actions of Schlaglöchern . must therefore be the size of each layer on the surface is in relation to the Fahrzeuglast and it is important to ensure that to avoid frequent Schlaglöchern this rule will be met .
Rafael Herrera pointed out that there are still many research would take , for example , Asphaltemulsionen in other countries , even on the market , and with which the bumps simply and without using high temperatures repair .

Troops feel sympathy rather than respect
The event was a Wall Street - Gala , the millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City collected .
Kid Rock sang a Ballad of helplessness , frustration and loss .
On cue , collected a hundred soldiers , sailors , pilots and marines around him .
The amount in black Smokings stood up and applauded .
“ The servicemen and women have been seen as a hero , ” said David Saltzman , the Spendenaktion organised in the spring .
A senior military officer at the gala , which , among other things , on the Stabchef and then Chairman , Admiral Mike Mullen , saw the role of the troops in a different way .
“ They were introduced as orphans , ” the officer wrote in an e - mail .
I am sure that the organisers have meant well .
I know that .
But it was no respect , not really , it was sympathy for them .
The stark contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the most distant , sometimes admiring american public .
The troops are showered with praise for their victims .
But the praise has its price , say Dienstangehörige .
The public is acting increasingly , as do the people in uniform of suffering .
“ We were not sacrifice , ” said Brigade General B. Sean MacFarland , who commanded troops in Iraq and Afghanistan soon after .
“ But it seems that the only way the support of one of us in the role of unfortunate souls to inflate . ”
The issue is particularly sensitive for military leaders , not ungrateful or in dispute with the public they serve , seem to want .
They have also recognized that the anger , the returning troops in recent years of the Vietnam War clothed , much worse .
As a result there are discussions about compassion on the quiet and private between war veterans .
After his two sons from fighting with the marines have returned , warned the Colonel ( a. D. Mark Cancian them from that people outside the world of their military service from two different perspectives could see .
Some of them with a sense of awe , since they rebels defeated and to exotic places have visited .
Others wonder whether a “ angry , violent veteran under the surface , ” said Cancian , who had fought in Iraq and after his return , a senior Staatsposten in Washington .
During his job search , he said , he felt that some of the interviewer subtly erfragten , whether he was unable to immediately after his return from the fight the pressure of a demanding post in Washington .
“ If you talk about your service , they must be the negative impressions argue , ” declared Cancian his sons .
The lack of ease of the military is rooted in a lack of interest on the part of the Americans in the war .
Services on the battlefield , a country that has little experience with the military and only little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , is rarely as praise singled out .
“ We as a nation estimate military heroism is not more so , as it has been in the Second World War was normal practice , ” said Lieutenant General David Barno , who commanded US troops in Afghanistan .
Instead , the focus of the praise of the politicians and the public largely on the suffering of a Dienstangehörigen .
Troops find recognition for the number of attacks , they are suffering , the number of friends who have lost their job or for the severity of their injuries .

The world of the republican presidential candidates gemäβ
Mitt Romney , Herman Cain and Rick Perry competing in simplification and lack of knowledge about China 's , Iraq , and support for Israel .
Can a krisengeschwächtes America a complex world , with simple , not to say : stupid ideas ?
If the republican presidential candidates , listening to voters in almost this impression .
For a few days to Mitt Romney , Herman Cain , Rick Perry and their comrades - in - arms thundering their statements , and their statements regarding the Auβenpolitik , traditional republikanischem focus , consistently reported .
On China , Iran and the Israel - aid , often in any way - based slogans .
In terms of the appointment of the “ Grand Old Party ” , is the highest in the course of the Mitt Romney threatened the Chinese to the WTO and they quote the “ currency manipulation ” - leading issue in an America that the exodus of entire industries to Asia on Äuβerste would prefer not to accuse .
Stupid gone , if this is the introduction of a trade war is to imply , he said .
Jon Huntsman , the former ambassador to China under Obama , and the only candidate , the vision of a mature Auβenpolitik seems to have , almost in terms of the conduct of the emotions schmeichelnden strangled .
He had a full - blooded , but constructive Gesprächsaustausch with Beijing ( also called on the current position of Obama 's ) .
But Huntsman is not heard , because he was in the depths of the opinion polls is stagnating .
Reagan 's equal
Romney also had military strikes against Iran praised , if sanctions to talking the Nuklearprogrammes fail .
“ Should I am elected , and an I stop Iran ” , he had on hearing .
“ Obama is re - elected , they get the bomb . ”
Auβerdem he has greater military promised to help Israel and Obama charged that partner commitments guilty of having remained .
The businessman Herman Cain , zweithöchst platzierter candidate , for its part , a shameful Aktenunkenntnis on display .
Recently , he shouted to the chinese Militärbedrohung cons , as Beijing “ is trying to develop a nuclear power ” and appeared in the fact auβer to that China has since 1964 in possession of military Atomarwaffen !
The Texas Governor Rick Perry of Israel and military strikes against Iran , äuβert , for its part , ready to be the american army in against drug cartels in Mexico .
Obama 's 2009 banned use of Foltermaβnahmen towards mutmaβlichen terrorists was also of Cain , Perry and the Kandidation Michele Bachmann .
It is a long way from John McCain , the republican candidates in 2008 , a auβenpolitischen emphasis .
The current Präsidentschaftskontrahenten , Reagan had also simple ideas , and in spite of all that won the Cold War .
They call to mind the fact that Obama also selbstein amateur , and water in its wine to be had , with regard to the issue of anti - terrorist .
You are right to insist on the failure of his naïve Zwiegespräches with Iran , the hasty withdrawal of his “ boys ” from Iraq , his indecision in Libya , but also the reputation of the weakness .
These Anfeindung , however , is not quite so freely .
The population estimates the more positive assessment of the national security under Obama , the Bin Laden has switched off .
Since the Iraq careful not to military intervention , the clog up .
And Obama surprised by appropriate , he argues that America needed to economically to be rebuilt in its leadership .

The military is the increasing pressure to crack down on rape
This week to decide an important hearing about whether 28 men and women because of non - intervention in a rape before the military court to be charged .
It should not have hundreds of plaintiffs for the next hearing .
Elizabeth Obergefreite Lyman was 25 years old and in the 11th week pregnant when she was raped at night by a Soldatenkollegen .
It was in October 2008 and returned to their barracks in Miramar north of San Diego , the dinner with a friend , as a male colleagues , who was the one 12er Pack beer in itself .
He asked her whether to accompany a drink in their rooms .
“ My alarm bells to , ” said Lyman .
But the Texanerin brushed aside their concerns .
I thought : “ no , no , he is 19 .
He is from Texas , ” she said .
“ I wish I had on my gut instincts . ”
A few minutes after they had gone to Lymans Zimmer , the man behind it , put it down and they were raped , it claims .
This week , on 18 November , wait Lyman and 27 other current and former Militärangestellte anxious to a trial with an historic hearing in Arlington , Virginia , in deciding whether a charge against the former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor , Donald Rumsfeld , have to be in court are allowed .
The lawsuit claims that Gates and Rumsfeld not widespread rape in the military and in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers .
In February by Susan Burke , a lawyer in Washington , D. C. , comprised of the lawsuit initially 17 plaintiffs , but in the following months rose to 28 : 25 women and three men , all of which claim that they are of Soldatenkollegen raped or sexually abused , and that the military failed to identify , to condemn or a reasonable case law after the alleged attacks to provide .
Burke says it is monitoring the supreme military command , because the problem there will begin .
“ The military is hierarchical ” , she says .
“ But who are the individuals in the position , the culture of retribution to eradicate the lead . ”
Burke also says that since February , it has been in contact with almost 400 more survivors , many of them may be part of future claims .
Your strategy : instead of claimants , so to speak , for all their eggs in one basket , they will , if necessary , many more complaints to submit to keep up the pressure .
The team of defence for the Department of Defense , led by Bundesstaatsanwalt Neil MacBride , has made a request for legal action .
The files of the court , the Newsweek , lead , in detail , the defense to , first of all , that the military does not of current or former soldiers for injuries can be tried in the armed forces .
Because of a law of the Supreme Court in the 1950s , the so - called “ Feres Doctrine , there is the government not for injury , which is in active service , the soldiers to be added .
“ The alleged damage during the military service of the plaintiffs , ” says the document .
The Department of Defense refused any comment on this story .
Things have changed since the 1950s .
If women are still not to the service in the fight are permitted , it is only on behalf of the distinction : modern wars have only rarely clear fronts .
Both in Iraq and in Afghanistan teams play by female soldiers increasingly important roles , especially in the contact links with local women in the war zones .
The result : between the two wars died 150 soldiers , two - thirds of them in hostilities .
It is time for the military modernisation , says Burke .
And it is in their fight not alone : three further apart from their complaints are pending .
At Yale Law School , the veteran ” Legal Services Clinic lawsuit against the four main military academies , because of alleged promoting a hostile atmosphere .
This independent collects the not - for - profit Vietnam veteran of America a legal case against the military government , to be the diagnosis “ personality disorder ” , the rape victims received it from the service to a normal procedure , according to activists like Anu Bhagwati , the Service Women 's Action Network , a human rights group .
Her group , in December , a complaint against the veteran Administration ( , management of the war veterans ) , in which their discriminatory practices in dealing with entitlements for people accusing felt , in the service of sexually abused .
Nine laws has been independently by a mixture of senators and representatives from both parties in Congress , a number of leads .
In 2010 , according to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office ( , Office for prevention and reporting sexual abuse ) , Department of Defense 3.158 sexual abuses .
But the majority of abuses are not registered at all and the estimate of the Pentagon 's own account of this number about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases , on the face of it a year .
The report , which was published in March , also investigates the Strafverfolgungsraten : 2010 came 20 per cent of recorded cases in the military in a court of law , only half as many as in the civil law .
The plaintiffs in Burke 's case describe their attacks as only the first of a series of traumas .
In case they Lymans reported the alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after the attack .
That night , she says , she was 11 times , asked the details of her rape of a whole series of police officers , doctors and military commanders to tell .
You had a Vergewaltigungsset and the blood of their aggressor , from a cut on his arm , was found in her bed .
Six months later , in April 2009 , Lyman was by a judge heard . during this hearing , it was after the sex asked before the attack with her boyfriend .
Six people said as Charakterzeugen on behalf of the alleged perpetrator of will , in the end , was acquitted .
“ I remember the day when the verdict was read out , ” Lyman says .
“ I thought that would go into labor . I ran screaming from the courtroom . ”
“ They brought me to the psychiatric unit and I remember that I , when I came out again , to my commander said that was not his trial . that was my procedure . ”
Lyman has been asked to visit Militärpsychiater will , in the end , a personality disorder diagnosed and for dienstunfähig said .
In January 2010 , she was dishonourable , so that they do not support .
Whether the complaint that the Lyman and the other plaintiffs have submitted , is pure speculation , says John Turley , a professor of law at the George Washington University Law School .
However , it says : “ I believe they are making progress . ”
What between them and a verdict is , is this doctrine , criticised the will , for the first time , was called into question .
I am a critic throughout their life the Feres Doctrine .
The military is still lagging behind a decade later , because they do not possess the same incentive and the same deterrence , the liability .
He adds : “ the odds are against them … but it is important for them to try . ”
These things will only change , if good people are ready to fight .
If the item is not hearing their way , Burke , the lawyer of the plaintiffs , with its hundreds of other claimants for future cases .
“ We are going to the military , in this regard , continue to fight until reforms ” , she says .
Or until we die , whatever the first .

The court approved for 2015 the transition to digital television in Mexico
The conversion of the analog to digital signals in recent years , is one of the world 's most important changes .
The Supreme Court of Mexico 's ( SCJN ) , the Verfassungsklagen , by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the presidential decree , and by virtue of the switch from analogue to digital signals from 2021 to 2015 must be brought forward , due to the lack of eight votes to Gesetzesanfechtung are needed .
A minority of four ministers , including the President of the Supreme Court , Juan Silva Meza , thought that the President Felipe Calderón has not exceeded its powers to the decree - law with the details of the switchover to digital terrestrial issued .
With this decision has been launched by the Senate rejected constitutional struggle for lack of qualified majority of eight votes , so that the court is on the constitutionality of or not , should decide the constitutionality of the law , it remains in force .
In the project for the complaint that by the Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero , proposed that the decree - law unconstitutional to explain , because for the radio and television in question the Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones ( Cofetel ) ( Federale Commission for telecommunications in Mexico ) is responsible , so the decree - law the hierarchical principles and the legal reservations .
Only Zaldivar voted in favor of the project , Jorge Mario Pardo , Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero itself .
With this argument , both the Senate and the House of Representatives Verfassungsbeschwerden against the decree - law a. after the adoption of the complaints followed the Minister Sánchez Cordero the decree - law no longer , and found all activities on the establishment of the digital transmission .
The Council of Ministers also rejected by the Chamber of Deputies complaint , failing in the debate about the project , for which the minister Sánchez Cordero was responsible .
In his speech , the Prime Minister , not with the arguments of the project to agree , in the sense that the Länderregierung not with general provisions of the measures , the public administration to take control .
“ I do not believe that , if you do this , the independence of the regulator will not be affected , ” reminded us that for the strategic planning policies , such as the sector of the telecommunications , of constitutional law , the state government is responsible , because this is leading the state affairs .
The replacement of the analog signals by digital is one of the most important changes in recent years across the world , and it leads to a better use of radioelektrischen spectrum , higher quality of the signal and more channels .
The postponement of the changeover , she said , was a postponement of the enjoyment of the digital age , which is a decision in the public interest is not the only technical aspects , “ because it includes economic , social , political and security issues . ”
Those issues , they said , “ making the action of the whole system needed , in accordance with the principle of economic leadership by the state included a group of characteristics , which the Constitution in the hands of the central state government . ”
She called to mind that many countries around the world , the digital conversion already carried out , and on the government , even though they have highly specialised institutions .
It could not conclude that the government of the launching of the contested Gesetzesdekrets in the powers of Congress intervene , because of the legislative adopted laws would be respected , ” it said .

Is immigration burden or chance for the economy ?
The of Nicolas Sarkozy 's immigration policy has been criticized from many corners - of - police , judicial and governing bodies , as a result of the figures derive policy , a combination of this policy with the status of a “ country of human rights ” , as France call themselves .
Recently , the foreign students directed against harassment of administrative side the Wochenschauen marked , the interior minister had in passing ( see Libération on 23 May ) announced that France “ no talent , a bricklayer or waiter from abroad need . ”
But this policy was rarely , from an economic point of view .
On this issue is a wide consensus between right and left .
By right - wing side was the tone of Jacques Chirac , the mood in 1976 had stated that , “ 000 unemployed people , including more than 2 million immigrant workers , it is not a problem for a country should be , ” by left - wing side by Michel Rocard , the 1990 , France had expressed “ could not the whole of poverty in the world . ”
One difference is the level of Groβzügigkeit
The fear of the invasion of national land by hordes of polish plumber was in 2005 on both the right and left .
By both camps were immigrants as a burden for the economy and the french society .
The only difference is the extent to which the Groβzügigkeit , be towards immigrants are willing to admit .
Francois Hollande is limited in its programme on trite , the co - development would like it , our “ Contrary to resolve . ”
This idea of immigration as a burden , as a problem , may be on the elections effect ; but it is economically costly .
As the economists and Ian Goldin , Geoffrey Cameron in a recent work , the latest findings on the immigration together ( Exceptional People : how Migration Shaped our and our World Will Define Future , May 2011 , Princeton University Press , 352 S. ) among the specialists , there is a broad consensus about the positive impact of the flood on economic growth , jobs and wages in the destination .
The immigration would limit the growth of calm and the labour market .
The fears about the influence of the migrants are based on the idea that this risk , the indigenous workers , particularly the less skilled , substitutes , putting pressure on their pay .
However , experience shows that the migrants in fact much complementary than than the local grounds , as they schwerpunktmäβig professions in sectors that arbeitsplatztechnisch unausgelastet .
The low - skilled immigrants working in sectors , the local grounds little annoy , the higher quality among immigrants working in dynamic sectors in which the training is not the supply line .
Positive Lohneffekt
As well as a surgeon difficulties would have in a country to work , where there is a lack of Anästhesisten , this complementarity between locals and migrants a positive effect of the Einwandererzuzugs on wages and domestic labour market .
Giovanni Peri , in this way , calculated that a 1 % disabled rise in the flood of miteinbezogene , a long - term increase in wages between 0.6 % and 0.9 % herbeiführe .
And this does not take into account the fact that the of the immigrants ' s diversity of Ideenschöpfung , as well as the economic growth is the ( high proportion of immigrants from naturalized american Nobel Prize winners ; Google , Intel , Paypal , eBay and Yahoo have been of immigrants founded ) .
The migrants are also a net to the social security system , in european countries , on average , for a total of about 1 % of the entire budget .
The International Labour Organisation estimates , for example , that one at the age of 30 years after Germany einwandernde person the public budget , on average , about his life a net contribution ( revenue minus spending ) of the 150,000 euros .
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to start his mandate the intersection with the lack of “ teeth ” .
Question teeth , the immigrants would shock , however , exactly the opposite effect .

Plan a controversial oil pipeline will be delayed after exposure to US approval revised

TransCanada said on Monday night that the planned pipeline from the ecologically sensitive Sandhills area in the Nebraska will reroute .
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Parliament building of Nebraska .
Alex Pourbax of TransCanada , said that the company is still confident that the pipeline will be approved at the end of the day , albeit with a different course .
This came after an announcement by the State Department last week , after which a decision is made on a Bundeszulassung for the project would be postponed until the new possible course of review that is the territory of the Sandhills in Nebraska and the Ogallala Aquifer , a vast - Unterwasserversorgung , meide .
“ This is a real step forward , ” said the Republican Party 's Lee Terry , a Republican from Nebraska , to Fox News .
The new Umweltüberprüfung , the State Department has ordered , may be postponed a decision until 2013 , after next year 's election , although officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision .
Obama said last week in a written statement that the decision is the task of the State Department , and said his support .
The 1,700 - mile pipeline has been Canada to the Gulf of Mexico .
You would 700,000 barrels of oil per day from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas .
In this regard , the pipeline would pass through six states .
Environmentalists they hate , but labour markets because they love , they estimate that the pipeline will create 20,000 jobs .
But the legislators Nebraskas , the opposition to the plan , are weighing up the laws in order to move away from the region of the Sandhills and the Ogallala Aquifer , a main source of drinking water and irrigation to force .
The current study on the impact on the environment of the Foreign Office has found out that the project had little impact on the environment , but the source of the energy industry says the Ministry Hauptprüfer a separate probe has requested the review process , which is focused on two issues .
One is whether a lobbyist by TransCanada has been stopped , Paul Elliott , the 2008 adviser to Hillary Clinton was in a conflict of interest .
The other is whether a company that has been charged , the original study , an inappropriate choice , as it was with TransCanada .

Scalia and Thomas dinieren with opponents of the Gesundheitsgesetze , as a court case takes
On the same day that the Supreme Court behind closed doors to the politically teilende question about whether it is a challenge to the Gesundheitsgesetze by President Obama will hear , made two of its judges , Antonin Scalia and finally there is Clarence Thomas , at a dinner attended by the Chancellery gesponsort , that was the case in court .
The incident took place last Thursday , when all nine judges are meeting to discuss met on the petitions for consideration .
One of the cases handled an appeal by the 26 states against the far - reaching reform of the healthcare system , the last year by Congress approved a law in the conservative activists across the United States on the slogan .
The judge agreed with the hearing on ; indeed , in March , a 5 1 / 2 - hour Grundlagendiskussion expected , probably the result will probably boost the Präsidentschaftskampf 2012 , at the time , in which the court 's decision is made public , will be in full swing .
The lawyer , the courts , and will maintain that the law is to overturn , will probably be Paul Clement , Attorney General once under the administration of George W. Bush .
Clements ' s cabinet , Bancroft PLLC , was one of the nearly two dozen companies , the annual dinner of the federalist society , a veteran group , which the defence of conservative principles .
Another company , which has sponsored the dinner , Jones Day , represents one of the business associations , the National Federation of Independent Business , which challenged the law .
Another was the sponsor Pharmaziegigant Pfizer Inc. , the financially in the outcome of the enormous process is involved .
The dinner was held a few hours after the court on the debate , in a Washington hotel .
Service had , among other things , Mitch McConnell , America 's the Fraktionschef of Republicans in the Senate and a fierce critic of the health - care reform
The guests of the dinner ? Scalia and Thomas .
This is nothing new : the two judges visit for years events the federalist society .
And it is not against moral rules .
In fact , the judges by the code of conduct , free of the actions of the lower Bundesrichter .
They were there , they might well under the principle 4c Code , which states : “ a judge can get near law and other organisations to take part , and the judge , according to a spokesman for guest or programme does not a guest , such events . ”
Nevertheless , the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the with the case of related practices , as well as to a company with a massive financial interest in this , morality - and - Regierungsaktivisten alert .
“ The startling break with morality and the contrast with the code gives the complaints by some judges lie , the court seems to play by the same rules for all other Bundesrichter apply , ” said Bob Edgar , President of the common cause , a civil rights movement in the United States .
“ The judges won and dinnierten during a Benefiziveranstaltung with lawyers with pending trials at the court . ”
Your attitude and their support for this event a Spendenaktion undermine any right to impartial and are not acceptable .
Scalia and Thomas have little regard for critics , who say they are Gerichtsangelegenheit too easily with groups that are off the agenda , such as the federalist society , mix .
And the wife , Ginni Thomas ” is a well - known conservative activist .
However , the Conservatives that Judge Elena Kagan was a moral problem , not Scalia and Thomas .
Kagan was Generalstaatsanwältin under the Obama administration , when the first Gesetzesanfechtungen in the first instance in court .
Your critics urged Kagan themselves from the hearing of the case because of bias to withdraw because they are too much in defending the law committed to be impartial .
Kagan is not about to do that .

The Hinspiel had two teams the objectivity of missing .
“ At the end of the 90 minutes , we will be a happy team and , above all , a happy country . ”
Paulo Bento already faces in Poland and Ukraine .
For him , there is not the slightest hint of doubt that , “ La Selecçao ” , his Nationalelf , for which he since September 2010 , is responsible for the 2012 European Championship qualifying .
For Portugal , which in fact only 90 minutes honeymoon .
But there is a match to play , and an opponent abzuservieren , Bosnia .
In view of the Hinspiels ( 0 - 0 ) on Friday in the hell of Zenica , it seems obvious that the cast have not yet been taken .
Portugal has dominated for more than an hour of the game , but the team was not able to make that are so important to mark the pressure it would have taken .

A good idea , provided that this time will be put into practice .

Walls have eyes : how researchers see you on Facebook
Before the new face of the right - wing extremism in Europe was Anders Behring Breivik , just one of many boys who their anti - Einwanderungsmeinung online broadcast .
On Monday , Breivik , who has been on a killing spree in Norway in July to have committed , in which 77 people were killed , his first public court hearing .
Despite Breivik acted alone , he is far from alone in cyberspace : he has a great deal of time until his attack before his computer and with some of the millions of nationalists gechattet , the extreme right - wing groups on the part of social support networks .
After the tragedy of this past summer , researchers wanted to find out more about these people .
But , as we find them ?
This is easy , you only have to connect on Facebook .
“ We have found that it was not difficult , to go to them , ” says Jamie Bartlett , the Hauptautor a recent report of the british Ideenfabrik DEMOS , on the digital populism in Europe .
Facebooks hide - and - seek personal data is so enzyklopädisch Bartlett , says that the researchers simply Werbetool the side have to use their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy decide exactly - as retailers have done for years .
Bartletts team found half a million fans of far - right groups throughout Europe and visierte it with Adds , but rather than with a new band or a new Diätprodukt to effect , invited the Adds users to a survey in which after their level of education , their attitude to violence and the assessment of their own future was asked .
Thanks to Facebook , Bartlett and his colleagues in the situation , more than 10,000 followers of 14 very right - wing parties in 11 european countries to question - without even to her office would have to leave .
“ It is a fairly new research method , ” says Bartlett .
Some of the results come as a surprise hardly . online promoter of far - right groups are mostly young , male and resent the immigration .
But in a kind of surprising distortion , “ those who make their online activism with an off - line activism combine sensible , democratic and less violent than those who are behind their computer screens to sit still . ”
DEMOs work is just one example of how Facebook is a new tool in the hands of scientists .
Ideenfabriken , medical researchers and political scientists use the hand , study it all , of health issues to Gesellschaftstrends as in “ Likes ” , text messages and Statusaktualisierungen .
With more than 800 million active users , on average , three content per day add , generated Facebooks “ Datensupernova ” a Forschungsboom , the number of scientific work by the name of this side of the title in the last five years , almost 800 % increase .
For some researchers is the beauty of Facebook , the fact that this side of people studying , usually with his Clipboard on the road is not achieved .
“ If he had previously tried to people of the British National Party to ask , it was very difficult to identify them . ”
“ You had to inform the first of the party and they never would have access to , ” says Bartlett .
“ Facebook is everything away , you will go directly to them . ”
Others say that the side offers an opportunity to social health problems to identify and resolve .
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin , Madison , and her colleagues found that students who their Vollrausch on Facebook , significantly more than the Problemtrinken tend to students who remained silent on the issue .
Moreno is proposing that equal students , for example , the Wohnberater side monitor and a student help if they make many Statusaktualisierungen postet .
“ You can 't solve a problem if you have not heard of , ” said Dimitri Christakis , Morenos co - author and director of the Child Health , Behavior and Development on Children ' s Research Institute in Seattle , the Washington Post .
“ We have found an opportunity to vulnerable children to identify the , not been found . ”
Facebook zapft also constantly the data of its own people .
The Datenteam the side has statistics on the Beziehungsstatus and Valentine 's Day , turnout in the 2010 mid - term elections , and a National Glücksindex produced ( and the first data have been used on the all - access Facebook has perfected the digital freedom have known for a long time that the side of their great Datenfundgrube for other for research purposes , to make . )
But the users of Facebook , know that the side observed them , whether they want it or not , with a friend , the thousands of miles away , to be able to play Scrabble , allowed one of the side 's own personal data auszubringen .
But what if the users of Facebook , part of a survey , from which they do not even know about ?
While researchers have strict guidelines laid down as to how they collect data offline to online is allowed to do anything .
“ I do not believe that many users at all reflecting on the fact that researchers could study their profiles , ” says Neil Selwyn , a sociologist at London Knowledge Lab , a study in 2006 , in which he public sides of students on Facebook investigated .
“ What it is , it was only for them and their friends . ”
Then there is the question of methodology .
Even offline , there is no guarantee that a Forschungsteilnehmer absolutely honest .
On Facebook , it is impossible to know how many of the claims in a Nutzerprofil and in speeches are true .
“ What you on Facebook says and what is outside of Facebook , are two different things , ” says Selwyn .
Therefore thinks Selwyn despite his years as Technologieforscher that a Clipboard and a pen is still the best Forschungswerkzeuge is that everyone can use .
“ There is no substitute for the real world and with real people to talk to , ” he says .
“ Social research to turn to the social care and a lot of social life is still offline . ”

Experts say a Stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the initial article about how Stylisten learn , I had a little bit of gemeckert that a little bit too much food , for a start .
As anticipated , I do not have the slightest of what is to come .
Lectures by three experts from the industry , the clothing of troubled characters and a seminar on how the “ place ” .
It is worse to come .
The closer examination , so more information and practical challenges before us .
But even if the course each on Saturdays and Sunday , he is still full .
This time , we debated with director exists ( on the course , not a single man part ) , as a woman , not the ideal proportionierte figure .
And that is still the most of us .
The first is too short a neck , the other a jungenhafte figure without proper curves and others are mollig .
It is up to the Stylisten , broad shoulders looks to conceal the neck or the necessary hervorzuzaubern curves .
We also got tips , such as a Frauentyp as Jennifer Lopez - that is , with great from the waist up , wide and narrow their waist - hip nicely and figurbetont attracts without too provocative .
If , for example , the difference between their waist and Hüften is so great that the rock or the pair of trousers really do not fit , you should at least a little bit to tailor - make their groups .
The you will certainly not regret , because well - based clothing is simply unaffordable .
In such a tailor - made Rock you feel are much better than in a “ off the , the full of high - and , in the absteht verrutscht their waist , and so on .
Jungenhafte characters can , in turn , allow clothing with wrinkles , Bauschen , applications , embroidery or Raffung .
In this lot of information and Figurtypen , I am pleased that a whole week I have time , I thoroughly over .
And yet , I fear that , given the homework assigned to it almost impossible to achieve .
Each of the Kursteilnehmerinnen received a Promi allocated , for which it is fitting attire and come up with to - Tagesbekleidung Abendrobe .
Should the current appearance , Modestil of the stars and the Figurtyp account .
I should Miranda Kerr “ attract ” that you possibly from the campaign Victoria 's secret .
In the heart of juble I , as it is for me personally , much better than , for example , Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera , the last time well the hundred kilos of increased ( okay , this is a bit of an exaggeration ) , or even the young Selena Gomez .
The clothes are we from ausschneiden magazines or on the Internet , and then printed grafisch .
In the “ Moodboard ” , as the whole result is to then our personal style and our relationship to the graphic design .
It is very important , even on the side of the graphic Stylings .
The Stylist , the models are not only physically , but also creates the so - called product side in the journal ( after specific target , for example , trend - handbags , coats , etc . ) .
It told us the Stylist and designer Mario Kameník .
But the only on Sunday .
This means that a Stylist must have a good view .
With the information about Figurentypen angefüllte Samstagsvortrag , three visitors from the seasoned industry :
By Jan Stylisten Pokorný , the fashion designer Jakub Polanka and the Modefotograf Ben Renč .
Jakub reminded us that fashion is the illusion and a Stylist should be able to take advantage of this .
And eingeschickter Stylist can with a single Bekleidungsstück in a very different way to work .
The magic word means variability .
You can , for example , a Trenchcoat as usual on the wear jeans , a T - shirt or coat , you can have it but also on the naked body , Absatzschuhe to attract it as a dress .
It is enough , the sleeves or the collar hochzukrempeln and immediately , the whole look very different .
“ To play with , ” he said .
Most came to me but the Council to be the following : “ first of all you have to know the rules of perfect . ”
“ Only then you can violate them , ” said Jakub .
At last , is clear to me why we all these theories pauken must what to do with what can combine and why , even if , in Modejournalen often quite another to see .
By Modeschauen .
Thanks to the photographer Ben I know now that a Stylist much more Bekleidungsvarianten have prepared , as it will finally be photographed .
So you have for a Fashion story with ten pages ( read ten attire ) to be prepared , at least 15 to stylen .
And also that the clothing the photograph in combination with other accessories sometimes looks very different than in reality .
With all that are going to have to get the attire .
That image and sometimes Styl half the success , swiping us Jan Pokorný .
You only need to be even Madonna , a not particularly brilliant singer from the image and marketing a world star with respect .
In the Czech Republic , the services of a Stylisten more reserved .
Even celebrities is often a waste of money for ( the main thing is that I , as I am is a secondary issue ) .
And if one of us stylen , then we should expect that he or she is very likely a very different ( smaller ) size sport , as he or she really needs .
It will then be only googlen with security to note that the tabloid writes , the corresponding Promi have again or declined , and so on .
Jan and Mario put us on Sunday to not to believe that a Stylist only to the fashion to focus on and then the clothes “ assemble needs . ”
In his work he needs , in particular , with the people communicate , which he stylt and it must be a skilled psychologist .
People assess without , and to please his opinion .
“ If we have any manager , their Kleiderschrank to sift through and beautiful pieces to supplement , then it does not eliminate the whole a cupboard and say , my God , this is terrible . ”
“ At least a few worthy things on which they recommend what you can , ” says Mario .
He showed us specifically as a so - called “ Platztasche must contain . ”
In other words , so a bag at the their waist zuknöpft and in which all the necessary Proprietäten in .
No such clear terms , such as the gap , Abroller Haareentfernen Sicherheitsnadeln or does it contain such Utensilien , such as a Nylonfaden ( helping the Stylist the photography of products such as handbags or hats from ) , specific clips to the back of the clothing gerafft will , if it is too big ( Stecknadeln or other Klemmen are prohibited , so that the material does not break down ) and , of course , Nähzeug .
So that we not only have to listen to , but also something virtually can try , we learned how to properly unterklebt shoes .
The photography studio , where the floor is , it can damage the Schuhsohle , much less the outside .
Us o klebten and klebten we …
With the gap , we must not even affect the shoes , so that they are not damaged .
So you have really sent .
Mario delighted me by my “ creation ” without restrictions praised .
The skill is not just my strength .
All of this was just the fraction of what we in the second weekend - Fortsetzungskurs to be told .
One thing is I have since become clear - the Styling at a professional level , is not an easy task .

V Need for speed : “ the run ” - the illegal race across America
Recession
Originally , careless driving has been hit by a series of entirely preventable , dilettantischer mistake to Routinefahrt to Frühschicht .
It managed to ambitions in large part to meet , but what is the point if no one seems to want a bit more to do .
Even before he came to the Ladentische , part of the new with the subtitle “ the run high expectations . ”
He promised , but the already bejahrte Spieleserie “ Need for speed ” back in a new dimension to delay in the spielbaren Demonstrationsbeispielen he seemed really not only one of many action - Rennspielen .
We were also curious as to how the eingepassten passages , in which the main protagonist of the car is rising and will continue on foot .
But as it was in NFS is so accustomed to , in essence , is a lot different than it had expected .
Sure , there are potentially very decent Arkade - race , but on the whole , the game by some unnecessary mistakes diminished in this series are already more or less for a few years to have a presence there .
So there are really no more mistakes , but rather evidence of a in principle incomprehensible laziness of the Spieleentwickler .
The adventure begins very well .
For now , it will be in the history of introduced , whose main character Jack personal nature of certain problems ; the only solution seems to be in an illegal race across America .
In San Francisco , on the west coast , will it get steering wheel - with the task , as the first in New York to be .
The basic idea is a whole series of interesting elements .
The entire route is in ten stages and in more than 50 individual race divided .
This means that every race at another route , and that the various stages in different , sufficiently different and interesting milieu .
It has no moment the impression that game is always the same .
Some areas are still very nicely , although the technical level of chart does not have the earlier parts of the series .
That is not something I get too excited about .
But the journey through the desert , through herbstliche landscape or high by deep verschneite landscape wirk visually very pleasant .
Now and again bring atypical elements of a bit of a change in the individual race .
In the desert , for example , is a surprise to the point of view of the desert storm cripples .
In the mountains , in turn , must be to watch your step , that is not an avalanche buried .
By the way are fairly well in a row the individual race .
Only a few , but they do .
For a while we tried , the required number of opponents to overtake ( in principle a classic race ) , you have time to catch up ( classic race against the stopwatch ) , it still expected a duel between a face - to - face with a single opponent .
And there is also the police force that a blow the whole thing .
A novelty are passages in which Jack of the vehicle leaves .
It is more about certain interactive including animations , in which Jack before anyone escaping and where the players must help by it at the right moment , the right button .
So it is not complicated .
It is surprising , however , that it is in the game a lot less passages , as one would expect ( actually the only three ) .
In the end , that is the thing is more likely to have the advantage , because as this element at least has no chance of becoming boring - it is in the context of the above to the elements that make the game to vary .
The Fahrmodell is progressing in the Fußtapfen the previous parts .
That is to say , from today 's point of view , is pulling out of the trees , on the other hand , you could not argue that it would be bad .
Anyone who seeks realistic simulations , must look elsewhere .
But a aktionsgeladenen Rennfahren Fahrmodell our supermarket will remain very well , although the competition could find better .
Until then , as far as all in good order .
Real problems , there are only after a certain time .
In contrast to the Kollisionsmodell Fahrmodell is not O. K .
Of a game of this kind , it is hard to expect there to be complicated deformations and collisions , but if there is virtually no impact on any object idea of how the car , then , is clearly not everything is in order .
Case in point : the close Überholen or Vorbeifahren of oncoming cars “ scratches ” it in some places in the other car only slightly , in others , almost identical situation , but we went into a tailspin on wild performance .
Or the Karre to scrap metal .
Thanks to the Restart - system which is nothing more , from annoying it is ever - present .
The Restarts are so resolved : if you have destroyed or far away from the route ends up , then the game back to the last point of reference .
Only - in every race has only five Restarts .
When they are exhausted , everything is from square one..
The Restarts are actually more of something like a tool , in the event that something does not succeed , but rely on it is hard .
Sometimes does not help the Restart , and nothing other than the critical section from the head to learn .
Extremely unpleasant is that the same things often to the same places .
Some curves , for example , in a very specific way , because otherwise if we simply do not .
Elsewhere , there is a list of the “ civilian ” cars always in the same configuration , regardless of whether you as a first or fifth , five seconds sooner or a minute later .
This is particularly in situations annoying when you see that the Kontrahent a romped to two oncoming cars get away , but until it gets to the cars are already in such a position that they get or delay .
And it is no matter when they arrive , everything is designed to have this situation to always close to your nose .
The opposing parties have other benefits .
Throughout the game , there are a few places where you always in the same place from the same opponents will be overtaken again regardless of the time .
On Verrücktesten , this is the end of the game to the long bridge , one in the head .
The Kontrahent a must here seem to come hell or overtake .
And if he then had a is , then that is a , of course , the point of view , so that they initially by car a couple of times in Klump drive .
Clearly , you want the game simply more exciting and exciting but this intention is so clearly that they quickly the pleasure the game spoiled .
And that is a shame , because , in spite of a simpler Fahrmodell is the game as a whole rather entertaining and at times so aktionsgeladen that they no longer know , where one of the head .
And in principle , regardless of what “ guilty ” of it is - the concept with 50 unique routes , the organisation of the race in a way that no boredom , pay , or something else …
A far - fetched idea is also the Wagenwechsel during the race .
We must filling stations on the road not overlook the fact that just because you can not change the car , even though in most cases the car enough that it is .
The cars are divided into three categories .
The sports cars are good for the urban areas , the strong american brand for the precise motorways and exotic super sports car for the technical journeys , for example , to the Serpentinen in the mountains .
Hand in hand with the way Spielgeschichte is also the tasks - mode ( challenges ) - the race in the individual localities , which is in the history of it .
There is not only medals , but also own Erfahrungspunkte for the win , which together for the tasks ( challenges ) and history .
In order to enhance the Fahrerniveau , have different open : the car started to the Backgrounds for the profile .
This is , at the same time as the online role Autolog , among other things , the own achieved results compare with those of other players and also for further collective functions .
A further incomprehensible Schnitzern is a situation in the last race of the story .
Here it is : the car in an underground tunnel ( I ) , where it was in the dark on the track for boils ( say ) .
On the Tacho look paragraphs between 150 a 200 km / h ( I ) , but there is at once from behind a metro and drives a hard - line to scrap metal .
In our editorial we will probably still argue for a long time about whether this was a Blackout of Spielgestalter , or whether the authors to be so stupid .
The technical side is nothing Überwältigendes but at least the visual overall impression that , in most cases , appealing and here and there , even brilliant .
Even more galling is that some of the exciting moments Bildwiederholfrequenz is slowing and that sometimes quite dramatic .
That is particularly the accidents with greater number of concerned , where a continuous FPS not of any good .
As far as the Tonwiedergabe is O. K. and the Soundtrack is Geschmackssache .
In an effort to such a broad range of possible as more young audience , was a “ Soundtrack lá each of something ” - but who is buying such a game because of the music ?
The overall impression of Need for speed : the run ? the feelings are more mixed .
When the game not by these totally unnecessary mistakes would diminish if we had with the held conviction able to claim that the run the best piece of NFS in recent years .
But in fact , the game somehow unfinished .
In a class for pleasure , but we must be prepared for this mistake with the power of Flughafenscheinwerfern in the eye .

Debt on construction
In the programmes Hábitat , Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 Sozialbauten planned for migrants are at risk due to lack of funds to be completed , or only with great delay , said Miguel Ángel López Miranda .
The head of the urban authority for social development , said that , while the works at an advanced stage , they are now in peril , because the interests of its fair share of funding for the three programmes 11 million peso cross , have not paid .
He said that the overall investment in these three programmes was almost 50 million pesos , of whom 25 % in the state fell to have now only the Federación and the community resources contributed to the work , which is why a delay of the Baubeendigung to expect .
“ They must contribute 12 million , and although the year comes to an end , they have not a penny , and , even though it in July , a part of have to pay , ” he said . “ not to being late , with the work we have already started , and they are well advanced , but we need the money . ”
He pointed out that under the government of Jesús Aguilar Padilla the state not met its commitments , which is why the community whose government at the start of a loan of $ 7 million needed to borrow the equivalent to the amount that the central government would have to raise .
“ That was us in the last legislature so gone , because the state did not have sufficient economic resources of the went further and this year , we have the resources , the state does not have to in order to participate in these programmes , ” he tells .
Even if the state authorities to release these funds have a duty , he commented that the minister of administration and finance , requested that the administrative work to speed up and the outstanding share as soon as possible .
“ Nearly 12 million they must provide , and although the year comes to an end , they have not one penny . ”

Why is the unemployment rate of disabled people in such a high level ?
About 19 % of people with disabilities are to find a job .
Today marks the start of the “ 15. week of work for disabled . ”
Despite a purposeful Öffentlichkeitspolitik , which was introduced in 2005 , the unemployment rate is for disabled people always twice as high as the average average : 19 % to 9 % of the total population of unemployment .
Discouraging ?
“ No , it stressed Éric Blanchet , Director General of the Association of Adapt , the “ week of work for disabled ” . ”
“ In 15 years of progress . ”
“ At the time , it was the unemployment rate , not twice , but three times as high . ”
“ Nichtsdestotrotz remains enormous amount of work to be done . ”
It has to be said , however , that the unemployed for disabled many obstacles remain before they get a job .
It is more often the elderly : 37 % are over the age of 50 years ( 17 % on average ) .
You have a low level of qualifications : 80 % of them have no a - levels and there are only 10,000 people with disabilities in the 2.3 million students with qualifications .
In the end , the very long - term unemployment widespread : 53 % for the disabled to 38 % in Gesamtschnitt .
In short , there are so many criteria that a renewed Arbeitseinstieg more difficult , and the “ heart of the problem lies , ” Christian Grapin , Director - General of Tremplin , a 1992 association set up companies to help disabled workers to recruit .
So much for the factual brakes .
The left unsaid , the mindsets , certainly , but slowly develop .
A in April from the Association of IMS - Entreprendre for the journal La Cité study of the managers surveyed have “ a weak Kenntnisniveau on disabled , ” the “ over - represented ” is “ for people in wheelchairs , mentally or intellectually off . ”
The result is that private companies with more than 20 people still have a long way to the Anstellungsziel of 6 % disabled workers , which by law in 1987 , has been established .
The latter , which dates back to 2008 , figures point to a ratios of 2.6 % .
“ We are now in the 3 % , ” said Pierre Blanc , Director - General of Agefiph , the organization that is entrusted to collect contributions from companies that this law .
The evidence : the number “ charges zahlender ” sites , as well as the sum of the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011 , and although zahlenmäβig of 59.000 on 000 ( and of 606 to 480 million euros ) .
“ The 2005 law , which provides for increased contributions , created a strong pressure on businesses , said Pierre Blanc . ”
“ But this improvement also brings a real recognition , especially at the groβen Firmengruppen . ”
According to the Ministry of work only 59 % of the sites between 20 and 49 staff disabled workers , companies with 100 to 199 employees against 82 % .

7 lessons of the interview with the late Steve Jobs , this week in a theatre was shown
After the death of Steve Jobs on 5 October compared some of it with Henry Ford and raised the Technikgenie as a large , modern inventors .
What Apple 's fans , but perhaps the most telling in the recently discovered jobs - interview , which this week in particular Filmvorführungen on the major markets dusted off , is how much the creative head networking and routines understood .
He was certainly a designer , a dreamer and self - appointed Hippie , but he was also a meticulous organizer , the eager to Diagrammen bastelte - a man who thought that many managers in “ a disease of thought ” , “ a really great idea 90 per cent of the total work … [ but ] there is a huge amount of Handwerkskunst between a great idea and a great product . ”
Bob Cringely 1995 developed the tv series “ triumph of Fachidioten ” as a result of the personal computer , and he was sitting for more than an hour with jobs , in one of the rare , detailed talks led .
At that time , and 10 years since jobs from Apple . and he has already worked hard on his new computer company NeXT , and was on the broad adoption of the Internet .
While a small part of Cringleys interview in Fachidioten has been used , he says that the Kopiervorlagen of the interview in the supply were missing .
Jobs death only after it was also found that a full copy of VHS - in the garage of the director .
This slightly revised film footage that forms the basis for the 68minütigen film “ Steve Jobs : the Lost , ” the interview this Wednesday and Thursday in the Landmark - theatre .
For someone who is well - known for detailed interviews detests seems surprisingly busy jobs here in the explanation of his technological philosophies and business strategies .
And incredibly interesting .
In the course of the interview , it is four times to longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds Nachsinnen , in which jobs clearly weighed up his ideas and accuracy .
There are also moments when jobs , ” perfect to days when he apparently impatient Cringelys responded to questions and anschubst more quickly with issues or Nebenhandlungen of greater importance .
Before the era of Pixar , iPod or iPhone included seems the lost interview somehow incredibly far - sighted , if jobs assessed what other companies believes is right or wrong and his own vision for the future of the computer .
It is one thing to posthumous awards the career jobs ” to read , but jobs here as the greedy dreamers to see on the leap to the grandeur is something quite different , original and inspiring .
He has a vision of how things might be and should be .
Just after he has said all had , and he made it .
A quick glance at seven remarkable sequences of the lost interviews :
As he learned to do business :
“ Throughout the years in the business , I always ask : “ why are you doing things ? ” and the answer that you always have , is : “ oh , so it will be easy . ”
No one knows why he is doing what he is doing , no one in the business think very carefully about things .
I have found .
Jobs his efforts on the accounting for Apple to streamline .
Perplexed , such as cost record - usually began with “ Standardkosten ” at the mere suggestion put out , and then with the “ anomaly ” - it developed the automated factory , who ensured that the Geschäftskosten to micromanage being identified .
As the Pope veralbert :
Jobs told of the “ blue boxes ” that he has built with Steve Wozniak , a device which we have been in the telephone company slip and long - distance calls for nothing .
On the device much has already been written , but jobs enthusiasm , the blue as an act of Selbstbemächtigung describes is contagious .
He describes how he and Wozniak would test the box , making it a gebührenpflichtiges phone use , and then make a phone call from an AT & amp ; amp ; T network to another , while so many satellites as possible durchschleifen .
“ We sent about a half - dozen times around the globe and if we telephone grölte , there was a minute later in the telephone next door out ” , tells kichernd jobs .
“ We were young and we learned that we ourselves can make something that billions of dollars in infrastructure in the world can control . ”
Both of us , we did not know much , but we were able to build this little thing , which is a huge thing can control , that was an incredible lesson and I do not believe that without them , Apple would be .
Jobs told further away from a glorious gimmick , the Wozniak and he almost pulled out , as they are in the middle of the night via Blue Box in the Vatican phoning and with the Pope wanted to talk , while it as best they could , Henry Kissinger nachmachten .
As several members of the catholic hierarchy in the middle of the night , have been called in to deal with the american diplomats , had the two loslachen before the Pope himself up the phone .
As he has been in the technology verliebte ( and unprepared Bill Hewlett called ) :
At the age of 12 years ago , when he sought to spare parts , in order to build a Frequenzzähler , seeking to Bill Hewlett in telephone directory and called on it to .
Shortly after her 20 - minute telephone call received jobs for the summer work part - time at Hewlett - Packard .
“ This has had a remarkable influence on me ; it was the only company that I had seen in the age and it shaped my views about what a company was and how well his staff treated . ”
Later , Jobs one of the HP - the research laboratory of the company in Palo Alto , where he visited “ the first 's desktop computers , ever made ” .
It was the size of a suitcase , had a small screen with Braunscher Röhre and I verliebte me in it .
I would , if HP as a teenager and climb to the top of this machine , and programmes , they write .
How innovation improved :
Several times in the interview talking about jobs and about how to spontaneously inventing new products .
Early in his career , when he some einbaute situation , he was asked by a customer , the whole computers assemble them .
He was working with a payment of only 30 days and had both the assembly processes and the extradition of the ready - made equipment drawing board .
Later on , Apple he will recall the problems in the development of a Computermaus :
“ I remember very strong arguments … they screamed at me , that it would take five years to a mouse to build the $ 300 would cost ] and I went out and found a manufacturer . ”
90 days later we had a mouse , for $ 15 to construct . that was amazing credible .
On large companies that continue :
Long before he revived Apple , Jobs saw the ways in which so many industrial giants with their visions in stumbling and control over their shares lost .
“ We say , you are working with IBM or Xerox , so make a better Kopierer or printers , so what ? ”
You have the Aktienmonopol , so is the company was more successful .
Sales and marketing make it successful , so there are such people [ are ] at the end of the day , the companies and the product , with which the people from the decision - making process .
The Produktgenie , which led to this monopoly of the people who have no idea about good products versus bad products , wiped out - Handwerkskunst necessary .
That happened in Xerox …
Xerox had all the computer industry .
We have ten times more can be , the Microsoft of the 1990 's can be …
You have the defeat by the victory .
About innovation as an art form .
“ It 's a lot of Handwerkskunst between a great idea and a great product … if this great idea , they are changing and growing . ”
We are learning a lot about its nuances .
It must be votes , certain things that you can 't do , but electrons , glass , robots , factories .
We must see 5,000 terms , these concepts , and all of them together …
In the end , it amounts to the taste , what it comes down to is that we try to deal with the best stuff that people have created , and then tried to these matters to the together , what you do .
Picasso said that good artists copy , great artists steal .
We are always shamelessly steal in the grand ideas .
Part of what makes Macintosh great was made , that the people who work there , musicians , poets , artists , Zoologen , historians , who just happens to be the best computer scientists in the world .
It would not be in the computer business , they would have been in other areas of fantastic things .

Add to this the experience with the Spanish frenzy in complex Ausscheidungsspielen Eurocup and in the World Cup .
The Tico - footballers do , however , have a few international meetings in the framework of the Concacaf , the FIFA rankings on the bottom .
We will have to wait and see what the spanish team 's last register , the goalkeeper Iker Casillas , the last Saturday against England defeat ( 0 - 1 ) in London with 126 Auslandsspielen a level playing field with the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta .
Casillas will today against the dreifarbigen team play Spain and a new record of 127 Auslandsspielen .

Follow him Xabi Alonso with 91 , Fernando Torres with 90 , David Villa and Sergio Ramos both with 81 , Andrés Iniesta , Cesc Fábregas with 62 with 61 and David Silva with 53 .
From the Ticos and close to Michael Umaña are of the left - wing Seitenstürmer Júnior Díaz with 48 games and the striker Bryan Ruiz with 45 .
From there , only five to over 30 games : Keilor Navas with 31 , Randall Azofeifa with 32 , Michael Barrantes with 31 , Carlos Hernandez with 36 and José Luis López with 35 .
Those with the fewest games .
Less than 30 games , in the spanish team Gerard Piqué ( 37 ) , Sergio Busquets ( 36 ) , Santiago Santi Cazorla ( 32 ) , Álvaro Arbeloa ( 31 ) and Raúl Albiol ( 31 ) .
From the national team come to less than 30 games Roy Miller with 26 , Winston parks with 26 , Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23 .
The rest is not even the 1920s - border .
While Nacho Moreal only four Games , and Jordi Alba two , recorded in Costa Rica Víctor Bolivar only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson had its debut not yet .
The historic gate - keepers of Spain is David Villa with 50 Treffern , followed by Fernando Torres with 27 .
For Costa Rica , Bryan Ruiz with nine most gates opened fire , two more than Carlos Hernandez and three more than Roy Myrie and parks .

How a lie exposed
A look at today 's headlines shows how serious and widespread fraud and lie in day - to - day life .
The republican nominee for president , Herman Cain , is busy , and allegations of sexual harassment by several women Mr. both sides accuse each other of lying .
The leadership of Penh State is the Meineids accused , since they are supposedly reports has withheld , under which a retired Footballtrainer sexually abused young boys .
In the last week has been on an open microphone mitangehört , as the French President Nicolas Sarkozy to the US President Barack Obama to claimed that the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar .
Lies destroy careers , shaking countries .
The New York congressman and Internetexhibitionist Anthony Weidner was kidding when he Verleugnungen - the very quickly by incontrovertible evidence refuted .
The former presidential candidate John Edwards is the violations in the Kampagnenfinanzierung accused in connection with the cover - up of an extramarital affair .
And then , of course , no one forgets that it has experienced the media circus , the President Bill Clinton , when he during his second term in office in the Oval Office about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky lied .
Stories about Schummeln in school and college tests are widespread .
There have been incidents in which teachers to their students the Prüfungsantworten set so that they themselves in their Leistungsüberprüfungen well launched .
Mentors , the opposite teach should send a message that lies and Schummeln okay .
How much deception we see ?
As studies show , lie us every day between 10 and 200 times .
Many of these lies , but as lies .
Another study shows that strangers each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting of lying to us .
Lies to see or “ lies ” is a highlight , to learn for every human being is important , both for personal and also for professional reasons .
Far from a parlor game such as Scharaden away , where the goal is , “ who you ! ” , this is a deception Enttarnen a serious knowledge , based on scientific data over the past six decades of prestigious universities have been collected , the wide - ranging research projects , particularly in the fields of psychology and physiology .
The result of the research is that most of the old myths about the lies exposed .
Lies a look in the eye .
You stottern , suffused with zappeln stammeln , and not always .
This may , however , are not that this liar difficult to detect and expose .
An experienced Lügenenttarner can penetrate the truth , when he heard about the structure of the claim , the subtle Gesichtsausdrücke , and timing is learning .
I have a couple of years spent the scientific results of the broad and ever - growing area of the passport to investigate , and it is clear that the Enttarnen a deception a modern ability is easy to understand , and we in the Zurechtfinden in our complex world helps , especially if the closing or the questioning of people or negotiations or management to their own professional responsibilities .
Good liar are very good , other people to assess their interests and their own emotions to dominate and they intuitively sense that other perceived to be .
Thanks to the research , we know the extrovertierte people more often than people lying introvertierte that men are more likely to have “ selbstorientierte ” lies serving up than women , whose lies more in other “ follow ” - in the rule so that they want to protect the feelings that married people lying to their partners less often than unmarried people ( but the lies that they tell lies , are usually “ fat ” ) .
We also know that , if a person has been exposed as a culprit , others are less feel guilty , this person to have lied .
As you can see whether someone is lying ?
The first , by the normal behaviour that person .
This is known as the “ Baselining ” , the starting point .
It is a point of reference for the future assessment of changes .
You are watching the attitude , the laughter , the Stimmqualität their trial .
You should know better , when someone is normally constantly walking along , so that they do not unfairly , if it during a meetings with the foot along .
Then you look at accumulations striking verbal and nonverbaler behaviour .
When you look at these accumulations , the alarm bells ringing , not as proof of a passport .
People who deceive bogged down , perhaps , to try to their history , to recall , perhaps , their feet in the direction of the door or reject it in terms of the outcome , change their position in a significant way or show a “ relaxation after the Einstellungsgespräch ” , that deep , entspannende Ausatmen and the change in the attitude , if all the hard questions are over .
Asking the signal often wrongly , that a Einstellungsgespräch is over , only to this relaxation after the Einstellungsgespräch .
You also look at the language you trial .
By Scott Peterson is famous , when he used the past tense when he claimed that his wife was killed on the live and a national search for her .
People can also be deceptive distanzierende language : “ I did not have sexual relations with that woman … Miss Lewinsky ” or if there is a question repeated knifflige in its entirety .
The most frequent verbal signs are subtle .
Some people use “ qualifying language ” when they knifflige a question to answer is : “ now … to tell you the truth … as far as I know … in good faith . ”
In this way , the response will be more wahrnehmend as objectively , which often set the alarm bells ringing .
There is no Zaubermittel to Enttarnen of lies , but we can learn skills , thanks to a passport is possible .
Thanks to these skills , anyone can fall prey to fraudsters are rare , both in the private - as in the workplace .

What was lacking the candidate del Valle to the new Miss Colombia ?
Analysis of the factors that impact that Melina Ramírez Serna the crown of Miss Colombia could not get .
El Valle receives his 14 . Misstitel .
Once again , Valle del Cauca empty in the award of the crown for Miss Colombia .
This time , Melina Ramírez Serna , on the Gewinnerpodium , a Silberkrone and the bond , which it as the new Miss Colombia , addiction .
With the result that night received in Cartagena , where Miss Atlántico the crown and the Zeder in itself , is already on the 's Department of 14 Misstitel and Melina is linked to the legion of Valle del Cauca , the crown almost in the hands of . proclaimed to the Misses include : Miriam Ospina Benoit ( 1947 ) , Clara Domínguez Borrero ( 1949 ) , Patricia Bellini Ayala ( 1979 ) , Lorena Álvarez ( 1981 ) , Rose Mary Alzate ( 1983 ) , Olga María Arenas ( 1987 ) , Leila Blanque ( 1988 ) , Mónica Evers ( 1989 ) , María Consuela Pinedo ( 1990 ) , Diana Isabel Romero ( 1993 ) , Giselle Garcés Aljure ( 2000 ) , Catalina Giraldo ( 2007 ) , Stephanie Garcés Aljure ( 2008 ) .
The big question that arises today , many are asking is : what was lacking ?
Because the result is in line with the decline of a large , the favorite in each trial had shown that they have everything for the new Miss Colombia . will not be in vain to Queen of the police force and for Mejor Rostro Jolie of Vogue was elected to the title , the Schönheitsköniginnen Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro had received , and the crown of Miss Colombia took home .
The first factor that is as crucial for the decision by the jury , the first Miss to appoint , is that it is the answer to the question , “ what kind of book , you most and why ? ” from Murillo Martín Gómez of the Carreta Literaria Leamos , who were not convinced .
The young woman from the author of Valle del Cauca replied :
“ I read a lot , I think quite to the literature , I believe it is a kind of a civilised , ultimately , I believe that the book , most of my childhood , the “ small ” Prince is a very deep book .
At the moment I read “ guilt and atonement . ” it is a book of universal culture that we all should read . I just read a book by Irene Nemirovski , a russian girl , a wonderful book , “ passions ' says .
A response that did not like , firstly because of the term “ civilise 'and secondly , because it was not specific , had declared in what way each of her book , “ they had .
But after the conclusion of the ceremony said Melina , calm and to feel happy with the result , “ the universe is wise , it is done and what has to happen .
And for all the people ask : lest a little “ small Prince . ” it is a great book .
Among other things , it is said that the darling of El Valle is high .
A journalist from Bogota suggested that the fact that it was the Bevorzugte , all of which Beifälle einheimste and in the run - up to all get prices ( catering competition , Oster Publikumsabstimmung on the best handgeschneiderte dressed and Reina Madre ) , “ the other candidates are jealous had made , what the Queen stresste , which therefore on the stage not shine . ”
And it noted in her first presentation to the swimming on the shore of the Hilton Hotel and its two elevators in the Krönungsfeier .
Although they both appeared safe , but it lacked the strength and momentum , the representatives of the Magdalena and Atlántico displayed .
Ariel Osorio , a journalist of the programme “ Como en Casa ” in the channel RCN said that the fact that Melina to been crowned Miss , “ shows that the candidate , the competition during the most prices wins , ultimately not Queen ” .
Valle was also at the end of the press from the way - a mistake .
Another hypothesis is that the Valle Jurie about their interest in the social work not convince , which ultimately the essence of the national beauty contest .
There must be a reason that two days before the make - up of the international jury Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman who is the social affairs of their country .
“ Beauty alone is enough for Miss Colombia . we need to look beyond the Körperliche , focusing on the social sense to focus on the fact that they are already taking part in the competition had worked on projects , ” she said .
There is also speculation that Valle with their defects of the Derriere and the fibrosis , is in the Magengegend said , had sinned . but this is inconsistent , because the jury chose it as a candidate for “ natural beauty ” with a healthy body , good eating habits and good physical work .
The coach of the queens , Hernán Jorge Orozco , admits that Melina not the best body , that it would be better , “ but their problem with the fibrosis in the belly , which for me to be honest hard to say was , put their scoring on the last day . ”
In the meantime , the journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos the view that the mistake the woman of Valle del Cauca , the surgery , which they had been subjected to .
“ Operations are : ok , but Valle did not know how they can do it properly .
Your body is never a strong side here , and she has had to pay . ”
Because of this prize , which was the first time the national beauty contest that arose after the appearance in swimming a cruel to forecast the true in the night . it has been getuschelt that Raymundo Melina a consolation prize , so they do not benefit from the crown .
Regardless of whether it is true or not , the fact is that their Herrschaftsjahr Melina from today , not as the Queen , but as a Princess , a position that will , on naming the national beauty contest Colombia in one of the international competitions .
But will it as one of the Queen , which despite its overwhelming outburst of Cartagena , escaped the crown was to go down in history .

Urgent warnings from the Pentagon from possible cuts in the defence
Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta fueled the Congress on Monday , when he is warned that automatic budget cuts will weaken national security unnoticed , he delivered a financial chain reaction in the halls of the Pentagon 'to the battlefields of Afghanistan and the civilian conveyor belts .
The Pentagon has already carefully cuts to the tune of $ 450 billion over the next decade , but now fear that further cuts to $ 600 trillion or more will be needed if the Congress does not end up in the spending .
“ The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry , ” Panetta wrote in a letter to the republican senators John McCain , of Arizona , and Lindsey Graham , South Carolina .
He said that a failure of Congress in achieving a Budgetvereinbarung , leading to a so - called seizure , would lead to 23 % across - the - board cuts and an end to many new projects .
“ Such a high level of reduction , carried out in such ill - considered way , most of our ship - building projects and unviable , you can not three - quarters of a ship or buy a building and other efforts to modernize seriously harm , ” Panetta wrote to the senators .
“ We would also be forced to part us from a large part of our civilian staff to separate and , since the reduction as soon would be implemented , we would have almost certainly kinds of civilians , the goal is to be achieved . ”
“ These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and our alert seriously damage . ”
The cuts were , in the end , the combat forces take , ” said Panetta .
“ While the Kriegszeitkontingente in the war on terrorism , by the seizure are not directly affected , the serious interference in the Grundbudget the Kriegsbemühungen adversely affect , ” Panetta warned .
“ Recruitment were to be cut back , leading to delays in the attitudes and the Einstellungsaufsicht , supporting the war . ”
“ The salaries of the staff would be cut , with late payments to Kriegszeithändler leads and the legal and political support would be disrupted . ”
The two senators said Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details about the potential impact of the automatic cuts to the Ministry of Defense .
“ The consequences of a seizure of the Department of Defense would be a rapid decline of the United States as the world 's leading military power in the world . ”
“ We are strongly against these draconian action , ” the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon , they Panettas letter published .
“ This is a result with which we can not live , and it is certainly none of us should impose . ”
“ The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United Statten and their commitment should not be allowed . ”
Whether Panettas letter and the new warnings of the senators the pressure on a compromise on the budget will increase or demands will increase the Pentagon cuts , remains to be seen .
Panetta has become increasingly outspoken about the possible cuts , even though he has many years of experience in the budget in Congress and in the White House , before he was the head of the Pentagon 'came , and I know that he is facing tough decisions .
At a press conference last week , the defense minister malte a gloomy picture , which might face a military shell , but without a core .
“ It is a ship without sailors . ”
“ It is a brigade without ammunition . ”
“ It is an air - without enough trained pilots . ”
“ It is a paper tiger , an army of barracks , buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers who are in a position to the mission , ” Panetta said in his opening address to the Pentagon .
“ It is a force of morality and alert and is not in a position to provide it with potential opponents . ”
“ You can be a really angry . ”
In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham led Panetta new details , such as reductions of “ significant operational risks creating : delays in times of crisis , conflicts and disasters , serious constraints on our global work and Eingreiffähigkeit , leading to an unacceptable risk in future Kriegsoperationen leading . ”
And Panetta said that some of the biggest Verteidigungsprojekte the removal could fall victim , including those that already have been tested and are already in the early stage of planning .
That list includes the fighter pilots F35 Joint Strike Fighter , a proposed new Bombenflugzeug , the next generation of ballistic submarines , the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new Bodenkampffahrzeug , the Army and Navy , in need of the Humvee to replace .
The further development and testing of the F35 stop , it would in the next 10 years , up to save $ 80 billion , but the supporters say , an important next step in the build - up is , so that potential dangers posed by China and other opponents can be averted .

Park or mountain ?
The architects , in addition to the bickering over the fees with the tender .
The urban tender on the 16 gates opened the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona anew .
In the mid - 1980 's , at the peak of the now disappeared Spanish Metropolitana de Barcelona ( CMB ) , published this administration their Schmähschrift on the promotion of Collserola .
The brochure described the mountain as a huge Park in Barcelona city .
He was even in figures with the Central Park in New York .
With the demise of the CMB in 1987 , the Park , in the eyes of many again to the ceiling of Barcelona , as the capital of Catalonia is one of the few who are not in the North - South spread , but upwards ( mountains ) and down ( Sea ) .
The classification Collserolas as natural park plays with this idea .
As an example , served is no longer the Central Park , but Yellowstone with wild boar in the role of the Yogibärs .
So far , it was , as the city in September a Riesenausschreibung , consisting of 16 competitions , for further Zugangstore after Collserola .
No doubt , a gateway to the concept of a park .
Either that , or someone , gates into the country .
The question is : Collserola , parks or mountain ?
The announcement is not only from organizational point of view , but also in terms of a reflection on the city of the topic of discussion in the mouths of all architects from Barcelona .
It is almost a rekurrentes issue that two members of the old eingesessenen caste , which is in the lift , can turn .
And it is this fact is the stuff of one of the rare common ground between what three architects from Barcelona , think about it , and some university professors , on the project .
Miguel Roldán , Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona : the tender is appropriate .
“ It is necessary for Roldán , ” after the attack on the coast on the “ front of the mountains ” , as far as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda , on the green apples , not pregnancy .
“ We should start from the principle that Barcelona is the greatest Park beach .
Among other things , because it is easily accessible .
Collserola is more complex , ” judging from the architect , for the title of “ the gates of Collserola ” a “ collective ” case : we must not “ as access to a park , but as a ring - fencing of areas in which we need to act . ”
Modol , as Roldán and Bayona with urban experience , viewed the proposal as a “ intellectual challenge , ” the “ some risks ” .
Risks from the “ uncertainty , the creation of a public space today brings with it ” , according to the experience in the 1980 's , in the area of the Forum of their “ swan song . ”
The first fear is the limit on what must be developed .
“ This limit always means , the next step ” , i. e. it .
“ We must think about new urban planning tools , because the current [ with reference to the plan General Metropolitano ( PGM ) ] can become a real catastrophe . ”
Modol , which is close to the issue , says simplified , the side of Collserola towards Vallesana is , “ can be understood as a park , in the sense of not Barcelona ” , and for purely topografischen reasons .
Modol recalls that it has a study by the Patronat de Collserola that are not “ should fall on deaf ears , ” though he is grateful to the town hall that his body the opportunity in this project “ from the outset . ”
In addition , it says that the proximity of the mountain to the town of Geleitbrief is that it allows the architects , participate in the debate , even though he “ doubts ” to say whether this technical profile the first launched in multidisciplinary teams ( “ exactly the right , ” he says “ we should guide ) architects should only be a tool . ”
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the title of the article is complex , as in the offering of a global view of Collserola lacked : “ there were 16 competitions in the cross - section of advertised , ” he says , “ on the axis mountains - sea , but there are no Längsschnittperspektive the area seen in its entirety . ”
That has , at least in his case that led it to the 16 competitions .
Otherwise , the programme and the definition of a project for a goal with the architect of the Tors also clash .
In his view , should the city a guarantee that the strip of directly on the Dalt de Ronda , in all its length so that a soft transition between the town and the green belt .

Europe 's most beautiful pools
Leap into the blue
Julie Stanek
Planschbecken in Ufo - visual intrusion , Prunkpools in Budapest : who travel through Europe , may be a result of see - and after a Städtetour or a wandering the tired legs in Sprudelbädern rest .
A book shows where promotion in the water on the most beautiful .
If iris Meder over the past year and a half to Recherchereise was , one in her luggage not : their swimming .
Rücklings on the water , lying , they looked high in elaborately shaped domes , they swim marble - Putten , contrary to the most Beckenrand they waited , and staunte on meticulously restored Jugendstilschwimmhallen .
Like a bad , they took it in great haste in their Notizbuch on - with wissenswerten details on the construction and history of the building .
More than 200 swimming pools erkundete Architekturhistorikerin Meder in this way , and it is now just in her book “ Badefreuden ” : Volksschwimmhallen in Munich , historic Badepaläste in the Black Forest , “ hardcore ” Betonbauten in Taunus .
By 13 countries , it introduced its “ trip to the most extraordinary bathrooms in Central Europe ” : in addition to Germany , Austria and Switzerland they visited places in Italy , France , the Czech Republic , Slovakia , Slovenia , Hungary , Romania , Poland , and each year a city in Luxembourg , Serbia and Croatia .
The 46 - year - old german is a real Badekultur - Enthusiastin .
With sport have little hat on , says Meder - just in the water is different .
Annoying only that Schwimmfans with blue Kacheln Chlorgestank and have to accept , while the smell of Jogger betörenden Fichtenwäldern inhale or happy already in the park to listen to .
“ I have one day asked why swimming pools are always so must be ugly , ” says the Meder living in Vienna .
“ So I began to fine pools to collect . ”
Mains doubled architecture
Geplätscher in Sprungbecken and essential oils sauna - the Wellnessfaktor in bathrooms is so great , because all sense , so Meder .
And if the builders of trouble , can be a real Schwimmhallen Augenschmaus : “ instead of a Fußbodens bathrooms has a surface . ”
“ On the one hand , it is transparent , reflects on the other hand , but the beauty of the entire building . ”
All doubles look : high vaults , colorful Kacheln , Sprungbretter .
The “ kleinformatige Bildband Badefreuden ” gives to 190 Wissenswertes sides on the architecture and cultural history of historic promotion - oases but above all an appetite for a leap in the blue .
Remarkable copies discovered the pools Sammlerin Meder with her research in Hungary .
In addition to magnificent Heilbädern as the 100 - year - old Széchenyi - it was a bad in Budapest nitrathaltiges waters in a urigen Karsthöhle ( Höhlenbad in Miskolc - Tapolca ) , as well as an Thermalbad , whose basin alkalihaltigem were filled with water and is in a flaschenförmigen building ( Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény ) .
Spectacular prospects , on the other hand , provide many districts Freibäder in Switzerland and Austria : while the Zurich Dachbad the entire city , in a Außenpool Bads in St. Anton on the covered Arlberg look - and in the Dampfbad : there is a window , from which it the flow on the ski runway can monitor .
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool - design expects beach in Längenfeld : the Ötztal Aquadome looks like a particularly in the Alps gelandetes Ufo .
From three to open the peel dampft it in the winter , while in the background , the mountains of Ötztals stand out in the sky .
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in any swimming pool , the pool - Sammlerin Meder the smell of chlorine in the nose .
Many thermal spas smelt sulphur , after the Árpád - bath in the hungarian Békescsaba smell it is so much for fuel oil , which is difficult to believe , in a Gesundheitsbad landed .
The smell is coming from the alkali - hydrogenkarbonathaltigen medicinal waters , almost black , and whose silt a stain on the skin , as soon as it is sliding into the pool , a promotion - a special kind of .
In one place , iris Meder in their search for beautiful bathing , however , also disappointed : the free - and in the czech Sonnenbad bad Luhatschowitz wanted to visit , it was a abgesperrtes terrain .
The 1902 - designed by the architects Dušan Jurkovic bad has since been closed .
As Meder look verwitterten through the window of the red - and - white - yellow building Jugendstil - raised her , like weeds between the Fliesen has grown .
The drop has addressed it , on the other hand , turning in a swimming pool in the Black Forest : the Palais made in Wildbad bad .
Three construction schedules , this bad already ; discover you can not only neoromanische elements from moments of its construction in 1844 , but also a maurische warehouse in the Alhambra - style , in 1900 added .
Since the careful modernisation in 1995 , the Palais made the Lieblingsbad the pool knowledge iris Meder - and not just because they had originated in the Black Forest .
“ It is quite an achievement , as various Baustile at such a wonderful unity to merge , ” says Meder .
In such a palace is the Tauchgang in Thermalpool appear to be beside the point .

The CDU is proposing that the EU president due to general vote to choose
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democrats ( CDU on Monday , November 14 , in Leipzig , for Angela Merkel , Chancellor and head of the christian democratic party , without any real difficulties .
The future of Europe was not included in the programme , but , in the autumn of enforced , particularly those activists would be enough to make the government policy with regard to the Greeks today and possibly Italy tomorrow as too lax .
In the Bureau Präsidentschaftsantrag proposed by the European Commission was almost unanimously adopted .
Under 1001 delegates had only nine voted against it , ten had abstained from the vote .
The several minutes - long standing ovation , on the basis of their first Interventionserlässen Angela Merkel , as well as a few hours later , Wolfgang Schäuble , lieβen from the three Euro - minded finance minister , no doubt .
The Hauptidee the Chancellor , as well as the subsequent Antrage slogan : the answer to the crisis is “ not less , but more Europe . ”
Not only because Europe peace means , but also as “ nine million jobs directly from the euro are dependent on . ”
For the Chancellor is “ the time for a breakthrough in Europe ” .
This could be through more control of the European Union reinforcing overhaul of the Lisbon Treaty on the budgetary policy of the countries in the euro zone to come , as well as it could , however , in the election of the president of the European Commission , on the basis of a general vote lead ” to Europe a face ” .
However , this is definitely one of the approved by Congress , which clearly Antragsvorschläge Wolfgang Schäuble godfather .
Certainly , it is unlikely that the 47 soon on this revolution : some Groβ - Britain , is opposed to the cause , and the Leitenden believe the Christian Democratic Union ( CDU ) to know that Nicolas Sarkozy is the same opinion .
The milestone , however .
Likewise , the delegates in a vast majority of the proposal of the weighting of any country in the ECB 's Governing Board in accordance with the weighting of the individual economies , rejected what appears to be a more powerful the position of Germany .
The playing of the climate within their party of rediscovering the German Chancellor has therefore points of reference to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl . it has , however , is no longer the Congress at the expense of the “ small ” or in difficulties european countries to win , the delay in Germany are criticising arrogant .
As far as the Europe - request the relevance of the “ Franco - german ” a clause , calls on Angela Merkel France not to the plan .
At least not directly .
Because this serves as a reminder that , Leipzig two centuries ago in the centre of a bloody battle .
In fact , one of the zuhöchst humiliating defeats the Napoleonic army .
