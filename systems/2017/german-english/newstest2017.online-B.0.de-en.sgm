<seg id="1">28-year-old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall</seg>
<seg id="2">A 28-year-old cook, who recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in the stairs of a local shopping center.</seg>
<seg id="3">The victim's brother said that he could not imagine anyone who wanted to harm him. "At last he went uphill again."</seg>
<seg id="4">The corpse found in the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as the twenty-eight-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, said the San Francisco court medical department.</seg>
<seg id="5">The San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as murder and the investigation is ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="6">The brother of the victim, Louis Galicia, informed the ABS transmitter KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a chef in Boston, had managed his dream job as a chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.</seg>
<seg id="7">A spokesman for the Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and devastated" about his death.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss him painfully," the speaker continued.</seg>
<seg id="9">Our thoughts and condolences are with Frank's family and friends during this difficult time.</seg>
<seg id="10">Louis Galicia stated that Frank initially lived in hostels, but that "things were finally going uphill for him."</seg>
<seg id="11">"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend," Louis Garcia said.</seg>
<seg id="12">Louis Galicia said that he could not imagine anyone who wanted to harm his younger brother.</seg>
<seg id="13">He was a friendly person with a big heart.</seg>
<seg id="14">Combining his style with his family has always been to cook us something for us, "said Louis Galicia.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never wanted to participate in any kind of argument.</seg>
<seg id="16">He was the brother who swam with the stream.</seg>
<seg id="17">"In everything that goes wrong in the world, he was this unpolished diamond that shone brightly every day," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone who has information on the case will be asked to call the SFPD telephone number at 415-575-4444.</seg>

<seg id="2">Jennifer Aniston does not always have to be perfect or successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Hollywood star has now made it clear in an interview.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I'm always stuck in drawers or get labels from outside, which have little to do with me and the reality."</seg>
<seg id="5">"I do not want to be perfect and successful."</seg>
<seg id="6">"Honestly, these things are more of a snap to me."</seg>
<seg id="7">Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh at the fact that she is considered a "Miss Perfect", as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan".</seg>
<seg id="8">The actress likes to spend her time at home, in front of television with a loose dump and Mexican food, says the magazine.</seg>
<seg id="9">To the incandescence, she asked the question: "We women do not have to be married or have children to be perfect," the Hollywood star said.</seg>
<seg id="10">In her new film "Mother's Day", Aniston is seen as a single mother of two sons.</seg>
<seg id="11">The film will take place from August 25th.</seg>

<seg id="1">Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid</seg>
<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golfing tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer looked for a bit of variety with a few colleagues and a ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "Golden Sportpyramide" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">After a few minutes, the horses remembered on their evening's eve, and they hunted home to the feeding troughs in the fast gallop.</seg>
<seg id="7">One kilometer at this rate, I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It was not a good experience," says Langer.</seg>
<seg id="9">And then the riding career ended again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament victories - was again close to horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He and his family ran across the ALRV, and he did not even swing on a horse for photographic purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Langer was the first time in Aachen and thus also with the CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports aid handed over the Golden Sportpyramide to the man from Anhausen in the context of a small gala.</seg>
<seg id="15">The sympathetic athlete is not lacking in awards.</seg>
<seg id="16">Federal Tour Cross, Silver Laurel Leaf, Champions Tour Player of the Year ...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen has already ennobled him.</seg>
<seg id="18">Langer is the 18th prize winner of the Sportpyramide.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Aachen he met the first prize-winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="20">"This award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it is awarded not only for sporting success but also for social commitment".</seg>
<seg id="21">Langer has been supporting the new generation for decades.</seg>
<seg id="22">And so he gave the prize money of 25,000 euros the same.</seg>
<seg id="23">With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time US-champion was taken to the "Hall of Fame of German Sports" on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the gymnasts Eberhard Gienger, the fencers Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the rudder Peter-Michael Kolbe, the bob driver Meinhard Nehmer, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumping rider Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumous handball player Erhard Wunderlich.</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="26">After the official part the illustrious company went to the jumping stadium, where the Lavazza prize was running.</seg>
<seg id="27">Bernhard Langer kept distance from the big animals.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clintons and Trumps Economic Policy Compared: It's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and preventing the trade agreement TTP - this is what both Clinton and Trump want.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential candidates are in the tax and energy policy as well as in a principle question.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical, difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">The, about the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep the doubt small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and to death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, says Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will massively cut back on regulations, and he is making a strong tax reform with lower tax rates strong - for private individuals and for businesses.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton, on the other hand, says: "The state has certain tasks, it has to open up disadvantaged opportunities and needs money for it.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why the tax would be increased for the rich, she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">Trump and Clinton say almost word-for-word.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Democratic candidate even announced the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in infrastructure are classical democratic policy and are strictly rejected by the state-critical Teaparty wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">At Trump, there might be party-internal discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are clearer.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and boost coal production in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil subsidies should also be possible in protected areas so far, he wants to terminate the Paris climate protection agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton, on the other hand, wants to expand renewable energy with its investment program and calls: "A country will be the supermarket of clean energy and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"It will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be us."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in terms of infrastructure, but also in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpacific trade agreement, does not want to sign either.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, however, both do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply protect American jobs better.</seg>
<seg id="25">They are also to be paid for better, says Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $ 7.25 is a hunger wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: The minimum wage has to go up, then he says he should not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months is probably more about the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand there is Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens, to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">Its critics insist that the budget deficit would be even greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least the rich to demand that they pay more taxes, and their critics say: More taxes are not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="1">Escape: "Every fugitive woman has experience with sexual violence"</seg>
<seg id="2">Sexual violence is almost everyday life for women who are fleeing alone.</seg>
<seg id="3">When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house provides refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">Four women are sitting in a large kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each has a baby that is at most one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son in the arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks curiously into the room with big eyes.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother is staring at the table.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until she realizes she's being watched.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles briefly and kisses the little one.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene is normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">She is the area manager of Condrobs, a social aid provider in Bavaria, and is also concerned with women on the run.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are fugitives.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralized accommodations for all-women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January, Condrobs set up the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid.</seg>
<seg id="18">Recently, it was officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are no men - neither as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guardman outside the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"It is no exaggeration to say that every woman who arrives here has had experiences with sexual violence on her flight," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they face torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as a hope-bearer," she says.</seg>
<seg id="24">In women, there are other reasons for the escape: "Many steal themselves stealthily because they see no other way out".</seg>
<seg id="25">In their homeland, they have had experience with sexual violence, forced marriage, honor murder, slavery, or compulsive prostitution.</seg>
<seg id="26">This drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run, this continues.</seg>
<seg id="28">"That tugs, for example, demand a sexual action for a bottle of water is not a rarity," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">Who believes that the end, as soon as they arrive in Germany, is wrong, says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="31">Again, single women in refugee shelters would often be regarded as inferior and, at worst, abused.</seg>
<seg id="32">As a result, around 90 percent of women living in the north of Munich are traumatized, she says.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Some of the children have certainly not been born voluntarily".</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so accustomed to saying nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Or they do not dare to speak openly about the experience, because the shame is too great."</seg>
<seg id="36">Since they often would not be able to help, they need more accommodation only for them, Bahr asks.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for housing refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">When asked whether they knew about a project similar to that in Munich, some responded with no.</seg>
<seg id="39">In Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in government accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="40">Even in Swabia alone fled women are not separately housed, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press secretary of the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Oberbayern, Unter- und Mittelfranken, there are floors or houses in some community accommodation only for single women and their children.</seg>
<seg id="42">The exception is Niederbayern, where there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be placed separately from men.</seg>
<seg id="44">In a study published for the Committee, "It is very important that men and women are housed separately."</seg>
<seg id="45">"If the privacy is lacking, or if men and women are brought together, there can be - ongoing" violence against women ".</seg>
<seg id="46">Especially the washrooms should be separate and accessible to women, is the study.</seg>
<seg id="47">The extent to which women feel this need for protection can be seen in the rush of the house in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Since we got around, we have a long queue," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="49">You could easily open a second house.</seg>

<seg id="2">Representatives of the medical assistants have called on their trade union to approve new labor measures in their disputes regarding a new treaty.</seg>
<seg id="3">The British Medical Association's (JDC) Junior Doctors Committee (BMA) has called on its entire Council to approve more work measures from the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC said that ministers had neglected to address concerns about the Treaty.</seg>
<seg id="5">In July, medical assistants and medical students voted on the rejection of a contract, which was agreed with the BMA.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of his members, who voted in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a letter to the members, which was published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government had remained "persistently calm" to problems, which led to the contract being rejected.</seg>
<seg id="8">She said, "In view of this, the JDC Board has voted to completely reject the proposed new treaty and to request official renegotiations for all your concerns."</seg>
<seg id="9">In response to the silence of the government, the JDC Board has today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing program of escalating workflights, which begins in early September.</seg>
<seg id="10">The disputes led to the fact that medical assistants were striking six times this year, the first total failures in the history of the NHS.</seg>
<seg id="11">The head of the BMA's assistant physician Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed terms of the contract, which had been recommended by the BMA.</seg>
<seg id="12">He informed BMA members during the meetings, which were held before the vote by 54,000 assistants and medical students, that the contract should be advantageous and accepted.</seg>
<seg id="13">After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for doctors in England would be compulsorily introduced.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: An "Alliance of Outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end to the eight-month-long war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I can not deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the hand, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile seemed to be narrow-necked, and he barely radiated warmth, even for his reserved circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but would even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper described Erdogan as if nothing bad had happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me his enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiant, lasting coolness showed that Russia's headmaster had not forgotten anything.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory remarks: the shooting of a Russian combat aircraft on the Syrian frontier through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was fierce.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin said, accusing Ankara of falling behind Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offense was even greater because it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Reconcile confidence will be difficult, if not impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media launched a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">Most seriously, the allegations of senior officials were that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from illegal oil trade in Syrian territories controlled by the so-called Islamic state.</seg>
<seg id="22">He vehemently denied this.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan, which he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia was able to score a victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the benefits of a truce are clear.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan needs first and foremost all the friends he can get after he has almost been deprived of his office last month in a failed state coup.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights, which each year usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, state TV forecasted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports were allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">A report in Vedemosti put it as follows: "Tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry with the West because it sees its response to the attempted seizure of power as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">In addition, there is the ongoing resentment over the snail tempo of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is keen to benefit from the cool mood and to reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian state secretary certainly won in Ankara a bonus for the fact that after the attempted coup he demanded support for the elected state organs.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a self-evident fact for Moscow, which itself has a profound fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this splendid palace by the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey, as an analyst once described, to depict the "alliance of outsiders": two countries that are offended by the West and feel badly treated and are now allying.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played a role as a peace-builder, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after nearly three hours of initial talks, both presidents at the press conference said they had not even touched the issue.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey intentionally avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize this.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator to Syria can be found.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a complete disaster, as NATO member Turkey shot the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state at least talk again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available to customers outside of Scotland</seg>
<seg id="2">According to the board of the bank, the RBS brand is only to be reduced to a backoffice role.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bank has since distanced itself, when it had almost collapsed and had to be saved eight years ago.</seg>
<seg id="6">During this time, branded "RBS" brands have been used to protect other end-consumer financial brands.</seg>
<seg id="7">She supported international sports with millions of pounds of sponsorship, from the Six Nations Rugby to the Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.</seg>
<seg id="8">But now it has decided to focus more national brands.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland but will not be initialized.</seg>
<seg id="10">In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralized headquarters and the stock exchange listing will switch to NatWest.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are other smaller brands for the retail business that will get more importance - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.</seg>
<seg id="13">McEwan was interviewed by customers and employees in Inverness-shire during an inspection tour.</seg>
<seg id="14">He told BBC Scotland: "The RSB brand will become our investor brand and the brand under which our employees will be employed, as we are now becoming a bank of brands."</seg>
<seg id="15">When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.</seg>
<seg id="16">I now say that we are not pursuing global goals but local objectives.</seg>
<seg id="17">Each of these brands will be completely different in their own communities, and our employees will work with customers under these brands.</seg>
<seg id="18">RBS has already said that it will not continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the perceptibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship.</seg>
<seg id="19">"It is time for us to develop into the Bank of Brands, because how do we focus on the internal (we have asked) to make it a better bank for customers," said the CEO.</seg>
<seg id="20">It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands.</seg>
<seg id="21">But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think you will see many changes.</seg>
<seg id="22">We can launch these brands again, so I think the time has come.</seg>

<seg id="2">Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket, which brings him 3,000th win</seg>
<seg id="3">The jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="4">He set a milestone on Predilection, which is trained by John Gosden, on his local race track with his second win of the night.</seg>
<seg id="5">The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in the flat race.</seg>
<seg id="6">He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry, and Willie Carson.</seg>
<seg id="7">The three-time winner Dettori, who previously won Ghayyar, said, "It's something special."</seg>
<seg id="8">I am very emotional because my family is here as well</seg>
<seg id="9">I am very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday night with 20,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I am relieved and very humble.</seg>
<seg id="12">Dettori takes the rejoicing as he takes the victory on Predilection</seg>
<seg id="13">Two jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jockey Richard Johnson and the retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who scored more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.</seg>
<seg id="14">Lester Piggott, the nine-time Derbysieger, had 4.493 career bonuses</seg>
<seg id="15">Frankie is one of the best jugglers of the modern age and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that few have reached before him.</seg>
<seg id="16">He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.</seg>
<seg id="17">He is a fantastic ambassador for races, his enthusiasm and charisma has inspired fans for years for this sport.</seg>
<seg id="18">I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he already had 6,000 gains, if he were not just a weekend and big tournament jockey!</seg>
<seg id="19">Frankie has already won almost 30 years in GB, which is great.</seg>
<seg id="20">He has a living personality, which is good for a British race, but he is also an incredible jockey.</seg>
<seg id="21">Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount</seg>
<seg id="22">From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the flag of the British open-air race for two decades.</seg>
<seg id="23">It was nerve-racking.</seg>
<seg id="24">A whole lot of big tournament winnings, including his famous "Glorious Seven" 1996 in Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and got a drug ban.</seg>
<seg id="25">Three years ago he had difficulties at first when he returned from his six-month suspension, but he showed an impressive strength of character to defy his doubters and return to his best form.</seg>
<seg id="26">And he is far from the end - Dettori once said that he wants to continue his competitions up to at least 50 years of age.</seg>

<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed Special Envoy for Environmental and Transport Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a statement from the Kremlin it is stated that Putin had ordered "the dismissal of Ivanov from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration, without stating reasons."</seg>

<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital of Tallinn, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin's website (in Russian), he was later to be the secretary of the government and the head of the government.</seg>
<seg id="10">On his appointment he told Putin: "Thank you for your confidence."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the most important task of the government to support your work as a state secretary with regard to draft legislation and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was for a long time one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidants and works for the Soviet Intelligence Service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">He was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, broadcast on television, both men claimed that the chief of staff would resign at his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, few are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">Is this the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion - that a man who was once praised as a potential president, at once to lead the Russian environmental policy - met with great skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said "it is true that I asked you in early 2012 in a conversation to entrust this very complicated post - you could almost say - to cumbersome posts for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been the chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), replacing the KGB, Ivanov was appointed deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov as one of five people to whom he most trusted.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was assumed that Ivanov might become President of Russia after Putin's second term of office, since Putin's third term of office would have violated the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another close friend of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before becoming president again three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £ 1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have linked the Norddeck of the Queensferry Crossing to the viaduct, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is the first of four closures of the "deck fans" approaching the completion around each of the three towers of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 sloped cables.</seg>
<seg id="7">The £ 1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economy Keith Brown paid a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to get on the bridge from the country.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said, "This is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry Crossing.</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic measure in this project with over 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity which requires extremely precise tolerances for the fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total, almost 79% of the entire bridge deck is in place, and the last section of the deck now receives a concrete bet for the deck in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted onto the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, Project Manager at Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said, "The first shutter is a significant milestone in any bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project represents the closure of future-oriented civil engineering and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the Nordturmdeck, we had to close the remaining gap on the north or land side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive, as the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and has to be pulled upwards at an incline of about 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">The problem was that the tolerances to which the team was working were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters.</seg>
<seg id="20">Fortunately everything went very well.</seg>

<seg id="2">Three men are "lucky to be still alive" after being thrown out of their fishing boat off Anglesey.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Moelfre RNLI Rescue Station bounced on Friday at 13:20 BST after a crew watched the event in Moelfre Bay.</seg>
<seg id="4">The three men had difficulties to swim in safety while their boat moved on on their own.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We saw the boat turn around in their vicinity, and they presented the worst," said the head of the rescue station of Moelfre Vince Jones.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Fortunately, the strong winds have blown the boat out of their reach, until we let ourselves into water," he added.</seg>
<seg id="7">Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man, at the age of 60, was exhausted and found hanging from a buoy without a rescue vest.</seg>
<seg id="8">They all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were taken back to the rescue station</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Jones said, "The three men who were thrown into the water, happiness are uninjured and still alive.</seg>

<seg id="1">Who builds Braunschweig's cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="2">The SPD and Greens believe that investors will be much more involved in the future.</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">The SPD is proposing a "Housing Action Plan" at the next Council meeting.</seg>
<seg id="5">But dispute is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost, the question is: Who is to build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">SPD parliamentary group leader Christoph Bratmann said: "We agree with the Greens. If you want to build on urban areas, you will have to show 20% of all apartments as social apartments."</seg>
<seg id="9">The cheap apartments can however also arise in the stock.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, Bratmann says, "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private land?"</seg>
<seg id="11">"We want investors to build at least 10 per cent, but as much as 20 per cent of the apartments as social apartments on such areas."</seg>
<seg id="12">A new urban housing development program, which will cost millions and still needs to be financed, is intended to provide incentives.</seg>
<seg id="13">The problem, according to Bratmann: "There is currently no agreement between the political groups."</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors as few regulations as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left still wants tough conditions for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Irrespective of this, Bratmann said that the situation on the housing market was exacerbating.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the action plan is implemented, this will provide additional tasks in the construction management.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is required.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the specialists.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the program is not yet complete: the 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">How, however, is the loss of a further 1,300 low-priced apartments, which will be phased out in the coming years?</seg>
<seg id="22">Alone by the year 2020 there will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">In order to prevent this, according to the planning-political spokeswoman Nicole Palm, now expiring bonds should be purchased from the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, it would have to be thought about bringing apartments back into price.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in Weststadt.</seg>
<seg id="26">The problem could be solved in one fell swoop.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the Weststadt deadlines expire at the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments could be brought back into the price-fixing for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">The owners, the housing associations, do not want that.</seg>
<seg id="30">For the number of social apartments in the Weststadt is once again drastically increased, one moves away from the goal of so-called intermixing.</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no concentration of social weakness in only a few districts.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens expect that there will be movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">Holger Herlitschke, President of the Swiss parliament, said: "The CDU must be involved in the boat for a broad majority."</seg>
<seg id="34">It had concentrated on more building sites for single-family houses.</seg>
<seg id="35">But what does not mean that a compromise can not be found.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">The fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, but prefer to spend their free time staring at screens has been mourned by many in the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to television, then to video games, and most recently to smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">I'm referring to the Pokémon Go Madness, an app based on the characters created for the video games in the 1990s (later a series of characters, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many phenomena of pop culture, the interest decreased before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries was shifted by massive demand, which overloaded the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, the players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokémon tracked with a GPS and once captured they can be "photographed" (captured on a mobile phone screen) or "captured".</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation who played the game when she was younger, joined the delusion and jumped for the search from the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US, the game led to a considerable increase in the number of steps the "average" person spent every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for AppleWatch that tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of launching the game, the number of tracked people who train 30 minutes every day is 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go - it just sees the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to "take 30 minutes to get off the couch" and "be active every day" have fallen on deaf ears because many public messages are boring to health and come from people who look miserable.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport can not be overstated.</seg>
<seg id="19">People who exercise regularly exercise their chances of getting cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical exercise helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the great thing about Pokémon Go is that it makes people do something outdoors that they enjoy.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus, three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even make new friends on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there are sullen game shooters, who always have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to do sport as this game does.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its charm and the use will subside over time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to Pokemon's success, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with real-world action, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="2">Forget the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="3">Forget the hype.</seg>
<seg id="4">Simone Biles is immune to all this.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dynamic on the jumping horse.</seg>
<seg id="6">Effortless on the beam.</seg>
<seg id="7">Breathtaking on the floor.</seg>
<seg id="8">On the whole brilliant.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now finally also Olympiasiegerin.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast climbed on Thursday to a multi-task title and magnified the gap between himself and the rest of the world before the eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Their total score of 62.18 was clearly ahead of Silver Medal winners and "Final Five" team mate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American women Simone Biles will play on the suspension beam during the women's singles tournament in the artificial summer at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American to win a multi-combat title and the fifth overall as she consolidates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her end result was shown and her long journey ended at that moment.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who have brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has dominated her sport over the past three years, winning 15 World Champions medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the 1984 Olympian Mary Lou Retton said she was "the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">She expected a final test in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas would be viewed as disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Americans Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the women's singles tournament in the Olympic Games in 2016, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles won the first medal on Tuesday while she served as an exclamation mark at the farewell party of retired team-mate Martha Karolyi.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although Biles insisted on having never planned the future during her long journey to the top, this is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of their practice - which includes their typical Tumbling Pass - is matched to Latin music, which would fit at home on the street outside the Olympiaarena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is no accident.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, who was adopted by her grandparents as a small child and was discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the gym, where Boorman trained, became a force.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, she has lost no more competitions, a victory that will last as long as Biles wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even though Mustafina easily led by two twists, the picture bore.</seg>
<seg id="27">Suspension beams and bodynesses - in which Biles holds the world title.</seg>
<seg id="28">She picked up again with 15,433 on the suspension beam - and with a 15,933 on the ground put another on it.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman gently embraced her as she awaited her ultimate grief-a pure formality-and tears streamed on Bilene's brilliant red, white, and blue eyeliner as the vision she once described in her collection book became a reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a tiebrake.</seg>
<seg id="31">This time, the 22-year-old team captain, who is called "grandma" by the Americans, had a lead.</seg>
<seg id="32">After her exercise, she threw kissing hands at the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes seemed dubious.</seg>
<seg id="33">As for Biles, the fast-spreading tweet of the 19-year-olds from the beginning of this week has a whole new meaning:</seg>

<seg id="1">Police: 3 casualties in series murder case when listening to music in the car</seg>
<seg id="2">According to police reports released on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl who had been killed in one of the deadliest attacks for a decade in Phoenix's first serial murder case were shot while they were talking in the car and listening to music.</seg>
<seg id="3">Angela Rochelliner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis's daughter Maleah were shot dead on June 12, while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said.</seg>
<seg id="4">The perpetrator fired eight shots from a hand-held firearm while he was standing on the passenger's side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, to be read in the report.</seg>
<seg id="5">The police said the three-man murder had not been the result of a robbery because the attacker did not take the handbags or the $ 2,900 that were owned by one of the adult victims.</seg>
<seg id="6">The police officer of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said the shooting caused the investigators to take a closer look at whether it was connected to four previous attacks.</seg>
<seg id="7">In total, seven people were killed and two others injured in nine instances, mainly in Hispanic districts.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It happens in a residential area in front of a house," Howard told the KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, earlier this month.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is assumed that the suspect used several vehicles, including a brown Nissans from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990ern and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.</seg>
<seg id="10">The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were linked and committed by the same murderer.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for her injuries and died later.</seg>
<seg id="12">Liner, 31, and Ellis's daughter, Maleah, died on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="13">A witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.</seg>
<seg id="14">The authorities also published a police report on the shooting that was aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the three-killing, and is said to be the work of the serial murderer.</seg>
<seg id="15">Investigators found cartridge sleeves and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment.</seg>

<seg id="2">Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.</seg>
<seg id="3">But like most of his contemporaries, Edmund has microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing about during her pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="4">When he first came home, my first thought was, I can not do it.</seg>
<seg id="5">I can not do it.</seg>
<seg id="6">I have not let myself go.</seg>
<seg id="7">What is not at all true, of course, has been the case, "she said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Her husband Vincent and her was informed that Edmund may never recognize them and that he may not even survive.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some doctors even went so far as to suggest that they institutionalize it.</seg>
<seg id="10">"My first answer was 'I did not know people were still doing it,'" Picciuto explained.</seg>
<seg id="11">Edmund can walk with the help of a walking aid.</seg>
<seg id="12">Edmund could neither sit nor crawl until he was three years old, and he still can not speak.</seg>
<seg id="13">But he is making progress slowly.</seg>
<seg id="14">He can run with support and bike riding.</seg>
<seg id="15">He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.</seg>
<seg id="16">Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund has designed for "Please sing me something". "</seg>
<seg id="17">"We're teaching him language," Picciuto told CBS News.</seg>
<seg id="18">But it is not a typical sign language - she says. Edmund has invented some characters alone.</seg>
<seg id="19">Microcephaly has a variety of causes: genetic as in Edmund as well as infections with viruses such as measles or the cicavirus during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="20">The symptoms and prognosis may vary widely.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the infected with the zikavirus.</seg>
<seg id="22">Picciuto recalls the emotional price of an uncertain future.</seg>
<seg id="23">I constantly asked what will happen?</seg>
<seg id="24">What will happen?</seg>
<seg id="25">And she still does not really know.</seg>
<seg id="26">I have not asked for the prognosis for a long time, because I do not expect anyone to really tell me.</seg>
<seg id="27">But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zikavirus.</seg>
<seg id="28">It gets better.</seg>
<seg id="29">You know it will be better for you.</seg>
<seg id="30">You will love your child and your child will love you.</seg>

<seg id="8">The weather service announced that there might be an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain in this area.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the south of Alabama, an early flood warning system was deployed on Friday while it continued to rain in Mobile.</seg>
<seg id="10">The River Comite near Baton Rouges and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, are likely to reach record levels over the weekend.</seg>
<seg id="11">The metereologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.</seg>
<seg id="12">He also said that a downstream flooding in Ascension Parish is a danger because they will flow slowly over the river into Lake Maurepas.</seg>
<seg id="13">The River Tickfaw, south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest score ever recorded on Friday at 09.00.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rescue teams still plucked people from the flood waters in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="15">Leroy Hansford, his wife, and his step-son were among those who were rescued on Friday near Gloster.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 400 feet from his house, rose sharply overnight.</seg>
<seg id="17">He said that another stepdaughter who lived nearby had warned him.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We have woken up and the water poured and poured in," said Hansford.</seg>
<seg id="19">It reached my waist.</seg>
<seg id="20">His wife told Hansford that in the 48 years she lived there, she had never seen such a high rise in the river.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hansford said that he and his family members had all the disabilities and that he was the only one who could swim.</seg>
<seg id="22">Hansford said emergency aid had rescued all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they were lodged until Friday.</seg>
<seg id="23">Krautmann said the flooding had spread "quickly", as there were still heavy rains and that the authorities were considering evacuation instructions.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Krautmann, an observer near Livingstone reported a rain of 13.75 inches from midnight to Friday morning.</seg>
<seg id="25">Krautmann said that the ground had been drastically affected by the rainfall since Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="26">The authorities said heavy rainfall and street flooding caused the rescue of residents from their houses in Tangipahoa Parish and school failure in five school districts.</seg>
<seg id="27">The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that a deputy in Tangipahoa ruled over 200 flooded houses.</seg>
<seg id="28">The inhabitants were evacuated in two churches, which were now both flooded.</seg>
<seg id="29">The head of the community, Robby Miller, said the authorities had rescued 72 people and seven domestic animals flushed by the flood.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the cities of Amite and Hammond emergency accommodations were set up to accommodate the evacuees.</seg>
<seg id="31">"As soon as the water begins to return, they will be able to return to their homes," he said.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the town of Hammond, Tangipahoa, almost two dozen roads were closed due to the flood, and sandbags were provided for the residents, who were hoping to keep the water out of their homes and shops.</seg>
<seg id="33">"The last major flooding we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum from the city administration.</seg>
<seg id="34">This seems to be a similar incident.</seg>
<seg id="35">In Mississipp, the emergency manager Rupert Lacy of the Harrison County said it was raining on the Gulf Coast.</seg>
<seg id="36">According to his data, a handful of houses were reported to have been flooded on Thursday, but no reports have been reported on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="37">Keith Townson, manager of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.</seg>
<seg id="38">"I have seen water in places where I have never seen it before," said Townson, "and it still comes."</seg>

<p>
<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I am imagining in the gymnastics of women's gymnastics, and for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">Firstly, I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly, this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who were inspiring for many young girls of different skin color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, which is Aly Raisman, the Jewish woman, and Madison Kocian, the Catholic, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the United States.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one female gymnast was an African-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year were Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion and America cheered.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected but masterly Gymastikroutinen.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American woman to win gold at an individual multi-match event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We are experiencing the top of this sport, but it does not look like a gymnasium in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "last five" because the next Olympics will have only four gymnasts in the team, as well as last year with Marta Karolyi as a coach.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and Turner is primarily used in private gymnasiums maintained by parents who are responsible for the training, equipment, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnasts and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these gymnasiums are located in affluent suburbs, which can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs the gymnasts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We must allow a more affordable and accessible gymnastics to the communities of countless young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my own founding of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events, we offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youngsters (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September, we will be expanding to Detroit (my hometown) to offer high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination provides life-long benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that makes thousands of young girls get interested in gymnastics and that is great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sport, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby, and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by bringing the Olympic team-mate and thank you, so many young girls with different backgrounds motivate her to start her way to becoming healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="1">Doctors want to organize further strikes after they have rejected Jeremy Hunts proposal</seg>
<seg id="2">The ministers had hoped to put an end to the dispute over the amendments by accepting a reformed treaty with the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 medical assistants who voted in an election declined.</seg>
<seg id="3">In July, Hunt had revealed plans to compulsorily enforce the contract, saying the NHS was in a "Niemandsland" and any further delay would be detrimental to employees and patients.</seg>
<seg id="4">The first assistants are to receive a new contract, which includes changes to night and weekend work, in order to improve care at inhospitable times.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dr Ellen McCourt, the chairman of the BMA Committee for Medical Assistants, reported last night in a communication: "Doctors continue to have serious concerns about the proposed treaty, in particular that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and refuse to treat all doctors fairly."</seg>
<seg id="6">With only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new treaty, progress must be made and time is running out.</seg>
<seg id="7">Efforts on the part of the BMA to resolve the disputes through discussions met with the government to take part in repugnance and sometimes to deafening silence.</seg>
<seg id="8">This happened to a promise that Jeremy Hunt had just made about last month that his door would always be open.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Jeremy Hunt must now act, lift the imposition, and address the concerns of the assistants."</seg>
<seg id="10">If he does not do so, the doctors have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further work-fighting measures.</seg>
<seg id="11">The last strike At the end of April, there were a delay of almost 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and specialists were included to cover the strike population.</seg>
<seg id="12">The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by accepting the reformed treaty with the British Medical Association officials.</seg>
<seg id="13">The BMA would like a better weekly wage for the 54,000 assistants who will be subject to the contract.</seg>
<seg id="14">Daniel Mortimer, general manager of the NHS staff, called on the assistants to end the strike.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mortimer said, "Labor policies do not do very well, but they are already burdened by overburdened teams and service providers, and they only give patients, carers and their families worry, distress and interruption."</seg>
<seg id="16">In the past two months, we have been talking to the Committee of Medical Assistants and responded positively to the concerns about guardianship and whistleblowing with the Ministry of Health and other ministries.</seg>
<seg id="17">The employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important issues such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from work, training, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training leave and gender pay gap in medicine were a sign of how serious the employers, health education England and the Ministry of Health were in respecting the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.</seg>

<seg id="1">The £ 2 per day drug that can lower heart attack risk</seg>
<seg id="2">Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 per day drug after being recommended by the authorities to administer this more people for a longer period of time.</seg>
<seg id="3">The anticoagulant drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with a heart disease.</seg>
<seg id="4">The medication is administered for 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of stroke or further heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="5">The NICE regulatory body of the NHS has recommended a four-year-long dose to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.</seg>
<seg id="6">The NICE regulatory body of the NHS has recommended a four-year-long dose to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.</seg>
<seg id="7">Around 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulation of fatty material in the arterial walls that form deposits.</seg>
<seg id="9">When the pad breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot that clogs blood flow to the heart causing a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="10">As the blood clot dissolves, it can flow through the bloodstream and block blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="11">People who already had a heart attack are at a higher risk of having a further one.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots less likely.</seg>
<seg id="13">NICE's guidance, published today, recommends taking 90mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60mg with twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Center said: "Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have a further heart attack or a stroke - often with disastrous consequences."</seg>
<seg id="15">The fear of a new heart attack can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.</seg>
<seg id="16">Experience shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who already had a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">Through a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="18">Information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years. The guidance draft does not recommend treatment beyond this period.</seg>

<seg id="1">Culture of Political Correctness makes electoral frauds flourish in Muslim areas</seg>
<seg id="2">The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year at the instigation of a government report for corruption</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of political correctness has led to the fact that widespread election fraud in Muslim communities is knowingly ignored as a crushing government report today.</seg>
<seg id="4">The former Cabinetmember Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police, election observers, and town halls to ignore evidence of abuse of choice due to "hypocrisy about religion and ethnicity".</seg>
<seg id="5">The former Minister of Integration and Local Government, now an anti-corruption kings, said the intimidation of religious voters was so bad that the police should be allowed to set barrier bands outside election booths to protect intimidated voters.</seg>
<seg id="6">He recommends that voters should carry an identity card to prove their identity in elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the moment, a voter simply needs to name his name and address.</seg>
<seg id="8">The report suggests applying non-removable ink to a person's finger when they cast their voices to prevent someone from dialing twice.</seg>
<seg id="9">Whistleblowers should get more protection, says Sir Eric.</seg>
<seg id="10">He calls for the press to have more access to community records and decisions by unofficial committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"This is not only against electoral fraud but also to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture associated with it," he said.</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlet's election scandal in East London.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last year, a special court ruled that the acting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be exempted from corrupt and illegal practices after a litany.</seg>
<seg id="14">The court found that Rahman "perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community" cynically, "and that he had silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.</seg>
<seg id="15">Rahman is said to have "led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 voices were either doubtful or the result of an imitation in which a person chooses as someone else.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">In particular, he expressed an alarming response to the fraudulent correspondence - in which older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sir Eric, depicted, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including passing IDs to prove identity</seg>
<seg id="20">In his report, the report stated that "pressure was being put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, to choose according to the will of the elderly, especially communities with a Pakistani or Bangladeshi background.</seg>
<seg id="21">"There were concerns that ... state institutions had knowingly ignored such behavior because of" politically correct "hypocrises about ethnicity and religion."</seg>
<seg id="22">Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including the prohibition of political activists to edit the voting documents to stop "electoral".</seg>
<seg id="23">The report, which is being considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher registration checks to prevent the election list from being used for immigration and social welfare purposes.</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider options to ask voters before the election for your ID.</seg>
<seg id="25">Use non-removable ink on a person's finger as soon as she has cast her voice to prevent someone from dialing twice.</seg>
<seg id="26">Systematic checks on the nationality of a person to ensure that they are entitled to vote.</seg>
<seg id="27">A three-year limit on applications for automatic dialing.</seg>
<seg id="28">Prohibition of political activists working on full postal and envelopes.</seg>
<seg id="29">Give the police the power to set up barriers around polling stations.</seg>
<seg id="30">A law amendment which facilitates an accusation of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983 (Volksvertretungsgesetz 1983).</seg>
<seg id="31">Photography prohibition in election stations.</seg>
<seg id="32">Requirement that only English may be used in the election stations (with the exception of Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">Intensification of the training to ensure that the employees enforce the rule that voters go into the election booth alone.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that after the Tower Hamlet's case no criminal complaint was made.</seg>
<seg id="35">"The electoral court declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy to be unfit for corruption and illicit practices because of a litany," he said.</seg>
<seg id="36">He was found guilty on the basis of a number of reasons, according to the high requirements of the criminal procedure.</seg>
<seg id="37">He also criticized the ineffective "check controls" of the electoral registration departments of the town halls.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Eric said, "The judging in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.</seg>
<seg id="39">Our country, as the mother of parliaments, has a proud heritage, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and the denial of some authorities threaten this reputation.</seg>

<seg id="4">In honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that are currently flickering on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympics that have more than a certain resemblance to Hollywood celebrities.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Hunter and the Wolf: team member of the US team in archery Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since his childhood</seg>
<seg id="6">Apart from Kate's double-decker on the cycle track, many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain archer could be the twin of A-celebrity Leonardo DiCaprio.</seg>
<seg id="7">The team member of the US team at Archery Brady Ellison has caused an onslaught on Twitter after appearing pictures on which he looks eerily similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star.</seg>
<seg id="8">In fact, the archer got the insanity in the social media and admitted that since his childhood he has been hearing that he looks like Leo.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I do not see any big resemblance, except the facial hair," Brady told the Huffington Post.</seg>
<seg id="10">"He's a handsome guy, so I'll take that as a compliment."</seg>
<seg id="11">One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be even more important this year: the striking similarity between the British farmer Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina with her big, expressive eyes is to be able to go as a double for the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.</seg>
<seg id="13">And in the swimming pool the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared for years to the Glee star Matthew Morrison.</seg>
<seg id="14">One higher: This user is of the opinion that Nathan is the "athletic version" of the Inception's actor</seg>
<seg id="15">Another persistent match was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similarly heavy eyebrows and lips.</seg>

<seg id="20">A Twitter user explained her satisfaction that "the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are nearly identical."</seg>
<seg id="21">In fact, the US football star Hope Solo and the Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes.</seg>
<seg id="22">Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as the gold medal winner in gymnastics Gabby Douglas, who has her own beautiful, wide smile resembling that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.</seg>

<seg id="1">CBC commentator for the Olympics apologizes for his statement that Chinese swimmer "died like a pig"</seg>
<seg id="2">Byron MacDonald's analysis on the fourth place of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at dr 4x200m free-kicking squad shocked spectators of the CBC live broadcast of the Olmypical Games on Wednesday</seg>
<seg id="3">The Canadian broadcaster CBC had to apologize after one of its commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "went off like Mief" and "like a pig" during the race.</seg>
<seg id="4">The commentator Byron MacDonalds thought that his microphone was switched off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m freestyle swim.</seg>
<seg id="5">MacDonald, who had been brought into the CBS's commentator board to give more "color," could be heard saying, "This little 14-year-old Chinese girl has lost the connection, baby".</seg>
<seg id="6">Too excited, went off like Mief, died like a pig.</seg>
<seg id="7">Thanks for that.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second stage of the swim 1: 57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to open the gap to China.</seg>
<seg id="9">Spectators across Canada responded quickly online after being shocked by the sound and language</seg>
<seg id="10">Emmett Macfarlane tweete, "Did the CBC commentator just said that the 14-year-old swimmer from China" died like a pig "?</seg>
<seg id="11">The idiot did not realize they were still on the air. "</seg>
<seg id="12">Ai Yanhan from China was described as follows: "This little 14-year-old Chinese girl has lost the connection, baby."</seg>
<seg id="13">The criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and hard, with many of them talking to him</seg>
<seg id="14">Twitter users did not hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was</seg>
<seg id="15">Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.</seg>
<seg id="16">You represent the CBC and Canada and let us all look like racists.</seg>
<seg id="17">Shortly afterwards, Scott Russel, who moderated the CBC broadcast, apologized for the MacDonald commentary, saying, "We apologize for the commentary on a swimming performance."</seg>
<seg id="18">It was an unfortunate choice, we are sorry that it happened. "</seg>
<seg id="19">CBC apologized in the end over 90 times among the people who have responded to the remark about Twitter</seg>
<seg id="20">The commentary colleague Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald</seg>
<seg id="21">CBC and added his apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about the comments from MacDonald</seg>
<seg id="22">The network also apologized quickly and issued a message.</seg>
<seg id="23">We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that they were allowed to be aired.</seg>
<seg id="24">We apologized yesterday night to our viewers on the air and our followers in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="25">To clarify, Byron's comments were related to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person.</seg>
<seg id="26">Still, they were inadequate and an unfortunate choice. Byron is very sorry for what he said.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald excused himself in the show and tried to justify his remark by stating that it was not his intention that it be interpreted as a personal attack.</seg>
<seg id="28">"I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women's swim in the CBC Olympics, he said.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I've been referring to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person."</seg>
<seg id="30">Of course, no disregard was intended and I am very sorry. "</seg>

<seg id="6">A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was at the same time in the store, said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear, "she dressed again and left the shop without buying anything."</seg>
<seg id="7">She said, "People could not believe what they saw."</seg>
<seg id="8">Standing in the middle of the sales floor, she took a pair of pantyhose out of the display, took off her own tights and trousers and tried them on.</seg>
<seg id="9">"She did not even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, cheeky like Oskar."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Everyone stared as she took off the underpants, which she obviously did not like, as she put them back on the shelf."</seg>
<seg id="11">She repeated it with three more underpants, before she finally decided that she did not like, dressed again and went out.</seg>
<seg id="12">"She did not seem to mind watching anyone-or thinking about the person who might buy the underwear she'd tried on."</seg>
<seg id="13">Mrs. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said, "How disgusting to think that someone taking home pants with another person who was not washed and who was not washed."</seg>
<seg id="14">The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="15">Ms Davidson added, "As I've noticed, the employees have tried to pull the garments out of the sale after they went - which is just as good."</seg>
<seg id="16">"I would hate to go home with a new pair of underpants and find out that another woman was wearing them and going out again and not washing them."</seg>
<seg id="17">A spokesman from Primark said, "Primark is aware of the incident that happened in our branch in Folkstone on Tuesday, August 9."</seg>
<seg id="18">All eligible products were withdrawn from the sale.</seg>

<seg id="1">How to protect yourself with Krav Maga</seg>
<seg id="2">The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a bit safer for you.</seg>
<seg id="3">We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a Grandmaster of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.</seg>
<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from behind, this video will show you how to turn the tables for your robber.</seg>
<seg id="5">If you approach them from behind, you should turn around first so that you can see your attacker and "get out of the shot," says Mizrachi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Then grab the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder before you hit it with your free elbow in the face.</seg>
<seg id="7">Then strike him with the knee in the groin and twist the weapon out of his hands as the attacker collapses in pain. Hit him with the barrel in the face and move backwards while they are pointing the gun at him.</seg>
<seg id="8">For attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the firing line, grab the weapon and twist it so that the attacker can not shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time, relocate the weight to the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then twist the gun out of its handle before moving backward and directing the gun toward him.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds difficult?</seg>
<seg id="11">Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi is doing it.</seg>
<seg id="12">But remember that if you are not a Krav Maga Grandmaster, it is safest to hand over your money to a robbery.</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveler Ian Wright scrapes his tongue at the dirtiest places in Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveler underwent a serious examination of his immune system and gag reflex - licking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The presenter and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk scraped his train on a euro bill, a railcaster at Piccadilly Circus, a flush button of a train toilet, and a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he was going to do.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", brought some surprising results to light.</seg>
<seg id="6">The idea of licking the flush button of a train toilet, already used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of Darmbacteria and his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing he licked left more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resilience of his bowel by traveling throughout the world and eating strange and miraculous things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public railings at railway stations to flush buttons of toilets, the task put his immune system definitely under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film, he said, "Already as a child, I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film, he certainly lived up to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His sample swab showed a luminometer count of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">In comparison, the luminometer count of freshly washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet he refused to lick after their luminometer count was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands had one of less than 60</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish producer of milk products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">In the film, he says, "This is close to the worst thing I smelled in a toilet."</seg>
<seg id="19">There's nothing dirtier than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not lick anything here, because it is disgusting inside.</seg>
<seg id="21">"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company provides Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of Darmbacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, Juices and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We really wanted to offer the consumer something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We went through crazy brainstormings that ended with saying "Let's call Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary, we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the movie shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added, "Let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I told him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course, there were things that made it easier to get Ian licking them and others that were quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad we took some of these filthy treats on film. "</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey carried out by Valio in 2015, 84% of all lactic acid bacteria responded, particularly with the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58% said they at least occasionally use products containing lactic acid bacteria included.</seg>

<seg id="1">Asocial family destroyed before deloging social apartment in Saltash, Cornwall</seg>
<seg id="2">An asocial family left her social home after a delay of £ 50,000, because she had terrorized her neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After being forcibly removed from their homes, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an irreparable state.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls had gaping holes, wooden boards were torn open, garbage was scattered on the floor, and graffiti was smeared to the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family was relocated and it is assumed that she now lives in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for the Housekeeping Department at Cornwall Housing, said she feared that the apartment could no longer be repaired.</seg>
<seg id="8">She said, "It was an absolute nightmare for people here and I believe that people do not have to live this way.</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider, as this property will probably be viewed as not so nice part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and its reputation is the same.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime, and the police said the terror that the family had inflicted on street fighting with baseball players, intimidation of local residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive cries, quarreling and cursing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an order for antisocial behavior in June.</seg>
<seg id="13">In some rooms of the house, which may be demolished, old rubbish was found</seg>
<seg id="14">There were drifts in the property, where drugs were traded in the past</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbors said they saw them fighting on the street and had to be called regularly to the police</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing delighted her and her partner this week by force from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily undress.</seg>
<seg id="17">The delogation was cheered by facilitated neighbors who said their lives were made the hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">One said, "They did not care for anyone."</seg>
<seg id="19">We lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad.</seg>
<seg id="20">The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.</seg>
<seg id="21">"This morning we could not sleep."</seg>
<seg id="22">We stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it!</seg>
<seg id="23">Now that they are finally gone, it will be beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighborhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said the family had neglected to cooperate with the local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house, to which the police was called at regular intervals, for 20 years</seg>
<seg id="26">On the overgrown side of the town hall rubbish and old toys were thrown down</seg>
<seg id="27">He added, "It is a shame that the tenant neglected to accept any responsibility for their behavior and that of their family, as delogation is always the last step that Cornwall Housing takes into consideration.</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case because the behavior was extreme and their deeds had to be terribly watchful for their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and provided us with the information.</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will provide comfort to some neighbors and convey the message that antisocial behavior is not tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress left in one of the bedrooms of the house after the delogation on the floor</seg>
<seg id="33">Workers of the house administration will now have to clear the garbage dumps surrounding the house</seg>
<seg id="34">In 2014 the police carried out a raid in the house and found over 70g cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash in the amount of £ 1,700.</seg>
<seg id="35">Skeldon was fined for having been guilty of possession of a Class B drug in commercial practice.</seg>
<seg id="36">She claimed that the money was for a grave of her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="37">After they were without shelter, Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.</seg>
<seg id="38">Many room walls of the house were smeared with graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">The police say that they will deliberate tenants who do not follow the rules of the house</seg>
<seg id="40">Angela Crow, from the Devon and Cornwall police, said the delogation was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not follow the rules of the house.</seg>
<seg id="41">"This goes to those who think that they can behave without self-reproach, as well as those who have been harmed by such behavior," she said.</seg>
<seg id="42">The Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and antisocial behavior, which will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.</seg>

<seg id="6">Dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft flew over the sunsets almost on the beach in Aveiro, northern Portugal.</seg>
<seg id="7">The holidaymakers jumped on their feet as they began to worry about the noise of jet engines without first seeing what was passing through the clouds.</seg>
<seg id="8">The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.</seg>

<seg id="13">The spokesman said that due to the poor visibility, the jet flew a bit deeper than usual due to nearby fires, but the air forces insisted that the safety was never compromised at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">This summer, fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland, where four people died on the island of Madeira.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot had to fly so low, because of the conditions - heavy fog and fire smoke, which restricted his view</seg>

<seg id="2">The leadership of the US Republicans is plagued by massive worries, even in traditionally conservative federal states, to lose their majority.</seg>
<seg id="3">Presidential candidate Donald Trump now gave weaknesses to his election campaign in the Republican High Court of Utah.</seg>
<seg id="4">A rare moment in which the multitillionaire, who is usually cocky and self-assured, expressed some kind of concern, as correspondents reported.</seg>
<seg id="5">After throwing out 16 rivals within his own Republican camp, the doubts about his success in the fight for the White House are growing.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We have tremendous problems in Utah," said Trump before evangelical Christians, asking for support in important states like Ohio, Florida, or Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to him, false reports of his candidacy were due, he resumed his well-known media scolding.</seg>
<seg id="8">Republican fortresses wiggle</seg>
<seg id="9">Utah is usually a safe bank for the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to a survey conducted by SurveyUSA in June, Trump and his competitor were equated by the Democrats, Hillary Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="11">Other institutions see Trump ahead, but not with the distance that is common to Republican candidates in the state.</seg>
<seg id="12">Arizona and Georgia are also at risk.</seg>
<seg id="13">In an interview with CNBC, Trump responded to the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton's advance: "Just as I've done so far."</seg>
<seg id="14">And postponed afterwards: this will either be "successful" or I will make a very very nice, long vacation ".</seg>

<seg id="2">The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary committee on the case.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kenya's light athletes face unfavor after the second doping affair at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a fraud attempt in a doping control in the Olympic village, Kenya has sent a coach home.</seg>
<seg id="5">The International Olympic Committee announced its intention to establish a disciplinary commission as soon as possible to investigate the case.</seg>
<seg id="6">A Kenyan official had indicated that the former sprinter and today's coach, John Anzrah, had given a urine test in the Olympic village under the name of the 800-meter runners Ferguson Rotich.</seg>
<seg id="7">This had been reported to the team leadership of Kenya by the doping controllers.</seg>
<seg id="8">The IAAF World Federation has asked the IOC for information on the case to investigate its own, an IAAF spokesman said.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent measures of the IOC, the IAAF will carry out an assessment," said an IAAF statement.</seg>
<seg id="10">"He (Anzrah) has gone to the doping control station and has given himself as Ferguson Rotich, gave the test and signed it," declared Kenya's chief deputy Stephan Arap Soi.</seg>
<seg id="11">He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete, who was on the list for the training checks of the World Anti-Doping Agency.</seg>
<seg id="12">In 2015, Ferguson Rotich had become world champion fourth in 800 meters.</seg>
<seg id="13">Four days before, the Kenyan athletics delegation chief, Michael Rotich, had been withdrawn from the Rio Games.</seg>
<seg id="14">He is supposed to have informed the athletes of his country about doping tests.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to media reports, he was arrested on his return to Nairobi airport.</seg>
<seg id="16">Kenya has been under special scrutiny at the IOC for a long time after numerous doping offenses.</seg>
<seg id="17">In announcing the more than 2,000 doping control controls launched by the IOC before the Rio Games, it was unusual to note that athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted.</seg>
<seg id="18">The World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system before the summer games in Brazil.</seg>
<seg id="19">The law was passed a few weeks before the start of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="20">As a result, WADA took Kenya from the list of countries whose doping control is compliant with the WADA rules.</seg>
<seg id="21">Kenya is considered a great runner nation.</seg>
<seg id="22">The athletes of the country won the most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="23">In a series of television reports of the ARD, accusations have repeatedly been raised that in Kenya doping means are easily accessible and there should be a considerable mentality of the sports fraud.</seg>
<seg id="24">IOC member Richard Pound recently requested a similar investigation in Kenya as he had done in Russian athletics.</seg>
<seg id="25">It could be shown that this type of sport was doped and systematically doped.</seg>
<seg id="26">Russia's athletes were then excluded from the summer games.</seg>

<seg id="1">Salzburg "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli</seg>
<seg id="2">In the Shakespeare Year, the Salzburg Festival presents the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic love couple, much like Romeo and Juliet.</seg>
<seg id="3">Including a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.</seg>
<seg id="4">A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story", Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.</seg>
<seg id="5">The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical to the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Maria a youth space.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the orchestra pit, the Simón Bolívar Orchestra under the direction of the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm", he enthuses.</seg>
<seg id="7">We always say that it is very Latin-American.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are many Latin ingredients in their tempo and melody.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="10">I would say that we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!</seg>
<seg id="11">In this production Bartoli plays an older Maria.</seg>
<seg id="12">She remembers with sadness her love with Tony, while the younger Maria plays and dances.</seg>
<seg id="13">The role of Maria always fascinated me.</seg>
<seg id="14">Firstly because it is musically extraordinary!</seg>
<seg id="15">And then there was Mary's personality.</seg>
<seg id="16">She says it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright."</seg>
<seg id="17">So she is wise, of course also naive, and very passionate.</seg>
<seg id="18">"It is very similar to my Italian character, which I have as a Roman," laughs Bartoli.</seg>
<seg id="19">Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."</seg>
<seg id="20">It is so an honor for us to work with her.</seg>
<seg id="21">She is an immensely generous man.</seg>
<seg id="22">And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"</seg>
<seg id="23">Conducting is a necessity for him.</seg>
<seg id="24">You see it in each of his movements, in his looks, it is his life!</seg>
<seg id="25">It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.</seg>
<seg id="26">We both have a more southern temperament, a fire, a passion and a joyous approach to life, which is very important at all!</seg>
<seg id="27">For the American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the "West Side Story" is highly contemporary: "This play is about prejudice and fanaticism."</seg>
<seg id="28">Today we have the refugees, then the Puerto Ricans went to New York, and the New Yorkers did not want them.</seg>
<seg id="29">They are the same themes, and they are just as relevant today as they were then.</seg>
<seg id="30">59 years later the piece is still relevant.</seg>

<seg id="4">It was believed that she was killed by a Russian air raid in Raqqa, the bulwark of the group in the country, ITV News reported Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="5">Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died shortly after she planned to leave the war-torn country and return to England.</seg>
<seg id="6">"One can only hope that the only good is - as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to keep people from ever making that decision," said Akunjee.</seg>
<seg id="7">In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from the East of London boarded a plane to Turkey and then boarded a bus to the Syrian border.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sultana's family was told that she had married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months.</seg>

<seg id="1">Reid says Clinton will remain a candidate for the Supreme Court in the event of an election victory at Garland</seg>
<seg id="2">Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland's confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.</seg>
<seg id="4">The majority leader in Senate Mitch McConnell is of the opinion that the next president will nominate the successor of the late Judge to the Supreme Court, Antonin Scalia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Reid said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expected Clinton to select Garland "with a certain degree of certainty".</seg>
<seg id="6">A spokeswoman from Reid later said that he had not yet talked to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland and he speculated.</seg>
<seg id="7">He praised Garland and said Clinton's team would not worry about a new candidate.</seg>
<seg id="8">Garland is the highest judge for the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.</seg>
<seg id="9">Raid said Republicans blocked the Garlands nomination, were lackeys and helpers of Republican Presidential Candidate Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="10">He also noted that Donald Trump was unsuitable for the presidency.</seg>

<seg id="2">"Those who do not adjust themselves and praise Erdogan sit on packed suitcases," says the chairman of the Gülen-based Foundation Dialogue and World, Ercan Karakoyun.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Kurdish community of Germany expects ten-thousand refugees to flee from Turkey to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the medium term it could even be "a few hundred thousand", believes the chairman of the association Ali Toprak.</seg>
<seg id="5">Because of the harsh Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's move after the coup attempt, the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass curse to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="6">"In the short term, I am counting on tens of thousands, in the medium term with several hundred thousand refugees from Turkey in Germany, if the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," says Ali Toprak.</seg>
<seg id="7">Because the government had already overdue Kurdish strongholds with criminal acts months ago, 500,000 Kurds are fleeing within Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="8">After the defeated coup, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks were added.</seg>
<seg id="9">Many will want to start anew in Europe if they are further suppressed in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="10">"It can not be that a state that takes refugees themselves produces refugees in their own country," Toprak said.</seg>
<seg id="11">The association commissioner complained about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish and also in Alevi cities.</seg>
<seg id="12">With this Erdogan wants to increase the pressure to the remaining Kurds.</seg>
<seg id="13">"They are the last major minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been exterminated or expelled for the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member.</seg>
<seg id="14">The prosecutor demanded that the federal government be positioned "as sharply as Austria against Erdogan and its supporters".</seg>
<seg id="15">Also in Germany a "witch hunt" takes place against Erdogan critics instead.</seg>
<seg id="16">I do not feel safe in Germany for the first time in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="17">The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad.</seg>
<seg id="18">More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and Oppositionals.</seg>
<seg id="19">Branding as a Gülen devotee destroys teachers 'and other academics' professional existence.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Those who do not adjust themselves and praise Erdogan sit on packed suitcases, as well as the Kemalists and secular ones," said Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen Foundation for Dialogue and Education, the "World".</seg>
<seg id="21">According to the newspaper, citing figures from the German Ministry of the Interior, the Turks were the largest group of asylum-seekers recognized for political persecution in Germany before the coup.</seg>
<seg id="22">As of the reporting date of June 30, 11,386 people were thus and almost 29 per cent of all asylum seekers (39,625).</seg>
<seg id="23">This survey does not contain those who have fled from war, poverty or lack of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="24">Asylum seekers who are entitled to asylum under the Basic Law are exclusively persecuted, ie, politically, ie from the state side.</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The locals do not get anything from the summer election campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the state parliament.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they have understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2021, the Landtag election will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin parliament has already decided earlier this year.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is not so stupid as before: summer holidays, heat and the election of the provincial elections - that bites.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who are to be convinced by the election campaigners, are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the holidaymakers who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee on the way, are no local people, so they can not choose the state parliament.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are also practical problems: during the holidays, helpers who hang up posters, blow up balloons, distribute flyers, and finally count votes, can only be troubled.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has yet to pass the election campaign just past the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if one can say at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it is also about something: Minister President Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must be afraid of his office.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls.</seg>
<seg id="13">What is exciting is how much newcomer AfD cuts off and what remains in the end coalition suits.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 government minister, makes an almost inconspicuous acting election campaign, one from his large poster.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels around the country, spreads roses and talks a bit with the people, just as his legendary worthless predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise Seelering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame for the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their refugee policy, their "We create that" has accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists, which is probably going to cost him the nice office.</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU, with its top candidate, the Minister of the Interior, Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it is like to be at the wrong time in the right place.</seg>
<seg id="19">Chancellor Angela Merkel has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale surveys, Merkel Bundestagswahlkreis is located in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony than Mecklenburger and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"There was probably the majority of other states," complained Vincent Kokert, secretary general of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR.</seg>
<seg id="22">But it does not pity anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise, the Northeast CDU largely renounces the usual election booths at marketplaces and in front of shopping centers with umbrellas and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">This, according to Kokert, plays only a "subordinate role".</seg>
<seg id="25">The Union has also noticed that you are breaking the ground in the country, that it has to be very hard to find a wire to the people again.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is like the left, the SPD, the Greens: scarcely available in the vastness of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">The advice of the CDU candidate Kokert to his colleagues is, however, also self-explanatory: "They must go where it hurts, where the people are: Dorffeste, Golden Weddings, every birthday celebration must be used".</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called his SPD to a particularly dedicated campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In surveys the Social Democrats were last with 22 per cent behind partner CDU (25) and only just before the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">In the 2011 election the SPD had clearly won 35.6 percent ahead of the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Greens, small parties with seven percent in the polls, are likely to make the leap into the state parliament.</seg>
<seg id="32">They turn a holiday virtue into a modern virtue and move their campaign largely into the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Online election campaign," states the country's chairman Claudia Müller.</seg>
<seg id="34">Otherwise, green election campaigners are on track searching for local voters among tourists.</seg>
<seg id="35">Silke Gajek, the top candidate, is curving straight with a houseboat through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it also beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="36">Your impression: "Election holidays in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment".</seg>

<seg id="1">B27-Restructuring: Restaurants suffer from blocking</seg>
<seg id="2">The speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="3">For those responsible for the construction works, which start at 5.30 in the morning and end only around 8 pm, there is praise everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="4">"They made everything quite jagged," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the Jet petrol station.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a superteam.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is also no delay.</seg>
<seg id="7">The construction site could be moved to the south at the beginning of the week at half-time, by the end of October everything should be ready.</seg>
<seg id="8">We also commend the meeting of those who are responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to the setting up of makeshift entrances.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site on Monday migrated to the south and also the blocking of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was lifted and thus also the connection to Rottenburg again exists, the traffic situation within the place has relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="10">From Ofterdingen the citizens can now ride the B 27 on both sides again.</seg>
<seg id="11">The evasion traffic through the village seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"There were sometimes significant complaints," says Deputy Chief Executive Officer Florian King, responsible for traffic management management.</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because many crawls were looking for and more familiar with their navigation than the signs.</seg>
<seg id="14">Which led to the fact that some trucks were fraying in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the speed limits were not met, the municipality increasingly demanded the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.</seg>
<seg id="16">"There have been significant overruns," says King, who himself knew about the situation on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="17">Since two to three per minute have been flashed.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fastest was traveling with 77 km / h in the Tempo-30 zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">Since the construction site has moved on, however, it has become quieter.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the businessmen on the B 27, it is only a small consolation that the road is now open again for customers from Rottenburg.</seg>
<seg id="21">Businessmen do not like to look at the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the fact that the B 27 renovation has led to sales slumps has left anyone you wondered through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more affected and some are less affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">If you have less to do with the "end customer", that is for other companies produced, the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences.</seg>
<seg id="25">Thomas Sulz also speaks of a "maximum slight decline" at the Autohaus Maier, but also admits that, of course, the "running track" is missing.</seg>
<seg id="26">The most crowded are the restaurants along the street.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly crown, finds clear words.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already a threat to life.</seg>
<seg id="29">Not only him, but all the restaurants "hit hard".</seg>
<seg id="30">The customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.</seg>
<seg id="31">We must be happy about every euro turnover.</seg>
<seg id="32">The sales losses are estimated to be "well over 50 percent".</seg>
<seg id="33">The road repair had "thrown back two years".</seg>
<seg id="34">He had had to dismiss half of his staff.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, the policy would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, Jörg Schmidt, the President of the Government, responded to a question by Göhner about whether there could be a financial compensation, that the restaurant would benefit from the advantages of the situation at B 27. Now it must also bear the disadvantages that result from the renovation.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other districts, where something more generous was handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">In all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family business has been established here since 1715, he points to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">The fact that other regular visitors are now less frequent, because of the complicated traffic management, can understand.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can not go, it is also beautiful elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="42">The fact that his regular clientele will return after the end of the reconstruction work has no doubt in this regard.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises with BSE and bird flu, Göhner considers the impact of the B 27 construction work on his customers the biggest crisis his restaurant has experienced in its long history.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six months of construction work is already brutal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Constitutions are constantly being made in the name of terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="2">After the latest attacks, Minister of the Interior de Maizière now presents a thick security package.</seg>
<seg id="3">But what does a toleration status have to do with terror?</seg>
<seg id="4">And what does the coalition partner say to all this?</seg>
<seg id="5">Thomas de Maizière gives the reconciler.</seg>
<seg id="6">All his proposals are "politically reasonable" to the coalition partner, says the Federal Minister of the Interior at the presentation of his new security package.</seg>
<seg id="7">They do not overwhelm anyone.</seg>
<seg id="8">Other, wider points were initially discussed within the parties.</seg>
<seg id="9">I also participate in it.</seg>
<seg id="10">As interior minister, however, he was concerned with results and a "achievable consensus" within the coalition.</seg>
<seg id="11">De Maizière, after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, let a little time pass before he presented his conclusions on security in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="12">But they are all the more extensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">Some are already known, announced, targeted: That a new security authority should take care of the cracking of encrypted communication is not new.</seg>
<seg id="14">Nor is the fact that Germany has to implement several EU provisions on passenger data and arms legislation.</seg>
<seg id="15">The call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is also not surprising.</seg>
<seg id="16">In part, de Maizière is launching a second run for proposals that the SPD has so far failed to do: he wants to punish sympathy for terrorist groups and jihadists with dual citizenship unbutton the German passport.</seg>
<seg id="17">"These will be difficult points for the SPD," admits the CDU man.</seg>
<seg id="18">He considers this to be reasonable and does not call for anything that does not have any chances with the coalition partner anyway.</seg>
<seg id="19">De Maizière also presents a few new ideas.</seg>
<seg id="20">They have a part in themselves: they are planning rapid procedures for deportations and more possibilities for the imprisonment of people before deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees who are targeted in the country should first check their smartphones and reveal social media accounts for a security check.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the case of toleration for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some worse than before - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately discard their papers in order to conceal their identity.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of this is politically and legally delicate.</seg>
<seg id="24">There are also things that are still unsung and leave questions open.</seg>
<seg id="25">And on some points - in the case of the uneven treatment of the tolerated, for example - the question arises: What actually has to do with security and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, de Maizière says it is important to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it can not be denied that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">In addition, many people were worried about security because of the high numbers of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="29">And things that people were deeply concerned about could not be excluded even in election times.</seg>
<seg id="30">The internal security is enormously in the focus.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The uncertainty is great.</seg>
<seg id="34">And yes, there are election campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Union and the SPD are therefore becoming more and more active in the area of internal security.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the past few days, the two parties have been high.</seg>
<seg id="37">Only a nasty dispute over the equipment of the federal police, then on a security policy collection of some interior ministers of the interior, in which the heads of departments also demand a Burka ban and a departure from the dual citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="38">De Maizière is also concerned here with conciliatory tones.</seg>
<seg id="39">He did not think anything of a departure from the double pass.</seg>
<seg id="40">We have pacified the discussion in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">Reopening it is not useful.</seg>
<seg id="42">And in the case of a Burka ban, he had constitutional concerns.</seg>
<seg id="43">Whether his own package at all corners is constitutionally determined and whether it is actually "reasonable" for the coalition partner, must first show.</seg>
<seg id="44">There is a lot in it, which could cause dispute.</seg>
<seg id="45">But the SPD is also currently trying to shape the issue of internal security.</seg>
<seg id="46">"The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security", says Sigmar Gabriel.</seg>

<seg id="1">Nor is Volkswagen going through lightly.</seg>
<seg id="2">Despite Dieselskandals, the delivery figures are increasing worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="3">But not all markets are running smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the recall action, vortexes are a concept.</seg>
<seg id="5">Volkswagen starts with the deliveries more cautiously in the second half-year.</seg>
<seg id="6">Europe's largest car maker can continue to show a positive performance despite the fact that the company's diesel engines are still operating thanks to its many brands and some well-running markets.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, in July the core brand VW weakened mainly in Western Europe and thus again burdened the total sales, as the Dax-listed company communicated.</seg>
<seg id="8">In July, the VW brand sold 449100 cars, down 1.8 percent fewer than in the previous month.</seg>
<seg id="9">In Western Europe alone, the second-largest market after China, sales were down 14 percent year-on-year.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the home market of Germany, deliveries fell by almost one-sixth.</seg>
<seg id="11">Brandvertriebschef Jürgen Stackmann led the weaker figures from July, mainly on two sales days less in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="12">Moreover, in some core markets "purchasing power" had been retained by "changed economic conditions".</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey, the British vote also had an impact on the withdrawal from the EU, explained a spokeswoman.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US, where the exhaust gas escalation first escalated, there is also a further minus.</seg>
<seg id="15">Great support for VW is the Chinese market.</seg>
<seg id="16">All in all, the mainly affected housemark of the Lower Saxony is still light-hearted by the diesel scandal: After the first seven months, only a delivery margin of 0.9 per cent to 3.37 million vehicles is booked.</seg>
<seg id="17">Group sales manager Fred Kappler continued to show a sales slump from January to July.</seg>
<seg id="18">1.3 percent more vehicles were delivered by Volkswagen during this period, 5.904 million worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="19">Volkswagen had manipulated with a software exhaust test.</seg>
<seg id="20">Alone in Germany, VW is calling for some 2.5 million cars to be converted into the workshops.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the course of the conversion VW confirmed that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects.</seg>
<seg id="22">After the conversion of the vehicles there was no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to the builder, the customer would issue a "guarantee-equivalent" certificate after the conversion, but he did not speak of a "guarantee", as it was called in company days on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="24">The reason was legal subtleties.</seg>
<seg id="25">The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen now gives its German customers a guarantee for converted diesel models.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would have confirmed VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday.</seg>
<seg id="27">It was confirmed by the Ministry of Transport that this meeting existed.</seg>
<seg id="28">"VW has to fulfill the requirements of my investigation commission and the KBA in full."</seg>
<seg id="29">"Deviations from this are not accepted," said Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), according to the ministry.</seg>
<seg id="30">VW has taken over the warranty that no deterioration takes place after the retrofitting in the case of fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power and that all vehicle approval values relevant to type approval remain unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="31">Volkswagen itself does not use the term "guarantee" as it was called in company.</seg>
<seg id="32">With the broad concept of "guarantee", Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers, for example six months after retrofitting, might come to a workshop with a motor damage - and this could be attributed to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.</seg>
<seg id="33">In the interests of the customer, it is also important to avoid the possibility of any possible damage to the exhaustion dilemma resulting in uncertainty as to the possible guarantee arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="34">Therefore VW does not use the term "guarantee".</seg>

<seg id="1">The Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee demands a lot of savings from future savers - as the second institute in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="2">Bank chief Josef Paul said on Thursday: "It is only about 139 customers, who park 40 million euros on giro or day money accounts".</seg>
<seg id="3">The Federal Association of German Banks speaks of a single case and does not see any signal: Normal savers would "not have to pay penal rates for their savings".</seg>
<seg id="4">When banks spend money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they must pay their 0.4 percent penalty.</seg>
<seg id="5">From September, Raiffeisenbank Gmund will demand this fee from private and corporate clients for deposits of more than EUR 100,000 on giro or daily money accounts.</seg>
<seg id="6">"The first 100,000 euros are free."</seg>
<seg id="7">"The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year," said Paul.</seg>
<seg id="8">He has been guarding for some time 40 million euros, which could be lifted from one day to the next and which he could not recycle.</seg>
<seg id="9">"They lie with me in the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent costs," said the bank chief.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I can not lay down 4000 euros for every million."</seg>
<seg id="11">The costs are now passed on according to the polluter pays principle.</seg>
<seg id="12">To leave the cash simply in the Raiffeisenbank vaults would be much too dangerous: "I've already experienced four raids, I do not want to be the fifth!" Said the head of the bank.</seg>
<seg id="13">Most customers would understand and switch to other forms of investment.</seg>
<seg id="14">Only a few migrated to other banks.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Cooperative Association of Bavaria stated: "The extreme monetary policy course of the ECB causes considerable costs for all banks".</seg>
<seg id="16">To bear them alone is "permanently unworkable".</seg>
<seg id="17">Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for bank accounts, credit cards or bank transfers.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Thüringer Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land, with its Skatbank branch in 2014, had made headlines with interest on penalties for deposits of more than three million euros.</seg>
<seg id="19">Michael Kemmer, chief executive officer of the banking association, said: "We do not expect private customers to pay flat-rate charges for deposits, but the competition in Germany is far too strong among banks and savings banks."</seg>
<seg id="20">A banker said there is "a clientele that is more lushly endowed with assets" at Tegernsee.</seg>
<seg id="21">"This can become a problem for a small bank", if they are free of money.</seg>
<seg id="22">Founded in 1911, the Genossenschaftsbank Gmund has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the region famous actors, sportsmen and entrepreneurs live.</seg>
<seg id="24">The cooperative association of Bavaria "currently no other banks are known, which charge a reimbursement of expenses for deposits of private customers," said spokesman Ernst.</seg>
<seg id="25">The President of the Federal Association of German People's Banks and Raiffeisen Banks (BVR), Uwe Fröhlich, declared at the end of June: "The threshold to go negatively towards the private customer is very, very high."</seg>
<seg id="26">The competition is tough, and it threatens the migration of investors to the competition.</seg>
<seg id="27">The customers in Germany will not be pleased with the width.</seg>

<seg id="2">Lonely middle-aged men love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you rush to the comment section to sneak it out under the pseudonym NotAlleEinsamenMännerMittlerenAlters with harsh insults, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the much-discussed re-emergence of records is not due to a boom in millennials that want to welcome the novelty of physical objects, but to mid-life nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently purchased a plate are most likely to be between the ages of 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes of hobbies - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers keep their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you agree with the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog were a news report on TV, I would follow the camera as I walk in the middle of a bustling street in Soho, wear a modest gray suit and stalk wildly before I stand still, hold my hands and say something definite like, "Let's take a closer look."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where once independent vendors were resident - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specials.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the camera man to turn off the camera for the next part, where I am in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records, is one day long for a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they appeared and again to buy items that he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. Things I was probably a bit too young to buy them to me," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records are more introverted and like to spend their own time, and adds, "I do not smoke and I do not drink very much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">Wez, 25, who works for Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers he meets apply to the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">He has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media hit, people who have heard about the comeback and are looking to buy their old records again.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations I have conducted, people have usually departed from their collection in 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom in followers of the plate revival of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the supposed emotional meaning of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It only takes a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to Wez, some of the older customers took offense at the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record covers, of objects that evoke happy memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the filling of an emptiness or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," says Wez.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is so with me as a collector so and I think that it is with many people like that.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is an easy way to mentally deal.</seg>
<seg id="34">"We are like their social workers!" A colleague from a plate pile out.</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey by the ICM in April reveals that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not listened to it yet.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record have no record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very worried while I leaf through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works for Sounds of the Universe, has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"Someone just came in here recently and said," I do not have a record player, but I'd like to buy a radiohead record so I can put it on the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More product-compliant, less music-resistant.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say, "I do not have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones, who are only slowly coming.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, who has devoted almost a whole floor to the records, has a colorful audience when I go.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beast's newest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz booms out of the speakers - it is good to see such a diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks very lonely, but gnawing mental trauma is hard to pinpoint when you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around the shop for several minutes and is looking at the variety of plates available for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is more like a window shopping than a big shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">It does not earn much, so collecting plates is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to hear music from a computer or some other way, but the beauty of records is ... "she drifts off with a sigh of love.</seg>
<seg id="53">I do not know how to explain it - it is truly unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a store that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I seem to be looking at the jeans hotpants, I watch a group of young teenage girls grouping around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter decide to buy a Crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">To the left is a staircase, a wall full of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far up that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "plate art".</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these items could make more money for the industry and send some customers to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is the one that spends most on luxury items such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research has shown that the results of YouGov are right, at least in record shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors who exist in reality, record stores and online forums are disregarded.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard in school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They certainly do not spend their Thursday morning strolling through Berwick Street records and leafing through plates, while avoiding the staring gaze of an eerie, thirty-year-old fake presenter who stands out over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.</seg>

<seg id="1">French court denies offer of demolition of transactions in the jungle refugee camp</seg>
<seg id="2">A French court has refused an offer from the authorities in Calais to kill dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, home to thousands of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="3">At a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be allowed to break down 72 provisional deals in which people within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Calais Prefecture argued that these places should be demolished because they would constitute a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would pose a fire and sanitary risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important, as the free meals offered by the government-backed association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also claimed that the provisional shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of the 72 provisional businesses, but acknowledged that the concerns of the Calais prefecture were "absolutely comprehensible."</seg>
<seg id="8">Judge Jean-François Molla said that the food, cafés and restaurants would play a much greater role than merely to feed people "living in extremely precarious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places threatened by tearing down was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the Camp, which is run on a non-profit basis, offering 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as advice on asylum matters for the hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to protect the Kids' Café.</seg>
<seg id="12">In a letter to the Guardian, it was said that the closure "for these children would be a disaster, of which the recent eight years are old."</seg>
<seg id="13">The two aid organizations, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle had risen to more than 9,000 people, the highest number so far, following a steep increase in new arrivals during the summer.</seg>

<seg id="1">Here comes the Enforcement Trailer</seg>
<seg id="2">Germany's racers have to adapt to the next generation of speedometers: New flash units are being tested in different federal states, including in Hesse and Brandenburg, which are supposed to transfer tempo faders particularly effectively.</seg>
<seg id="3">The futuristic Enforcement trailers of the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used, for example, at major areas of accidents where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.</seg>
<seg id="4">For example, at motorway construction sites or temporary bridges with temporary tempolimit, there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide a stationary speed camera for speed limitation.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, a permanent mobile structure can be too dangerous or complicated.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Enforcement Trailer is self-sufficient: its battery keeps five days with continuous measuring operation, the case data is transferred encrypted over a modem.</seg>
<seg id="7">With laser measurement technology, all vehicles can also be recorded simultaneously over several tracks.</seg>
<seg id="8">Variable speed limits as well as transit restrictions by time, lane and vehicle class can also be monitored.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the high state you can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with any car with trailer coupling.</seg>
<seg id="10">So that it is not simply stolen, it is lowered in the measuring mode, so that the wheels in the armored and by the way also shuffle-safe outer cover disappear.</seg>
<seg id="11">In addition, a built-in alarm system to protect the speed camera from vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since 2015, the trailer has been tested and used in several federal states, according to Vitronic.</seg>
<seg id="13">Also foreign authorities are flashing with the new technology: Recently, France has ordered 100 pieces, after an order of 150 pieces last year.</seg>

<seg id="1">The UK is bringing silver in the 7-rugby after Fiji brings Masterclass Gold</seg>
<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Great Britain in the 7th rugby came in the final on Thursday evening to an abrupt stop at the last hurdle in the form of the Fijis, when they were beaten with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji gave a masterclass in handling, side stepping, tracking, running, and raw strength to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was sweetened by the not so bad trophy of the silver medal - the UK's fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semifinal on the same day might fall back on them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of this, Fiji would have hit a 15-man team in the best form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for GB - but probably not - that at least a British will have a gold medal hanging around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's chief Ben Ryan, the former head for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult road behind it.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens under Ryan.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This blow will hurt, but the progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started wonderfully and let GB's attacks bounce off for fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt like the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. were running in the running buses. The World Series winners went 5-0 up as Osea Kolinisau rushed in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With another four minutes of play, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner, which he converted.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB has hardly tackled the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A prominent tackle from Mitchell stopped the mountain from Man Leone Nakarawa to score a third goal, but it has stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua leveled a touchdown in the right corner and it was 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the re-start and there was still a one-minute game time ... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou broke through the GB team's weak tackle and went to the line to score a goal.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is as if Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB is still there.</seg>
<seg id="22">So it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB made major changes at half time, closing the Fijian gap ... for a full four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half until Josua Tuisova went through after a brilliant interim play from Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started a test for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game had long gone in favor of the South Seesulians whose fans were singing, waving flags and dancing in the stands.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not hard to admire Fijis' playful approach.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle sounded, the Fijis embraced each other and GB kicked killingly into the lawn.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier in the day Fiji Japan had defeated 20-5 in the semi-finals and the United Kingdom pushed South Africa in a tight semi-final match - Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Boks forward in the first half but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal under the post in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late tackle by Marcus Watson, brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have been inspired by the trainer's cancer to ride the helm</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no more emotinal gold than with these games and that will mean something.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first helm to the last, 220 hard hieve that go down in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even if they were only the two who were at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. Robin Williams' echo was all-rounder as they rowed to the second Olympic gold medal in the second without the helm, the first women in the history of British sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolute, after all their unbeaten run, which is also unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athletes who glide over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the kind of triumph to the full.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in the row is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental advances that make the difference and no one was more helpful than the trainer who did not know 30 months ago if he would ever survive the day when cancer was diagnosed.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said, he was risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer that is operable and they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes the view somewhat.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky to be able to start treatment in early 2014, off-season, which would keep the interruption to a minimum, if that is the right term under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to get better soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps would suffice.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing itself is a challenge, but it makes it even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the immediacy of the victory their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve-racking morning talking more than usual, trying to deal with his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Stanning, who was the main man at the Royal Artillery Regiment in Afghanistan, said, "I was an emotional wreck this week, which is perhaps something extreme, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It only repeats how much it means to me how much I and Helen and Robin have worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin, we would be no one, so a massive thank you to him. He is the best coach in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I could not have asked for a better person to train or a better coach.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the past five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The pair had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to unlock, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very caught right now.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen cried "stay in the process, stay in the process".</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important not to get carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not looking to make something great.</seg>
<seg id="33">We did not want a fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, which we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about their future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover must appear next week at a wedding, her own with TV adventurer Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I did not want to say that was my last race.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have meant too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">In London it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympian winner.</seg>
<seg id="40">It was all so new to me and I was so stressed.</seg>
<seg id="41">It took about four minutes.</seg>
<seg id="42">It feels so much better, "she said.</seg>

<seg id="1">31 years of exemplary clarity</seg>
<seg id="2">The managing director of the Wasserzweckverband "Veitensteingruppe", Ruppert Göller, retires.</seg>
<seg id="3">The association is regarded as "exemplary in Bavaria".</seg>
<seg id="4">A small Franconian drinking water association as a model for the large water producers.</seg>
<seg id="5">So it was called some time ago in the original sound in a contribution of the Bavarian Rundfunks.</seg>
<seg id="6">A little later, the government's water forum paid tribute to the government of underfiles.</seg>
<seg id="7">The work of the Veitensteingruppe was "exemplary in Bavaria".</seg>
<seg id="8">Behind all this, Rupert Göller, who has been a member of the Employees' Association for 31 years, has 28 years as Managing Director.</seg>
<seg id="9">Now he was retired at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Drinking Water Purification Association of the Veitsteingruppe, headquartered in Kottendorf, municipality of Bretbrunn, promotes about 150000 cubic meters of water annually and supplies 32 villages and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">The communities Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach are members of the municipality.</seg>
<seg id="12">Water supply contracts exist for other cities and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current chairman, Breitbrunn's mayoress Gertrud Bühl (FW), reminded that Rupert Göller was hired as water manager in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Special Purpose Association in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"His tasks have been very diverse, ranging from water pipeline construction and maintenance to office and organizational activities, budgeting, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency situations on weekends," the chairman said.</seg>
<seg id="15">In 1994, the company announced that it had commissioned and inaugurated the new wells (1994), land purchases in the area of the new wells (1998) and compensation for farmers, refurbishment of high containers (1999), new acquisition of a central computer control system (2004) and partial renewal of water pipes.</seg>
<seg id="16">There has been no standstill at all, and innovations have been introduced since water is life and drinking water is the most important food.</seg>
<seg id="17">In her laudation she praised Göller's faithful, reliable and correct service for over 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">He has worked with a lot of Herzblut for his Wasserzweckverband and he has lived the Wasserzweckverband rightly, as if it were his own enterprise.</seg>
<seg id="19">Just a few weeks ago, he had been able to present the success concept of the group of companies for nitrate reduction before the water forum of the district of Unterfranken.</seg>
<seg id="20">For this he received a lot of recognition and praise.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rupert Göller praised Wasserwart Alfons Griebel, who had worked with him for 28 years.</seg>
<seg id="22">He is the best water keeper and he was a faithful squire.</seg>
<seg id="23">Together we were an unbeatable team.</seg>

<seg id="27">Also the supply of Neubrunn could only be maintained, because one filled the high container of Pettstadt with hoses.</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - light sight for German steel industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-stricken and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared from additional costs in millions of euros.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial strains, which threatened the industry from the promotion of green electricity, are off the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the case of the exemption from the Renewable Energies apportionment in the existing facilities, the Federal Minister of the Economy, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition) said that the German steel industry was to be freed from the Renewable Energies.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I am really glad that we could finally achieve this after two years of tough negotiations."</seg>
<seg id="6">The European Commission had therefore initially planned to ask steel producers, who use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the German industry association, the steel industry was facing additional costs of € 120 to 240 million per year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel told the WAZ that there is now a basic agreement with the EU Commission after discussions with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only when the generators in the steelworks were replaced did an EEG apportionment of 20 per cent occur.</seg>
<seg id="10">But this too is not collected in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed the unification of Germany with the EU Commission on the generation of own power.</seg>
<seg id="12">Thus, the status quo of the previous regulation is largely fixed.</seg>
<seg id="13">Gabriel's successful efforts for the steel industry are of particular importance.</seg>
<seg id="14">"With regard to our campaign 'Steel is the future', this is a first step."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Others must follow."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Climate and employment targets are also to be weighed in the reform of emissions trading," IG Metall CEO Jörg Hofmann explained in Frankfurt.</seg>
<seg id="17">Since the financial crisis in 2008, the steel sector in Europe has suffered from overcapacity and a considerable price pressure.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year, the situation intensified further as the world's largest producer country stepped up steel on the world market in the face of the weaker domestic demand.</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers are imposing price dumping on Chinese steel groups.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the course of this spring the situation has relaxed somewhat.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand, import duties imposed on imported steel have acted, and on the other hand economic prospects have brightened in China.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry prime Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the end, prices had stagnated again.</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry is reacting to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">Thyssenkrupp did not want to exclude the closure of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the German steel industry, around 86,000 people were employed at the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="28">In July, German steel producers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.</seg>
<seg id="29">At 3.4 million tons, they produced well six percent less crude steel than in the previous month, as the steel industry association announced on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="30">After a short increase in May the quantity produced now went back one after the other for the second month.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since the beginning of the year, production has been two percent below the previous year's figure.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Association expects an increase in output in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, spirit, health: Singing is good for seniors</seg>
<seg id="2">Ursel Kipp has been involved in singing her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, she studied music in her lehramt studies, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she says.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and altogether livelier, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good for her health and her spirit.</seg>
<seg id="6">Singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler from the German Senior Citizens League.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in chorus and share the joy of the music with like-minded people, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through the regular gathering, seniors can socialize and cultivate social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because social and family structures often disappear in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">This experience has also been made by Ursel Kipp in her choir: "To be able to talk and to organize, to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of cooperation".</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be strenuous in the positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">For this, seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">If you regularly ask for your lungs, you do not get so fast out of your daily routine.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even when it comes to keeping the tone of the voice in old age, singing is an ideal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">Singen has often had a very special effect on the elderly, says Ursula Lenz from the Bundesarbeitsgemeinschaft der Senioren-Organisationen.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations the singing together had a much higher priority, it was part of everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in the elderly arouses many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through song texts and particularly melodies, even dementia patients recall long-standing events.</seg>
<seg id="19">When singing, the head is also called for a special performance, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, concentrating on one's own voice and on a given rhythm while adapting to the other singers is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Older people, who live alone, practice not only to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition one gets through the singing in a choir, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Self-esteem also grows through singing in a choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: When I practice for a long time, I become better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start singing, there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Anyone who wants to try out a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he means to have little talent, advises Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="28">One does not sing alone - in 50 singing people, who is listening to it when a sound goes wrong?</seg>
<seg id="29">In the search for the right offer, seniors have different possibilities, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone from the circle of acquaintances sings in a seniors' choir, one can simply join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer surveys on the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">If you want to sing in a church choir, you can go directly to the church or the church head.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many seniors choirs can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">If you do not have access to the Internet, you can ask the family, friends or neighbors for help with internet searches.</seg>
<seg id="35">If you want to sing, you should definitely join a choir, Hackler advises.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that is true for all ages.</seg>

<seg id="1">Cats react more sensitively as hangovers to cries of the beasts</seg>
<seg id="2">In Hanover, biologists have investigated the effects of calling cats on adult animals.</seg>
<seg id="3">To their surprise, the meowing did not leave the males cold - but they always behaved the same as the females.</seg>
<seg id="4">Female cats can recognize the excitement of catbabies at the meow of the small.</seg>
<seg id="5">They react ten per cent faster to sounds of kittens, who are in great need, as scientists from the Veterinary College and the Medical University of Hannover (MHH) have found out.</seg>
<seg id="6">Kater also respond to the calls of kittens - however, always the same.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Apparently the acoustic differences between the meandering of less and strongly excited young animals are either not perceptible or not important for the males," said biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.</seg>
<seg id="8">She is the first author of the study published this Friday in the specialist magazine "BMC Evolutionary Biology".</seg>
<seg id="9">In a previous study the researcher had already found out that the duration and pitch of the kitten cries differed with the urgency of their need for help.</seg>
<seg id="10">A total of nine adult cats and eight kittens from the animal husbandry of the MHH were observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">On the one hand, they were called by small children, who were taken out of the throwing box for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings.</seg>
<seg id="12">On the other hand, they were confronted with cries of more excited kittens, which were additionally raised.</seg>
<seg id="13">The researchers consider their results to be meaningful despite the low sample.</seg>
<seg id="14">"All females, even those who did not have their own offspring, responded differently to the screams," said Konerding.</seg>
<seg id="15">They turned to the loudspeaker more quickly when the calls of the more excited kitties took place.</seg>
<seg id="16">This ability is possibly congenital or develops with the sexual maturity.</seg>
<seg id="17">"One surprise was that the males have responded at all," said the biologist.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the past, scientists have repeatedly investigated the reactions of women and men to baby sounds in humans.</seg>
<seg id="19">Some studies also showed that women reacted more sensitively to infants, whether they were already mothers or not, reports the biologist Marina Scheumann.</seg>

<seg id="2">Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="3">A warrant of arrest has been issued in Turkey against former footballer Hakan Sükür.</seg>
<seg id="4">He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.</seg>
<seg id="5">For the first time after the coup attempt an important football game takes place in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="6">Before the match between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul for the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: "Business as usual" is announced.</seg>
<seg id="7">Even in the imposition of the state of emergency after the coup attempt in July, the government argued that the everyday life of ordinary citizens should not be impaired.</seg>
<seg id="8">But this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is responsible for the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="9">Even before the football is not stopped.</seg>
<seg id="10">Against the former Starkicker Hakan Sükür, the prosecutor issued a warrant for arrest.</seg>
<seg id="11">Accordingly, the South Sudan now living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.</seg>
<seg id="12">Sükür is supposed to be a supporter of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is blamed by the President of the Republic, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, for the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is true that the state of exile, which was initially imposed for 90 days, still applies until October, but in fact this has almost no effect on the lives of most Turks.</seg>
<seg id="14">The nightly "democracy guards" in public places across the country has declared Erdogan on Wednesday for finished.</seg>
<seg id="15">The sport, like the whole country, is divided into the followers and opponents of Erdogan.</seg>
<seg id="16">Especially fans of the Besiktas workers' club traditionally do not belong to the president's friends.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, the majority of the Turks are united by dramatic experiences in history, which is the strict rejection of military putsches.</seg>
<seg id="18">Even the fans agree - no matter if their hearts beat for Galatasaray or Besiktas.</seg>
<seg id="19">At the Pokal winner "Gala", Lukas Podolski will be particularly keen to return.</seg>
<seg id="20">His sporting achievement proved the Cologne in the past season: With 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions, the 31-year-old finished his first season as top scorer of his club.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the final against Fenerbahce he scored the 1: 0-winner.</seg>
<seg id="22">The newspaper "Fanatik" cheered him: "He was the best in the square."</seg>
<seg id="23">He finished the season in an excellent way and secured his trophy for his team.</seg>
<seg id="24">Thanks to "Poldi" the disappointing season for the record champion was a conciliatory conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="25">After the preliminary knockout knockout in the Champions League, the "Löwen" departed early in the Europa League.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the Süper Lig it was only sixth.</seg>
<seg id="27">The season was not good.</seg>
<seg id="28">The trophy was the only way to win something.</seg>
<seg id="29">"We did it and that's the most important thing," said Podolski.</seg>
<seg id="30">For Master Besiktas, the year went better.</seg>
<seg id="31">Above all thanks to Mario Gomez, who laid the basis for the 14th title with 26 Sais matches as a Süper Lig goalkeeper.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="33">The Gomez, who was under contract at the AC Florence and only loaned to Besiktas, had announced after the coup attempt that he would not return because of the political situation in the country after his EM-holidays.</seg>
<seg id="34">"If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say it," quoted the specialist magazine "Kicker" Clubchef Fikret Orman.</seg>
<seg id="35">However, the striker would have to be prepared to forgo a third of his annual salary worth 7.5 million euros, Orman said: "We can not pay his salary in Florence".</seg>

<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Julia Stepanova is not allowed to start in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="4">Other athletic athletes can only laugh at it - they fight for medals in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="5">The issue of doping still determines the headlines at the Rio Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Russian swimmer, Yulia Jefimova, who had sued her right of entry shortly before the games after a doping ban, was mercilessly knocked out and booed at her start (100 meters breast).</seg>
<seg id="7">There was a bizarre scene: with a raised smile, she had strolled into the hall and had provoked with her appearance.</seg>
<seg id="8">The audience broke into a jubilee when it was clear that they were not going to get gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">But there are a lot of other athletes who are going to take part in the Olympics in Rio despite the doping past.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here is an overview:</seg>
<seg id="11">Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100 m-relay / USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics.</seg>
<seg id="12">He has already been banned twice for doping (2001 and 2006 to 2010).</seg>
<seg id="13">Since his spell, the Olympian winner of 2004 and ex-world champion even faster than before, he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.80 seconds and is considered the biggest challenger of Usain Bolt.</seg>
<seg id="14">Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100 m relay / Jamaica): The two-time Olympic champion and seven-time world champion had to hold a six-month suspension after her taking the painkiller Oxycodone.</seg>
<seg id="15">She had a strong toothache after an operation, the 29-year-old defended herself.</seg>
<seg id="16">Sandra Perkovic (Diskus / Croatia): In 2011, the Olympic champion of 2012, world champion of 2013 and European champion from 2010 to 2016 was positively tested for the forbidden stimulant medium methylhexanamine.</seg>
<seg id="17">Perkovic denied knowledge and was suspended for six months.</seg>
<seg id="18">The four longest throws this year will go to the account of the big gold favorite.</seg>
<seg id="19">LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400-m-Relay / USA): The Beijing Olympian winner and two-time world champion over 400 m, had been positively tested in 2010 and blocked for 21 months.</seg>
<seg id="20">A means for penis enlargement was responsible, replied Merritt.</seg>
<seg id="21">This year, the 30-year-old is over 200 and 400 m the fastest man in the world.</seg>
<seg id="22">Iwan Tichon (hammer throw, Belarus): It was hardly an athlete who was able to recognize so many medals.</seg>
<seg id="23">Thus, Tichon lost his world title of 2005 nine years later, after him testosterone doping was determined.</seg>
<seg id="24">The 40-year-old also had to surrender Olympic silver 2004 due to steroid doping and the 2006 European Championship due to testosterone abuse.</seg>
<seg id="25">The bronze medal of the Olympic Games 2008, which was likewise known, was returned on the basis of a judgment of the International Court of Sports Court CAS.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Austrian embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, said the speaker of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Thomas Schnöll, Freitagfrüh.</seg>
<seg id="3">She had suffered cuts and had been treated in the hospital, but she had already left her.</seg>
<seg id="4">She planned her return home for the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="5">Whether the further explosions on the tourist island of Phuket, as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon also Austrian citizens are affected, is still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="6">The foreign ministry is in constant contact with local authorities, says Schnöll.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the Hua Hin, about 200 kilometers south of the capital Bangkok, two bombs exploded in a nightlife area on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to police, a Thai woman was killed and some 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutchmen and three Italians.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Friday morning, another two bombshells went up again, according to the authorities, another person was killed.</seg>
<seg id="10">A bomb explosion was also reported in the morning from Phuket.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the detonation near the Patong beach, which was popular with tourists, a taxi driver was injured.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Surat Thani on the southeast coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing an urban employee.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the authorities, the blast gun had burst into the air in a flowerbed in front of the police station.</seg>
<seg id="14">Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwest coast as well as in Chumphon on the southeast coast demanded several injuries.</seg>
<seg id="15">They are talking about a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, they said.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The bombshells carry the same manuscript," said army general Danai Kritmethavee Friday morning before journalists.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We assume that this is a coordinated attack."</seg>
<seg id="18">It was too early to comment on possible motives - but probably the deeds of Muslim rebels.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the attacks, Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern typical of the bombing of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the assassinations were not related to the Islamic uprising movement or to international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"This is only local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces," said a spokesman in Bangkok.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rather, it is assumed that the bombs were placed by opponents of the ruling military junta.</seg>
<seg id="23">The authorities had received intelligence in the past few days about the impending attacks in the south of the country, but they had not been informed of the exact date and places.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police instructed their officials across the country to strengthen security around important government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment areas.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Thailand there are always small bomb attacks, but they are mostly not directed against tourists.</seg>
<seg id="27">In Hua Hin lies a palace, which was used for years by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">After the recent bomb explosions, the Austrian Foreign Ministry on its website recommends that the Thai security authorities strictly follow the instructions.</seg>
<seg id="29">High security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="30">After disputes between the security forces and the Muslim population, it is advised not to travel to these provinces.</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution prepared by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This will also give the military great influence in the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">Junta chief and prime minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs had been an attempt to create chaos as the country moved towards stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The militia, which had taken power after a period of bloody unrest in 2014, has benefited itself in having restored the kingdom to stability and order.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, the military has not succeeded in getting to grips with the rebellion of Muslim rebels, which has been smoldering for years in the far south.</seg>
<seg id="37">In the conflict, more than 6500 people have already been killed.</seg>
<seg id="38">Just over a year ago, 20 people were killed in a bombing of a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was the most bloody attack on the country's recent history.</seg>

<seg id="1">The right "identity movement" has become the target of the Federal Office for Protection of the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="2">After several state offices, the constitutional protectionists in the Confederation also placed the group under observation.</seg>
<seg id="3">"We see the" identity movement "as a sign of efforts to achieve the democratic freedom of the democratic order," said Hans-Georg Maaßen, constitutional protection chief of the German Press Agency in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="4">Thus, immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are defamed extremistically.</seg>
<seg id="5">That is why we are now watching the movement.</seg>
<seg id="6">The "Identity Movement" is a grouping of French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="7">It turns against "multicultural madness", "uncontrolled mass migration" and the "loss of one's own identity by means of alienation".</seg>
<seg id="8">Constitutionalists in nine federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hesse, Berlin, Baden-Wuerttemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - are already observing the "identity".</seg>
<seg id="9">Maaßen said that his authority had worked closely with the Landesamtes on the decision.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Groups like the 'Identity Movement' are trying to get their target group where they are," said the Constitutional Commissioner.</seg>
<seg id="11">In general, extremists try to address them with a youthful language, often with poppy music.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Islamists as well as the right-wing extremists.</seg>

<seg id="18">Maaßen said that he had no knowledge about this.</seg>
<seg id="19">For the protection of the constitution, possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point onwards.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is a question of whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - is changing its direction of direction by certain persons who are extremist, and becomes so extremist.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is therefore decisive whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is not apparent.</seg>
<seg id="23">With a view to the significant increase in the number of right-wing crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelters, Maaßen said that he would not be talking about terrorism again.</seg>
<seg id="24">But in the last few years we have noticed that there can be a right-wing terrorist structure.</seg>
<seg id="25">There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freital group.</seg>
<seg id="26">It may well be that other right-wing terrorist groupings or microgroups are formed that plan attacks against asylum seekers, refugees' homes or attacks from other right-wing extremists.</seg>
<seg id="27">A German-wide or Europe-wide control of legal terrorism is however not recognizable.</seg>
<seg id="28">The existing groups were created at the regional level or in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="29">Worried, Maaßen was concerned that many of the attacks were on the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right scene.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is the cause of concern.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many of the suspects were not previously known as criminals, politically motivated offenders, or supporters of the right-wing scene.</seg>
<seg id="32">"So many people have committed crimes that were previously unchecked by right-wing extremists, who were perhaps politically indifferent or who, for example, chose the CDU, the SPD, or the left, which then radicalized themselves by right-wing extremist sentiment."</seg>

<seg id="2">The Olympics or world records do not always determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte during the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">At the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that he was temporarily out of sight in the TV pictures.</seg>
<seg id="5">He simply disappeared - no matter how far the section was selected.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the social networks, Habte subsequently became a viral interneethite.</seg>
<seg id="7">In fact, the 24-year-old finished his lead with a lag of 48 seconds and finished 59th place with 59 starters.</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was more of a non-athletic figure that drew the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why does the 24-year-old take part in the Olympics?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian got a special start right from the international swimming association.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to promote swimming in underrepresented countries.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since in Ethiopia most athletes are running, Habte simply wanted to do something different.</seg>
<seg id="13">Preparation is everything: Robel Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.</seg>
<seg id="14">The first nicknames quickly made the rounds.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some media called him "Robel the Whale".</seg>
<seg id="16">The English tabloid "The Sun" made fun of "Dad Bod" on the basis of a "prosperous belly".</seg>
<seg id="17">His time, he did not hit the 100 meter free-kick with a minute and almost five seconds, did not matter.</seg>
<seg id="18">Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">At the Sydney Olympics in Sydney, Eric Moussambani's run ensured media attention.</seg>
<seg id="20">Unforgettable was the appearance of the floater from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to compete in a prelude over 100 meters of Freistil alone.</seg>
<seg id="21">Frenetically, Moussambani was fired at the time.</seg>
<seg id="22">The then 22-year-old learned to swim only eight months before the Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.</seg>

<seg id="2">The consumer research company GfK is exchanging its chief Matthias Hartmann.</seg>
<seg id="3">The resignations came suddenly - but not quite surprisingly.</seg>
<seg id="4">The difficult situation of the market research company GfK suggested that the chairman of the board of directors, Matthias Hartmann, becomes all the more uncertain as long as the promises he promises do not happen.</seg>
<seg id="5">Turbulence at the head of the Nuremberg market research company GfK: Following another disappointing business figures and the resignation of the company management, the worldwide number five of the industry is facing a new start for personnel.</seg>
<seg id="6">GfK's CEO wants to leave the company by the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board, Arno Mahlert, will leave the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September.</seg>
<seg id="8">On 1 September, Gerhard Hausruckinger, a member of the Management Board, took over the management board.</seg>
<seg id="9">He is to officially assume the function of a "CEO" until a successor for Hartmann is found.</seg>
<seg id="10">As a reason for the resignation, the company called "different views" on the long-term business policy orientation.</seg>
<seg id="11">Details did not want to call a company spokesman on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="12">Who would lead the market research company in the future, is still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="13">In Friday, shareholders were said to have been disappointed by the disappointing results of the restructuring which had taken place years ago.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr. Hartmann has been at GfK since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="15">"The fruits of the restructuring are still not to be seen even after 5 years," said it.</seg>
<seg id="16">In view of the recent poor GfK business figures, any shareholder would be disturbed at some point.</seg>
<seg id="17">"If that were the case with BMW, the Quandts would do the same," they said.</seg>
<seg id="18">The company had not been able to stop its loss journey after setbacks in the previous quarters in the second quarter of 2016.</seg>
<seg id="19">At EUR 361.2 million, sales were 6.1 percent below the level of the same quarter of the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="20">In relation to the first half of the year, sales declined by 3.4 percent to 721.2 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="21">The profit in the second quarter mainly affected the lower value of the company in view of its difficult economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="22">The goodwill amortization of 139 million euros, which was necessary in the Consumer Experience division, resulted in a loss of 148.2 million euros for the Group.</seg>

<seg id="3">Two of the inmates suffered serious injuries, the police said.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 66-year-old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisenach, according to her data, had to avoid a counter-vicious truck, which was partly on the opposite lane.</seg>

<seg id="1">The charges per cubic meter of wastewater will be 3,36 Euro (previously 2,26 Euro) for Zulndberg / Lindenberg / Lopp and for Azendorf 3,64 Euro (previously 2,18 Euro) for the sewage system Neudorf / Reuth / Welschenkahl 3.44 instead of 2.10 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="2">At the plant in Azendorf the waste water charge will increase again at the latest, if appropriate improvements are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a rough calculation, the wastewater price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic meter.</seg>
<seg id="4">As mayor Bernd Steinhauser (CSU) reported, during the approval of the budget by the Landratsamt Kulmbach, it was found that these wastewater systems were subject to underfloating.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to legal grounds, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the plants on a cost-effective basis.</seg>
<seg id="6">From October 1, 2016 the citizens, as well as the commercial and industrial enterprises from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to dig deeper into the money bag.</seg>
<seg id="7">The charges are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As the manager Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the committee, a re-calculation of the fees for the sewage systems of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, overlays and undercoverings from the previous calculation period should also be offset.</seg>
<seg id="10">The grave fee increases justified Schmidt that all three sewage plants are relatively small facilities with a very low wastewater incidence ranging from 6800 to 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact, due to the small distribution base.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the wastewater volume in all three plants declined slightly.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, in the course of the last calculation period, renovation and repair expenditures had to a considerable extent been incurred for all three plants, not least because of their age.</seg>
<seg id="14">The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the facilities for Welschkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp nearly 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the Azendorf sewage plant because of a damage.</seg>
<seg id="16">The nearly 20-year-old conveyor system had to be completely overhauled in the pumping plant Welschkahl. After nearly 20 years of operation, the first clarification plant had to be excavated, the sewage sludge was disposed of and an additional ventilation option was installed in order to comply with the water legislation.</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: "These extraordinary expenses were attributable to the continued maintenance and maintenance costs, which must be taken into account accordingly in the new calculation period."</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which were significantly below the present level in the previous calculation in 2011/2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">Steinhäuser made it clear that in the case of the low level of waste water in the three plants the expenses for the operation and maintenance "fully durchschlag".</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, added Schmidt, the market community had spared major maintenance costs in sewage plants in the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="21">According to Steinhäuser, the situation for the above-mentioned plants will continue to remain precarious in the long term, especially since the supply areas of the Friesenbachtal sewage disposal network can not be extended by these facilities because they are deficient facilities.</seg>

<seg id="1">Snapchat "anime" effect criticized as an Asian cartoon</seg>
<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filter tool, Snapchat allows around 150 million users daily to change reality and play with identities in such a way that already borders the absurd.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are blunt, proprietary twisting tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfs per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All the missing parts are released to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have been criticized in the past by accusing the app of promoting Blackface or propagating white skin as a beauty ideals.</seg>
<seg id="8">When this week a few users suggested a filter that gave them slit eyes, false teeth and puffy cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - "yellow face".</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a bigger problem that the company has with diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and indignation were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat communicated that it would have disabled the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was intended to be an homage to anime characters and not as a caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced racism reminded the filter of injurious stereotypes.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student, whose tweet about the photos were widely spread, wrote that the filter was "hurtful and uncomfortable."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the contrast of a very disgusting Asian cartoon and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellowish, but the yellow face has been pulled into the depreciating extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural tripping wires.</seg>
<seg id="18">American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the equipment we all hold in our hands.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchat's large audience of young people, who are more diverse than their older counterparts, might be more likely to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">When one of Snapchat's filters creates an image that is offensive to a user, "it's much harder that such things go unnoticed than they used to be," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday, Zhu, a product manager and engineer for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account, asking others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said that she believes race-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in recruitment practices at Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticized the largely white, only male leadership, and ended her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Either they do not have a diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with different skin colors working there but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say what."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinions, a complaint that left Snapchat largely unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural background of his staff, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a personnel manager focusing on underrepresented population groups and on internal integration efforts.</seg>
<seg id="28">Zhu said that she will close her Snapchat account and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that is not O.K."</seg>

<seg id="1">The military administration distorts ISIS secret service information, establishes the Congress committee</seg>
<seg id="2">United States Central Command militants changed news intelligence to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic state in Iraq and Syria than would have permitted the actual conditions on the ground, a Congressional Review Committee reported in a Thursday report.</seg>
<seg id="3">The preliminary report, prepared by a Task Force of the Republican members of the Armed Forces Committee, the Secret Service Commission, and the Wehrbud Commander, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic state.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, or Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"News-related information typically typed by high-ranking Centcom commanders typically drew a more positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism than would have allowed the actual conditions on the ground, and were more positive than the analysis of other news services," a newspaper article quoted.</seg>
<seg id="6">"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyzes are presented to our political leaders," noted Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives.</seg>
<seg id="7">The management errors in Centcom reach to the highest point of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows in detail consistent problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyzes of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct evidence that government leaders under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts were exposed to pressure from their superiors to draw a more optimistic picture of the Islamic state's threat, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before the Congress were much more positive than the facts," the report noted.</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a Centcom official publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic state.</seg>
<seg id="13">"After months of investigation, so much is clear," said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the Central Command leaders changed the intelligence reports to reduce the risk of ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans launched the task force after they were told that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic state.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report, published on Thursday, will be completed by more detailed findings, while the investigation will continue.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports are underway by the General Engineer of the Ministry of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the intelligence community published their own findings on Thursday, which coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"In 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly limited process for the preparation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," the top-ranking Democrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Schiff, announced in an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="20">This process, Mr. Schiff said, "delayed the publication of news reports," harmed the morale among analysts, and "gave too little space for dissent."</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr Schiff and the Democrats said they had not found any evidence of White House intervention by the Centcom analysts regarding a "particular political opinion".</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the congressional investigations were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast".</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon's General Investigator, who were received after complaints from Centcom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Patrick Evans, a press officer of the Pentagon, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on any reports from the Congress while the investigator's investigations were still in progress.</seg>
<seg id="25">But he also stated that "experts sometimes have divergent opinions about the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense."</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful American-led air campaign in Iraq and Syria (a claim now made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, last year's accusations have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crises.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic state is reminiscent of more than ten years ago, when a centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document on how the then government under George W. Bush opposed the recommendations of many analysts to a small occupation group in Iraq and little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the insurrection against the current coverage of the Islamic state.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, according to government officials, the team around Mr. Hooker notes that, contrary to the government's statements, the air raids against the Islamic state's refineries had no significant impact on the financial position of the terrorist group because these provisional refineries were commissioned to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">This finding, however, was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcom's former commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the Legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced at the Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the match will decide which of the two will get the first and second place in each group of six teams.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first place finishes the strong Dutch women a little longer out of the way, the other group lead.</seg>
<seg id="10">Whatever the game may be, the Americans have triggered a surprising whirlwind through their success story, four years after landing at the last London Games on the last of 12 places.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bam was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Bluebell, Pennsylvania, and had a hockey stick in her hands for the first time at the age of three (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), at 16 she became a national player in the US, the youngest in the team's history.</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympics in 2008 because she could not qualify for the squad.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012, in which everything for her and her team went wrong.</seg>
<seg id="15">The following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, became the coach of the national team, and with that, things began to change.</seg>
<seg id="16">"A cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the workspace in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We've been able to pull the helm completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the scoring in the first half of the game with a backhand stroke from the close range.</seg>
<seg id="20">India had gone into the game without a win in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and held the game from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She made a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then pulled the ball into the goal to get the Americans a 2-0 lead.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the goalkeeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who had to score a goal in each of the previous games.</seg>
<seg id="24">She has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"We are in a good position," said Parnham, but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amidst the rage of the Olympics, the Zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, whatever time it is, it is the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro are a constant and inevitable one, a fast-paced relay race between competition and aspirations.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself were a burning stick, which is passed from the crossbow gun to the swimmer to the gymnast to the triathlete.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can not turn on the TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbors' conversation in the queue, without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the quarrel between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is part of the Olympic Games for the first time, and a swarm of women with dimples, could well have been among these well-known names broadcast at prime time by sponsors and well-being TV advertisements if he were a swimmer, gymnast, or even fencer.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is struggling for gold in the Olympic trampolines.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event alike.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in shadow are the sports, which are not generally accepted: air gun shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast-float and may it be long.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I could make modest arguments for my particular favorite, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although trampolining has been an Olympic event since 2000 when it debuted in Sydney, it has been so scantily perceived for the last 16 years that many of whom I interviewed did not know that it was an Olympics sport at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in trampolines, and by 2012 an athlete has made it to the finals.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women to share.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jumping has a certain outsider charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for a clown school than for the Olympics for the unsupervised ear.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert but only a ground-based enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartooning trembling of its never-ending impact - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that essentially unite it.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means "jumpboard."</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and have a series of falling movements (turning, pikes and somersaults) before they land on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">They are rated according to official Olympic program after execution, difficulty and "flight time".</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common olympic vector is straight.</seg>
<seg id="26">In their pursuit of gold, medalists have to go farther, faster, up and over, sometimes up to the goal, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They hunt not only the target line or the exit wall, but also another sarcastic goal in television broadcasting: the world or the Olympic record.</seg>
<seg id="28">The purposeful pursuit is classy, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to stir even a spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel when watching these games as a bit tiring.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers an Atempause.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline pringer is up.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless as an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly up again.</seg>
<seg id="34">Here, too, there is competition, not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no vaulting into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant elimination of time and power.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as competition in the Olympics can be.</seg>
<seg id="36">Women's qualification and finals will take place on Friday afternoon, streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time, and the men's on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympic mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is generally troubled.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the raising of consciousness can only be achieved by the assertion and the objectification of male athletes - as the male US gymnasts according to The Wall Street Journal recently suggested - then Mr. Dooley expects his air-confronting, new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="1">"One generation protested" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the US</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia met with violent resistance from the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that tens of thousands of protesters were killed during the clashes with the police at gunpoint.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just breaking up?</seg>
<seg id="6">Over the past ten years, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a fast-growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months protests against the government have shaken the country and expanded into more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government's response, according to human rights organizations, was ruthless.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen were shooting and killing at tens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">Videos circulating about the protests, presumably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security guards beat young people with sticks while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the United Nations Human Rights Authority is now asking for an in-depth investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"It has always been difficult to keep this country together, and in the future it will be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is, after Nigeria, the most populous country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services are working closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorism across the region, especially in Somalia. Only a few countries in Africa, if any, receive so much Western aid.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has drastically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy, human rights organizations have consistently repressed the government, the opposition in the country has been restricted, and dissidents have been effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent to exile or to prison, killed or driven into the vastness of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"If you oppress people and they have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="23">All the youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">One generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints covering everything from land use to strangleholds with regard to the power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, the tensions along the border with Eritrea are rising, a struggle for this jagged, controversial line required hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which have been more or less conquered in recent years, could exploit the turmoil and arm themselves again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness are exploding after years of aching below the surface now.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years have very many Ethiopians been able to communicate through the social media, as cheaper smartphones became more and more frequent and the Internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, which it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate through Internet proxies that hide where they are.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians said they gathered in protest.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For ages, the Amharas, coming from Ethiopia's predominantly Christian highlands, prospered in politics and economics, exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in flatland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But that too is changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"We are going to coordinate under one umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which account for about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, intelligence services, commerce and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr Meles, a former rebel leader, was prime minister until his death in a non-publicized disease in 2012 for 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think of corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say he was particularly savvy in seeing early signs of dissatisfaction and using special commissioners to deal with opponents and render them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"The current regime lacks this basic skill," said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst.</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected for relatively opaque reasons to take over the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Northern Ethiopia, Mr Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say he does not enjoy the trust of the Tigray-controlled security services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia experienced such an upheaval was in 2005, when thousands protested against elections that, according to analysts, seemed to be bogged down by the government and subsequently stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the subsequent raids, many protesters were killed, even though it was less than in recent months and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in the fight against poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal dislike of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it assumes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, protesters in Gondar, an Amharic city, started business from Tigray, and the hatred of the Tigray became more common in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The US government used Ethiopia as the basis for drones over neighboring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it has closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile area.</seg>
<seg id="59">"This," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin tightrope walk."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his allegation that Obama ISIS had been "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump attempted to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign on Friday by stating that his repeated assertion that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the terrorist group Islamic State were not serious.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raised new questions about the communication skills of the Presidential candidate of the Republicans as to whether he was in a position to communicate clearly with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings his co-workers, who strive to protect him during an eventful period, into the peculiar position of explaining statements which he could not have meant at all.</seg>
<seg id="5">After making the hint at an electoral event on Wednesday night Mr. Trump rowed back on Thursday's assertion and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to imply that President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was the opposite of the previous day, when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the accusation was quite serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to mitigate the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism rages down on Mr. Trump, while he has tried to focus his campaign on the economic situation due to falling surveys.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton gave speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump again tried to return to the subject.</seg>
<seg id="12">Reporting on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes, and that he had found her speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already presented sarcasm for his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July, he drew strong criticism when he said that the Russians were supposed to hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but he later declared, "Of course I meant the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to shift the linguistic boundaries in politics and then row back as needed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans, how they arrive, and then" clarify "depending on how the reaction goes wrong," said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has assumed a more corrosive tone since his polls have fallen further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, published on Friday, showed a lead with a great lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is generally trying not to apologize for his provocative remarks, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humor.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he is increasingly focused on attention in the last few months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps jokes have brought his loyal supporters into the uncomfortable situation of facing him, no matter how provocative his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps' most prominent advocates, took great pains to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate political comments," said Mr. Giuliani, so he was questioned about the truth of Mr. Trump's statements as to whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic state.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backbanks, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, where Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread by blocking the situation in the Middle East aggressively.</seg>
<seg id="26">Prior to the electoral campaigns in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of being bored with each of his words and being biased against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">He mocked the "poor, miserable" TV wizards who tried to understand him and said, "You can not!".</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the Democrats scoffed at Mr. Trump's apology as just another proof that he was unsuitable for the presidential office.</seg>

<seg id="1">Once pushed over the price from the market, Café returns in Greenpoint</seg>
<seg id="2">Verb Cafe was a shabby cafe in Williamsburg, where you could pay only cash, which had no Wi-Fi, but served for 15 years good coffee.</seg>
<seg id="3">Of course, by the prices from his Bedford Avenue, shopfront was crowded.</seg>
<seg id="4">The business soap Cherie replacing verb in the summer of 2014 sells soap in the form of cupcakes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Locals mourned it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.</seg>
<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change, but I still can not believe CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel except and Verb is now a soap business."</seg>
<seg id="7">But if New York is change, then it is also reinvention.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revitalized verb cafe opened in Greenpoint last November, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similar unpretentious atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the old cafe, which is owner and managing director of the new cafe.</seg>
<seg id="12">He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a customer offered him to provide funds for a new outsource, he was excited to do so, he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rodriguez, 36, maintained much.</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb used the same distributor for the Bagels bought the same espresso machine model.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said that he also wanted to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnishes like capers and sautéed onions.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are natural tear-bowls.</seg>
<seg id="21">The café no longer serves beer, but there are fresh juices.</seg>
<seg id="22">After nine months, Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regulars.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Many old customers were also ousted by Williamsburg," he said.</seg>
<seg id="24">Recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.</seg>
<seg id="25">Oliveira, 34, lived in Williamsburg before and visited the verb regularly.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after she had moved to Greenpoint, she would take the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">After the verb had closed, she gave up coffee drinking for a while, she said.</seg>
<seg id="28">"I realized it was the coffee and the culture that I liked," she said.</seg>
<seg id="29">Now she is drinking coffee again, even if she ordered a Blended Chai Tea on this day instead of her usual Iced Coffe, which is another new addition.</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Rosenthal has been a long-standing and faithful customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="31">He went there before the work and ordered inevitably always the same.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I came quarter past seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch, and they prepare my Everything-Bagel with butter," he said.</seg>
<seg id="33">Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nowadays Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his Everything bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.</seg>
<seg id="35">Rodriguez said that he had no grudge about the fact that the soap business had taken over the old business premises.</seg>
<seg id="36">In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for verb with the cold-boiled coffee of the cafe as an ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="37">"I think we'll go into their offer," Rodriguez said.</seg>
<seg id="38">And the traditional, Polish inhabitants of Greenpoints have also accepted the cafe.</seg>
<seg id="39">A new customer translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said he plans to exhibit it soon so his new neighbors feel welcome.</seg>
<seg id="40">The site also has other advantages.</seg>
<seg id="41">A local juice locale would like to fill the cold-boiled coffee into the bottle and sell it.</seg>
<seg id="42">There is a chance that the café will expand to an adjacent building.</seg>
<seg id="43">For many customers, a new verb is sufficient to get their old favorites.</seg>
<seg id="44">Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said he was devastated when the cafe closed.</seg>
<seg id="45">When the new cafe opened, Whitt said the entering of the pub and ordering a new coffee felt like a homecoming.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I had to smell that," he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a copious meal"</seg>
<seg id="2">In March 1933, shortly after his rise to the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.</seg>
<seg id="3">As a gourmet, President Roosevelt had a taste for refined delicacies on Fifth Avenue such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland Turtle Turtle Soup.</seg>
<seg id="4">His menu on this day was somewhat more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and as dessert a plum pudding.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.</seg>
<seg id="6">Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">Coe's last book, "Chop Suey", was about Chinese cooking in the USA, while Ziegelman told her about her life in a dwelling-house on the Lower East Side from the food perspective in her book "97 Orchard".</seg>
<seg id="9">Their latest collaboration, "A decent meal," which will be released on Tuesday at the Harper Publishing House, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="10">They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, snappy snack in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the Börsencrash in 1929.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive bits while Coe, 57, ate turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture.</seg>
<seg id="12">When the reporter ordered meatloafs, the pair found this to fit into a discussion about food in the era of the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Rich foods were very popular," Ziegelman said.</seg>
<seg id="14">There was peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.</seg>
<seg id="15">They were made from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">Coe grinned.</seg>
<seg id="18">"It must have been like lead in the stomach," he said.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the years before the Great Depression, the table in an American household, especially in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet.</seg>
<seg id="20">Teams of women cooked for male field workers and freshly baked pate was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</seg>
<seg id="21">It was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the first world war. "A Square Meal" marks the ways in which the country was no longer the landlocked land.</seg>
<seg id="22">"It was a time when food became a central, tense subject for the Americans," Coe explained why he and his wife wanted to write about it.</seg>
<seg id="23">The new budget diet was just as tense as this: the mysterious food such as breads and casseroles became the basic foodstuffs, the Kasserolle as a "miraculous way to recycle food residues," noted Ziegelman, since cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meat, which for many years was the centerpiece of American cuisine, became a rarely served luxury.</seg>
<seg id="26">Strange mixtures were tried, as a calorie-rich and nutritious satisfaction had precedence over taste or even healthy cooking.</seg>
<seg id="27">During her search for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from this era, baked onions with peanut butter.</seg>
<seg id="28">"It was not a popular addition at midday," says Coe.</seg>
<seg id="29">Ziegelmann continues: "It was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions do not match each other.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the housekeeping recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">As never before or since, budgetary economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - were driving the eating habits of the country so much.</seg>
<seg id="33">By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "household policemen" and meet the challenge of transforming Pampe like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.</seg>
<seg id="34">"A Square Meal" is a feast of historical delicacies.</seg>
<seg id="35">In particular, the reports of the government's response to the starving citizen, such as President Herbert Hoovers's Lass-mich-Kuchen-Essen attitude, are palatable.</seg>
<seg id="36">While publicly praising the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen, he dined like the million-strong man of the world to whom he has become.</seg>
<seg id="37">"He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in an almost gilded dining room, wearing a tuxedo.</seg>

<seg id="40">President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not asked him to set an example with his stomach.</seg>
<seg id="41">As described in the book, the hiring of a housekeeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs. Roosevelt led to the White House bringing the dullest food in Washington, but also one of the most dreary. "</seg>
<seg id="42">Many of the species from the era of the Great Depression, dealing with food, were rejected as soon as the country got back on its feet.</seg>
<seg id="43">The legacy lies on our continued focus on calories and food, Ziegelman, as well as on how science was applied to foods.</seg>
<seg id="44">The couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother-in-law when writing the book - for example, how she could not throw away food.</seg>
<seg id="45">"She had a real fear of wasting food," Coe said.</seg>
<seg id="46">Ziegelman recalled, "She actually made people sick."</seg>
<seg id="47">There was the windbag incident.</seg>
<seg id="48">After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, they and Coe pulled out a dessert that they had prepared at home: the Pflaumendessert, which President Roosevelt ate at noon.</seg>
<seg id="49">"It's called Prune Whip," said Ziegelman, adding that it was a common trick to give a modest name to modest recipes.</seg>
<seg id="50">There was no whipped cream, just plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.</seg>
<seg id="51">Everyone dipped a spoon into the tough, brown glibber.</seg>
<seg id="52">Amazingly it tasted not bad.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland Shark: The oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland sharks usually only reach the surface in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed back into the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland sharks do not get offspring until 150 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">The greenland shark swims slowly along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it reaches an average of 1,220 meters.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it comes to it, the five-meter-long animal accelerates to a full 2.6 km / h - and is at this top speed half as fast as a seal.</seg>
<seg id="9">This lifestyle, however, characterized by slowness, seems to be a patent for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the magazine "Science" from a Greenland shark, which could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Insanity", Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock comments on this life span, which means a world record for vertebrate animals.</seg>
<seg id="12">The evolutionary biologist has for a long time assumed that Greenland sharks are becoming stale.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland sharks are hard to observe, after all they live mainly in the Arctic Ocean off the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Little is known about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their time-lapdog measured them when, before Spitzbergen, they equipped six animals with a transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, these sharks are still prey: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, while another had swallowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">They may hunt sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice and seek carcasses staggering from higher water levels.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland sharks, which caught fishermen from Greenland or Spitzbergen between 2010 and 2013 as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest measured 502 centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the shark core of the sharks using the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This center of the eye lens is created before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein are not renewed again later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had strikingly much carbon-14 in the lins core.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons attempted to throw larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the 220-centimeter-longest third, the Linsenkerner contained a small excess of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons tests, so it should have celebrated its 50th birthday in its investigation in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 levels in their lime core, caused by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon 14 o'clock for a 493 centimeter long Greenland shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimeters is even 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is known that Greenland shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals at 392 centimeters was probably on the threshold of sexual maturity and its age was determined to be 156 years, Greenland shark with the increase is evidently at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be a world record for invertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is no coincidence that such Methuseums live mainly in icy waters.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale, in whose bacon on the neck a 120-year-old harpoon tip was stuck, was caught off Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there also often runs on a spar flame.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">To keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often also particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses warmth.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much greater than a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage is that you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"A smaller animal is therefore more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many descendants as possible as early as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.</seg>
<seg id="42">A very large animal, on the other hand, should invest his resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="1">Frankfurt is benefiting from Brexit</seg>
<seg id="2">As a result, the City of the Main has the best chances to attract jobs and companies from London, in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg.</seg>
<seg id="3">"It is very likely that Frankfurt will profit most from the Brexit vote," says Michael Voigtländer, head of the financial services and real estate markets of the IW.</seg>
<seg id="4">After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether financial institutions are allowed to continue to operate London financial transactions throughout the EU.</seg>
<seg id="5">For the so-called EU passport, they have been granted authorization in Great Britain.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is being used by large US banks.</seg>
<seg id="7">Several banks have already announced to relocate jobs.</seg>
<seg id="8">The lobbying association "Frankfurt Main Finance" expects 10000 new jobs on the Main within five years.</seg>
<seg id="9">For Frankfurt, according to the IW, the seat of the European Central Bank (ECB), which is responsible for the monetary policy and supervision of the largest eurozone banks, and other important authorities such as the European insurance supervisory authority EIOPA and the ESRB Risk Board.</seg>
<seg id="10">Although the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is based in Paris, it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The proximity to the bank is important for banks, as they can communicate directly with the supervisor," says IW-Professor Voigtländer.</seg>
<seg id="12">Although Luxembourg is home to a large fund sector, it is worse off than infrastructure in Dublin.</seg>
<seg id="13">Thanks to the large airport, Frankfurt is much easier to reach.</seg>
<seg id="14">The city also scored points with easily available commercial properties.</seg>
<seg id="15">"In Paris it is not so easy to find free high-quality offices," says Voigtländer.</seg>
<seg id="16">On the Seine, rents for first class commercial properties are 50 percent higher than on the Main.</seg>
<seg id="17">Frankfurt also offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime.</seg>
<seg id="18">Mercer's ranking was ranked number seven, Luxembourg ranked 19th, Dublin ranked 33th and Paris 37th.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if quality of life is a question of preferences: "With its already strong position as financial center for the European single market, Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors," concludes the IW.</seg>
<seg id="20">Despite the Brexit vote, London will remain the most important financial center in Europe, according to economic researchers.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also reflected by the economic situation. According to the Landesbank Helaba, around 144,000 people were employed in the banking sector at the end of 2015, while in Frankfurt they were 62500.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes</seg>
<seg id="2">Hillary Clinton published her tax return for the year 2015, which resulted in an income of USD 10.75 million for the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband and an effective federal rate of 34.2%.</seg>
<seg id="3">In the year 2015, the Clinton donated USD 1 million for charitable purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation, while former President Bill Clinton made nearly $ 5.3 million in Redehonoraren, and the former Secretary of State paid US $ 3 million to Simon & Schuster for her book on her term of office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="4">Clinton's candidate for the vice-presidency, Sen. Tim Kaine from Virginia, and his wife, Anne Holton, published his tax returns for the past ten years.</seg>
<seg id="5">They paid an effective federal rate of 20.3% in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency," Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri announced in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a stark contrast, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and retreats with regard to his previous promises to publish his tax declarations.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, although they are not required by law to do so.</seg>
<seg id="9">Trump, a New York businessman, and his attorneys have given a reason for refusing a tax audit by the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="10">"You are on the train," wrote Clinton's campaign leader Ian Sams on Twitter, regarding the publication of the Democratic presidential candidate.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trumps Special Advisor, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish anything until the tax audits are not finalized.</seg>
<seg id="12">Trumps critics, including the Republican Presidential Candidate of 2012 Mitt Romney, have already stated that his refusal raises questions about wealth, his donations to charitable organizations, his business activities, and various other connections, especially with Russia.</seg>
<seg id="13">Clinton has already pounced on the issue, and on Friday published a video on the Internet, in which high-ranking Republicans Trump request to publish their tax return.</seg>
<seg id="14">On Thursday she also addressed the subject during a speech on the economy in Michigan.</seg>
<seg id="15">"He refuses to do what every other Presidential candidate has done over the past few decades and publish his tax returns," she told the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="16">Politico has reported that during the 1990s Trump did not pay very much or very little tax for two years, and a New York Times economic journalist quoted a number of tax attorneys and tax advisors on Friday stating that this could still be the case.</seg>
<seg id="17">Federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="18">Clinton supports a scheme named after the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, who would ensure that individuals earning more than USD 1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.</seg>
<seg id="19">President Obama also supported the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="20">During an election campaign for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate is based here, asked Trump for a meeting to exchange their tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="21">Buffett said he had also been subjected to a tax audit of the IRS, and Trump was "afraid" of the electorate, not the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="22">Clinton's campaign has released tax return due to the year 2007.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Clintons, now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid on average an effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Clinton tax return of 2015 showed that they only paid $ 100 of their income as wages, unlike most Americans.</seg>
<seg id="25">Its principal investment was a low-cost index fund from which the Clintons taxed dividends and income of USD 109,000.</seg>

<seg id="2">Conservatives in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from moving into populated settlements - they throw condoms filled with chilipuder.</seg>
<seg id="3">The method has proven to be effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea years ago, has intensified its support with US nature conservation by training volunteers in villages in the north of Tanzania to use a non-violent four-step method to protect their homes and crops without hurting animals.</seg>
<seg id="4">Previously, many spears have been used to defend themselves.</seg>
<seg id="5">Friday is Weltelefantentag, dedicated to animal protection.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Since we developed the ... toolkit, we have been able to observe a change in their attitudes within these communities, and they are much more confident that they can keep the elephants from their fields without harming the elephant," said the managing director of Honeyguide Damian Bell.</seg>
<seg id="7">The first two steps include lighting the elephant with a torch and blowing it into a horn.</seg>
<seg id="8">If it is not quenched, a so-called "chili cloud" is thrown.</seg>
<seg id="9">Chilipuder mixed with earth is packed together with a fireworks body in a condom, the end of which is turned up to the fuse.</seg>
<seg id="10">When it is lit, the condom bursts with a bang and sprays fine dust to chilipuder into the air.</seg>
<seg id="11">A hint quite usually already out to chase the elephant.</seg>
<seg id="12">One last possibility is a throwing gun that shoots a gun of gold in the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media upheaval after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list any Israeli dial-in code, as Arab guests had "requested" it from a staff member.</seg>
<seg id="3">Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentation "Shoah" left his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.</seg>
<seg id="4">During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the country code list of the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="5">The country, however, was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.</seg>
<seg id="6">How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel has been eliminated and eradicated?</seg>
<seg id="7">Wrote Lanzmann.</seg>
<seg id="8">Instead, the Kempinksi Bristol offers an opportunity to select Israel through its own call center.</seg>
<seg id="9">After an explanation, the director turned to the hotel reception.</seg>
<seg id="10">The reply he received there "shocked him," as Lanzmann wrote.</seg>
<seg id="11">The hotel employee said the measure was an "intentional decision of the management of the Kempinski Hotels."</seg>
<seg id="12">The reason behind this sparked more anger in the director.</seg>
<seg id="13">"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have requested that the area code be deleted," the clerk of Lanzmann was quoted.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great disgrace," reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung.</seg>
<seg id="15">We were horrified and shocked by this event.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is really very shameful.</seg>
<seg id="17">The fact that this has been the case in Germany in this hotel chain is even an even greater disgrace.</seg>
<seg id="18">This does not require any explanation.</seg>
<seg id="19">We expect the hotel "to draw the right conclusions," said the official.</seg>
<seg id="20">The incident triggered a fairly large response on the Internet, where the people called it a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="21">Some accused the Kempinski Hotel of having "surrendered" the alleged demands of Arab guests.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Shame on you," said another contribution, pointing out that the hotel, which is located on the noble Kurfürstendamm, is near a synagogue.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hotel quickly rejected all the allegations and called the incident an "oversight" and "apologized" at Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reported.</seg>
<seg id="24">"There was never a direct instruction" to not include Israel in the shortlist, "the Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman for the Kempinski Hotel.</seg>

<seg id="2">With the abolition of the sanctions, according to Levan Dzhagaryan, the Russian ambassador to Iran, the trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 per cent year-on-year.</seg>
<seg id="3">Since the international sanctions against Iran were lifted, the interest on the part of Russian companies in business in the country grew strongly, the Ambassador said.</seg>
<seg id="4">Russian companies are taking up existing connections with Iran while new firms are ready to gain access to the market.</seg>
<seg id="5">Of course, further trade expansion is one of the greatest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran, "said Dzhagaryan.</seg>
<seg id="6">He noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 856 million.</seg>
<seg id="7">In particular, Russian imports to Iran increased by 91.5 per cent, jumping to $ 697 million.</seg>
<seg id="8">Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $ 158 million.</seg>
<seg id="9">The trade boom has been achieved by deliveries of machinery, land vehicles and weapons, "said the Ambassador.</seg>
<seg id="10">Dzhagaryan is expecting a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Last year, the Russian foreign representative issued about 35,000 visas, primarily travel to Iran, to Iranian citizens.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, Iran reached the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="13">One could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia from last year, are broken, "he said.</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers from the pastoral care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Together, four stages were completed.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the time until the next Rome pilgrimage of all the ministries in two years, the upper ministry of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a pilgrimage of several days.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various pilgrimage destinations were tested and finally decided for the bishopric city of Freiburg, where a special pilgrimage destination was offered this year on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy with the open gate of mercy at the Freiburg Cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis from Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Heiligenzimmern set off.</seg>
<seg id="7">The previous evening, Father Storost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrim crosses, and gave the pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb it was by train to the starting point Villingen, where also a cathedral of Our Lady stands and thus the pilgrim way of the cathedral was entered.</seg>
<seg id="9">The individual day trips were framed in the morning and in the evening by a short impulse with different prayers, songs and texts.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way, the Minis made a break at the crossroads, chapels or churches to sing together a song from a specially composed pilgrim songbook.</seg>
<seg id="11">The parish homes of the local parishes were available for the overnight stays.</seg>
<seg id="12">Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller were there for a tasty and strong dinner and breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the second day we went over Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">The next day, the stage went to St. Peter, which was the most strenuous route, but had to be descended at about 500 heights and then climbed again.</seg>
<seg id="15">The deserved reward was in the evening a common barbecue at Badweiher.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning impulse on the fourth pilgrimage day in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter, we went to the final stage to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="17">Visibly relieved and happy, the Minis arrived at the Freiburg Cathedral in the late afternoon and crossed the gate of mercy.</seg>
<seg id="18">With a small impulse, God was thanked here.</seg>
<seg id="19">At the evening fair in the cathedral the minis arrived at the pilgrimage destination were welcomed by co-operator Markus Obert.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the service the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.</seg>
<seg id="21">The next day there was still time for the marsh gourd.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the afternoon we went by train back to Horb.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the end, all participants agreed that the days were characterized by spirituality and a strong community experience.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner raced to fame last night at the men's team sprint in the Velodrome in Rio, when the British team defended the 2012 title.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role his countryman, Sir Chris Hoy, had taken as his own. The boys' pound made the legend proud when he stormed home to take a win from favorites New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympiagold medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after taking a modest sixth place at the London World Championships in March despite the resignation of Hoys.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the starter Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did so in time as Hindes appeared.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoy's retirement produced a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton were trying to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the Scot that has now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but the New Zealanders won in the first round in the standard rounds.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hindes were close behind his turn, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a big part of the transformation, with Hindes driving in a higher gear to slow him down and to allow Kenny and above all Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked aside from his position as a BBC expert, and Skinner, Kenny and Hindes appeared as they climbed onto the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "It's a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.</seg>
<seg id="17">We have set an Olympic record in the finals and defeated the world champions.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph of 2012 at the side of Kenny and Hoys, Hindes admitted that he was deliberately on the track after a weak start.</seg>
<seg id="21">He withdrew this statement later and there was no opposition from England's rival.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such an outstanding victory there was no such problem this time.</seg>
<seg id="23">Hindes said: "It feels with all the GB flags on the grandstand like London."</seg>
<seg id="24">We have teamed up in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We've gone so badly with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win again at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which won seven out of ten titles in both Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect a successful five days in the Velodrome.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form of Kenny, it is within the scope of the possibility that he will repeat Hoys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">This would be Kenny - exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23rd (an apparently sacred date for British sport, that day also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same from Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny is next in the sprint, which starts today and will go for three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I just enjoy this for the moment."</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with your colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels somewhat lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be knighted."</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal contest of the day, but there were more good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-four-kilometer race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at the finish line in 3: 51.942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was 3: 51.659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will certainly be the focus.</seg>
<seg id="42">Yesterday, he had met with commissioners before the qualification, when officials called him to measure his body size.</seg>
<seg id="43">Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker, and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in World Rector's time at 4: 13,260 in the corresponding women's contest that will be continued and finished tomorrow.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team is relying on its strong railroad team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to bring a host of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were reduced.</seg>
<seg id="46">There were dramas in the background, including the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amidst sexism and bullying accusations as well as the retirement of greats like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrome, it looks as if the now legendary reputation of GB, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, can be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Future of the smelting of Portland due to the abolition of the energy contract questionable</seg>
<seg id="2">The future of the Portland aluminum smelter in Victoria, as well as hundreds of workplaces, are at stake, as the plant operator will terminate the energy supply contract and thus cancel all supply contracts, as the supplying energy company reported.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria earlier this year, no further subsidies to the operation of the plant to be awarded.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy for 20 years expires in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa facility in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">No less than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could be endangered in the event of a closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, Dominoeffects could occur because the smelter consumes about 10 per cent of Victoria's total electricity production.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014 Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">Alcoa's smelter in Portland loses money and risks closing it down.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the many years of speculation about the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and, most recently, the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the large aluminum smelting plant with its Loy Yang A power station in Latrobe Valley, announced that it expects three other owners to terminate their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The plant is majority owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL expects that the plant in Portland will continue to operate, which means a further physical demand for electricity through the smelter," the company said.</seg>
<seg id="14">AGL also said that the contracts were so-called "hedging transactions", which should have come into effect from November 2016 onwards.</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Therefore, AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenues in fiscal year 17," said the electricity supplier.</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impacts on revenue on AGL as of FY 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the major markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL stated that it had written off the value of the contracts already in its annual financial statements of $ 187 million in "expectation of a termination".</seg>
<seg id="19">Alcoa said that the decision to deregister the contracts, "the ability of Alcoas ... to operate the smelter or to ensure the power supply to the smelter."</seg>
<seg id="20">The US company said it had completed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which should have come into effect from November this year, even though it still owes an explanation of why it has resigned from the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts are warning that the Portland smelter will be shut down in Victoria and the Tomago facility near Newcastle due to the poor economic conditions in the industry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Referring to analysts' statements earlier this week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes about 600 megawatts of electricity per year and that Tomago consumes about 900 megawatts of electricity.</seg>
<seg id="23">If both systems disappear from the market, this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the [electricity market].</seg>
<seg id="24">And it would not be good for us as an electricity producer, "he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of the Vogue</seg>
<seg id="2">Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner clan Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and running at Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced Thursday the news on her Instagram account.</seg>
<seg id="4">"In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry," wrote Kendall.</seg>
<seg id="5">The reunion of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians?), Scripted reality video showing the entire Kardashian Jenner family (with the exception of the Rob and Caitlyn problems and in the presence of the most popular showbiz uncle and producer of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest).</seg>
<seg id="6">This is the stereotype of almost every birthday episode of a children's song (Seacrest brought the sentence "You thought we'd forgotten you," with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit on a broadcasting slot at 8am), but Kris had to let her other girls somehow participate in this publicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September edition of the Vogue has certainly begun a new era of Kardashians.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendall's big sister, Kim, likes to hit on the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were to be seen in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league of its own.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September edition is the most sold edition of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a volume that is more like an image book than a fashion magazine, the output attracts a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista were 615 pages of advertising from the 832 pages of the Wälzers).</seg>
<seg id="11">The revelation of his coverstar is so eagerly awaited that in the last two years, pictures of the magazine had leaked before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">In recent years, there were clearly more "celebrities who model" than "models that are celebrities" on the cover.</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar-winner and Dior-Markenbotschafterin Jennifer Lawrence was 2013 on the cover, one year after Lady Gaga had the honor.</seg>
<seg id="15">But even with the small chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the former category, she is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous characters or reality stars or teenagers of today who know how to make a good snapchat video (even if it all applies to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are truly talented women who are distinguished in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course, Jenner's success does not appeal to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With her reality TV story, Jenner's position in the fashion world was always a bit tense.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June, the former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid and called her "the bitches of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings boiled again as the news came out with the appearance of Jenner on the Vogue cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But to ride around on the disgust seems to have passed at the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is literally a supermodel.</seg>
<seg id="26">She is running for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">It makes advertising for your foundation by Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">She and all her sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective Paywall apps.</seg>
<seg id="29">She sells her pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to LOVE magazine.</seg>
<seg id="30">And in her spare time, she is on Reality TV, probably to see her sister Kourtney and her children.</seg>

<seg id="2">More than 160,000 of the country's most vulnerable are refused annually by the municipalities, while the industry is focusing on the impact of further cuts on already overloaded transactions.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly elderly persons, immigrants, needy workers, victims of violent acts and those who have no means of unfair detention and the like - are rejected in their request for free legal advice and legal aid.</seg>
<seg id="4">Legal services of the municipality, which are already exhausted, are preparing for further reductions.</seg>
<seg id="5">As of June next year, these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds.</seg>
<seg id="6">The director of Queesland's communal center James Farrell said that the latest survey of the National Association of Town Centers showed that thousands of people are already rejected every year.</seg>
<seg id="7">Farrell said that the situation would only get worse without repealing the decision of the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Queensland's community centers are chronically under-funded, which means that thousands of people are being rejected by important services you need," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">People who leave violent relationships, people with unmanageable and crushing debts, families who go through divisions, workers who have been unjustly dismissed - all these people have problems of a legal nature, and this survey shows that they can not get the help they need.</seg>
<seg id="10">As of June 2017, the federal government will cut the funds by 30 percent, which means that thousands of more needy Queensland people will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help.</seg>
<seg id="11">We call on the Federal Prosecutor's Office, the Federal Ministry of Justice, and the Senators of Queensland George Brandis to immediately abolish these cuts so that people can get the help they need in the event of legal problems.</seg>
<seg id="12">Last year the state government fulfilled its pledge to raise funds for legal aid to the national average.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is now time to look at the needs of community centers and their customer communities, as well as to invest the Palaszczuk government into this important work.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the forthcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (September 4) and Berlin (September 18), considerable losses are expected for the SPD and CDU government departments.</seg>
<seg id="3">This was the result of representative surveys conducted by the opinion research institute INSA for the "Bild" -Zeitung (Friday).</seg>
<seg id="4">While the red-black government coalition in the north could be just a little further, this is not possible according to the polls in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="5">In both states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would thus have a good chance of continuing to head the government.</seg>
<seg id="6">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD fell from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the poll, the party would therefore be just ahead of the CDU, which could again reach 23 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">The third place is controversial between the left and the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="9">The left would come to 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented for the first time with 19 percent in the state parliament.</seg>
<seg id="10">Despite the slight losses, the Greens returned to the Schwerin Landtag with 6 percent (previously 8.7 percent).</seg>
<seg id="11">NPD and FDP would not be represented in the state parliament with 3 per cent each.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the poll, the SPD would only reach 23 per cent (election 2011: 28.3 per cent) in the Berlin parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="13">The CDU only reached 18 percent after 23.4 percent.</seg>
<seg id="14">It would thus still be behind the Greens with 19 per cent (2011: 17.6 per cent), but before the left with 15 per cent (previously 11.7 per cent).</seg>
<seg id="15">At 14 percent, the AfD would be represented for the first time in the House of Representatives.</seg>
<seg id="16">With 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, but the pirates, contrary to 2011, would miss the entry.</seg>

<seg id="2">E-mail and Internet in Slow Motion: Nokia Communicator came onto the market 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="3">The successors dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was thicker and bigger, so it was not good in the hand.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was quite chunky.</seg>
<seg id="7">The built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which would today be enough for about two high resolution self-help.</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" arrived exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, in the shops - and it was the first smartphone.</seg>
<seg id="10">For a few euro lovers can buy the devices still on the Internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="11">Twenty years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair Cebit in Hanover as "office in the Western pocket format".</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the new mobile phone could be a lot for then standards: SMS and emails could be sent and received, even by fax the communicator could be reached.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browser, although tormenting slow.</seg>
<seg id="15">A pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be opened like a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then found a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">Pretty proud was the price: 2700 D-Mark, thus about 1400 euro.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany in 2015 was 392 euros.</seg>
<seg id="20">No one could have guessed in August 1996 that the communicator would be the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since then everything has changed.</seg>
<seg id="22">The smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The mobile phone division of the Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster, was eventually sold to Microsoft and handled.</seg>
<seg id="24">The market now dominate providers, which all came much later than Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="25">To be online always and everywhere, this is everyday life for a lot of people.</seg>
<seg id="26">In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="27">It sold approximately 1.4 billion units, and Samsung and Apple alone account for 555 million units.</seg>
<seg id="28">Worldwide sales of the devices are around 400 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="29">In addition, the well-running business of the numerous app providers and the telecommunication companies.</seg>
<seg id="30">Around the smartphone, a whole industry has emerged.</seg>
<seg id="31">The decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007, then Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced on the Mac-World the introduction of the iPhones.</seg>
<seg id="32">He promised three devices in one: a music player, a telephone and an Internet communicator, all easy to use via touch screen.</seg>
<seg id="33">The triumphal procession of Apple began, still today the iPhone is the most important product of the group.</seg>

<seg id="1">England must steer the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow</seg>
<seg id="2">Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="3">For me, this was the biggest attraction of Heathrow, just as it was in London in 2012, when we were doing a great deal to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for locals and businesses near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">For our local communities, we will already create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs, and put an end to the youth unemployment in the airport environment.</seg>
<seg id="7">As we were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of expanding Heathrows is too great.</seg>
<seg id="8">I was told that England will never be ready for the games, and that we will embarrass ourselves on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question asked.</seg>
<seg id="11">Like the Olympics, Heathrow is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project.</seg>
<seg id="12">Enlargement is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £ 211 billion in corporate growth, and leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.</seg>
<seg id="13">We have a great team in Heathrow that has implemented an £ 11 billion infrastructure investment program in terms of time and budget from the T5, which has been voted the world's best airport terminal five years in a row, to the T2 that was built in the middle of the two busiest catwalks in the world.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now they are ready to deliver a third catwalk, which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment.</seg>
<seg id="15">The 2012 London Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is time we steered this Olympic spirit and expanded Heathrow, securing our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.</seg>

<seg id="1">Adblock Plus, Facebook in the "cat and mouse game" regarding ad blocking</seg>
<seg id="2">For companies that earn money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to bypass ad blocking, a "cat and mouse game" equal.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad blockages on its desktop, AdblockPlus released a blog post stating that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising on the social network.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the coding for its advertisements to make it difficult to recognize ad blockages to determine which part of the page is advertising.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">In a blog post, the spokesman for Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this sort of back-and-forth battle between the ad-blocking open source community and the evaders has been ongoing since the invention of ad blockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fact that the world's largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of how worrying ad blockers have become for the industry.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to a study conducted last year by Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people use ad blockers around the world, nearly four times as much as 2013.</seg>
<seg id="9">With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook through their mobile devices, mobile advertising makes up 84 percent of Facebook's advertising revenue.</seg>
<seg id="10">The company has focused on ad blockers on desktop PCs because mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a spokesman said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Advertising on desktop PCs accounts for a large portion of the revenue, making Facebook the investment of such a step as worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="12">On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update its "ads preference tool" to give people more control over them targeted advertising.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters would be worrying because they would also block content on the site that is not advertising.</seg>
<seg id="14">"This is not a positive experience for users, so we are planning to address the problem," a Facebook spokesman said in an e-mail message.</seg>
<seg id="15">Ad blockers are a dull means, so instead we've focused on developer tools like Ad Preferences to put more control in the hands of people.</seg>

<seg id="2">The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.</seg>
<seg id="3">The police call witnesses after a woman was crossed on a highway in the early morning hours on a presumed suicide of several vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.</seg>
<seg id="5">A woman lay down in the dark "in an act of despair" and were hit by several cars, the police said in Vaud.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is obvious that a Swiss woman, aged 49, who was crossed by several vehicles, including a truck, herself wanted to kill herself.</seg>
<seg id="7">She still died on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="8">Several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, the police said, calling on them and any witnesses of the incident to report.</seg>
<seg id="9">An investigation was opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="11">Was a clash avoidable?</seg>
<seg id="12">This is something the prosecutor must decide, "Hofstetter said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not held responsible.</seg>
<seg id="14">In each of the two cases - where a person was running on the highway in the dark - it was decided that the car drivers would not have to assume that a pedestrian would run on the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper said.</seg>
<seg id="15">Last year, a policewoman was released from negligent killing after she had killed and killed a man who was staying one night on the A1 near Payerne in August 2014.</seg>
<seg id="16">The 22-year-old victim had drunk and became unconscious on the street, the court heard.</seg>
<seg id="17">The court noted that the policewoman - who had responded to an emergency call - was driving in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a "completely exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.</seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably once habitable.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere could have once exposed earth-like conditions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously pointed out that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation suggests that Venus might have had a thin Earth-like atmosphere, but still slowly turned.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably had more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to shelter lives and protect from rapid evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent dull.</seg>
<seg id="10">"In the GISS model simulation, Venus's slow rotation exposes her daytime of the sun for almost two months," explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This heats the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a lot of the sun's heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are several degrees cooler than those of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus, which resembles the evolution previously suspected by planetary scientists.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was once probably inhabitable, Venus was subjected to excessive heat and ultraviolet light for billions of years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burnt by the ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">When their hydrogen escaped, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect remained - the Venus, as we know it today.</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.</seg>

<seg id="2">Patrick Roy resigned as a Colorado Avalanche coach and vice president of hockey operations on Thursday, leading to too little co-determination in the team's decision-making process.</seg>
<seg id="3">Alternate President / General Manager of Colorado Joe Sakic confirmed this decision, noting that the club will immediately look for a new coach.</seg>
<seg id="4">"In the last three years, I have fulfilled my duties as Cheftrainer and Vice President of Hockey Operations of the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," said 50-year-old Roy in an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the course of the summer, I have been thinking a lot about how I could improve this team, to give it more depth, to take it to a higher level.</seg>
<seg id="6">To achieve this, the coach's vision and vice president of hockey operations must be perfectly aligned with the organization.</seg>
<seg id="7">It must also have a right of co-determination in decisions which influence the performance of the team.</seg>
<seg id="8">These conditions are currently not met.</seg>
<seg id="9">Sakic, who hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Patrick informed me today about this decision," said Sakic.</seg>
<seg id="11">We appreciate all that he has done for our organization and wish him the best for the future.</seg>
<seg id="12">Roy was named the best coach of the league during his debut season at the Avalanches 2013-14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards.</seg>
<seg id="13">He led the club to 112 points and first place in Central Vision, but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the playoffs of Minnesota and missed the post-season in each of the last two years.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 mark in the 2015-16 season and fell five points behind the Wild for a second wildcard spot in the Western Conference.</seg>

<seg id="1">North sea workers are again taking up talks, and are striking out</seg>
<seg id="2">The labor battles regarding the compensation for North Sea workers are being suspended as all the parties are putting themselves to the table for a new round of talks, said negotiators.</seg>
<seg id="3">Strikes against the oilfield service provider Wood Group were carried out sporadically on platforms in the North Sea, operated by Royal Dutch Shell.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Woodgroup, as well as Unite and RMT unions, can confirm that we have agreed to restart the settlement process of the current dispute," says a joint statement.</seg>
<seg id="5">We will hold a few full-day meetings over the next few weeks, which will begin early next year to tackle the problems again.</seg>
<seg id="6">The unions said their last strike, the first in over 25 years, is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent.</seg>
<seg id="7">Wood Group has reduced the rates to its contractors in the North Sea by about 9 percent this year due to negative market pressure.</seg>
<seg id="8">The company's rate cut follows a 10 percent decline for onshore contractors in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="9">The company said that additional cuts give the company the space it needs to get through the market downturn.</seg>
<seg id="10">Shell has dismissed thousands of people for its part, announcing plans to abandon its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries, as it is streamlining its business activities as a result of its merging with British energy company BG Group.</seg>
<seg id="11">Energy companies are under pressure because of the lower crude oil prices, an economic situation that had been reinforced by the decision of the British in June to leave the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="12">Scottish parliamentarian Dave Anderson met with workers leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest disputes that have taken place in the North Sea since a generation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">"In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for many and not just a few," he said in a statement.</seg>

<seg id="1">Kepler measures the rate of rotation of stars in the Pleiads</seg>
<seg id="2">The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of rotation rates among the stars of the Pleiad stars.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data will help astronomers understand why stars are rotating at different rates in the star cluster, as well as the relationship between the rotation periods and the planetary evolution.</seg>
<seg id="4">"We hope that by comparing our results to other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age, and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center, Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The stars of the Pleiads are 445 light years away from the earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this star cluster, which originated around 125 million years ago, now reach the adult age.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now turning the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">At peak rotation rates, these ripening stars emit large amounts of star winds.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">As a star ages, its rotation rate begins to decelerate.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by detecting the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot, such as solar spots.</seg>
<seg id="12">The latest catalog of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars spin more slowly than less massive stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with larger stars rotating slower than small ones.</seg>
<seg id="14">"In the" Ballet "of the Pleiads, we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, while faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," said Rebull.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the stars of the Pleiadians are so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The Pleiad's star cluster offers an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.</seg>
<seg id="17">There is still a lot in front of us that we would like to learn more about how the How, When and Why stars slow their rotation rates and, so to speak, hang their "dancing shoes".</seg>
<seg id="18">Rebull and her colleagues have reported extensively in three newspaper reports on their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Pleiades, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.</seg>

<seg id="2">The tears ran faster with Alex Rodriguez than the US baseball star in base days from base to base.</seg>
<seg id="3">After his emotional resignation announcement, the 41-year-old pro will be wearing the jersey of his New York Yankees for the last time against the Tampa Bay Rays.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I love this game and this team."</seg>
<seg id="5">"I say 'Goodbye' to both," said the 14-time all-star game participant of Major League Baseball (MLB).</seg>
<seg id="6">Three times, Rodriguez was voted the most valuable player in the league, in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees.</seg>
<seg id="7">His signing under a ten-year contract has earned him $ 27 million annually since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="8">Until the end of the contract on December 31, 2017, he will act as advisor and youth coaching agent at full salary.</seg>
<seg id="9">As a player, it paid Rodriguez a long time with performance.</seg>
<seg id="10">He made some milestones with 696 homers, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("Runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and since 2005 the Yankees.</seg>
<seg id="11">With Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two other baseball players show similar values in the most important stats.</seg>
<seg id="12">But the 41-year-old should not be accepted into the hall of fame of the baseball.</seg>
<seg id="13">Because Rodriguez, nicknamed "A-Rod", was so successful in the field, his controversy is out of place.</seg>
<seg id="14">Already in 2009, the superstar at "ESPN" gave up to have forbidden steroids between 2001 and 2003.</seg>
<seg id="15">In August 2013 he was closed for 211 games by the end of 2014 due to a complication in the biogenesis scandal.</seg>
<seg id="16">Rodriguez is considered to be the main suspect for years to have received an anti-aging clinic in South Florida.</seg>
<seg id="17">After a legal dispute the lock was reduced to 162 encounters.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The league could have done me a favor for the year 2014, because I've been playing for 20 years without a break," said Rodriguez at the time, smugly.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even his farewell days do not run silently.</seg>
<seg id="20">While many baseball legends once again get the big stage in their last games, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench.</seg>
<seg id="21">"My job does not include a farewell tour."</seg>
<seg id="22">"My job involves trying to win every game," said Yankees coach Joe Girardi.</seg>
<seg id="23">After all, Rodriguez, who was married to the actress Cameron Diaz and is credited with the pop star Madonna and the actress Kate Hudson, received sympathy from the fans of the Yankee arch rival Boston Red Sox.</seg>
<seg id="24">"We want A-Rod," the supporters sang in the 4: 9 defeat against the Rodriguez team.</seg>

<seg id="1">Olympia 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases</seg>
<seg id="2">Caught: Due to a positive doping test, weightlifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland can not start in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.</seg>
<seg id="4">An accomplished athlete would have won almost a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the seventh day of the competition, the first official doping events became known to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000 meter obstacle runner Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were positively tested and excluded in Brazil - just before the start of the already critically acclaimed track and field athletics competitions, these news come untimely.</seg>
<seg id="7">The diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, which is used as a masking agent for dopant substances, was already demonstrated by Chen last Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="8">The International Court of Sports Court CAS confirmed their exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday, the 18-year-old had finished fourth in the final over 100 m butterfly, only 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday Chen would have participated in the preliminaries over 50 m of free time.</seg>
<seg id="11">Chen has applied to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for the opening of the B-sample and a hearing.</seg>
<seg id="12">The national association takes the matter "very seriously and demands full cooperation from Chen," Xinhua quoted from a statement: "We will work with the International Court of Justice, CAS, and will accept the verdict."</seg>
<seg id="13">For the first time in history, the CAS is no longer responsible for the sanctioning of athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also on the night of Rio, the news about the positive rehearsal at Danekowa seeped through, the 33-year-old went thus even on the offensive.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive." This was "an incredible shock," she told the Bulgarian TV station BNT.</seg>
<seg id="16">She is innocent, "the only explanation could be food supplements," explained the Leichtathletin.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the report, the prohibited substance is to be the blood doping agent EPO.</seg>
<seg id="18">Danekowa has been provisionally suspended, according to BNT, the B-sample has already been positive.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgarian Prime Minister Bojko Borissov spoke up immediately with criticism of the athlete.</seg>
<seg id="20">"I do not understand why the athletes do not draw the right conclusions," he said, "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, all weightlifters from the nation who are chronically doping can not participate in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The event "Adrian Zielinski" was announced on Friday and the London Olympian winner in the class of up to 85 kg was tested three days earlier for the anabolic steroid Nandrolone, just like his brother Tomasz.</seg>
<seg id="23">Both dispute the intake, but both may not start in the class up to 94 kg.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before the start of the athletes, the Danekowa case is another major blow to the reputation of the entire sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The IAAF World Federation had banned the entire Russian team except for one exception for systematic doping, and the Kenyan runners-up race also produced numerous bad news in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the swim sport, the previous offense in China had also caused violent clashes between the athletes.</seg>
<seg id="27">Thus Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympian Sun Yang harshly.</seg>
<seg id="28">"Sun Yang pisses purple."</seg>
<seg id="29">"If I see the podium over 200 m of free-range, I will surrender," said Lacourt on French radio.</seg>
<seg id="30">Sun was also at the center of an argument with the Australian Mack Horton.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I have no time and no respect for doping scammers," he said.</seg>
<seg id="32">Sun had been tested positively for the stimulant trimetazidine at the Chinese championships in 2014, but had only a three-month suspension.</seg>

<seg id="1">Data hack: So hackers hack their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of extortion malware are currently attacking companies - and are doing so successfully.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey of the malware defense specialists malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, UK and Germany, 40 percent of surveyed companies have been victim of an attack with blackmail software at least once, in part, several times over the past twelve months.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany nearly 20 percent of the companies were once already the target of a Ransomware extortion.</seg>
<seg id="5">Forty per cent of the victims willingly paid the pledges required by the perpetrators to use the systems and data they had attacked.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to Malwarebytes, malware specialists are increasingly specifying their blackmail software for attacks on corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potential ransom to be extorted is considerably higher than with private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We are currently monitoring a terrifyingly rapid evolution of malicious software," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "World".</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most malware programs were designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered extortion software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">First, private users were the target, but the change to company attacks took place in the last months frighteningly fast.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once active on the computer of a victim, it searches specifically for recently changed files such as Word, Excel or database files as well as archives of pictures and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and deletes the originals permanently.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then the software presents the demands of the blackmailers.</seg>
<seg id="15">In order to get the final encryption code to the files, the victims have to transfer money - mostly in the form of the crypto Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where the personal photo database is at stake with private users, companies are concerned about sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production stands still.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage is greater if a ransom is applied.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the affected German companies reported a loss of turnover due to Ransomware, 13 percent even had to interrupt the business activity completely, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks, whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="20">"We always tell the victims: Do not pay, you only help the problem," explains Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="21">Yet 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay are getting their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers, it is difficult to reject the demands of the perpetrators in the face of standstill.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers in turn know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, security researchers at F-Secure investigated user interfaces and contact with extortionists, and concluded that the perpetrators are trying to build up a kind of customer service to make more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They tell their victims by chat how they can pay by Bitcoin, set up free-access support sites or decrypt sample files for free.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private individuals are rescinded after payments of a few hundred euros, companies have to negotiate partisanship and pay five-digit sums to get their data back in encrypted form.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the face of potentially high and relatively risky profits from Ransomware blackmail, the hackers are becoming more and more professional and are sharing the work, says security expert Chester Wisniewski from the antivirus provider Sophos: "A single person can write a Ransomware about within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more likely that it is three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malicious software in the form of a software kit to the actual blackmailer.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous malware kits were created by buying the malware itself, consulting and additional tools for a one-time, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"The scope of delivery includes an adaptation tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmailers then look for more hackers to spread the freshly bought software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service industry.</seg>
<seg id="34">So you log into one of the forums in the underground, buy the set of a criminal and commissioned another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>

<seg id="36">"Typically, the criminals instruct spammers with the spread," explains Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known by many companies, which secure their data better.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of the company's IT staff in the malwarebytes survey rely on file back-ups and scanner software to defend Ransomware.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"If the encryption of data alone is no longer a sufficient threat for successful assessment, the perpetrators instead threaten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="41">As a result, the damage potential is still much higher than before, depending on the type of data.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the future, the perpetrators could also tackle completely new goals on the Internet of things.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Defcon hackers' conference, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter the release of such a blocked heater could be worth a ransom for many victims.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators instead of the heating in the future block a whole production line in a factory, Ransomware could become also in the industry 4.0 a topic.</seg>

<seg id="2">HONDA HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use</seg>
<seg id="3">In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, proves to be very flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the HR-V, which is only 1.60 m high, is rather small in size, the passengers have plenty of space in the front row as well as in the rear, but it does not work at any point.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the interior are well-processed and pleasant, only the cockpit top falls somewhat.</seg>
<seg id="7">The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in the storage space.</seg>
<seg id="8">There is not only a trunk of 453 l with raised seats and 1026 l with folded backrests, but there are the "Magic Seats".</seg>
<seg id="9">This is less magical than it sounds: the seats of the rear bench can be folded up like a cinematical chair, offering space space that is 1,24 m high from floor to ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="10">The trunk can be loaded well, but the loading height is 650 mm slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel engine with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very strong thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">He should, however, do his work somewhat more quietly.</seg>
<seg id="13">Pleasing is the daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another engine: a 1.5-liter petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">An all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">The driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="17">The steering should be somewhat more direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">The equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the tested top variant "Executive".</seg>
<seg id="19">The safety systems include the city emergency brake assist (works up to speed 32), the collision warning system and the tracking assist.</seg>
<seg id="20">The collision warning device sometimes irritates because it judges many obstacles as "approaching objects" during maneuvering.</seg>
<seg id="21">The high-beam assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent cruise control responds to the traffic sign detection and throttles the speed as required.</seg>
<seg id="23">The full connectivity is available only for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB and one HDMI jack are located under the armrest and are therefore a little cumbersome to reach.</seg>
<seg id="25">The around 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are all right.</seg>
<seg id="26">If you do not want to invest so much, you get the gasoline from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="27">The engines meet the Euro 6 emissions standard.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.</seg>

<seg id="1">Better traffic flow on the highway</seg>
<seg id="2">It regularly juts down the road - here is a picture of November.</seg>
<seg id="3">But this is to change: the right turn lane is to be extended.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is a good news for all drivers who are in traffic on the road every evening when they drive over the motorway junction (A 43).</seg>
<seg id="5">On the next Tuesday and Wednesday (16/17 August) the Landesbetrieb Straßenbau extends the right turn lane around 700 meters in the area between Hammerstraße and the Weseler Straße exit.</seg>
<seg id="6">Drivers can then straight from the Hammerstraße turn right.</seg>
<seg id="7">The big advantage is that traffic is split up at an early stage, which improves the overall flow on the busy section of Federal Highway 51.</seg>
<seg id="8">The idea with the extended exit was the CDU faction in the district representation Münster-West.</seg>
<seg id="9">The road narrowing on the feeder annoyed the drivers mainly between 17 and 19 clock.</seg>
<seg id="10">On working days, the backwater reaches the bridge over the Albersloher Weg and sometimes even beyond.</seg>
<seg id="11">The reason is the bottleneck on the B 51 just before the exit Weseler Straße.</seg>
<seg id="12">From here the traffic is only one-lane over the motorway bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">The second lane had to be reconstructed well over three and a half years ago.</seg>
<seg id="14">The reason: Static calculations have shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary load-bearing capacity, in particular to accommodate heavy-load traffic in two lanes.</seg>
<seg id="15">How long this bottleneck and the associated workplace jam will last, can not say the responsible state enterprise.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, it is to be expected that the bridge will have an official rest period until 2034.</seg>
<seg id="17">For the extension of the right turn lane, the state enterprise deliberately selected the traffic-weaker time during the school holidays because disabilities were to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="18">On Tuesday and Wednesday, the traffic will be lapped past the construction site.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing night: tips against sleep disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening you waddle around forever, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning is far from the alarm rattling not to think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, you are in good company with such problems: According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not restful.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disorders manifest themselves?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and they can be caused by a variety of causes, stresses Hans-Günter Weeß, Member of the Board of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What one understands commonly under it, however, is the insomnia, thus a Eingang and Durchlaufstörung.</seg>
<seg id="8">The caring-mindedness feels many people as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, board member in the German House of Physicians Association with practice in Lower Saxony Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind this, organic, psychological or behavioral factors, as well as drugs, can be found.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not infrequently, the sleep disorder expresses another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Very early waking is particularly common in depression," says Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="14">And it may be that different factors condition each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, if you have an intervertebral disc, you may be ill, wake up every two or three hours, and perhaps start thinking about everyday problems and nursing, says Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should you go to the doctor with sleep problems?</seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone who does not sleep well for a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is impaired the day should go to the doctor, Weeß advises.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can be quite different: one is repulsive, tired, has no sleep, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical discomforts such as stomach or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to relieve sleep disturbance, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Possible treatment options include behavioral changes, cognitive behavioral therapy or medication - classic sleep apneas only in exceptional cases and for a maximum of two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="22">There is hardly any sleep-doctor in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, director of the Interdisciplinary Sleep Medicine Center of the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">That is why we should go to the family doctor in the case of sleeping problems, Weeß advises.</seg>
<seg id="24">The investigator can investigate whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to the Schlaflabor, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For examina- tion in the sleep lab, doctors advise, for example, in cases of snoring with respiratory exacerbations, in case of sickly fatigue, sleepwalkers, or if one does not find the cause of a sleep disorder, Fietze explains.</seg>
<seg id="27">You do not have to prepare yourself for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Just do not make a mid-day sleep," says Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="30">After cabling, you go to bed at your normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose-glasses, a chest-belt and a feeler on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera on the ceiling records the sleeping.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can people affected the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of set screws, which can be used for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Weeß counts: regular sleeping and resting times, not lying too long in bed, not sleeping in the day, not watching TV to sleep, avoiding alcohol and not looking at the clock at night - then you start to calculate immediately, and that is not at all beneficial.</seg>

<seg id="5">"In a country where an Olympic player wins € 20,000 and a € 150,000 jungle king, no one should wonder about missing medals," the 26-year-old wrote in the night to Friday on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="6">The promotion system in the swimming sport was bad, the doping controls on the other hand very good.</seg>
<seg id="7">This means that we can not compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look so closely at the topic of doping or even operate it.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I am not saying that the controls should be discontinued," he continued.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, a few linden trees, between the rest of the cobbled streets: the Riga street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not look like this at first sight, but the police rank it as one of the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">Walking along the road from east to west, you will pass playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a health food store.</seg>
<seg id="3">To the facade of a gray house someone has "ugly!" Sprayed.</seg>
<seg id="4">Opposite of a Lidl, which is also to be demolished soon, is already built: By 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new rental housing is to be created here.</seg>
<seg id="5">Articles about this "trendy district", as the responsible real estate firm calls Friedrichshain, are illustrated in the last few weeks, however, with burning cars pictured.</seg>
<seg id="6">The house is numbered 94: Once it was occupied, now the residents have leases, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">In particular, Henkel, the Berlin interior designer, had repeatedly spoken of the project as a "no-go zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After the premises on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, had been cleared by 300 policemen on June 22nd, the police patrolled three-week officially with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on the street, blocking parts of the street and preventing visitors from entering the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">During this renovated construction workers on behalf of the unknown house owners the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On July 13, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the eviction had been illegal, and a day later police and construction workers withdrew under the exultation of sympathizers and local residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">This summer afternoon the street is peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the citizenry in front of the houses in the sun, others talk about Späti.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left-wing violence is not the main concern of many local residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in the neighborhood since 1999, and Jana *, who is raising three children, are annoyed by the police.</seg>
<seg id="14">Together with the inhabitants of house projects, they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a neighborhood, which mostly wanted police protection from vandalizing left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, which the Berlin interior designer and the police between house occupiers and their neighbors open up, does not exist so obviously.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional workplace, which today also has a low average income and a high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="18">House occupations and the housing projects resulting from them have long been a part of the Kiez: in 1990 numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzerstrasse, very close to the Riga.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer had been evicted under a large police force in a regular street battles, many of the projects in the Riga were legalized and some are still inhabited by the people who occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and electoral Berliners from all over the world in recent years. They now share their neighborhood with GDR-era residents and former occupiers.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also evident in the rents that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 for new leases.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Riga are attacked as symbols of this development: they can be seen on inserted panes or freshly painted facades, which were stained with color bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other street was so often mentioned this year together with the words "left-wing violence".</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason that not all neighbors see this as a problem may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: offenses such as bodily harm are directed to statistics almost exclusively against police officers.</seg>
<seg id="25">The majority of the offenses constitute damage to property, which tend to meet the new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a tenement house for the past 17 years next to the controversial 94, there can be no question of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As for violent acts, it is appeasing: the people in the 94 are their neighbors, they were not that.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars do not exist anymore in Riga.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary: "They help each other, live together on the street and get more from one another than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer deliberately moved to Riga Street.</seg>
<seg id="31">That's why it was so important for the residents to get back to their streets: from the police, the politics and the media, who all of them suddenly claimed the importance of interpreting the district in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the street is still being taken away from them: through faceless new buildings in former vacant lots, which the old inhabitants displace.</seg>
<seg id="33">"These are ultimately condominiums, which are not interesting for many people here - people who are not so well looked after are more likely to live here," she says.</seg>
<seg id="34">"Violence and destruction, I can absolutely not approve."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what can you do if nobody ever listens to you?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the residents.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little sympathy for people who are attracted to color bombs: the house projects and the left scene belonged to the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="38">Anyone who pulls should be aware of this - just like someone who moves into a pub area, can complain badly about noise.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons with only first names have asked not to be named with their real name</seg>

<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organization, working with people on the ground and also behind the scenes, as well as networking activities.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been around for six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has limited a 50 per cent point to three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"It was high time," says Regine Kunde, that Annika Deuschle supports honorary and full-time actors.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon there will be new containers in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem has been finding homes for the follow-up refugees who have been recognized for some time.</seg>
<seg id="18">The local authorities are responsible for the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must place the refugees in their own or rented premises.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs of building, renting or renovating these accommodations must be borne by the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">Responsibility changes from Landratsamt to municipalities and job centers.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: There are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the administration does not find any private dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="25">It does not work so far, but one is dependent on private apartments, according to Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, municipal housing must be upgraded as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be set up in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments is it not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a permanent place, there are placements, training places, school places, one-euro jobs and assistance for refugees and migrants who have to be found or established.</seg>
<seg id="31">"More places would be good," reports Regine Kunde.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the construction yard or help housemasters, do non-profit work - and that motivates and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">It hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is "no occupational therapy".</seg>
<seg id="35">But work does not just mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a firm structure, says Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So it needs such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So here, too, administration and honorary officials are taking part.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees feel that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the proceedings is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They have to explain to the refugees that it is just taking time and that they can bridge the time meaningfully, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Anyone who develops the feeling that he can not help anyone in Urbach, should not work and be useless, will never integrate.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">But there are also problems, says the customer, "people who do not mind." The work of Deuschle and the customer is therefore always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">This is already a "mammoth task".</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do they have fear of radicalization after the recent occurrences, even in a small municipality like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"No," says Regine customer clearly, "what may be called naive", but a residual risk can not and does not exclude it.</seg>
<seg id="50">The helpers were already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also the subject of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They are afraid that the assassin will bring them completely into disrepute.</seg>
<seg id="53">"They want to show that they have nothing to do with it," Regine says.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So the main and honorary officials have to look for activities on the ground and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that a new blow to refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need an upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly, the policy shies.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it is unfair to hire helpers on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="60">"In Urbach, we have not yet arrived where we are going," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the location.</seg>
<seg id="62">Reginekunde also makes it clear that the Urbacher are already fully utilized to integrate the existing people sensibly.</seg>
<seg id="63">At present there are about 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they need help, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, since there are no simple answers.</seg>
