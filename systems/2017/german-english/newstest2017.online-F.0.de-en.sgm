<seg id="1">Clintons and Trumps economic policy in the comparison: It's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">In infrastructure and the trade agreement invests TTP prevents - both Clinton and Trump want that.</seg>
<seg id="3">In disagreement itself the two US president shank applicants are however with the tax and energy policy as well as in a matter of principle.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in the economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton a fundamental, rather philosophical difference is the basis.</seg>
<seg id="5">That, over the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep rather small in the doubt and warns before it, like the state of the economy to harm can - with taxes and adjustments.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to tax and to death adjust the economy to death, says it.</seg>
<seg id="8">It against it would completely different be, maintains Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">It will go back adjustments substantial, and he makes himself strong for an extensive tax revision with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton against it says: The state has to fulfill certain tasks, it has disadvantaged opportunities to open and needs for it money.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore the taxes for the realms were increased, say them.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly enough itself both very close with the topic infrastructure is.</seg>
<seg id="13">Into those, nearly says Trump and Clinton must be invested.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic applicant announces the largest investment into new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">National investment programs into the infrastructure are classical democratic policy and for instance by the state-critical Teaparty wing of the republicans are strictly rejected.</seg>
<seg id="16">To Trump thus still internal party discussions could come.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences are clearer in the energy and climate policy.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power stations and the coal promotion in the USA again for raising.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should be possible also in areas protected so far, which Paris climate protection agreements wants it to quit.</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton against it wants to develop the renewable energies with its investment program expressly and demands: “A country will become the superpower of the clean energies and millions jobs will create.”</seg>
<seg id="21">“It becomes probably either China, Germany or America its - I want that we are it.”</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only with the infrastructure - also with international trade agreements the two competitors are not too far from each other distant.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazifische trade agreement, want not to sign both.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time both want to isolate however the USA not from the international trade - to separate simply only American jobs better to protect.</seg>
<seg id="25">Those are to be also better paid then, demand for instance Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The present minimum wage of 7,25 US Dollar is a pittance.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to 15 dollar per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">Which wants to do Trump in this question, is not completely clear: Once he says: The minimum wage must up, then it, he says may not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the large discussion of the coming months might develop probably rather around the tax policy of the both bearings.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one side stands Trump, which wants to relieve the economy and the citizens, in order to set growth in motion.</seg>
<seg id="31">Its critics reproach to it, thus became the budgetary deficit only more largely.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other side stands Clinton, which wants to require at least of the realms that they pay more taxes, and their critic to say: More taxes are also not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="1">Escape: “Each fled woman has experiences by sexual force”</seg>
<seg id="2">Sexual force belongs for women, who flee alone, nearly already to the everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="3">If they arrive at Germany, they are often traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen four women sit.</seg>
<seg id="6">Everyone has a baby, who is old at the most one year.</seg>
<seg id="7">One put its small son into the arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">It looks with large eyes curiously into the area.</seg>
<seg id="9">Its mother stares at the desk top.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until it notices that she is observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">It smiles briefly and kisses the small one.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene works normally.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until one speaks with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">She is a range range from Condrobs, a carrier for social offers of help in Bavaria, and concerns herself among other things with the topic women on the escape.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are fleeing.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in Munich the north in one of the few decentralized accommodation for alone-fled women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January Condrobs opened the facility as well as pro Familia and that Munich for women's aid organisation.</seg>
<seg id="18">Recently it was officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">There 60 people live - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are men none - also not as a visitor.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard before the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">“It is not to be said exaggerated: Each woman, who arrives here, made, says experiences by sexual force on her escape” Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="23">“Men flee because of wars, because they are politically pursued, because torture or death threatens them or because they send, tell their families as hopes to Europe” them.</seg>
<seg id="24">With women other reasons for the escape outweigh: “Many steal themselves secretly of it because they do not see other way out”.</seg>
<seg id="25">In their homeland they made for experience with sexual force, forced marriages, honour killings, slavery or forced prostitution.</seg>
<seg id="26">That chases away it.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the escape that continues.</seg>
<seg id="28">“That tractors demand for example for a bottle of water a sexual action, are no rarity”, say Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone, them not by their families are protected.</seg>
<seg id="30">Who believes that end, as soon as they would arrive at Germany, err, tell Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="31">Single women in refugee accommodation were often regarded also here as inferior and abused at worst.</seg>
<seg id="32">That leads to it that about 90 percent of the women, who live in the accommodation in Munich the north it is traumatized, estimates it.</seg>
<seg id="33">“Did not develop surely some the children voluntarily”.</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so used to it that they do not say anything.</seg>
<seg id="35">“Or they dare not to speak openly about the experienced because the shame is too large”.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since they would often not know to help itself, need it more accommodation only for them, demand Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bavaria the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">To the question, whether they would know from a similar project as in Munich in their scope of responsibility, it answers some with no.</seg>
<seg id="39">In Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia about there is not something like that in accommodation of the governments.</seg>
<seg id="40">Also in Swabians alone fled women are accommodated separately, say Karl-Heinz Meyer, Pressesprecher of the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Upper Bavaria, under and middle Franconia there are floors or own houses in some community accommodation only for single women and their children.</seg>
<seg id="42">The exception is Lower Bavaria, there gives it to two central of accommodation exclusive for women.</seg>
<seg id="43">Also the committee of “rights of the woman and equality of the sexes” in the European parliament demands that women must be accommodated separately from men.</seg>
<seg id="44">In a study, which was published for the committee, it means: “It is very important that men and women are separately accommodated.”</seg>
<seg id="45">“The privacy is missing or men and women is together accommodated, can it continually - force against women come”.</seg>
<seg id="46">Above all the wash rooms should be easily accessible separately and for women, stand in the study.</seg>
<seg id="47">The how very women feel this protection need, one can read off from the crush, which there is on the house in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="48">“Since itself got around that there are us, have we a long waiting list”, says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="49">One could open easily a second house.</seg>

<seg id="2">Deputies of the assistant physicians called their trade union to approve new forms of industrial action with their disputes concerning a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors's Committee (JDC) that British Medical Association (BMA) demanded its entire advice to approve starting from at the beginning of September more forms of industrial action.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC stated that it Ministers would have neglected to deal with the concerns concerning the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">Assistant physicians and medical students co-ordinated in July on the refusal of a contract, which was agreed upon with the BMA.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was rejected of 58% of its members, that co-ordinated with the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a letter to the members, which was published on Thursday evening on Twitter, the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government would have remained “persistently calm” to problems, which led to the fact that the contract was rejected.</seg>
<seg id="8">She said: “Considering its JDC executive committee co-ordinated to reject the suggested new contract completely and to all your concerns requested official renegotiations.”</seg>
<seg id="9">When the JDC executive committee has today a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA of advice placed answer to the silence of the government, in order a current program of escalating forms of industrial action, at the beginning of Septembers begins to approve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The disputes led to it that assistant physicians struck this year six times, the first blackouts in the history of NHS.</seg>
<seg id="11">The director/conductor of the BMA of assistant physicians Dr. Johann Malawana withdrew after the choice for the refusal of the agreed upon contractual conditions, which had been recommended of the BMA.</seg>
<seg id="12">It communicated BMA to members during the meetings, which took place still before the vote by 54.000 assistant physicians and medical students, that the contract was favorable and should be accepted.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: A “alliance of outsiders”?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture, which terminated a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders Russlands and Turkey met on Tuesday, in order to give themselves the hands and to announce an official end of the eight months long persisting war of the words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish opponent in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburger of palace in receipt, I cannot refuse myself the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation at most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But of Putin smile worked schmallippig and he radiated hardly warmth, even for his reserved conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recep Tayyip Erdogan however spoke repetitive of its “dear friend” Putin - according to a report whole five time.</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it any longer.</seg>
<seg id="9">He promised also the fact that the relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis will even still improve but.</seg>
<seg id="10">On the next day a newspaper that Erdogan would have behaved in such a way, described as if something bad would have never happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">Its enthusiasm seemed to suggest rather the opposite to me.</seg>
<seg id="12">But, a lasting coolness radiating from Putin showed that head of state Russlands had not forgotten the anything.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather the cause of the crisis was first, which it mentioned in its introduction words: the firing of a Russian combat aircraft at the Syrian border by Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow reaction at the time was inflamed with rage.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin distributed and accused Ankara of, Russia in the backs pleases to be.</seg>
<seg id="16">Offence was even still larger, since it was committed by an alleged friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Vetrauen will again construct with difficulty, if become not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">The public opinion in Russia changed itself for November.</seg>
<seg id="19">Months long implemented the state-controlled mediums a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At once it seemed, as if the Turks for everything would carry the debt.</seg>
<seg id="21">The accusations were most serious from leading officials that Erdogans own family would have profited from the illegal oil trade in areas of Syria, which are controlled by the so-called Islamic state.</seg>
<seg id="22">It denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St. Petersburg the official message that it was time read, to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally this meeting took place only, because Putin received the apology, which it wanted to hear from president Erdogan.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara the advantages of an armistice are clearly obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan needs primarily all friends, whom he can get, after he was relieved last month with a failed coup d'etat nearly of his office.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repetitive terrorist raids on Turkey likewise shook it.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions met Turkey hard - in particular the prohibition of charter flights, which bring each year usually several millions Russian tourists to the Turkish coast.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number decreased around nearly 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia tour operators and charter companies will be relieved, if the flights are again taken up.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a lateseasonal attack to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week prognosticated public television cheaper fruit and vegetable, as soon as the Turkish agrarian imported goods are again permitted.</seg>
<seg id="35">A report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows: “Tourists there long, tomatoes here long.”</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious on the west, since it regards its reaction to the tried seizure of power as weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">In addition continuous resentment over the snail speed of the EU accession negotiations and the Putin come - which are eager to pull from the cool tendency benefit and to reduce the relationship of Turkey with the west.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara with security for the fact that he demanded support for the selected state organs after the tried coup d'etat.</seg>
<seg id="40">That is for Moscow mind you a matter of course, which has even a low-sitting fear of regime changes.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glossful palace at the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey to represent one, as it described me an analyst once, to “alliance of outsiders”: two countries, of the west offended and badly treated feel and now groups.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, exist between the two still large differences.</seg>
<seg id="43">The largest difference is Syria, where Moscow gave itself recently the role as a peacemaker, but where opposite sides support Russia and Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be characteristic that after nearly three hours at Erstgesprächen both presidents to the press conference stated that they would not have even touched the topic.</seg>
<seg id="45">The president of Turkey avoided to answer it intentionally to a question over its differences, during Putin itself in addition decided these to stress.</seg>
<seg id="46">No clear consent is present over it where a common denominator can be found to Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect Disaster, when the NATO member Turkey shot the Russian fighter plane - it is surely better that the two heads of state talk again with one another at least.</seg>

<seg id="2">The brand RBS is to be reduced according to the chief executive of the bank only more to a Back Office role.</seg>
<seg id="3">Royal Bank OF Scotland for customers outside of Scotland no longer will be available.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ross McEwan communicated Scotland to the BBC that the brand RBS with the global ambitions of the bank were connected.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bank dissociated itself since then, when it before eight years nearly collapsed and had to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this time brand strategists used “RBS” to protect other final consumer financial brands.</seg>
<seg id="7">It supported the international sport with millions pound at sponsoring, of the Six nation rugby up to the Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.</seg>
<seg id="8">But now it decided to move more national brands into the focus.</seg>
<seg id="9">Royal Bank OF Scotland only for customers in Scotland will be available, but one will not initialize.</seg>
<seg id="10">In England and Wales all PUCB becomes references, which changes decentralized head office and the stock exchange quotation to NatWest.</seg>
<seg id="11">The brand Ulster bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="12">There is other one, smaller brands for the private customer business, which will receive more meaning - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military bank.</seg>
<seg id="13">McEwan was interviewed during an inspection tour by customers and employees into Inverness shire.</seg>
<seg id="14">It divided the BBC Scotland with: “The brand PUCB will become now our investor brand as well as the brand, under which our employees will be employed, there we more a bank of brands.”</seg>
<seg id="15">When the bank became a global brand, RBS became the global brand.</seg>
<seg id="16">I say now that we do not pursue global goals, but local of goals.</seg>
<seg id="17">Each of these brands will be located somewhat perfectly in their own communities for different one and our employees will become under these brands with the customers to work.</seg>
<seg id="18">RBS already stated that its Six nation sponsoring any longer it would not continue becomes and that it will increase the perceptibility of the different brands in its sport sponsoring.</seg>
<seg id="19">“It is time for us to develop to the bank of the brands because as we concentrate on the inside (we have in demand) to make this a better bank for customers?” the chief executive said.</seg>
<seg id="20">It would have been before three years very cynical, if we had said that we will be for our customers a great bank and these brands would have launched.</seg>
<seg id="21">But with our work, which on customer needs and our not own, I think focus, one many changes will see.</seg>
<seg id="22">We can launch these brands again, from there think I that the time came.</seg>

<seg id="1">Of Russia Putin chief of staff Sergei Ivanov fires</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian president Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov to dismiss.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ivanov was many years part of the closest confidence circle of Putin.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year old was appointed the particular agent for environmental and transport affairs.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a statement of the Kremlin it reads that Putin without giving reasons arranged “the dismissal Ivanovs of its obligations as a chairman of the Russian presidential administration”.</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who was since 2012 Ivanovs a deputy, was appointed his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">born, he made his conclusion at the renowned national one Muscovite Institut for international relations (MGIMO) for 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn and worked in the message in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin it (on Russian) means that he was late minutes boss and staff leader of government staff.</seg>
<seg id="10">About its appointment he said as Putin: “Thanks for your confidence.”</seg>
<seg id="11">I think that it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as a head of state relative bills and controls for the conversion of your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin communicated transmitters to the Russian TV on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave its post and Vaino as its successor had recommended.</seg>
<seg id="13">Do the smiling faces convince?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step made Moscow shrouded in mystery.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was long time of one closest familiar Vladimir Putins and works as he for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As a chief of staff it was one of the most powerful men that of country.</seg>
<seg id="17">With a meeting with president both men maintained Putin, who was on TV radiated, that the chief of staff withdraws on own desire.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, here only few are of it convinced - above all now, shortly before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">Is the subsequent of a kind struggle for power here thus present?</seg>
<seg id="20">At present nobody knows.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official statement - that a man, who was advertized once as a potential president would like to lead at once the Russian environmental policy - encountered large skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In its remarks at Putin, which are quoted on the website of the Kremlin, Ivanov said “it is true that I had asked you at the beginning of 2012 in a discussion to entrust to me this very much complicated posts - one could almost say - cumbersome posts four years long.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I am since four years and eight months of chairmen of the Russian presidential administration.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Before he was a deputy Prime Minister and Secretary of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is member of the Russian security council and like Putin former member of the state security service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">Into the late 1990er years, when Putin of chairmen of the federal security agency (FSB) was, the KGB, Ivanov replaced its deputy was appointed.</seg>
<seg id="28">As Putin to power called it arrived Ivanov as one of five people, which he to most familiar.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was accepted that Ivanov could become after of Putin second term of office president of Russia, since a third term of office of Putin would have offended against the condition.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by a further, intimate allied Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became an Prime Minister, before it became three and a half years later again the president.</seg>

<seg id="11">Despite the substantial size and weight the bridge, is the completion of the catch between the viaduct and the bridge deck a delicate activity, which require extremely precise tolerances for the fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">Altogether nearly 79% of the entire bridge deck at their place and the last section of the deck are receive today in Rosyth a concrete casting for the deck, which meant that the entire deck is ready, on the bridge to its place to be lifted.</seg>

<seg id="14">With this fantastic project the catch represents to trend-setting high and foundation engineering.</seg>

<seg id="17">This was a substantial and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>

<seg id="1">Who builds of Braunschweig favorable apartments?</seg>
<seg id="2">The SPD and the Green mean: Investors are to be taken in the future much more strongly into the obligation.</seg>
<seg id="3">How does one react to the bad message that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 favorable apartments in the next years?</seg>
<seg id="4">The SPD suggests a “action concept living” for next council meeting.</seg>
<seg id="5">But controversy is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">Primarily it concerns the question: Who is to actually build the favorable apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">SPD faction leader Christoph Bratmann means: “We are us with the Greens united: Who wants to build on urban surfaces, in the future 20 percent of all apartments than subsidized low-rent housings must prove.”</seg>
<seg id="9">The favorable apartments can develop however also in the existence.</seg>
<seg id="10">The large point at issue in the city hall is however, like that roasting man: “As one deals with investors, those on private surfaces to build wants?”</seg>
<seg id="11">“We want that investors on such surfaces build at least 10 percent, but as 20 a percent of the apartments as possible as subsidized low-rent housings.”</seg>
<seg id="12">A new urban housebuilding advancement program, which will cost millions and still must be financed, is to provide for incentives.</seg>
<seg id="13">The problem, so roasting man: “There is momentarily still no agreement between the parliamentary groups.”</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU would like to make if possible few regulations for investors.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left one wants still hardens editions for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Regardless of its, so roasting man, is at hand an aggravation of the situation on the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the action concept is converted, for additional tasks in the building authorities will provide.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff one needs.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the specialists.</seg>
<seg id="20">Still the program does not stand completely: Because those approximately 1260 new apartments, which should anyway are built.</seg>
<seg id="21">How however does one adjust the loss of further approximately 1300 favorable apartments, whose promotion will run out in the next years?</seg>
<seg id="22">However up to the year 2020 there will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">In order to prevent, so the planning-political spokeswoman Nicole Palm, connections of the city, running out now, should be purchased.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition would have to be thought to get apartments again back into the application of fixed prices.</seg>
<seg id="25">That is possible in Weststadt.</seg>
<seg id="26">At one blow the problem would let itself solve.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because run out in Weststadt to the end of the year eking out.</seg>
<seg id="28">One could get approximately 1800 apartments there back into the application of fixed prices for favorable apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: The owners, housing associations do not want that.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because the number of the subsidized low-rent housings in Weststadt is increased again drastically, departs one from the goal of the so-called mixing.</seg>
<seg id="31">A concentration of socialweak in only few quarters is not to give it any longer.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens count on the fact that it will give still movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">Leader of the parliamentary group Holger Herlitschke means: “For a broad majority the CDU must also in the boat.”</seg>
<seg id="34">Those concentrated on more building sites for single family houses.</seg>
<seg id="35">Which however it does not mean that still another compromise cannot be found.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and luck, which are worthwhile themselves</seg>
<seg id="2">It is to be watched fascinatingly, how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">The fact that teenagers and child do not go to no more to playing to outside was deplored but it rather to prefer to spend their spare time thereby at screens to stare, in the last decade by many.</seg>
<seg id="4">With Pokemon Go goes it around getting and become more active letting people from the sofa to.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time at the screen was at first limited to the television, then to video games and last to smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">From there it is to be seen greatly that technology and activities in the free one are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">I refer thereby naturally to the Pokémon Go-illusion, an app, which is based on the characters, those first for the video games into the 1990ern to create (later developed from it an indication trick series, playing cards and other spin Offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many phenomena of the popular culture the interest before the publication of the play sank in the USA, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July somewhat.</seg>
<seg id="9">The introduction on the market in other countries was shifted by the substantial demand, which overloaded the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go of more users than Tinder and nearly so many had like Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it function?</seg>
<seg id="12">Briefly said the players with their smartphones go looking for outside and for Pokémons, which are after-pursued with a GPS and, as soon as they were once found, “photographed” (over a screenshot on the mobile phone) or to become “imprisoned taken” to be able.</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation, which played the play, when it was still younger, followed the illusion and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the USA the play led to a considerable rise at steps, which the “average” person puts back each day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, app for Apple Watch, which after-pursues 35,000 users, communicated Washington Post recently that within two days after introduction on the market of the play, which started number of of the after-pursued people, which train each day 30 minutes, from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The enterprise does not know, who plays of it Pokémon Go - it sees only the raw data for increase in output.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public clearing-up campaigns to the health, the people to it to bring want “30 minutes time to take themselves,” “from the sofa to come” and “each day be active” discovered deaf ears, because many public messages are boring to the health and come from people, which look miserable.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless the meaning of sport cannot be overestimated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Who drives regularly sport, reduces its opportunities to get sick with cancer or depressions.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical manipulation helps with weight control to state high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list at advantages, which too long are, in order it here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful at Pokémon Go is that it brings the people to do something in the free one that them joke makes.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three columns of the health are taken off - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as joke.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people close even new friendships on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As there are always also grumpy spoilsports, who must always weight about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it?</seg>
<seg id="27">A break-through occurred.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphones apps could after-pursue such as fit bits already in former times our activity, they did not give us a reason to drift sport as it does this play.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its attraction and will leave the use with the time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Due to Pokemons success will give it however more plays, which will unite apps and virtual reality with in the real world and will help many people on the hunt, more actively, to be more fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="8">On whole line brilliantly.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now finally also olympia winner.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year old American Turnerin ascended on Thursday to the multi-combat title and increased the gap between itself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the searchlight beam of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Their total result of 62,198 was appropriate clearly before the silver medal winners and “final Five” - for crew companion Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.</seg>

<seg id="14">It broke out in tears, when their final result was shown and their be enough for travel in this moment an end found.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success places it into the same league as singular athletes as Michael Phelps, which brought their kinds of sport to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles won the last three years their kind of sport dominated, 15 world champion medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises, which contain a mixture from ambition and precision that the olympia winner said Mary Lou Retton of 1984 of it that it is “the best Turnerin, which I ever saw.”</seg>
<seg id="17">It expected it a last examination in Brazil, a competition, which did not go so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between it and a load of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not with a handful of gold back to the family in jump, Texas return, would be as disappointment to be viewed.</seg>

<seg id="21">Although Biles insisted on it, during its long way on the point, the future to have never planned, is not really true that.</seg>
<seg id="22">A part of their ground exercises - which contain its typical Tumbling passport - is co-ordinated with Latin American music, which would fit at home on the road outside of the olympia arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">That is not coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, who was adopted of its grandparents as a small child and discovered of coach Aimee Boormans mother during a school trip into the gymnasium, in the Boorman trained, became the strength.</seg>
<seg id="25">It lost no more multi-combat competition since the summer 2013, a winning streak, which will so for a long time continue, as it wishes Biles.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even if Mustafina led by two turns easily, the picture trügte.</seg>
<seg id="27">Balance beams and floor exercises - in those Biles the world champion title holds - lay in wait.</seg>
<seg id="28">It got again with 15,433 on the balance beam - and set with 15.933 on the ground still a one on it.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman embraced it gently as it their Endergbnis expected - a pure formality - and tears flowed on Biles shining red, white and blue Eyeliner, when the vision, which described it once in her collecting book, became the reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The achievement Raismans was a revenge for the last mark before four years, when it fought for the third place, but the bronze medal in a Tiebrake at Mustafina went.</seg>
<seg id="31">This time the 22-year old captain, who is called by the Americans “granny”, had a lead.</seg>
<seg id="32">After its ground exercise she threw kiss hands to the audience, overwhelmed from a comeback, which appeared doubtful sometimes.</seg>

<seg id="18">But it is not a typical sign language -- she says. Edmund invented some indications alone.</seg>
<seg id="19">Mikrozephalie has a variety at causes: genetic as with Edmund as well as infections with viruses such as measles or the Zikavirus during the pregnancy.</seg>

<seg id="26">I did not ask already for a long time no more for the prognosis, because I do not expect that she can really say someone to me.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is, which I introduce myself under the woman Olympic team in doing gymnastics and which from more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First of all I participate since 1984 with each Summer Olympic Games and the USA was never so dominantly.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: This crew has three turn gutters, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren “Laurie” Hernandez, which worked for many young girls of other skin color inspiring.</seg>
<seg id="5">Structure this crew, which Aly Raisman, which is Jew and is Madison Kocian, the catholic, round off, make everyone proudly.</seg>
<seg id="6">This crew reflects finally the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the point of this kind of sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years the number one was under the female turn gutters an Afro American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year were Simone and Gabby #1 and #2.</seg>
<seg id="10">That shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">With the last Olympic Games a Gabby Douglas's was surprising olympia winner and America was jubilant.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world in the position, a witness of the unbelievable achievement of the three-way world champion Simone Biles was to be Douglas and Laurie Hernandez like it unexpected, but masterful Gymastikroutinen supplied.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American, who won during an individual multi-combat event for women Gold.</seg>
<seg id="14">Crew member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the point of this kind of sport, but turn classes do not look generally speaking country in such a way.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie knocked all the same way as Aly and Madison, in order to create it into the olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the “last five”, because the next Olympic team will have only four turn gutters in the crew. In addition that is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a coach.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality looks in such a way that doing gymnastics an expensive sport is and gymnasts are responsible primarily in private gymnastics clubs, which will maintain from parents those for the training, facility, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the coaches and their gymnast and families). The list can be continued at will.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these gymnastics clubs lie in wealthy suburbs, which can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs the gymnasts receive their entire training and that are for the families an expensive and long-term commitment.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, Trainerin of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, Trainerin of Laurie Hernandez, have both their athletes to have trained, since then her with doing gymnastics to have begun.</seg>
<seg id="22">We must make aun innumerable, young girls, who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, for the communities possible a leistbareres and more easily accessible Turntrainung.</seg>
<seg id="23">I created my turn foundation of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">With my events we ordered free and affordable doing gymnastics in Harlem for over 15.000 urban young people (above all black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown), in order to offer to the youth high-quality doing gymnastics, which earn the possibility of learning and of profiting from this great olympic kind of sport to.</seg>
<seg id="26">Do gymnastics develop strength, flexibility and co-ordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and certainty for the spirit.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong advantages for the health as well as for school and vocational success.</seg>
<seg id="28">The inspiration of this crew, which thousand young girls bring to it, is to be interested in doing gymnastics and that is great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in the sport particularly for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">That is a in such a way stretching time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank if Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this genuine representation of “Girl power” by getting the olympic crew gold and, if barrel it thanks so many young girls with different background motivated to become in order to begin their way, healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="1">Assistant physicians would like to organize further strikes, after they rejected Jeremy Hunts's proposal</seg>
<seg id="2">The Ministers had hoped to be able to terminate the controversy over the changes by acceptance of a reformed contract with the functionaries that British Medical Association but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistant physicians, who co-ordinated with a choice, rejected it.</seg>
<seg id="3">In July Hunt Pläne had revealed, whom contract said obligatorily to introduce and the fact that in a “no man's land” would be NHS and each further delay for the employees and patient would be harmful.</seg>
<seg id="4">The first assistant physicians are to receive a new contract, which contains changes to night and weekend works, in order to improve the care to inhospitable times.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dr Ellen McCourt, the chairman of the BMA Kommittees for assistant physicians divided last night in a report with: “Assistant physicians have serious doubts to the suggested contract still to treat all physicians fairly in particular that it will neglect the present staff crisis to heat up and it.”</seg>
<seg id="6">At only eight weeks, which still remain, until the first group of physicians under the new contract fall, must progress are made and the time runs out.</seg>
<seg id="7">Efforts on the part of the BMA for the solution of the disputes by discussions encountered at the government on aversions to take part and sometimes deafening silence.</seg>
<seg id="8">That happened the one promise, which had made Jeremy Hunt only last month over the fact that its door would always be open.</seg>
<seg id="9">“Jeremy Hunt must now act, which waive imposition and which concerns of the assistant physicians address”.</seg>
<seg id="10">If he should not do this, then the assistant physicians made it clear that they are ready to accomplish further forms of industrial action.</seg>

<seg id="12">The Ministers had hoped to be able to terminate the controversy over the changes by an acceptance of the reformed contract with the functionaries that British Medical Association.</seg>
<seg id="13">The BMA would like a better Wochendentlohnung for the 54,000 assistant physicians, who will be subject to the contract.</seg>
<seg id="14">Daniel Mortimer, general manager of NHS of the employees, requested the assistant physicians to terminate the strike.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mortimer said: “Forms of industrial action reach nothing the only few, load however teams and service providers already over-burdening and prepare the patients, male nurses and its families only concerns, emergency and interruption.”</seg>
<seg id="16">In the last two months we spoke me the committee of the assistant physicians and with the Ministry of Health as well as other Ministries positively to the doubts regarding the guardianship and the Whistleblowings answered.</seg>
<seg id="17">The employers hoped that the continued positive commitment about other important - like delegation, flexibility with training courses, additional training courses for those, which return from a vocational time-out, Schulungsksten, mutual acknowledgment of the curriculum, study leave and the gender pay gap in the medicine - an indication of it were, like seriously it the employers, which was Health Education England and the Ministry of Health concerning the adherence to the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.</seg>

<seg id="2">Thousands of heart attack patients will profit from a £2-pro day medicine, after by the authorities one recommended to give this to more people for a longer period.</seg>
<seg id="3">The coagulate-restraining medicine Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repetitive cardiac infarcts for people with a heart illness.</seg>
<seg id="4">The medicine is given already 12 months long after a cardiac infarct, whereby the risk of an apoplexy or a further cardiac infarct is reduced.</seg>
<seg id="5">The regulatory authority NICE of NHS recommended a four years long income, in order to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems further.</seg>
<seg id="6">The regulatory authority NICE of NHS recommended a four years long income, in order to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems further.</seg>
<seg id="7">Approximately 140,000 people suffer each year a cardiac infarct and a quarter of it suffer a further cardiac infarct or an apoplexy.</seg>
<seg id="8">Cardiac infarcts and apoplexies are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the arterial walls, which form surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="9">If the surface breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot, which causes flow of blood up to the heart clogged and thus a cardiac infarct.</seg>
<seg id="10">If the blood clot separates, it can flow by the bloodstream and clog flow of blood to the brain, which causes an apoplexy.</seg>
<seg id="11">People, who had already a cardiac infarct, are subject to a higher risk a further to have.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, which is manufactured by the British enterprise AstraZeneca and under the trade name Brilique is driven out, reduces this risk, by making the formation of blood clots more improbable.</seg>
<seg id="13">The instruction draft of NICE, which was today published, recommends a 12-month income of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed from 60mg with a twice daily income of Aspirin for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Professor Carole Longson, Direktorin of the NICE of health technology evaluation center said: “A quarter of all people, who suffered a cardiac infarct, has defiance of the availability of secondary prevention a further cardiac infarct or an apoplexy - often with disastrous consequences.”</seg>
<seg id="15">The fear of a renewed cardiac infarct can have substantial negative effects on the quality of life of a person.</seg>
<seg id="16">The experience shows that Ticagrelor is effective in combination with Aspirin with the reduction of further cardiac infarcts and apoplexies at people, which had already a cardiac infarct.</seg>
<seg id="17">By a provisional recommendation of Ticagrelor we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of humans who can profit from it.</seg>
<seg id="18">The information about the effectiveness and security of Ticagrelor - above all the bleeding risk - are limited to one period of up to three years. The instruction draft does not recommend treatment, which goes beyond this period.</seg>

<seg id="2">The former mayor von Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed last year on reason of a government report because of corruption from the office</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of the Political Correctness led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is knowingly ignored like a destroying government report today revealed.</seg>
<seg id="4">The former cabinet member sir Eric Pickles attacks verbal the police, election observer and city halls proofs of choice abuse due to “hypersensitivenesses concerning ethnicity and religion” to have ignored.</seg>
<seg id="5">The former Minister for integration and local government, which are now a Antkorruptionskönig, it said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that it should be permitted the police to furnish shut-off volumes outside from polling booths in order intimidated voters to protect.</seg>
<seg id="6">It recommends that voters should lead a document of identification with itself, in order to prove with elections their identity.</seg>
<seg id="7">At present a voter must call only its name and address.</seg>
<seg id="8">The report suggests laying not removable ink on on the finger of a person if they deliver their vote, in order to prevent that someone selects twice.</seg>
<seg id="9">Whistleblower should receive more protection, say sir Eric.</seg>
<seg id="10">It demands that the press more entrance to community documents and decisions of not official Kommittees or working groups should have.</seg>
<seg id="11">“Also the local government before the broader corruption and finance fraud culture, which accompany with it, does not only serve protects,” said it against electoral fraud, but is.</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was arranged of the Downing Street as consequence of the Tower Hamlets of choice scandal in the east of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last year decided a special choice court that the acting mayor Lutfur Rahman should be relieved after a litany at corrupt and illegal practices of his office.</seg>
<seg id="14">The court found that Rahman the religious feelings of its Muslim community would have perverted " in cynical way” and that it would have hushed its critics with racing SiS mash and Islamophobienanschuldigungen.</seg>
<seg id="15">Rahman is to have led “its campaign on the basis that it is the religöse obligation of Muslims, it to select.”</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 voices were either doubtful or the consequence of an imitation, with which a person selects as someone else.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said that there would be generally speaking country of proofs for fraud.</seg>
<seg id="18">He expressed himself in particular alarming to the fraudulent absentee voting - at older members would have made the Muslim community pressure on people to select a candidate of their choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sir Eric, shown, made several recommendations, in order to clean the choice system, including leading documents of identification, in order to prove the identity</seg>
<seg id="20">In its report it means: “As proof it was attached that pressure was exerted on members in need of protection of some ethnic minorities, in particular women and young people, in order to select in accordance with the will the older ones, in particular communities with background of Pakistan or of Bangladesh.</seg>
<seg id="21">“There were doubts that… national institutions would knowingly have ignored such a behavior due to “politically correct” hypersensitivenesses concerning the ethnicity and religion.”</seg>
<seg id="22">Sir Eric expressed 50 recommendations, in order to clean the system to stop including the prohibition that political activists works on absentee voting documents, in order “choice elections”.</seg>
<seg id="23">The report, which is considered by Theresa May, requires also harder registration examinations, in order to prevent that the choice listing is used for immigration and social fraud purposes.</seg>
<seg id="24">Options consider to ask voters before the choice for your document of identification.</seg>
<seg id="25">Do not use removable ink on the finger of a person, as soon as it delivered her voice, in order to prevent that someone selects twice.</seg>
<seg id="26">To accomplish systematic examinations over the nationality of a person, in order to guarantee that they are entitled to vote.</seg>
<seg id="27">A three-year delimitation on requests for an automatic absentee voting.</seg>
<seg id="28">Prohibition that political activists works on complete absentee votings and envelopes of absentee votings.</seg>
<seg id="29">Give the power to the police to furnish closing around choice elections.</seg>
<seg id="30">A law change, which facilitates an accusation because of intimidation in accordance with the Representation OF the People act 1983 (representative government law 1983).</seg>
<seg id="31">Photographing prohibition in choice elections.</seg>
<seg id="32">Requirement that only English in the choice elections may be used (with exception of Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">Intensification of the training, in order to guarantee that the employees implement the rule that voters go alone into the polling booth.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sir Eric falls over the metropolitan policy and finds it “amazingly” that after the Tower Hamlets case a charge one did not place.</seg>
<seg id="35">“The choice court explained,” said Lutfur Rahman and its deputy for due to a litany at corrupt and illegal practices as unfit it.</seg>
<seg id="36">It became due to a set of reasons for sufficient - in accordance with the high requirements in the criminal procedure - guiltily admits.</seg>
<seg id="37">He criticizes also ineffective “checking off controls” of the choice registration elections of the city halls.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Eric said: “The court decision in Tower Hamlets from the last year was a warning signal.</seg>
<seg id="39">Our country carries a proud inheritance, but the causing concern and covered propagation of electoral fraud and denying some authorities as the mother of the parliaments threatens this good reputation.</seg>

<seg id="2">Die Welt outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make it somewhat safer for you.</seg>
<seg id="3">We spoke with Rhon Mizrachi, a grand master of the Krav Maga of federation in New York, in order to find out, how one deals with armed robbers on close distance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Independently of whether one approaches you from the front or from the rear you this video will show, how you turn the tables for your robber.</seg>
<seg id="5">If one approximates you from the rear, then you should turn as the first, so that you can see your aggressor and “from the line of fire gone”, Mizrachi says itself.</seg>
<seg id="6">Seize the weapon then between your front arm and your shoulder before you it with your free elbow in the face strike.</seg>
<seg id="7">Strike it then with the knee into the ledge and rotate you, while the aggressor before pain together-curves, the weapon from its hands. Strike it with the run in the face and move you backwards, while they direct the weapon toward it.</seg>
<seg id="8">With aggressors, that approach from the front, the technology is similar - move your body from the line of fire, seize you the weapon and rotate you them, so that the aggressor cannot shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">If you shift at the same time the weight on the weapon and if you strike the aggressor on the chest, then you rotate the weapon from its grasp, before they move backwards and direct the weapon toward it.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveler submitted its immune system and choking reflex of a serious examination - by licking some the dirtiest and most disgusting places of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk scraped its course on a euro-light, a railing at the Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing button of a course toilet as well as a public telephone in Russia, in order to prove the ruggedness of its immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before licking each object it used a Luminometer, in order to appear and us, in which it will get involved.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title “The Lickhiker's Guide ton internal Strength”, brought some surprising results to the daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought to lick the rinsing button of a course toilet which already by thousands of others one used, may be completely repulsive, but more bad bacteria actually are in a kitchen rinse.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his travel by Europe Mr. Wright with physicians and medical specialists spoke about the promotion of intestine bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately nothing that he licked, left more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright became admits to test the ruggedness of its intestine by traveling by the world and strange as well as wonderful things ASS.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public railings at stations up to rinsing buttons of toilets, the task placed its immune system definitely under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film it told: “As a child I was relatively unconcerned already, which concerns my health and I have all possible things put into my mouth, earth, worms and mud water.”</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film it became in any case fair its call.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only one which it rejected, was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its sample reduction showed a Luminometerzahl from over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the comparison to it the Luminometerzahl of freshly washed hands amounts to less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to lick, after their Luminometerzahl over 4000 units amounted to, while freshly washed hands exhibit one of less than 60</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio produced the travel film “The Lickhiker's Guide ton internal Strength”, which shows the bacteria number at different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">In the film he says: “Approximates the worst one, which I smelled in a toilet.”</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing dirtier than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will lick here nothing, because it is disgusting here inside.</seg>
<seg id="21">“The Lickhiker's Guide ton internal Strength” was produced in co-operation with the Finnish manufacturer by milk products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The enterprise equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D, in order to support the promotion of intestine bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios senior Venice President for snack, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: “We wanted to really offer something new to the consumers.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something, which is fascinating for looking at and at the same time the advantages by Probiotika explained.</seg>
<seg id="25">We accomplished moved brainstorming, which ended with the fact that we said “let us leave us Ian to call.”</seg>
<seg id="26">They maintain that the interest in intestine health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">In place of only about the products to talk, we wanted to place them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the meaning of the intestine health and like it is linked with the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The increasing interest in the intestine health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary film could we to the consumers available over it more information in an interesting way make.</seg>
<seg id="29">I think also that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, which led the direction of the film, added: “Leaving it me to say in such a way - I would have mean respect for Ian lost, if he had licked some the things, I it instructed to lick, as the disgusting Russian toilet, those in the film am shown.”</seg>
<seg id="31">Naturally there were things to bring with which it was simpler, Ian to it to lick and others, with which this was rather difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">I am glad that we took up some these dirty treats on film.”</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey accomplished by Valio from the year 2015 it associated 84 percent of all asked lactic acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestine and 58 percent stated that they use at least occasionally products, which contain attached lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">An antisocial family left its subsidized low-rent housing after a Delogierung with a damage at a value of £50.000, because it had terrorized her neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list at complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After they were removed by force from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in a irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls exhibited gaping holes, timber floor boards were broken, garbage on the floor scattered and graffiti to the walls lubricated.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family it was resettled and is accepted that she lives now in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, which works for the housing management at Cornwall housing, said that she feared that the apartment beyond repair is.</seg>
<seg id="8">She said: “It was for the people an absolute nightmare and I am here the opinion that people do not have to live in this way.</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider, since this property will be probably viewed as not so beautiful part of Cornwalls.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and their call is it likewise.</seg>
<seg id="11">The pair had three sons, who lived in the meantime in the apartment and which police said that the terror, which had added the family covered street fights with baseball bats, intimidating adjacents resident, drug abuse, drug trade and excessive crying, controversies and swearing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skeldon, 47, its name on the lease was located, received in June an arrangement for anti-social behavior.</seg>
<seg id="13">In some areas of the house, which will be perhaps torn off, old garbage was found</seg>
<seg id="14">In the property, in which in the past drugs were acted, the timber floor boards were broken</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours stated that they saw fighting them on the road and regularly the police to be called had</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall housing delogierte it and their partner this week by force from the property, after her them an extended eke out from 11 weeks gave, in order to take off voluntarily.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Delogierung was cheered by relieved neighbours, that said that their life was made hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">One stated: “You bothered about nobody.”</seg>
<seg id="19">We lived 20 years beside them and it were always bad.</seg>
<seg id="20">The innumerable marks, which we say here the police, are unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="21">“This morning we could not sleep.”</seg>
<seg id="22">We rose, because it was here so calm - we are not used to that!</seg>
<seg id="23">Now, where they finally away are, it will become beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement manager of Cornwall housing, stated that it would have neglected the family with the local authorities to cooperate.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived 20 years in the house, to which the police in regular intervals was called, long</seg>
<seg id="26">On the side of the community center over-rampantly grown garbage and old toys were thrown down</seg>
<seg id="27">It added: “It is a dishonor that it neglected the tenant to accept any responsibility for their behavior and that their family since a Delogierung is always the last step, which considers Cornwall housing.</seg>
<seg id="28">That was a very difficult case, since the behavior was extreme and their acts for their neighbours had to be terrible to watch.</seg>
<seg id="29">I estimate all the work, those my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall as well as members of the community, which went courageously toward us and the information has us to send to have, carried out.</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will donate and the message to some neighbours comfort mediated that anti-social behavior is not tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">Fitzpatrick said that all three sons would have lived at different times in the house, but that they all were over 20.</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress, those left in one the bedrooms of the house after the Delogierung on the ground wirde</seg>
<seg id="33">Workers of the housing management will have to clear now garbage mountains, the house will surround</seg>

<seg id="35">Skeldon received a fine, after she admits herself the possession of a drug of the class B with commercial intention guiltily had.</seg>
<seg id="36">It stated that the money for a gravestone of its son Lee Skeldon was, which died 2013 with a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="37">After they were without shelter, is assumed Tanya and their partner live now in a private accommodation in Plymouth.</seg>
<seg id="38">Many room walls of the house were smeared with graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">The police say that it will delogieren tenants, who do not adhere to the house regulation</seg>
<seg id="40">Angela Crow of the police of Devon and Cornwall communicated that the Delogierung was a clear warning to the other tenants, who do not adhere to the house regulation.</seg>
<seg id="41">“This goes to those, which imagine that they can behave themselves without self-reproaches as well as to those, which were damaged by so a behavior” told them.</seg>
<seg id="42">The police of Devon and Cornwall will tolerate never criminal and anti-social behavior, who will co-operate further with partners, in order to protect our communities.</seg>

<seg id="2">“Who does not adapt and on packed suit-cases” the presiding of the Gulnear foundation dialogue and world, Ercan Karakoyun praises, sits, says Erdogan.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Kurdish community Germany counts at short notice on ten thousand protection-searching, which flee from Turkey to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the medium term it could become even “some hundred thousand”, believes the association chairman Ali Toprak.</seg>
<seg id="5">Because of the hard action of Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the putsch attempt the Kurdish community Germany expects a mass escape to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="6">“I count short term on ten thousands, in the medium term on some hundred thousand protection-searching from Turkey in Germany, if the Erdogan regime says the minorities and the democratic opposition further fought”, the association chairman Ali Toprak of the “world” of Friday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Because the government already covered months ago Kurdish centers with punitive actions, 500,000 Kurds are within Turkey on the escape.</seg>
<seg id="8">After the defeated putsch still secular and oppositional ethnic Turks would be added.</seg>
<seg id="9">Many will want to again begin in Europe, if they are continued to suppress in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="10">“It cannot be that a state, which accepts even refugees in the own country refugees produced”, it said to Toprak.</seg>
<seg id="11">The federation boss deplored the purposeful settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, in addition, in alevitischen cities.</seg>
<seg id="12">Thus Erdogan wants to increase the departure printing to the remaining Kurds.</seg>
<seg id="13">“You are the last large minority in Turkey, those Christian Armenian and Greek already in the past hundred years were exterminated or driven out”, said Toprak, who is also CDU member.</seg>
<seg id="14">The federation boss demanded that the Federal Government positions itself “as sharply as Austria against Erdogan and its supporters”.</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania: The native ones do not receive anything from the summer election campaign - and the holiday-makers from North Rhine-Westphalia may not select the federal state parliament.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">2021 already did not decide the election of the federal parliament again directly in the end summer holidays to take place, the Schweriner parliament at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">Because dumber than so far it does not go: Summer holidays, heat and election campaign for the Landtag - bites itself.</seg>
<seg id="6">The native ones, which are to be convinced by the election campaigners, are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">The most holiday-makers, who are in the country, on Usedom, reproaches or Hiddensee on the way, are not native ones, may thus not the federal state parliament select.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition practical problems come: In holidays aides, that hang posters up, are ballons blow up, flyers distribute and in the end voting count out to find only laboriously.</seg>
<seg id="9">By 4 September 2016, choice and last holidays day, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania must let past be issued once still election campaign scarcely at the people over itself.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if one can say that at all, began straight.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it concerns also somewhat: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, Anführer of a SPD/CDU coalition, must be afraid for his office.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, since 1998 a strongest party, lies now in surveys clearly behind the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="13">Becomes exciting, as strongly beginner AfD cuts off and which in the end coalition-suited remains remaining.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, makes a nearly inconspicuously working election campaign, sieved one from its large posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">It travels by the country, distributes roses and plauscht a little with the people, as it already his legendarily word-meager predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise soul ring got and gives cold feet chancellor Merkel the debt at blooming the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their refugee politics, it “we create” the ascent of the right populists accelerated, which will probably cost it now the beautiful office.</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with their leading candidate, who Minister of the Interior Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced, how it is, if one makes election campaign the wrong time at the correct place.</seg>
<seg id="19">It invited twice chancellor Angela Merkel to large demonstrations; Merkel election to the Bundestag circle lies in the northeast.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target audience did not tune, it was more Norths Rhine-Westphalia, citizen of Berlin and Saxony there than Mecklenburger and West Pomerania.</seg>
<seg id="21">“There the majority from other Federal states” was probable, complained Vincent Kokert, Secretary-General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently in the NDR.</seg>
<seg id="22">But it harms also nobody from other corners of Germany to listen once to Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise the northeast CDU does to a large extent without the usual election campaign conditions on market places and before shopping centres with parasols and ballons.</seg>
<seg id="24">That, then means Kokert, plays only a “subordinated role”.</seg>
<seg id="25">Also the union noticed that you wegbröselt on the country the basis that it must exert much to find again a wire to the people.</seg>
<seg id="26">You go it like that to linking, the SPD, the Green: in the widths of the country hardly available.</seg>
<seg id="27">The advice of the CDU election campaigner Kokert to its fellow combatants is however also exposing: “You must go there, where it hurts, i.e. where humans are: Village festivals, golden weddings, each birthday party must be used”.</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much stands on the play, Sellering called its SPD now to a particularly engaged election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In surveys the Social Democrats lay last with 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and only scarcely before the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">With the choice 2011 the SPD had won still clearly with 35,6 percent before the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Greens, a small party with seven percent in the surveys, might create the leap into the federal state parliament.</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue from the holidays emergency and move their election campaign mostly in the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">“Online election campaign”, calls it the regional chairmen Claudia Müller.</seg>
<seg id="34">Otherwise go green election campaigners on tracing after native voting citizens among the holiday-makers.</seg>
<seg id="35">Silke Gajek, the leading candidate, circles straight with a houseboat by the Mecklenburgian seas and finds it also still beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="36">Their impression: “Choice vacation in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania is not a punishment”.</seg>

<seg id="1">B27-Sanierung: Restaurants suffer from blockage</seg>
<seg id="2">At the speed, with which B 27 one reorganizes, it gives to grumble nothing.</seg>
<seg id="3">For the responsible persons of the construction work, which begins in the morning at 5.30 o'clock and ends only around 20 o'clock, there is everywhere praise.</seg>
<seg id="4">“Those made, tell everything rather jaggedly” Elvira Tetzlaff of the jet gas station.</seg>
<seg id="5">That is a superteam.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is also no delay.</seg>
<seg id="7">The building site could be moved at the beginning of the week to the half time according to plan after the south, to at the end of Octobers should everything be finished.</seg>
<seg id="8">Also the obligingness for the construction work of the responsible persons is praised, about if it concerns the facility from auxiliary entries.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the building site hiked on Monday after the south and also the blockage of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was waived and so that also the connection exists to Rottenburg again, the traffic conditions relaxed within the place.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can drive on now from Ofterdingen from B 27 again reciprocally.</seg>
<seg id="11">Alternate traffic by the place seems to decrease.</seg>
<seg id="12">“There it gave partial substantial complaints”, says for the traffic-technical management of the redevelopment responsible person deputy municipal managers to Florian King.</seg>
<seg id="13">The adjacents resident of brook sentence road, stone salmon route, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because many secret means looked for each other and rather trusted their Navi as the sign-posting.</seg>
<seg id="14">Which led to the fact that some truck in populated areas verfranste itself.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since also the speed limits were not kept, demanded the community strengthens the measuring vehicle from Mössingen on.</seg>
<seg id="16">“There were substantial excesses”, say King, which made itself well-informed over the situation times locally.</seg>
<seg id="17">There two to three per minute were already flashed.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fastest one was with 77 kilometers per hour in the Tempo-30-Zone on the way.</seg>
<seg id="19">Since the building site moved on, it became however calmer.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the businessmen at B 27 it is only a small comfort that for customers from Rottenburg now the road is again open.</seg>
<seg id="21">Into the cards to look businessmen do not leave themselves gladly.</seg>
<seg id="22">But that with them to revenue break-downs led B 27-Sanierung, it lets see through everyone, which one asks.</seg>
<seg id="23">However some more are less concerned and some.</seg>
<seg id="24">Who has to do with the “end customers” less, thus for other companies produced, for that the redevelopment has hardly consequences.</seg>
<seg id="25">In addition, also with the car dealership Maier speaks Thomas Sulz of a “at the most easy decrease”, grants that naturally “irregular customers are missing”.</seg>
<seg id="26">At the strongest shaken the restaurants are along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, Inhaber of the Steakhouse, before times crown, finds clear words.</seg>
<seg id="28">That already is existence-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="29">Not only it met it, but all restaurants “hard”.</seg>
<seg id="30">The customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.</seg>
<seg id="31">We must be glad over each euro revenue.</seg>
<seg id="32">It numbers the turnover losses on “far over 50 percent”.</seg>
<seg id="33">The road redevelopment threw its enterprise back “by two years”.</seg>
<seg id="34">It half of its employees had to dismiss.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half were to dismiss, had the policy differently reacted.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead head of the provincial government Jörg Schmidt answered to a request of Göhner, whether there could be a financial reconciliation, with the reference, the restaurant profits otherwise from the advantages the situation at B 27. Now it must carry just also the disadvantages, which arise as a result of the redevelopment.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other districts, where something so more generously one handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">With all complaints Göhner is sure itself that its restaurant will continue.</seg>
<seg id="39">Finally the family business is settled already since here 1715, refers it to long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">That other regular customers look in now because of the complicated traffic management less frequently, he can understand.</seg>
<seg id="41">If one cannot to drive here, it is also elsewhere beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="42">That its master clientele returns after the end of the repair works again, to it Göhner does not have doubts.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises with BSE and bird flu Göhner regards the effects of B 27-Bauarbeiten its customers as the largest crisis, which experienced its restaurant in its history of many years.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six months construction work, that is already brutal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Constantly in the name of the fight against terror at laws one screws.</seg>
<seg id="2">After the recent attacks Minister of the Interior de Maizière submits now a thick safety package.</seg>
<seg id="3">But which has a tolerance status with terror to do?</seg>
<seg id="4">And which says the coalition partner to all that?</seg>
<seg id="5">Thomas de Maizière gives the Versöhner.</seg>
<seg id="6">All its proposals are “politically reasonable” the coalition partner, say the Federal Minister of the Interior with the conception of its new safety package.</seg>
<seg id="7">They do not make excessive demands of anybody.</seg>
<seg id="8">Others, large points were discussed first within the parties.</seg>
<seg id="9">Also to it I take part.</seg>
<seg id="10">As a Minister of the Interior is however at results been to it and because of a “attainable consent” within the coalition.</seg>
<seg id="11">De Maizière let little time elapse after the recent attacks in Wuerzburg and Ansbach, before he presents his conclusions for security in the republic.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fail for it now however all the more extensively.</seg>
<seg id="13">Some is already well-known, announced, focused: The fact that a new security authority is to worry about cracking coded communication is not new.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also not the fact that Germany must convert several European Union-defaults to aircraft passenger data and gun law.</seg>
<seg id="15">The call to more closed circuit television and staff for the security authorities does not come just as surprisingly.</seg>
<seg id="16">Partially de Maizière starts a second approach for proposals, which were not to be made with the SPD so far: It wants sympathy advertisement for terrorist groups under punishment to place and to jihadists with double nationality the German passport unbutton.</seg>
<seg id="17">“That difficult points will be for the SPD”, grant the CDU man.</seg>
<seg id="18">It hold this nevertheless for reasonable and demand also nothing that has no opportunities at the coalition partner anyway.</seg>
<seg id="19">De Maizière presents a few new ideas also.</seg>
<seg id="20">Those have it partly in itself: It plans shortened proceedings for deportation and more possibilities for the arrest of humans before the deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees, who are gotten purposefully in the country, are to let their smartphones check before and Social Media accounts for a security examination to reveal.</seg>
<seg id="22">With tolerances for rejected asylum seekers it wants to place some still more badly than so far - for instance such, which commit criminal offences or throw their papers away consciously, in order to mask their identity.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of it is politically and legally delicate.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some works also still ill-considered and leaves questions open.</seg>
<seg id="25">And at some points - with the discrimination of waited one for example - the question arises: What has to do actually with security and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, de Maizière, says is important to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be placed in agreement that the assassins of Ansbach and Wuerzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">In addition many humans worryd themselves in view of the high refugee numbers around security.</seg>
<seg id="29">And things, which employed humans deeply, did not let themselves exclude just also in election campaign times.</seg>
<seg id="30">Internal security moved enormously into the focus.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only the attacks in the neighbourhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Wuerzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The disconcertion is large.</seg>
<seg id="34">And yes, election campaigns line up.</seg>
<seg id="35">Union and SPD position themselves with the topic internal security from there increasingly.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the past days it worked between the two parties highly.</seg>
<seg id="37">Only a mean controversy over the equipment of the Federal Police, then over a security-political idea collection of some union Ministers of the Interior, in which the department heads demand also a Burka prohibition and a break with the double nationality.</seg>
<seg id="38">De Maizière strives itself also here around conciliatory tones.</seg>
<seg id="39">From a break with the double passport do not think it anything.</seg>
<seg id="40">We pacified the discussion in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">It to open again, is not meaningful.</seg>
<seg id="42">And with a Burka prohibition it has constitutional doubts.</seg>
<seg id="43">Whether its own package at all corners is verfassungsfest and whether it is actually “reasonable” for the coalition partner, must itself only still show.</seg>
<seg id="44">It puts some in it, which could provide for controversy.</seg>
<seg id="45">But also the SPD tries at present to form itself with the topic internal security.</seg>
<seg id="46">Party chief Sigmar Gabriel signaled only times carefully willingness to have talks and says: “the SPD is ready to talk about everything which contributes to it, security further to increase”.</seg>

<seg id="15">Large support for VOLKSWAGEN is the Chinese market.</seg>
<seg id="16">Altogether the own brand mainly concerned that comes Lower Saxony anyway further mildly by the Diesel scandal: After the first seven months only a distribution minus from 0,9 percent stands to 3.37 million vehicles to beech.</seg>
<seg id="17">Company distribution boss of Fred Kappler could show from January to July of far sales sale.</seg>
<seg id="18">1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen in this time, world-wide 5.904 million.</seg>
<seg id="19">Volkswagen had manipulated exhaust tests with a software.</seg>
<seg id="20">Alone in Germany VOLKSWAGEN calls approximately 2.5 million car for re-equipment into the workshops.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the course of the re-equipment VOLKSWAGEN affirmed that the change of the cars does not have negative effects.</seg>
<seg id="22">After the re-equipment of the vehicles give it during fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance to no degradation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The car maker issues the customer after the re-equipment a “warranty-same” certificate, speak however not of a “warranty”, as it meant on Friday in company sources.</seg>
<seg id="24">Reason are legal intricacies.</seg>
<seg id="25">“Focus” had reported, Volkswagen grants to its German customers now nevertheless a warranty for reequipped Diesel models.</seg>
<seg id="26">On past Monday Volkswagen representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport would have confirmed this.</seg>
<seg id="27">From the Ministry of Transport it was confirmed that there was this meeting.</seg>
<seg id="28">“VOLKSWAGEN has to fulfill the editions of my commission of inquiry and the KBA at full extent.”</seg>
<seg id="29">“Deviations from it are not accepted”, explained Federal Ministers of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to Ministry.</seg>
<seg id="30">VOLKSWAGEN took over the warranty that at fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance after the re-equipment no degradations to take place and all type-approval-relevant vehicle values invariably existence to have.</seg>
<seg id="31">Volkswagen does not use the term “warranty” however, as it meant in company sources.</seg>
<seg id="32">With the far term “warranty” sees the possibility to Volkswagen the fact that customers come for example a half year to the re-equipment for instance with a damage to the engine into a workshop - and to the new software to attribute could do this, even if the damage thereby has to do nothing.</seg>
<seg id="33">Also in the interest of customer is important it to avoid that it comes with any other damage, which does not have to do nothing at all with the exhaust scandal to disconcertion regarding possible guarantee regulations, as it meant.</seg>
<seg id="34">Therefore do not use VOLKSWAGEN the term “warranty”.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination plates: who actually buys records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men of middle age love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you rush to the comment part, in order to scatter it under the alias NichtAlleEinsamenMännerMittlerenAlters with rough offenses, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov the much-discussed rerising of records is on one does not boom in Millennials, which want to welcome the news of physical articles to attribute but to Midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those, which bought recently a plate, are in all probability in the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">Indeed the age group of 18-24 is the most improbable buyer category.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also no hordes through hobby collecting tanks - it has an emotional meaning: older disk buyers keep their feelings rather for itself (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it spending alone time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But the results of YouGov are correct?</seg>
<seg id="9">If these blogs a news report on TV were, the camera would follow me, while I run in the midst of a busy road in Soho, a modest grey suit carries and wildly gestuliere, before I stop, my hands to hold and something determining said how: “Thus, you let a closer look on it throw us.”</seg>
<seg id="10">Thus, you let a view of it throw us.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart Sohos loses slowly at its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices fill now the buildings, in which once independent salespersen resided - still gives it a handful of fantastic disk special firms.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch the camera off for the next part in which I am located and tried in direct proximity to different men in such business to estimate their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I of Sister Ray (data's number: two young women, three men of middle age) in the Reckless record (data's number: eight men of middle age, a woman, probably in order the 20) follow, is long one day because of a meeting into London and goes through the business, in order to fill those few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is it a collecting tank, asks I?</seg>
<seg id="15">“I estimate already,” say he.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have approx. 3,000 or 4,000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, above shown (it sent the snapshot to me by email, did not follow I it home), line the walls of its living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason, why it possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of its available income: he now is able to buy plates which it could not afford to buy as it published and again articles which it sold, when it was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">“Many things, which I buy, are from the late 60ern, early 70ern, which appeared, when I was 11 or 12. ” He says things, with which I was too young probably somewhat, in order to buy her to me.</seg>
<seg id="20">It agrees that and it adds those, which buy plates, rather introverted are and gladly alone time spend: “I do not smoke and I drink not very much.</seg>
<seg id="21">That is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">Wez, 25, which works at Sister Ray, believes also that many customers, whom it meets apply to the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">He noticed however also a new wave at people, which are affected by the Medienhpe, people, which heard over the comeback and itself arranges to see to buy again their old plates.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the discussions, which I led, people got rid of their collection usually in such a way around 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers, who sold once their plates, in order to buy CDs, sell now their CDs, in order to buy again their plates,” say it.</seg>
<seg id="26">That will boom at supporters of the disk revival of a certain age to explain.</seg>
<seg id="27">But which is with the alleged emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only some seconds in a business such as Phonica, in order to recognize that a reassuring community of like-minded ones offers disk business.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to Wez took some the older customers impact at the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some disk fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to withdraw itself to stability from familiar record coverings, from articles, which evoke happy youthful memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">“I think, sometimes can it filling an emptiness or the possession of material properties as a kind comfort be,” say Wez.</seg>
<seg id="32">That is with me as collecting tank like that and I thinks that it is at many people like that.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to be occupied mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">“We are like their social workers!” an employee from a disk pack pipes.</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of the ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of the people, which bought last month a plate did not belong it yet.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found out the fact that 41% possess a record player, which they never use, while 7% those, which buy a plate, does not possess a record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time the news report I to look probably very anxious, while I leaf by a pile at Bossa new facts compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, that with sounds OF the university Universities of (data's number: three men of middle age), “aspect of trophy” of the revival works noticed.</seg>
<seg id="39">“Someone came in only recently here and said: “I do not possess a record player, but I would buy gladly a Radiohead record, so that I can place her in the shelf,” say he.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a large percentage, but it happens definitely.</seg>
<seg id="41">More produktlastig, less musiklastig.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people, which say: “I do not have a record player.”</seg>
<seg id="43">Those are younger people, not older, which come in only slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Tease, which dedicated nearly a whole floor to the records, a more multicolored audience has, than I go in.</seg>
<seg id="45">It gives pairs around the 70, tourists, who make photos, tea-gnaw-young and to women of middle age.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere roars somewhat less relaxed than into that to business managing specified actual game Beasts of more newly synthesizer and sexbepackter Pop in place of experimental jazz from the loudspeakers - it to see is good, such a diversity at the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks particularly lonely, but gnawing psychological traumata can be recognized with difficulty, if one stands beside someone 30 seconds long.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, runs around for some minutes in the business and regards the variety of the plates standing to the sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It makes rather one shop window-strolls as a bulk buying.</seg>
<seg id="50">She does not earn much, therefore collecting plates is not a real option, says it.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is to be heard easily music by a computer or on other way, but the beauty of plates is…” it drives off with a sigh fallen in love.</seg>
<seg id="53">I do not know, as I it to explain am - it is really singular.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business, by which it is said that a new generation of disk lovers is to have inspired: Urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the appearance to examine the jeans hot pant I observe a group of young tea gnawing girls, who group themselves for one moment around Polaroid cameras, before a father and its daughter consider themselves, a Crosley record players to buy.</seg>
<seg id="56">To linking is a stairway, a wall of full plates of ennobles, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classical authors, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody sees itself it to on perhaps, because they are only purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch her.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure “disk art”.</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering its that for the industry it means each attraction for these articles more funds and into the depths Sohos for more fancy would know some customers, it does not give it to anything, in order to weight.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is not a surprise that a subpopulation, which has more time and money than others is also that, which spends at most on luxury articles such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if my investigations showed that results of YouGov are correct, leave it, at least in disk business in Soho, which large number of female collectors and disk lovers, which exist in the reality, disk business and in online forums, unconsidered.</seg>
<seg id="62">These humans work probably hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They do not spend their Thursday tomorrow with security with strolling by disk business of Berwick Street and leafing by plates, while they avoid the staring view uncanny, 30-year old wrong moderator, which rises over the shoulders nothing suspecting men of middle age.</seg>

<seg id="6">They implemented beyond that the provisional business and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in emergency.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the classification of people, which operate the 72 provisional business but granted that the doubts of the prefecture of Calais were absolutely comprehensible “.”</seg>
<seg id="8">The judge Jean-François Molla said that the grocer's shops, cafés and restaurants would play a much larger role, than nourishing only people, “in extremely precarious conditions lives.”</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the ranges offer calm meeting places between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places, which was threatened by pulling down, was the Jungle Book Kids' café of the camp, which is gemeinnnützig operated and 200 meals at the day, English and French classes as well as a consultation to asylum things for the hundreds of persons under age in need of protection and unaccompanied in the camp offers.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressing achievement of Great Britain with the 7-er rugby came in the final on Thursday evening to an abrupt stop with the last hurdle in form of the Fijis, when they were struck here with a result of 43-7 in the Deodoro stage in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji gave a master class in the handling, Side Stepping, advancing, line run and raw strength, in order to win gold - their first olympia medal of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was sweetened by not too the comfort small comfort the silver medal - of Great Britain fourth on this day - and they could be quite proud on their efforts in this tournament, in that them New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa struck.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could drop back to it in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But independently of it Fiji would have struck with this form a 15-Mann-Team in best form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be for GB a comfort - however will it probably non that at least a Britisher tomorrow a gold medal around its neck to hang to have: Fijis coach Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult way behind itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">Before eight years they lost each play under Ryan with Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This setback will hurt, but the progress is amazing.</seg>

<seg id="3">There from the first stroke to last, 220 hard heave, which enter history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in its golden moment at the Estacio to Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even if only the two were, which sat at the rudder, there were three voices in the boat. The echo of the coach Robin Williams, was all-present as it to the second olympia gold in two without tax woman in consequence rowed, the first women in the history of the British sport, which put such a standard.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolutely, nevertheless its 39.ter unbeaten employment, which is likewise unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="6">Which we see are two brilliante athletes, who slide over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the kind of the triumph to entirety.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind each gold in rowing a battalion does not put those for on willing aides, that contribute to the incremental progress, the difference constitutes and it was more helpful anybody than the coach, who did not know 30 months ago whether he would survive this day at all, when with him cancer was diagnosed.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said, he which riskily.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, that am operatable and did her.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do that, he spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been rather bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the view.</seg>
<seg id="13">William one made a diagnosis in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio had luck that it were treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside of which season could begin, which held the interruption a minimum, if under such circumstances at all the correct term is.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, therefore I had to be soon again better.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 foot, 30 foot, 50 foot at a time, when they said that some steps would be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="18">Thus it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing actually is already a challenge, but it makes a still more larger.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the immediacy of the victory went their first thoughts to William, who spent a nerve-racking morning thereby somewhat more than otherwise to talk and thus tried to process its own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Stanning, which was as a captain in the Royal Artillery regiment in use in Afghanistan, said “I was this week an emotional wreck. That is perhaps somewhat extreme, but it means so much.”</seg>
<seg id="22">It repeats only, how much me that means, how much I and Helen and also Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">Were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin we would not be anybody, therefore goes a massif thanks to it. He is a best coach of the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I could myself have wished no better person for training or a better coach.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning lost no running in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The pair had a hard rhythm, with which their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters, as the teams from New Zealand and Denmark, had Stanning and Glover began to unlock too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very for the moment imprisoned.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called “remains in the process, remains in the process”.</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important not to be able to be drug along.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time were we not out to make something great.</seg>
<seg id="33">We wanted today no fireworks, we wanted simply a good result to obtain, go out and a running to win, which we also did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The pair will take itself for one year a time-out, before it will make decisions over its future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover must appear next week on a wedding, their own with the TV-adventurer Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now it wants to enjoy simply the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I did not want to say that my last running was.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have meant too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">In London it took approximately six months, in order to understand that I am an olympia winner.</seg>
<seg id="40">It was everything so again for me and I was in such a way stressed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Here it took approx. four minutes.</seg>
<seg id="42">That feels so much better,” said it.</seg>

<seg id="2">The crisis-shaken and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared by additional costs in million height.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens, which threatened the industry from the green electricity promotion, are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">It remains with the liberation from the renewable energy allocation with the inventory plants for so-called own electricity production in the German steel industry, said Federals Minister for Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) to the “West German general newspaper” (WAZ, Friday edition).</seg>
<seg id="5">“I am really glad over the fact that we could reach after two years of tough negotiations finally.”</seg>
<seg id="6">The European commission had therefore first planned, the steel manufacturers, which use gases from the blast furnace for generation of current for own consumption to ask to the cash.</seg>
<seg id="7">The steel industry threatened according to the German branch federation additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel said the WAZ, it gives now a principle agreement with the European Commission after discussions with competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only if the generators in the steel plants are replaced, result an EEG allocation of 20 percent.</seg>
<seg id="10">In addition, this is not raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">The IG metal welcomed the agreement of Germany with the European Commission for own power generation.</seg>

<seg id="13">Special meaning has the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="14">“Regarding our campaign 'steel is future' is that a first step.”</seg>
<seg id="15">“Further ones must follow.”</seg>
<seg id="16">“Also with the reform of the emission right trade climatic and occupation goals are to weigh”, explained IG Metal boss Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.</seg>
<seg id="17">The steel industry in Europe suffers since the financial crisis 2008 under over-capacities and a substantial price pressure.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year the situation continued to intensify, than the world largest producer country China threw domestic demand in great quantities in view of that slacking off steel on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers accuse price dumping to Chinese steel concerns.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the course of this spring the situation relaxed somewhat.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand imposed import duties point to import steel effect, on the other hand the economic prospects in China became brighter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Is unclear, how lasting the price recovery is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German top of the line Thyssenkrupp remained careful on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">The prices would have again rather stagnated last.</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry reacts to the difficult situation with further reductions of costs.</seg>
<seg id="26">Thyssenkrupp did not want to exclude thereby last also locking of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the German steel industry at the end of 2015 approximately 86000 humans was busy.</seg>
<seg id="28">In July the German steel manufacturers remain careful despite rising prices and increasing orders.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, spirit, health: Sing do seniors well</seg>
<seg id="2">Singing already accompanied Ursel Kipp their whole life: As a young girl it was in the school choir, in the teaching profession study occupied it the subject music, and today the 78-year old in a senior choir sings.</seg>
<seg id="3">“Singing moves me - emotional and physically”, it describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">For a sample it feels balanced, merrily and altogether more alive, says themselves it.</seg>
<seg id="5">Completely besides she does thereby to her health and her spirit of something property.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because singing is directly from several perspectives a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler of the German senior league.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the choir and divide with like-minded ones the joy in the music, describe Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">By regular gathering seniors can social contacts attach and maintain.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because frequently social and family structures at the age dissolve, a choir are then an ideal opportunity, in order to spend time with other humans.</seg>
<seg id="10">This experience made also Ursel Kipp in its choir: To deny themselves “and organize to be able and from each other learn to rely on the others - a choir is a completely special form of gathering”.</seg>
<seg id="11">To sing Hackler can be arduous in the positive sense, means.</seg>
<seg id="12">Because seniors train a deep and controlled respiration.</seg>
<seg id="13">Who demands its lung regularly, does not come also in the everyday life so fast from the breath.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even if it concerns, the sound of the voice at the age too received, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">On older humans singing has often a completely special effect, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Association of Labor of the senior organizations.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations common singing had a much higher value, it belonged to the everyday life, both at school and in the spare time, explains it.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz observes frequently that singing or hearing songs wakes many memories with older humans, often connected with positive feelings of their youth time.</seg>
<seg id="18">By song texts and melodies dementia-gotten sick humans particularly remember themselves for a long time past events.</seg>
<seg id="19">When singing the head besides a special achievement is demanded, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">To concentrate at the same time on the own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt thereby to the other singers - that is a large cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Straight older humans, who live alone, practice in such a way, not to only concentrate on itself.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the acknowledgment, which one experiences by singing in the choir, means Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Also the self-esteem grows by singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To be it shown: If I practice for a long time for something, I become better and exceed over me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">, In order to begin with singing, there are good reasons thus enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Who wants to try a new hobby out, should not hesitate - even if he means to have little talent guesses/advises Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="28">One does not sing alone - with 50 singing humans, who hears there already, if times a tone goes beside it?</seg>
<seg id="29">In the search for the suitable offer have seniors different possibilities, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a senior choir, one can follow simply.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition many cities offer overviews of the choirs in the environment.</seg>
<seg id="32">Who would like to sing in a church choir, can contact directly the community or the church chief.</seg>
<seg id="33">One finds many senior choirs also over the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Who does not have an entrance to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbour can ask for assistance with the Internet search.</seg>
<seg id="35">Who has desire to sing, should themselves absolutely a choir attach, guesses/advises Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Sing does to the soul well and has something release - is valid for each age.</seg>

<seg id="8">It is Erstautorin of the study, which was published on this Friday in the specialist journal “BMC Evolutionary Biology”.</seg>
<seg id="9">In a previous investigation the researcher team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the kitten cries with the urgency of their assistance neediness differ.</seg>
<seg id="10">Altogether nine adults tomcats and eight Kätzinnen from the animal husbandry of the MHH were observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">Them on the one hand calls were played by small ones, which were taken for three minutes from the throw box and separated from mother and brothers and sisters.</seg>
<seg id="12">On the other hand they were confronted with cries by more strongly excited kittens, which were additionally raised.</seg>
<seg id="13">The researchers consider their results despite the small sample meaningful.</seg>
<seg id="14">“All females, even those, which had still no own new generation, reacted differentiated to the cries”, said Konerding.</seg>
<seg id="15">They turned faster to the loudspeaker, if these calls of the very much more excited kittens played.</seg>
<seg id="16">This ability is possibly innate or develops with sexual maturity.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Austrian message in Thailand stands with the woman in contact, said the spokesman of the State Department, Thomas Schnöll, Freitagfrüh.</seg>
<seg id="3">It suffered cuts and was treated in the hospital, this however already again leave could.</seg>
<seg id="4">Their journey home planned it for at the beginning of Septembers.</seg>
<seg id="5">Whether by the further explosions on the holiday-maker island Phuket are affected as well as in the southern cities Surat Thani, catch Nga, Trang and Chumphon likewise Austrian citizens, is for the time being still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="6">The State Department is located in this connection in constant contact with the local authorities, thus to Schnöll.</seg>
<seg id="7">In approximately 200 kilometers south the capital Bangkok the convenient Hua had exploded first on Thursday evening in a going out quarter of two bombs.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to police one Thailänderin were killed and about 20 humans were injured, among them the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutchmen and three Italians.</seg>
<seg id="9">Friday-early then again two explosive devices went highly, according to the authorities further humans were killed.</seg>
<seg id="10">Also of Phuket in the early a bomb explosion was announced.</seg>
<seg id="11">With the explosion in the proximity with holiday-makers bath beach Patong liked after police sources a cab driver were injured.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Surat Thani at the southeast coast of the country exploded then a further bomb, which killed an urban employee.</seg>
<seg id="13">The explosive device went according to the authorities in a flower bed before the district of the coastal police into air.</seg>
<seg id="14">Finally still explosions in catch Nga and Trang at the southwest coast as well as in Chumphon at the southeast coast demanded several injured ones.</seg>
<seg id="15">One proceeds from a connection with the explosions in Hua, it was said.</seg>
<seg id="16">“The bomb assassination attempts carry the same handwriting”, said army general Danai Kritmethavee Friday-early before journalists.</seg>
<seg id="17">“We assume it concerns a coordinated attack.”</seg>
<seg id="18">It is too early, in order to express itself to possible motives - probably concern it however the acts of Muslim rebels.</seg>
<seg id="19">Also Thai media wanted to recognize a sample, which is typical for the bomb assassination attempts of Muslim separatists in the south of the country with the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police however explained, the assassination attempts would not stand in connection with the Islamist rebellion movement or with the international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">“That is limited only local sabotage, to limited areas and provinces”, said themselves a spokesman in Bangkok.</seg>
<seg id="22">One assumes rather the bombs were put by opponents of the dominant military junta.</seg>
<seg id="23">The authorities would have received secretofficial referring to forthcoming attacks in the south of the country in the past days - however they had not been informed about the exact time and the places.</seg>
<seg id="24">Still is unclear, which puts group behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police instructed its officials generally speaking country, security approximately around important government buildings as well as airports, stations, tourist attractions, to strengthen restaurants and nightclub districts.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Thailand there are smaller bomb attacks again and again, but are usually not directed it not against tourists.</seg>
<seg id="27">In Hua lies a palace, which was used over years by of Thailand king Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">After the present bomb explosions the Austrian State Department on its homepage recommends to absolutely carry out for the instructions of the Thai security authorities consequence.</seg>
<seg id="29">High security risk (security level 3) be valid for the provinces Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and environment.</seg>
<seg id="30">After arguments between safety forces and Muslim population parts before not necessary travels into these provinces one advises against.</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased security risk (security level 2) be valid for the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday were made few days after a disputed referendum by a condition prepared by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This grants large influence to the military also in the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">Junta boss and Prime Minister Prayut Chan o cha said, the bombs had been an attempt to donate chaos during itself the country toward stability, an improvement of the economic situation and the tourism move.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Militärunta, which had seized 2014 after a phase of bloody riots power, grants itself the kingdom again to stability and order to have led.</seg>
<seg id="36">However also the military did not succeed in getting for years the rebellion of Muslim rebels smoldering in the extreme south of the country into the grasp.</seg>
<seg id="37">In the conflict already more than 6500 humans were killed.</seg>
<seg id="38">Scarcely one year ago besides in Bangkok with an attack at a popular Hindu shrine 20 humans had been killed - most of them foreign tourists.</seg>

<seg id="1">The right “Identitäre movement” is in its sights the federal office for protection of the constitution guessed/advised.</seg>
<seg id="2">After several offices of a federal state also the Verfassungsschützer in the federation placed the group under observation.</seg>
<seg id="3">“We see reference points for efforts with the 'Identitären movement' against the liberal democratic constitutional structure”, said protection of the constitution boss of Hans-Georg Maaßen of the German press agency in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="4">Thus immigrants of Islamic faith are defamed or from the Near East in extremist way.</seg>
<seg id="5">Therefore we observe the movement now also.</seg>
<seg id="6">The “Identitäre movement” is a grouping with French roots, which is active since 2012 also in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="7">It turns against “Multikulti illusion”, “uncontrolled mass immigration” and the “loss of the own identity by foreign infiltration”.</seg>
<seg id="8">Verfassungsschützer in nine Federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-Wuerttemberg, North-Rhine/Westphalia, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - observe the “Identitären” already.</seg>
<seg id="9">Maaßen said, its authority with the decision with the offices of a federal state had closely come to an agreement.</seg>
<seg id="10">“Groups like the 'Identitäre movement' try to fetch their target audience where it stands, said” the protection of the constitution boss.</seg>
<seg id="11">Extremists generally try to address it with youth-fair language often with trendy music.</seg>
<seg id="12">Islamists would do that just like right-wing extremists.</seg>
<seg id="13">That is not fussy advertisement for the own thing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Propaganda is to address the people emotional.</seg>
<seg id="15">Young people are there in special way susceptible.</seg>
<seg id="16">That is dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="17">It had last given reports from several Federal states over contacts of the “Identitären” to AfD politicians.</seg>
<seg id="18">Maaßen said, in addition he did not have realizations.</seg>
<seg id="19">For the protection of the constitution possible contacts of this kind are only relevant starting from a certain point.</seg>
<seg id="20">It depends on whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - by certain people, who are extremist, change their objective and become so extremist.</seg>
<seg id="21">Decisive it is thus whether such people have steering influence on the party.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is not recognizable.</seg>
<seg id="23">With view of the clear increase of right-motivated criminal offences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee accommodation Maaßen, it said in this context not yet again to right terrorism would speak.</seg>
<seg id="24">But we stated in the past years that there can be rechtsterroristische structures.</seg>
<seg id="25">There was the group 'old School Society' or the Freitaler group.</seg>
<seg id="26">It can quite be that further rechtsterroristische groupings or Kleinstgruppen form, which plan attacks against asylum-seekers, against refugee homes or attacks from other right-extremist motives.</seg>
<seg id="27">A Germany-wide or European-wide control of right terrorism is however not recognizable.</seg>
<seg id="28">The past groups developed on the regional level or in social nets.</seg>
<seg id="29">Procured Maaßen expressed itself over the fact that many encroachments went on the account from humans, who had not stepped before in the right scene into feature.</seg>
<seg id="30">That is the causing concern.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many the suspects with attacks on asylum accommodation are before not as criminal ones, politically motivated offenders or supporters of the right scene do not admit been.</seg>
<seg id="32">“Many people committed thus criminal offences, which did not have nothing at all before with right-wing extremists at the hat, who were perhaps politically indifferent or for example CDU, SPD or link to have selected, which tendency-makes itself then however by right-extremist radicalized”.</seg>

<seg id="8">It was however rather its not straight sporty figure, which drew the attention of the international media on itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why does the 24-year old at the Olympic Games participate nevertheless?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian got a right of kind of separating from the international swimming federation.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed, in order to make a swimming in underrepresented countries more well-known.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since in Äthopien most sportsmen run, Habte wanted to make just something else.</seg>

<seg id="15">Some media called it “Robel the whale”.</seg>
<seg id="16">Following a “prosperity belly” the English tabloid made itself “The Sun” with “Dad Bod” over it hilariously.</seg>
<seg id="17">His time, it fastened only with one minute and nearly five seconds over the 100 meters freestyle, played there no role.</seg>
<seg id="18">Comparisons with “Eric the Eel” were drawn likewise.</seg>
<seg id="19">With the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney the run of Eric Moussambani provided for medial attention.</seg>
<seg id="20">The appearance of the float from Equatorial Guinea was unforgettable, when it had to begin in an advance over 100 meters freestyle alone.</seg>
<seg id="21">Frenetically Moussambani was encouraged at that time.</seg>
<seg id="22">The at that time 22-year old learned to swim only eight months before Olympia and before the match never a so long distance had completed.</seg>

<seg id="2">With the plant in Azendorf the waste water fee will at the latest again increase if appropriate improvement measures become necessary.</seg>

<seg id="6">Starting from 1 October 2016 the citizens as well as the trade and industrial companies from Welschenkahl, new village, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg more deeply into the purse will have to reach.</seg>
<seg id="7">The increases in charges lie between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As administrative leader pointed Herbert Schmidt to the committee out, a new calculation of the fees was necessary for the sewage systems of the market community.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the period of October 2016 until September 2020 also over and/or Unterdeckungen from the preceding calculation period is to be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">Schmidt justified the serious increases in charges with the fact that it acts with all three sewage systems around relatively small facilities with a very small waste water accumulation, which lies between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Thus due to the small distribution basis for example expenditures for necessary repairs would affect themselves several thousand euros seriously.</seg>
<seg id="12">Besides the waste water arising is easily declining in all three plants.</seg>
<seg id="13">Further in the past calculation period with all three plants not least due to their age redevelopment and repair expenditures to a substantial extent resulted.</seg>
<seg id="14">The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the plants for Welschenkahl, new village and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp nearly 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt referred to the fact that in the sewage system Azendorf the mechanical ventilating system had to be exchanged due to a damage.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the pumping plant Welschenkahl had to be overhauled those almost 20 years old conveyor plants by reason on and with the pond purification plant Lopp had after almost 20 years enterprise the first sludge pond excavated, the sewage sludge to be disposed of and an additional ventilation possibility inserted, in order to be able to keep the water-legal defaults also in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: “To these extraordinary expenditures the updated care and maintenance costs came to consider those accordingly in the new calculation period are.”</seg>
<seg id="18">The same is valid for cost of electricity, to which with the previous calculation in the years 2011/2012 still clearly under the current level were.</seg>
<seg id="19">It made stone houses clear that with the small waste water accumulation in the three plants the expenditures for the enterprise and maintenance pierce “fully”.</seg>
<seg id="20">, Supplemental Schmidt remained exempted, the market community from large maintenance costs with the sewage systems in the past 20 years.</seg>

<seg id="11">The enterprise offered an apology: The filter was meant as homage of anime characters and not as caricature from Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsider, the racing SiS mash experienced, reminded the filter of injuring plates.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others leaned the anime comparison decided off.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an email wrote Grace Sparapani, an Korean-American art student, whose Tweet was far spread over the photos that the filter was said unpleasant “injuring and gentle.”</seg>
<seg id="15">It added that “it was difficult with the confrontation of a very disgusting Asian caricature and filter effects to argue.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not gelbgesichtig, but that the yellow face was pulled in the devaluing extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only enterprise, which crosses this cultural trip wire.</seg>
<seg id="18">The American culture seems to be complicated in an endless diversity and integration fight, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices, which we all hold in the hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats large audience of young people - which are various in things race than their older opponents - could assume that rather to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">If one of Snapchats filters produces a picture that it is insulting for a user “like that it is many more difficult that such things remain unnoticed, than it was in former times the case” said 25-year old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday Zhu, which as a product manager and engineer for medium works, decided to delete their Snapchat account requested others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay for medium and in a telephone interview it said that she believed that race-referred controversies reflect a lack of diversity with the attitude practices with Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticized to a large extent white, only male leadership and terminated its essay with a Hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">“Either it does not have a various representation of humans with other skin colors in her staff, so that they can make such decisions,” said the chinesich American Zhu, “or it has humans with other skin colors, to say which work there, but not in positions, in those they are itself or probably-feel, around which against it.”</seg>
<seg id="25">Others divide its opinion, a complaint, the Snapchat left to a large extent unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The enterprise publishes no numbers for the diversity of its staff and refers to its status as private enterprise.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday it rejected Snapchat to discuss the cultural background of its employees but loud a spokesman the enterprise adjusted recently a staff responsible person, who concentrates on underrepresented subpopulations and on internal integration efforts.</seg>
<seg id="28">Zhu said for its part the fact that she will leave her Snapchat account closed and added, “I asked myself, whether they need more user like us, in order to be able to say that is not o.k.”</seg>

<seg id="1">Military guidance falsifies ISIS Geheimdienstinformationen, determines committee of the congress</seg>
<seg id="2">Military personnel of the United States cent ral COMMAND would locally have permitted, announced changed intelligence information to draw over a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic state in Iraq and in Syria than it the actual conditions a committee of inquiry of the congress in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The provisional report, provided by a task Force of the republican members of the Streitkräftekommitees, Geheimdienstkommitees and the Wehrbudgetkommites, reports of large discontent under cent ral COMMAND secret service analysts, which reported, how superiors changed their estimates to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic state.</seg>
<seg id="4">The cent ral the COMMAND, briefly Cencom, is military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which steers the American military operations in the Near East and central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">“Intelligence information, which of high-ranking Centcom commanders were typically nodded through, drew regularly a more positive picture of the American efforts against the terrorism as it the actual conditions would locally have permitted and was constantly more positive than analyses of other intelligence services”, quoted a newspaper article the report.</seg>
<seg id="6">“Which happened, is with the Centcom unacceptable - our soldiers suffer, if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders”, determined Ken Calvert, republican member of the house of representatives.</seg>
<seg id="7">The guidance errors in the Centcom reach up to the highest point of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows details steady problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although it does not supply direct pointing out that tops of the government among Obama's gave instructions to change the reports shows it, like analysts the pressure of their Vorgesetzen suspended saw itself, a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic state, also well-known than ISIS or ISIL to draw.</seg>
<seg id="10">“During the first half-year 2015 many cent ral COMMANDs press releases, statements and statements before the congress were clearly more positively than it the facts correspond” determined the report.</seg>
<seg id="11">For example a Centcom of members announced publicly that a military recapture Mossuls could already begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mossul, second largest city Iraq, remains further under control of the Islamic state.</seg>
<seg id="13">“After months of investigations, so much is clear.” Mike Pompeo, republican congressional representatives from Kansas, in a statement said.</seg>
<seg id="14">From the center of the year 2014 up to the center of the year 2015 the points of the cent ral COMMAND changed the intelligence reports, in order to play the danger down by ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The republicans brought the task Force into being, after them it was passed on that analysts worryd themselves regarding the manipulation from reports to the Islamic state.</seg>
<seg id="16">On Thursday published report will be completed still by more detailed realizations during the investigations to be continued.</seg>
<seg id="17">Further investigations of the Centcom of reports are additional by the general inspector of the Ministry of Defense under way.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Nachrichtendienstekomittees published their own realizations, which agreed with some of the conclusions of the republican task Force on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="19">“In the years 2014 and 2015 the Centcom created an excessively limited process for the production from intelligence estimates to ISIL and the Iraqi security agencies”, announced the höchstrangige democrat in the committee, member in the house of representatives Adam B. Schiff, in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="20">This process, so Mr. Schiff, “delayed the publication of intelligence reports”, damaged the moral under analysts and “excessively gave little area for deviating opinions.”</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the democrats indicated, no referring to an intervention of the white house for the Centcom analysts regarding “determined political opinion” have found.</seg>
<seg id="22">The provisional results of the investigations of the congress were published on Tuesday by “The DAILY Beast”.</seg>
<seg id="23">In past August New York Times von Ermittlungen reported the Pentagon, who were accepted after complaints by Centcom analyst by the general inspector.</seg>
<seg id="24">As per Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a press spokesman the Pentagon, indicated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not commentate reports of the congress, while the investigations of the general inspector were still under way.</seg>
<seg id="25">But it also indicated that “experts have sometimes quite diverging opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversy discussion of these important topics of the national defense.”</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have reactions over the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria outside (a statement, which is made in the meantime by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">The accusations of the past year raised however the question, to what extent president Obama can rely on the cent ral the COMMAND for honest estimates of the military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis zones.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism regarding the secret information about the Islamic state remind of disputes from more than ten years ago, than a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker wrote, a document over it, like the government at that time under George W. Bush against the recommendations of many analysts only a small occupation troop in Iraq planned and little time on it distorted, to make itself over the consequences of the invasion from 2003 thoughts to.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker played also a key role with the rebellion against the present reporting over the Islamic state.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year the team places around Mr. Hooker according to government agencies firmly that against the statements the government air strikes would not have significant effects against the refineries thought of the Islamic state on the financial situation of the terrorist group, since these provisional refineries would have taken in enterprise, in order to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">This realization was not published however, reported the Times in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcoms of commanders at that time, gene. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislation because of its excessively positive estimate of the war situation with a hearing before the senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin went in April into the retirement and became with the cent ral COMMAND by gene. Joseph L. Votel replaces.</seg>

<seg id="1">The USA win fourth match in the Feldhockey of the women, a showdown with Great Britain are approaching</seg>
<seg id="2">One day, after she during 6-1 a victory over Japan had shot three gates, Katie Bam made also the first two gates for the American Feldhockeyteam of the women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans with 3-0 won.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five gates in two plays should actually represent a memorable achievement, but Bam (27) said, them can not remember to have ever done.</seg>
<seg id="4">“I have no idea.” she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I do not belong to the people, which keep their gates in the memory.</seg>
<seg id="6">She knows however: The Americans are about 4-0 in the olympic match and are dead even in their group with the British at the first place, who remain after their 2-0 victory against Japan unbeaten.</seg>
<seg id="7">Great Britain and the United States will meet one another on Saturday in the last play of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both crews qualified themselves for the quarter final, the play will already decide, which of the two will attain first and the second place in each case within their group from six teams.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Erstplatzierte will go to the strong Dutchwomen somewhat longer out of the way, who would start the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">However the play on Saturday to go out likes, the Americans by their success story a surprising eddy released, four years after it with past London Games on the last of 12 places landed.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bam was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">It buildup in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey stick in hands (its two older sisters played the sport at the Drexel university), with 16 years became them national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">It missed the Olympiad in the year 2008, since she could not itself qualify for the cadre.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then the year 2012 came, in which for it and its team everything went wrong.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, became coach of the national team and thus began himself the things to the better to turn.</seg>
<seg id="16">“A cultural change, a mental change and a physical change”, said Bam.</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the work load in London, which we have now.</seg>
<seg id="18">We could to pull around the rudder completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the gate round dance in the first half of the play with a backhand stroke from close range.</seg>
<seg id="20">India had gone without victory in the tournament into the play, but the team appeared surprisingly toughly and held the score from 1-0 into the third quarter, until Bam took the play into its hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">It full-led a sprint with the flat ball across the left flank, pulled then into the center and lifted the ball into the gate around the Americans 2-0 a guidance to provide.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the center of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Shutout was first of the whole tournament for the goal keeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who had in each case to book so far a gate in everyone of the previous plays.</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Exactly the same as Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">“We are in a good position” said Parnham, but will depend as well on the result of the next play on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the midst of rise up the Olympic Games, the Zen of the Trampolins</seg>
<seg id="2">Where always you are also, as late it is also, there is the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel steadily and inevitably, a racing relay race between competition and props.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is, as if the olympic torch would be a burning staff, that is handed of crossbow contactors to the float to the gymnast to the triathlete.</seg>
<seg id="5">They cannot switch the television on, read a newspaper or listen with the discussion of your neighbour in the queue in the Coffeshop, without hearing over Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the controversy between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then it gives still Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, which is for the first time with the Olympic Games thereby and a woman swarm with dimples, could have been quite under this well-known names, which are sent to the Prime time, developed by sponsors and Wohlfühl TV advertisement, if he were a float, a gymnast or even a fencer.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights in the olympic Trampolinturnen for gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The olympic flame does not light up each equal event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Of the center, partly in the shade continue to be the kinds of sport, which are not generally appreciative: Airgun-shoot, sheet shooting, bath min tone, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have and may the breaststroke swimming it for a long time prevail.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I modest-prove arguments for my certain favourite to make were allowed, then you let me steer the attention on the discrete charm of the Trampolins.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the Trampolinspringen is already since 2000 an olympic event, when it had its debut in Sydney, it the last 16 years so meagerly noticed that those, I had asked many, did not know that it is at all an olympia kind of sport.</seg>
<seg id="14">That could be also regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA to the match sent athletes, it won never a medal in the Trampolinspringen and had to 2012 an athlete, which created it up to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians bend to divide the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend this year their gold medal from London.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Trampolinspringen has a certain outsider charm, partly because it for the unexplained ear more suitably for a clown school than for the Olympic Games sounds.</seg>
<seg id="19">Here I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a ground-based enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humoristic potential - kartoonhafte trembling of its to never end wanting impact - in addition, the grace of doing gymnastics and dipping, the two kinds of sport, which it essentially unites.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word “Trampolin” comes from the Spanish El Trampolin, which means so much like “springboard.”</seg>
<seg id="22">Rising winners jump on a gigantic Trampolin, shoot nearly up to 30 foot into air and must a row at falling movements (tricks, pikes and somersaults), before they land on the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">They are evaluated according to official olympia program after execution, degree of difficulty and “flying time”.</seg>
<seg id="24">Zweiundreißig athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will begin against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The in accordance with-loneliest olympic vector is straightforward.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medal-hoping must go in their striving for gold further, faster, upward and over it, sometimes up to the goal, sometimes back and forth, upward and downward on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They hunt not only the target line or the output wall, but in the television transmission also a further scornful goal: those the world or the olympia record.</seg>
<seg id="28">Purposeful striving is noble, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough, in order to agitate even a spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel when watching these plays as something fatiguing.</seg>
<seg id="30">Of it the Trampolin offers a breathing space.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the Trampolinspringers is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">It or it reflects, apparently weightlessly like an astronaut, goes upward, then downward, then easy again upward.</seg>
<seg id="34">A competition, naturally not without difficulty, prevails also here but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no curving to the distance, only the dreamy, elegant abolition of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is like that Zen like the competition with the Olympic Games to only be can.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final rounds of the women will take place on Friday afternoon, in the Streaming around 13.00 Eastern time; those of the men on Saturday, likewise around 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days starting from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the olympia mania they promise a calm, nice moment, one, which will probably ignore generally tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the consciousness increase can be achieved only by gaping and the Objektifizierung of male athletes - how the male US-gymnasts suggested it according to the The Wall Street Journal recently - then its, new fan club struggling for air expects Mr. Dooley.</seg>

<seg id="1">“A generation protests” in Ethiopia, Long an allying of the USA</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators, who demand political changes in Ethiopia, encountered violent resistance of the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses state that tens of protesting was killed during the collisions with the police with shootings.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is to be broken down Ethiopia about?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years it was one of the sturdiest countries of Africa, a solid allying of the west with a fast growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last months protests shook the country against the government and expanded into more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week stormed thousands of people on the roads and required fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The answer the government was merciless according to human rights organizations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses indicated that policemen shot and killed at tens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the circulation videos present over the protests, which are supposed from the latter or at the beginning of this year, show up like security personnel young people with sticks strike, while these were forced to make a handstand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The boss of the un agency for human rights requires now a detailed investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">“It was always difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even still more difficult,” said Rashid Abdi, the project manager the horn of Africa that internationally Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is to Nigeria the most densely populated country of Africa and its stability becomes estimated from the west.</seg>
<seg id="15">American Militär-und of secret services co-operates closely with the Ethiopians, in order to fight dangers of terrorism beyond the region, in particular in Somalia. Only few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much western assistance.</seg>
<seg id="16">Of Ethiopia economy expanded in the considerable speed.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure improved drastically - it gives a new commuter course in the capital to Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are usually calmly, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia everything else were as a model for democracy - human rights organizations stated sequentially the suppression by the government - the opposition in the country became reduced, whereby dissidents were effectively hushed.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent, killed into the exile or into the prison or floated into the widths of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">“If you people suppress and this no other options have except to protest, break it off,” said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints, which take everything off of the use of land up to the stranglehold regarding power of the governing coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After an extensively criticized choice the governing party and control its allied ones the last seat of the opposition received last year and now 100 percent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time the tensions rise along the border to Eritrea; a fight for this jagged, disputed line demanded hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo liberation front or the national liberation front of the Ogaden, which was more or less defeated in the last years, which could turbulences use and again arm themselves.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain, why feelings of the embitterment explode after years before itself of the Hinköchelns under the surface now.</seg>
<seg id="30">First seems harmless: Smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in the last years a great many Ethiopians in the position were to communicate by means of the social media since cheaper smartphones became ever more frequent and improved the Internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government closes the entrance to Facebook and Twitter, which does it in regular intervals, particularly with protests, many people can communicate still over Internet Proxies, which hide, where they are.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians indicated that they met in such a way to protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is the fact that it more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas which, gives two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since Äonen prospered the Amharas, which come from Äthopiens predominantly Christian highlands, in which politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, from which many Muslims are and live in flat country areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">In addition, changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">“We are about to coordinate under a screen” said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia unfair-proves by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray is dominated, those approximately 6 percent of the population to constitute and in the military, in the secret services, in the trade and the policy dominantly are.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the riots is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was 2012 17 years long up to its death at a not publicly made illness in the year of Ethiopia prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">It was viewed as a tactical genius, a man, who could think around corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">To analysts say that it was particularly experienced to notice early signs of discontent and use particular agents, in order opponents to work on and it innocuous make.</seg>
<seg id="45">“It is missing to the present regime at this basic fate,” said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst.</seg>
<seg id="46">Of Ethiopia of new prime ministers, Hailemariam Desalegn, for relatively obscure reasons was selected, in order to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Differently than Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of north Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that it does not enjoy the confidence from the Tigray controlled security agencies.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result more bloodshed will be.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last mark that Ethiopia experienced such a riot was 2005, after thousands protested against elections, which bungled according to information of analysts apparently from the government and were afterwards stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the raids following on it many protesting were killed, even if than in the last months were less and this time of the riots passed relatively fast.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised of Ethiopia leader for their visionary infrastructure planning, like the new commuter course, as well as for its measurable progress with the fight against poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal disfavor of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Protesting in Gondar, a amharischen city, of Tigray led business attacked last month and the hate opposite the Tigray become ever more usual in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests bring the USA and other western allied one into their own position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as basis for Dronenflüge over the neighbouring Somalia, even if it communicated recently that she closed this basis.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the west wants to support clearly the democracy, it does not want that its allying in an already volatile area breaks down.</seg>
<seg id="59">“This,” said Mr. Abdi, “is a very thin tightrope walk.”</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his statement Obama has ISIS to “sarcasm” was created</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to scatter the last controversy, which surrounds its campaign Friday, by indicating that his several times repeated statement, president Obama and Hillary Clinton would be the “founders” of the terrorist group Islamic state, had been not seriously meant.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raised new questions to the able to communicatenesses of the presidential candidate of the republicans whether it was able clearly and understandably with the American public to communicate.</seg>
<seg id="4">Also its fellow combatants bring themselves, endeavor it during an eventful phase in protection to take to have to explain into the peculiar position, statements which he could not at all have meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">After it had made the suggestion during an election campaign event at Wednesday evening, Mr rowed. Trump regarding the statement on Thursday back and insisted in interviews on the fact that it did not intend really to suggest, the president and Mrs. ISIS would have created Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in a earlymorning Tweet on Friday Mr said. Trump, it is simply sarcastically.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Tweet was the contrast to the previous day, at those Mr. Trump in a set of interviews said, he meant the accusation perfectly seriously.</seg>
<seg id="8">As the conservative radio moderator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump to help wanted to weaken the statement somewhat as it of the fact reminded that Mr. Obama ISIS to destroy wants to know, wanted the republican presidential candidate nothing of it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of the criticism sizzles on Mr. Trump down, during he tried the focus of his campaign to steer because of falling poll ratings on the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Speeches held Clinton to the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">Friday Mr tried. To turn Trump again to this topic back.</seg>
<seg id="12">Over Twitter announcing it warned itself that Mrs. Clintons's proposals to higher taxes would lead and that he their speech boring had found.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump already stated sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July drew it strong criticism on itself, when he meant, the Russians should Mrs. Clintons's enamels chop, however he explained later “natural meant I the sarcastic”.</seg>
<seg id="15">This method permits it to Mr. To shift and then as required back row Trump the linguistic borders in the policy.</seg>
<seg id="16">“I think, it am one of its methods to be tested, as certain messages are taken up by its fans, how they arrive, and then “to get straight if necessary” depending upon that, as the reaction fails. ” said Ruth Sherman, a Kommunikationsexpertin, which observes the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, I believe, he am more smartly enough around its statements enough to be held vaguely, so that they can be interpreted in different way.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr has. Trump a still more corroding tone accepted, since its poll ratings continued to decrease.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey of NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a guidance with large lead in the Federal States North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a neck-and-neck race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">During Mr. Generally tried not to have to apologize for its provocative expressions it accuses its critics of Trump frequently to distort its statements or to understand its humor wrongly.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while it is located strengthened in the focus of the attention in the last months of its presidency campaign, Mr have. Trumps's jokes its loyal fellow combatants into the incommodious situation brought, to it stand to have, independently of as provocatively its statements may also be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and of Trumps most prominent advocates, gave himself to defend large trouble the candidate today in an CNN interview from Thursday to.</seg>

<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, “I white, New York is change, but I cannot believe yet that CBGB is dead, Chelsea Hotel now exceptionally and verb a soap business.”</seg>
<seg id="7">But if New York is change, then it is also reinvention.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revived verb cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but has still some the same employees and a similarly simple atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is also still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, an employee of many years of the old café, who owner and managing director of the new café is.</seg>
<seg id="12">He began to work 2001 at verb and remained there up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a customer offered to it to make funds available for a new branch office it was excited to do it said it.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rodriguez, 36, maintained much.</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb uses the same Distributor for the Bagels bought the same espresso machine model.</seg>
<seg id="16">It uses even the same lamps from the old verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said that he wanted to also experiment.</seg>
<seg id="18">It introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the menu Sandwiches with bacon and cheese stand and it give never run gene such as capers and sauted bulbs.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are brown rice dishes.</seg>
<seg id="21">The café serves no more beer, but there are fresh juices.</seg>
<seg id="22">After nine months Rodriguez said that he had noticed a constant river at old regular customers.</seg>
<seg id="23">“Many old customers were displaced likewise by prices from William castle,” said it.</seg>
<seg id="24">On one Sunday Rebecca Oliveira such a customer was recent.</seg>
<seg id="25">Olive IRA, 34, lived in former times in William castle and visited the verb regularly.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after it had pulled after Greenpoint, she would take on the way.</seg>
<seg id="27">After the verb had closed, it gave one while up the coffee, said it.</seg>
<seg id="28">“Me it became clear that it was at the coffee and because of the culture in the verb, which pleased me” said it.</seg>
<seg id="29">Now she drinks again coffee, even if she ordered a Blended Chai Tea, who is a further new additive on this day in place of its usual Iced Coffees.</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Rosenthal is since the beginning the verb in the year 2003 a further customer of many years and faithful.</seg>

<seg id="32">“I came quarters to seven, each day, like Swiss a watch and her prepare my Everything Bagel with butter,” said he.</seg>
<seg id="33">Photo Rodriguez said, it wanted to experiment and to take up new ingredients to the menu.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nowadays Rosenthal gets still its usual order, sometimes but he alternates its Everything Bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.</seg>
<seg id="35">Rodriguez said that he did not preserve resentment over the fact that the soap business took the old business area.</seg>
<seg id="36">The owners of the Soap Cherie actually offered to manufacture a special soap for verb with the kaltgebrühten coffee of the café as ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="37">“I think, we still with its offer will deal,” said Rodriguez.</seg>
<seg id="38">And the traditional, Polish inhabitants Greenpoints likewise accepted the café.</seg>
<seg id="39">A new customer translated the menu into the Polish and said Rodriguez that he intends to issue it soon so that its new neighbours feel welcome.</seg>
<seg id="40">The location has also further advantages.</seg>
<seg id="41">A local juice restaurant would like to fill and sell the kaltgebrühten coffee in bottles.</seg>
<seg id="42">There is an opportunity that the café expands on a neighbouring building.</seg>
<seg id="43">For many customers a new verb is sufficient, in order to get their old favorites.</seg>
<seg id="44">Joseph Witt was regular customer and said that he was destroyed at the ground, when the café closed.</seg>

<seg id="1">The depressing meal of the economic crisis in “a plentiful meal”</seg>
<seg id="2">In March 1933, shortly after his ascent to the president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch in the oval Office.</seg>
<seg id="3">As a gourmet president Roosevelt had a weakness for refined delicacies of Fifth Avenue such as Pâte de foie grass and Maryland water turtle soup.</seg>
<seg id="4">Its menu on this day was somewhat more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and as dessert a plum pudding.</seg>
<seg id="5">“It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people,” said Jane Ziegelman.</seg>
<seg id="6">Her husband Andrew Coe added, “it was also a message to the Americans, like her to eat should.”</seg>
<seg id="7">The married couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and is both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">Coes last book “Chop Suey” acted of the Chinese kitchen in the USA, while “about the life in a house to the Lower East Side from the food perspective tells Ziegelman in its book 97 Orchard”.</seg>
<seg id="9">You newest co-operation, “a decent meal”, which will appear on Tuesday in Harper Verlag, illustrate the history of the American kitchen during great depression.</seg>
<seg id="10">They showed culinary solidarity, when them sand-yielded themselves with a reporter in the Eisenberg's shop with dinner meet, a small, straightforward lunch in the Flatiron District, which is already since the stock market crash 1929 in the business.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ziegelman, 54, cream cheese-sand-yielded with olive bits, during Coe, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ordered 57 ASS.</seg>
<seg id="12">When the reporter ordered chopping roasts, this found the pair suitable for a discussion over the meal in the era of great depression.</seg>
<seg id="13">“Rich food was much likes”, said Ziegelman.</seg>
<seg id="14">There was peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap one, which stretches the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Introduce yourselves to eat so many peanuts that they serve them as dinners.</seg>
<seg id="17">Coe grinned.</seg>
<seg id="18">“It must have put in the stomach such as lead,” said it.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the years before great depression the table in an American household, particularly in rural areas, was a universe You CAN Eat Buffet.</seg>
<seg id="20">Crews of women cooked for male agricultural labourers and it freshly baked pie for breakfast, for the lunch and dinners were served.</seg>
<seg id="21">Were the Americans, who sent Europeans on during the First World War food being hungry. “A Square Meal” notes the ways, with which the country dealt with it, no more the paradise to be.</seg>
<seg id="22">“It was a time, in which meal for the Americans became a central, strained topic”, begündete Coe, why it and its wife over it to write wanted.</seg>
<seg id="23">The new budget diet was just as strained: Mysterious meals such as bread and casseroles became staple food, the casserole as “wonderful kind of recycling leftovers” marked Ziegelman, since cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a kremigen sauce.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper drying fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meat, which was for many years the center of the American kitchen, became a rarely served luxury.</seg>
<seg id="26">Strange mixtures were tried out, since a calorie-rich and feedful satisfaction had priority before taste or even healthy understanding of kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="27">During its search for the book, which covers also recipes, a court prepared Ziegelman baked bulbs with peanut butter from this epoch.</seg>
<seg id="28">“It was not a popular additive at the Mittagstsich,” says Coe.</seg>
<seg id="29">Brick man continues to implement: “It was surreally.”</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked bulbs do not fit to each other.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the housekeeping recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">Like never before or since then, household businesspeople - under it Louise Stanley, Leiterin federal office of the OF Home Economics between 1923 to 1943 - propelled the eating habits of the country so.</seg>
<seg id="33">By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged to become women “budgetary policy gutters” to become fair and the challenge to transform Pampe like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.</seg>
<seg id="34">“A Square Meal” is a celebration of the historical delicacies.</seg>
<seg id="35">In particular tastily the reports are being hungry over the answer of the government to those citizens, like president Herbert Hoovers letting me cake meal leaving.</seg>
<seg id="36">While it praised publicly simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of its kitchen, he fed like the worth millions man of world, whom he became.</seg>
<seg id="37">“He liked continental kitchen such as fish with cucumber sauce,” said Coe.</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in a nearly gilded dining-room and wore a tuxedo.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was wonderful out of touch with reality.</seg>
<seg id="40">Perhaps president Roosevelt would have committed the same error, if not his Mrs. Eleanor had requested him to set with his stomach an example.</seg>
<seg id="41">As in the book descriptive hiring a lady housekeeper with no interest in flavors led by Mrs. Roosevelt to it that the white house brought the most boring meal out in Washington, but also one at the most hopeless prepared one.”</seg>
<seg id="42">Many of the kinds from the era of great depression of dealing with meal it was rejected, as soon as the country came the legs.</seg>
<seg id="43">The legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as whereupon, how science was applied to food.</seg>
<seg id="44">The pair gave to have better understood on during the writing of the book the eating habits about Ziegelmans mother-in-law - for example like it food not to throw away could.</seg>
<seg id="45">“A genuine fear of the wasting of food had you,” said Coe.</seg>
<seg id="46">Ziegelman remembered: “You made people actually suffer.”</seg>
<seg id="47">There there was the cream puff incident.</seg>
<seg id="48">After the plates were cleared with Eisenberg's, they and Coe pulled out a dessert, which they had at home prepared: the plum dessert, the president Roosevelt to noon ASS.</seg>
<seg id="49">“It is called Prune Whip,” said Ziegelman and added that it was a usual trick to give to modest recipes a fancy name.</seg>
<seg id="50">There was no struck cream, only plums, something flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.</seg>
<seg id="51">Everyone immersed somewhat unwillingly a spoon into the tough, brown Glibber.</seg>
<seg id="52">It did not taste surprisingly badly.</seg>
<seg id="53">Coe got itself three times a consulting.</seg>
<seg id="54">Like a CAN DO Budgetierer he said a few chopped walnuts to his wife, “would help.”</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland shark: The oldest vertebrate animal is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland sharks come usually only in the winter to the surface.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed after an investigation on board the research ship Sanna in the sea back.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was born 1624 and swims with well 1 km/h by the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland sharks get only with 150 years new generation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely the Greenland shark swims at the reason of the North Atlantic along, in one hour comes it on the average straight 1,220 meters far.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only if it depends on it, accelerated that five meters long animal on full 2.6 km/h - and is half as fast with this maximum speed as a seal.</seg>
<seg id="9">This lifestyle coined by tardiness seems to be however a ready-made solution for a great age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen of the university of Copenhagen and its colleagues anyhow report in the technical periodical “Science” of a Greenland shark, which could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">“Insanity”, commentates Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life-span, which means a world record for vertebrate animals.</seg>
<seg id="12">The evolution biologist assumed for a long time that Greenland sharks become aged.</seg>
<seg id="13">The proofs were only missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland sharks are difficult to observe, finally live them particularly in the polar sea before the thinly settled coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they emerge at the surface usually only in the winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">About the lifestyle of the Greenland sharks researchers know according to few.</seg>
<seg id="17">They measured their slow-motion, when they equipped six animals before Spitzbergen with a transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="18">These sharks make booty nevertheless: In the stomach of an animal researcher found the remnants of a seal, another the jaw bone of a young polar bear had swallowed.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they hunt sleeping animals or patrol at the reason of the polar sea and look for carcasses, which stagger downward from higher water layers.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and its colleagues examined now 28 Greenland sharks, which got Fischer between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spitzbergen as by-catch from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was straight 81 centimeters long, while measured largest 502 centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens core of the sharks with the Kohlenstoff-14-Methode.</seg>
<seg id="23">This center of the eyepiece develops already before the birth of the sharks, which become therein contained proteins later no more renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had remarkably much Kohlenstoff-14 in the lens core.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should lie from there after the early 1960er years, when nuclear tests hurled larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the animal third-smallest with 220 centimeters length contained the lens core against it a small surplus of Kohlenstoff-14 from the nuclear tests, it might when its investigation in the year 2012 thus its 50. Birthday celebrated.</seg>
<seg id="27">All larger Greenland sharks had normal Kohlenstoff-14-Mengen, which results from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere in their lens core against it.</seg>
<seg id="28">The Kohlenstoff-14-Uhr for a 493 centimeter actually showed long Greenland shark an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimeters might be even 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">The fact that Greenland shark females get only then new generation if they are longer than four meters, was well-known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers could assign an age to the length.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold to sexual maturity and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland sharks with increase leave themselves obviously at least one and a half centuries time.</seg>
<seg id="32">Also that might be for vertebrate animals world record at present.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such Methuselahs live particularly in icy waters, is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the past record holder, a 211 years old bowhead whale, into whose bacon at the neck 120 years an old harpoon point was, became imprisoned before Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">By the low temperatures frequently also the organism of the there living animals runs on low flame.</seg>
<seg id="36">They mature thus later - and age more slowly.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep itself warm in the cold water, the animals become besides often particularly largely.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows many faster than its surface, by which the animal loses warmth.</seg>
<seg id="39">The calorific loss of a gram of mouse is much larger from there than with a gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">A further advantage: They have less enemy.</seg>
<seg id="41">“A smaller animal lives thus more dangerously and should concentrate as early as possible as many as possible descendant to have”, explains the evolution biologist Scheuerlein.</seg>
<seg id="42">A very large animal should invest against it its resources rather into a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">The city at the Main has therefore in the competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg the best opportunities to attract from London shifted jobs and companies.</seg>
<seg id="3">“It is very probable that Frankfurt at most says profited from the Brexit vote”, Michael Voigtländer, Leiter of the competence field of financial markets and property markets of the IW.</seg>
<seg id="4">After the Brexit referendum it is uncertain whether financial institutions of far from London financial transactions in the entire European Union may operate.</seg>
<seg id="5">For the so-called European Union-passport so far the permission in Great Britain is enough to them.</seg>
<seg id="6">Straight large US-banks use.</seg>
<seg id="7">Several banks already announced to shift jobs.</seg>
<seg id="8">The lobby combination “Frankfurt Main Finance” counts on 10000 new jobs at the Main within five years.</seg>
<seg id="9">For Frankfurt, as the IW, speaks the seat of the European central bank (EZB), which responsibility for the monetary policy and supervision about the largest banks the euro zone unites, as well as further important authorities as European insurance control EIOPA and the risk advice ESRB.</seg>
<seg id="10">In Paris the organization for economic cooperation and development (OECD) has its head office, but this is less important for the financial sector than the EZB.</seg>
<seg id="11">“The proximity to the issuing bank is importantly for banks, there it so directly with the supervision to communicate can”, says IW-professor Voigtländer.</seg>
<seg id="12">Luxembourg beheimate a large fund sector, fares however just like Dublin with the infrastructure more badly.</seg>
<seg id="13">Frankfurt is clearly easier owing to the large airport to reach.</seg>
<seg id="14">Furthermore the city scores also easily available trade real estate.</seg>
<seg id="15">“In Paris it is not at all simple so to find free high-quality offices”, says Voigtländer.</seg>
<seg id="16">On the Seine are besides the rents for first-class trade real estate around 50 percent more highly than at the Main.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition offer to Frankfurt a higher quality of life than the competition owing to good medical supply and infrastructure as well as less crime.</seg>
<seg id="18">In a ranking of the management consultation MER cerium stand the city on place seven, Luxembourg on place 19, Dublin on place 33 and Paris at 37. Place.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if quality of life is a question of the preferences: “With its already strong position as financial location for the European domestic market Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors”, concludes the IW.</seg>
<seg id="20">London will remain however despite Brexit vote most important financial center in Europe, means the economic researchers.</seg>
<seg id="21">But also the balances of power speak: In London Helaba at the end of 2015 approximately 144000 humans in the bank industry, in Frankfurt worked were it 62500 in accordance with numbers of the Landesbank.</seg>

<seg id="3">Claude Lanzmann, Autor of the Holocaust documentation “Shoah” omitted his annoyance in the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.</seg>
<seg id="4">During its last stay Lanzmann Israel on the land preselection list of the hotel tried to find.</seg>
<seg id="5">The country was not listed however between the countries, which can be called directly from the hotel room.</seg>

<seg id="7">Lanzmann wrote.</seg>
<seg id="8">Instead the Kempinksi Bristol offers a possibility of selecting Israel over its own call center.</seg>
<seg id="9">Looking for an explanation the director turned to the hotel reception.</seg>
<seg id="10">The answer, which it received there, “shocked it”, as Lanzmann wrote.</seg>
<seg id="11">The hotel employee said that the measure was a “intentional decision of the management of the Kempinski hotels.”</seg>
<seg id="12">The reason, which stood behind it, released more rage in the director still.</seg>
<seg id="13">“The majority of our guests Arabs and they have required that the preselection is deleted,” the employee by Lanzmann were quoted.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Israeli Ambassadors in Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a “large dishonor”, reports the newspaper Süddeutsche.</seg>
<seg id="15">We were frightened and dismayed of this event.</seg>
<seg id="16">That is really very embarrassingly.</seg>
<seg id="17">The fact that this happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain, is even a still larger dishonor.</seg>
<seg id="18">That does not require an explanation.</seg>
<seg id="19">We expect that the hotel draws “the correct conclusions,” said the office-holder.</seg>
<seg id="20">The incident released a rather large resonance on the Internet, with which the people called the whole a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="21">Some subordinated hotel to the Kempinski that it would have given way to the alleged requests of Arab guests “”.</seg>
<seg id="22">“You,” meant it is ashamed in another contribution, in which it was pointed out that the hotel, which is at noble Kurfürstendamm stands in the proximity of a synagogue.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hotel pointed fast all accusations from itself and called the incident a “mistake” and “apologized” with Lanzmann, reports Der Spiegel.</seg>
<seg id="24">“There was never a direct instruction” not to take up Israel to the speed calling list” quoted the newspaper Süddeutsche a spokesman of the Kempinski hotels.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland Callum Skinner rests last evening in the man team sprint in the velodrome in Rio to the fame, when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year old from Glasgow took the anchor role, which its compatriot sir Chris Hoy had made itself own. The Jungspund made the legend proud, when it stormed home, in order to rake a victory of the favorites New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory before four years, while Hoy got the fifth of six olympia gold medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick, after they got a modest sixth place in March with the course world championships in London despite the resignation Hoys only.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Peking and London was the replacement of the Anfahrers Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as Hindes emerged.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retirement produced a gap, Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man, with whom they remained, when they saw potential in the Scot, which now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - which triumphed before four years with Hoy - and Skinner set an olympia record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders in the first round triumphed.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel also gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hindes was past after its round scarcely, but Kenny brought forward the team and to Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy constituted a large part of the transformation, with which Hindes drove in a higher course to hold in order to slow it down and to make it possible Kenny and above all Skinner, the speed.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy watched of its position as an BBC expert out and was noticeable to Skinner, Kenny and Hindes, when these rose to the landing.</seg>
<seg id="15">The 23-year old Skinner from Glasgow said: “It is a flattering comparison.”</seg>
<seg id="16">I am only here, in order to do and for me a name make my best.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up an olympia record in the final round and defeated the world champions.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was simply unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better kind this to win.</seg>
<seg id="20">After Triumph 2012 at the page Kennys and Hoys admitted Hindes that he fell after a weak start intentionally on the course.</seg>
<seg id="21">He did not withdraw this statement later and it came an objection of England rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">With so an outstanding victory there was this time none such problem.</seg>
<seg id="23">Hindes said: “It feels with the whole GB of flags on the grandstand such as London.”</seg>
<seg id="24">We met in the last three months as a team.</seg>
<seg id="25">We got away with so many world titles so badly that it was unbelievable to win again with the Olympiad.</seg>
<seg id="26">That is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which seven were won by 10 titles both in Peking and in London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If that is a barometer of our progress in the last five months that expect us successful five days in the velodrome.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form Kennys is it in the range of the possible one that he repeats Hoys victory of three olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That became for Kenny - which is 12 years younger exactly than Hoy, likewise to 23. March was born (an apparently holy date for the British sport; on the day also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal to mean.</seg>
<seg id="30">That would equal from Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny participates next in the sprint, which begins today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">The 28-year old from Bolton said: “I enjoy this only for the moment.”</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always best.</seg>
<seg id="34">One can win it with its colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels somewhat lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">Hindes said: “If it two further gold medals wins, should be struck it to the knight.”</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there was further good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, OD Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified themselves with the fastest achievement in the quadripartite four-kilometer running.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at 3:51,942 at the goal.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, which won 2012 in London gold, was with 3:51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) take place today on the second day of the Wettbewers, with which Wiggins with security will stand in the focus.</seg>
<seg id="42">It had argued yesterday with assigned one before the qualification, when functionaries called it to itself, in order to measure its body size.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the appropriate woman competition, which is continued tomorrow and terminated, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald OF Milngavie in world record time was promoted in 4:13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team relies on its strong course wheel team, in order to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a crowd at medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a indeed unusual representation of absolute dominance in Peking and London expectations for Rio were driven down.</seg>
<seg id="46">Drama in the background, as the resignation of the technical manager Shane Sutton in April in the midst of from sexism and bullying reproaches as well as the retirement took place from sizes as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">If one views oneself however the first evening of the competition in the velodrome, it looks whole like it, as if the legendary call GBs, which reached its high point to the perfect moment, could be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of the aluminum melt of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - stand on the play, since the plant operator the energy supply contract will waive to quit and thus all supply contracts, as the supplying energy company communicated.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria Anfang of this year to assign no further subsidies for the enterprise of the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">For 20 years a specified subsidy runs out in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Alcoa in Portland stand on the play.</seg>
<seg id="6">Less than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could not be endangered with a locking.</seg>
<seg id="7">Beyond that it could come to domino effects, since the Schmelzerei uses approximately 10 percent of the entire generation of current of Victoria.</seg>
<seg id="8">2014 closed Alcoa the POINT Henry Schmelzerei, which led last year to a locking of the Anglesea of power station.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Schmelzerei of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a locking.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the speculations for many years regarding the future of the plant, originally as consequence of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity tariff for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the large Aluminiumschmelzerei with its Loy Yang A power station in Latrobe Valley, communicated that it assumes three further owners will quit their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The plant is in the majority possession a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, about which the Chinese enterprise CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller portions.</seg>
<seg id="13">“AGL assumes the plant in Portland is further operated, which means a further physical demand for river by the Schmelzerei” communicated the enterprise.</seg>
<seg id="14">AGL stated further that the contracts were so-called “safeguard business”, which should have stepped starting from November 2016 into force.</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12-month term of notice, so that they will end to 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">“Of from there it AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute in the financial year 17 to the incomes,” said the current supplier.</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential effects on the incomes on AGL starting from the GJ 18 are at present limited by the prognoses of the strong option markets for wholesale electricity tariffs.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL communicated that it had already copied the value of the contracts in its Jahresabschlus at a value of $ 187 million in “expectation of a notice”.</seg>
<seg id="19">Alcoa said that the decision to write the contracts off which does not impair " ability Alcoas… the Schmelzerei to operate or the current supply to the Schmelzerei not ensure”.</seg>
<seg id="20">The US enterprise said that it had locked 2010 a 20-annual contract with Loy Yang, which from November this year on to go in effect should, even if it still another explanation is guilty, why it from the contract withdrew.</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn Schmelzerei in Victoria and the Tomago plant due to bad economical conditions of the industry before the possible locking the Portland in close proximity to Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">In reference to the statements of the analysts Anfang of the week the Head OF said operation Stephen Mikkelsen that Portland and Tomago approximately 900 megawatts at river use annually approximately 600 megawatts.</seg>
<seg id="23">If both plants of the market should disappear, a substantial decrease of the demand would mean on [electricity market].</seg>
<seg id="24">And for us as generators that would not be good,” said it.</seg>

<seg id="2">Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian Jenner of clan Kris are on the cover of the September edition in demand of US Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kendall, which is brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and on the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York ran, announced the news on its Instagram account on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">“In an area of full people, which I love, the sight of this cover brought me to crying,” wrote Kendall.</seg>
<seg id="5">The exposure of cover a bizarre (or simply Keeping UP with the Kardashians something similar?) followed, scripted Reality video, which shows the entire Kardashian Jenner family (with exception of the cases of problem Rob and Caitlyn as well as in presence of the all-side popular Showbiz uncle and producer of Keeping UP Ryan Seacrest), as they forget covers of their sister and with a classical idiom ends: they planned all a surprise party.</seg>
<seg id="6">That represents the plate-afflicted action to almost any birthday episode of a child transmission (Seacrest brought the sentence, “you thought that we would have forgotten you? ,” with the honesty of an indication trick rabbit on a time slot at 8 o'clock), but their other girls had to somehow let Kris in the morning participate in this publicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">With view to the September edition Vogue began a new era of the Kardashians with security.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendalls large sister Kim likes it, what concerns Vogue covers, struck (they and her man Kanye West were on it in April 2014 to see), but covers of the September edition of the magazine is a league for itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September edition is for Vogue to usually most sold edition of the year.</seg>
<seg id="10">With an extent, which resembles rather a book of pictures as a fashion magazine, the edition draws a large number on on advertisers (sound Fashionista were from the 832 pages of the tome 615 pages advertisement).</seg>
<seg id="11">The exposure of its cover star is so longingly expected that in the last two years pictures of the magazine oozed still before the official publication.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women, who already were on cover, cover Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the last years clearly more was “famousnesses, those models” than “model, the famousnesses is” on cover.</seg>
<seg id="14">OSCAR winner and Dior Markenbotschafterin Jennifer Lawrence was 2013 on cover, one year after lady Gaga the honour had.</seg>
<seg id="15">But even with the slim chance that Mrs. Jenner - of the magazine as the “break-through model” of her generation is described - falls under the earlier category, it is it in good society.</seg>
<seg id="16">This famousnesses is not related to famous people or Reality of star or young people today, that knows, like one a good Snapchat video turns (even if of it everything applies to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women, who are characterised in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, which appeared on last cover, had one of the most successful years of its career with the publication of Lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="19">Naturally Jenners success does not please everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With its Reality TV history Jenners position was always somewhat strained in the fashion world.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June the former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized and called it “the muck malice of the instant.”</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings cooked, when the message with the appearance Jenners on Vogue cover came out.</seg>
<seg id="23">But seems to pass on the moroseness to harp on the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is in the true sense of the word a supermodel.</seg>
<seg id="26">It runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">It makes advertisement for your priming of Estee Lauder.</seg>

<seg id="17">Then were a small keyboard and a monochrome screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The price was rather proud: 2700 D-mark, thus about 1400 euros.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price of smartphones in Germany was 2015 with 392 euros.</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody could suspect 1996 in August that the Communicator would become the beginning of the smartphones era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since then is everything different.</seg>
<seg id="22">The intelligent telephones are a success story, if also not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The mobile phone section of the Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster, at Microsoft was finally sold and completed.</seg>

<seg id="5">Scientists pointed before to the fact that the slow revolution of the Venus could be explained by their close atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But newest simulation points to the fact that a thin, earthsimilar atmosphere could have had the Venus and nevertheless slowly kept turning themselves.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model lit up also the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet exhibited probably more dry areas than de Erde, but had once enough water and geographical variability to accommodate over lives and before fast evaporation protected.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus profited also from a sun, which was more matte 30 percent.</seg>
<seg id="10">“In the GISS model simulation the slow revolution of the Venus exposes their daily side of the sun nearly two months long,” explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms up the surface and produces rains, which creates a thick layer clouds, which like an umbrella works, in order to shield the surface from a majority of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result are average temperatures, which are cool some degrees as those the earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought a history out of the Venus, which the evolution resembles, which was assumed before by planet researchers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was probably habitable once, were the Venus -- in the run more mehrer billions years --too much heat and ultraviolet light suspended.</seg>
<seg id="15">Its oceans evaporated and its water vapour by the ultraviolet light one burned away.</seg>

<seg id="9">Since this hoist by the magnetic fields of the stars travel, they have a braking effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">If a star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow down.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler does without the rotation rate of each star, by he the time between the appearance of a recognizable star mark -- like sunspots -- recognizes.</seg>
<seg id="12">The newest catalog of rotation rates points out that more solid stars turn more slowly than less solid stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rebull compares the stars with dancers, whereby larger stars of slow pirouettes turn as smaller.</seg>
<seg id="14">“In “clench” the pleiads see we that slow rotors tend to be more substantial whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright of stars” said to Rebull.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the heap of star of the pleiads is so close, it serves as ideal cosmic laboratory, in order to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates.</seg>
<seg id="16">“The heap of star of the pleiads offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older,” said Rebull.</seg>
<seg id="17">It lies still much before us about what we gladly to learn more wants, how how, when and why stars slow their rotation rates down and hang their “dancing pumps up” as it were.</seg>
<seg id="18">Rebull and their colleagues reported in detail in three newspaper reports on its newest analysis of the rotation rates of the pleiads, which will appear soon in the Astronomical journal.</seg>

<seg id="2">Gotten: Because of positive doping sample weight lifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland may not start in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - which become Olympic Games 2016 overshadowed by first official cases of doping.</seg>
<seg id="4">A gotten athlete would have won nearly a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the seventh match day first official cases of doping are the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro admit become.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-Meter-Hindernisläuferin Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Polish weight lifter Adrian Zielinski were tested positively and excluded in Brazil - directly before the beginning of the anyway critically eyed track-and-field events competitions these news comes to the wrong time.</seg>
<seg id="7">With Chen on past Sunday the diuretic Hydrochlorothiazide had been already proven, which is used as masking means for doping UBS dancing.</seg>
<seg id="8">The international sport Court of Justice CAS confirmed its exclusion of the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon local time.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday the 18-year old fourth place in the final over 100 m butterfly had occupied, only by 0.09 seconds missed it thereby the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday Chen should have participated in the advances over 50 m freestyle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Chen requested the opening of the B-sample and a hearing at the international olympic committee (IOC).</seg>
<seg id="12">The national federation takes the affair “very seriously and requires of Chen full co-operation with the investigations”, to quoted Xinhua from a report: “We will co-operate with the international sport Court of Justice CAS and will become the judgement to accept”.</seg>
<seg id="13">For the first time in history no more is responsible the IOC, but CAS for sanctioning the sportsmen with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Likewise in the night of Rio the message oozed over the positive sample with Danekowa, the 33-year old went thereby even into the offensive.</seg>
<seg id="15">“I had three tests, all negatively, and my fourth test was”, this was positively “an unbelievable shock”, said it to the Bulgarian TV-transmitter BNT.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is innocent, “the only explanation could food supplements be”, explained the athlete.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the report it is to concern with the forbidden substance the blood doping agent EPO.</seg>
<seg id="18">Danekowa was provisionally suspended, according to BNT is to have already positively failed also the B-sample.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of Bulgaria Prime Minister Bojko Borissow announced itself immediately with criticism at the athlete to word.</seg>
<seg id="20">“I do not understand, why the sportsmen draw, said not the correct conclusions” he: “We Bulgarian stand under observation, so many were already excluded”.</seg>
<seg id="21">So about all weight lifters from the chronically doping-loaded nation may not participate in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">On Friday also the case became “Adrian Zielinski” admits, who became London olympia winner in the class up to 85 kg like its brother Tomasz three days before positively on the anabolic steroid Nandrolon tested.</seg>
<seg id="23">Both deny the income, both may however not in the class up to 94 kg start.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before the start of the light athletes the case Danekowa is particularly a further heavy impact for the reputation of the entire kind of sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The world union IAAF had forbidden with one exception because of systematic doping the start, also the runner nation Kenya to the complete Russian crew produced in Rio numerous bad news.</seg>
<seg id="26">In swimming besides earlier offences in China had ensured for violent arguments also between the athletes.</seg>
<seg id="27">Thus the Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese olympia winner Sun Yang harshly.</seg>
<seg id="28">“Sun Yang pees purple.”</seg>
<seg id="29">“If I the podium over 200 m freestyle see, want to hand over I”, said myself Lacourt in the French radio.</seg>
<seg id="30">Sun was located besides in the center of an argument with the Australian Mack Horton.</seg>
<seg id="31">“I do not have time and no respect for doping cheats”, said to this.</seg>
<seg id="32">Sun had been positively tested 2014 with the Chinese championships on the stimulant Trimetazidin, had to serve however only a three-month barrier.</seg>

<seg id="1">Datenklau: So perfidiously hackers extort their ransom money</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers von Erpressungs-Malware seize up-to-date aimed enterprises on and are successful thereby.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a current survey of the malware defense specialists malware bytes under 540 enterprises in North America, Great Britain and Germany 40 percent of the asked companies became at least once, partly repeated in the past twelve months victims of an attack with blackmailer software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany scarcely 20 percent of the companies was already once a goal of an Ransomware extortion.</seg>
<seg id="5">Readily the ransom money demanded by the perpetrators paid 40 percent of the victims, in order to be able to use the attacked systems and data again.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their blackmailer software appreciably according to the observations of malware bytes in attacks into firm networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are there successful, that fails potential ransom money which can be extorted clearly more highly than with private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">“We observe up-to-date a terrifying fast evolution of the malware”, explain malware byte boss of Marcin Kleczynski in the discussion with the “world”.</seg>
<seg id="9">2008 was appropriate most malware programs still to send advertisement away.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered extortion software for itself.</seg>
<seg id="11">First private users were the goal, but the change to firm attacks took place in the past months alarmingly fast.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works after a simple sample: Once on the computer of a victim actively, it looks for purposefully after recently changed files as for instance Word, Excel or database files as well as after archives of pictures and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files code the Ransomware and delete the originals effectively.</seg>
<seg id="14">Subsequently, the software presents the demands of the blackmailers.</seg>
<seg id="15">In order the final key code to the files too gotten, the victims money - usually in form of the Cryptowährung Bitcoin - must transfer.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where with private users the personal photo database stands on the play, it concerns at companies sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production stands still.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly more highly the damage fails, if a Ransomware slams shut.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the German companies concerned turnover losses announced by Ransomware, to 13 percent had even the business activity completely to interrupt, to a case were humans in mortal danger.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany hospitals victims of attacks, whose patient can be threatened by the loss of patient documents acutely, were already repeated.</seg>
<seg id="20">“We always say to the victims: Does not pay, if you promotes thereby only the problem”, Kleczynski explains.</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of the companies, which pay, gets their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject in view of stop in the enterprise the demand of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know that and try everything, in order to develop a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a current study the safety researchers of F-Secure examined the user surfaces and the contact with the blackmailers and to come to the result: The perpetrators actually try to develop a kind customer service in order to take more funds.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain to their victims by chat, how they can pay by Bitcoin, furnish freely accessible support websites or decode in vain example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And private individuals are released after payments by few hundred euros, must negotiate enterprises partly hard and pay sums of five figures, in order to get back their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potential high and profits relatively without risk from the Ransomware extortion the hackers ever more professionally and to divide the work, explains itself security expert Chester Wisniewski of the anti-virus provider Sophos: “Individual person can write a Ransomware about within one week.”</seg>
<seg id="28">More probable is it however that it concerns three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their malware then in form of a software component system to the actual blackmailers.</seg>
<seg id="30">The past malware kits developed, as the malware, consultation and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollar were bought.</seg>
<seg id="31">“Adjustment tools are contained in the scope of supply, so that smaller configurations, appearance and development of brands can be changed”, say Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmailers look for each other then further hackers, in order to spread the freshly bought software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service economy.</seg>
<seg id="34">One logs oneself thus into one of the forums in the underground, buys the set of a criminal one and assigns a further to install the software on as much as possible PCs.</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment takes place per infected computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">“Usually the criminal ones assign then spammer the spreading”, explain Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is meanwhile well-known with many enterprises, which secure their data better.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent trust the company IT responsible person in the malware byte survey to be able to repel Ransomware by means of file baking UPS and Scannersoftware.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly the perpetrators pursue already new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">“If the encoding of data alone no sufficient threat for successful Erpessung more is, threatens the perpetrators instead with the publication of sensitive data as for instance, malware byte boss of Marcin Kleczynski explains customer master lists or price estimations”.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thus the damage potential is higher depending upon kind of the data still around a multiple than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">Also the perpetrators could take in the future completely new goals on the Internet the things on the grain.</seg>
<seg id="43">To the conference of hacker Defcon demonstrated safety researchers, how they could get a connected thermostat with the Internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle in the winter de-energizing of an in such a manner blocked heating so some victim could quite be worth a ransom money.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators block a whole production line in a factory then instead of the heating in the future, Ransomware could become also in the industry 4,0 a topic.</seg>

<seg id="3">Into the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: little SUV, little coupé and also still the versatility of a minivan.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, which was designed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves in the everyday life as expressed flexible.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although only the 1.60 m work high HR-V rather small, the passengers have both in the front row and in the fund much place, works nowhere closely.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the interior are well finished and work pleasantly, only the cockpit top side drop there somewhat.</seg>
<seg id="7">More versatile than comparable vehicles the HR-V is with the reservoir.</seg>

<seg id="10">The trunk can be loaded well, however loading height with 650 mm is somewhat higher than with comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1,6-l-Diesel with 88 kW/120 HP accelerates the HR-V owing to the torque of up to 300 Nm in far speed ranges very strong.</seg>
<seg id="12">He might perform its work however somewhat more quietly.</seg>
<seg id="13">The everyday life consumption of 4,7 l/100 km is pleasing.</seg>

<seg id="15">An all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>

<seg id="19">To the safety systems belong the town center emergency brake assistant (works to speed 32), the collision warning system and the trace retaining assistant.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Kollisionswarner irritates sometimes, because it evaluates many obstacles when ranking as “approaching objects”.</seg>
<seg id="21">The high beam assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent speed controller reacted to the road sign recognition and throttles if necessary the speed.</seg>
<seg id="23">Full connectivity gives it however only for the Top equipment: 7-Zoll-Touchscreen, Navi, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB and a HDMI socket are under the arm rest and are somewhat pedantic therefore to reach.</seg>
<seg id="25">Those approximately 29000 euros for the well equipped Top Diesel are correct.</seg>
<seg id="26">Who does not want to invest so much, receives the gasoline-driven car starting from 20000 euros, the Diesel starting from 23000 euros.</seg>

<seg id="1">Restful night: Hint against sleep disturbances</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening one turns over eternally, at night lies itself one awake for hours, in the morning is already far before that bell bells no longer of sleep to be thought.</seg>
<seg id="3">That is everything but restful.</seg>
<seg id="4">One nevertheless is with such problems in good society: According to Robert Koch-Institut about a quarter of the adults sleep disturbances and more do not have their sleep as ten percent to feel frequently or permanently than restful.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disturbances express themselves?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disturbances, and various causes can be the basis for them, stress Hans-Günter Weeß, Vorstandsmitglied of the German society for sleep research and sleep medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">Which one understands popularly by it, are however the Insomnie, thus an in and a Durchschlafstörung.</seg>
<seg id="8">Many humans feel straight sleeping through as unsatisfactory or say insufficient, Jens Wagenknecht, Vorstandsmitglied in the German family doctor federation with practice in the Varel of Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disturbances?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disturbances are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind it organic, psychological or behavior-conditioned factors, in addition, medicines can put.</seg>
<seg id="12">Pretty often the sleep disturbance is expression of another illness.</seg>
<seg id="13">“Very early waking up is particularly frequent with a depression”, says Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors cause each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">Who has for example a herniated disc, can lie badly, wakes up all two to three hours and possibly begins, over everyday problems and - to brood, give Weeß ensure an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">That leads to strain, and sleep is not possible any longer.</seg>
<seg id="17">Starting from when should one with sleep disturbances to the physician?</seg>
<seg id="18">Who sleeps during one period of one month at least three nights per week not well and is impaired on the day, Weeß should go to the physician, guesses/advises.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look completely different: One is reduced, tired, unausgeschlafen, has difficulties with the attention and the concentration, is easily attractionable, has changes in mood or physical complaints such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to alleviate the sleep disturbance, is important it to find their causes out.</seg>
<seg id="21">As treatment options are applicable among other things changes of behavior, a cognitive behavior therapy or also medicines - classical sleeping pills only in the exceptional case and at the most for two weeks -.</seg>
<seg id="22">The established sleep medical profession it hardly gives, stresses Leiter of the interdisciplinary sleep-medical center of the Charité university University of Berlin in Germany Professor Ingo Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore one should turn for sleep problems first to the family doctor, guesses themselves Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="24">That can clarify with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should in the sleep laboratory, and which happens there?</seg>
<seg id="26">To the investigation in the sleep laboratory the medical profession guess/advise for example when snoring with breath dropouts, with diseased daily tiredness, with sleep-walkers or if one does not find the cause of a Durchschlafstörung, Fietze explains.</seg>
<seg id="27">For the investigation to prepare one does not have itself actually.</seg>
<seg id="28">One should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">“Only please” Fietze make, say no midday sleep.</seg>
<seg id="30">To wiring one goes to its normal time to bed.</seg>
<seg id="31">Beside the electrodes at the body one carries nose glasses, a chest belt and a feeler at the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">Besides a camera at the cover notes to the sleeping.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can concerning the problems get into the grasp?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are rather many set screws, at which one can set for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Weeß enumerates: Regular sleeping and rising times, not too long in bed are, because of the day do not sleep, do not watch television for falling asleep, alcohol avoid and on the clock do not look at night - then one begins to count immediately, and that is not favorable at all.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, a few lime tree small trees, occasionally still another rest of cobblestones: The Rigaer road in Berlin Friedrichshain does not work at first sight in such a way, but the police ranks her among the “dangerous places” of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">If one goes along the road from the east to the west, one goes past at playgrounds, a freshpainted kindergarten and a health-food shop.</seg>
<seg id="3">To the front of a grey house someone has “ugly!” sprayed.</seg>
<seg id="4">Opposite of a Lidl, which is to be torn off also soon, already one builds: Until 2017 are to develop here a house with high windows and 133 new rented flats.</seg>
<seg id="5">Articles over this “trendy quarter”, how the responsible real estate company calls Friedrichshain, are illustrated in the last weeks however preferentially with burning cars.</seg>
<seg id="6">Reason is the house with the number 94: Once it was occupied, meanwhile has the inhabitants leases, in the ground floor is however still areas occupied and for events is used.</seg>
<seg id="7">Particularly the citizen of Berlin Senator of the Interiors Henkel had expressed itself since the beginning of the year several times for a hard action of the police against the project, which calls area “NO-Go-zone” for policemen and the 94 as starting point of autonomous force.</seg>
<seg id="8">After on 22 June the areas in the ground floor, which had been vacated Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers, patrolled the police three weeks long official statements according to with 30 to 40 officials and closed three crew cars locally, parts of the road and visitor held from it, the house with the number 94 to enter.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile construction workers reconditioned the areas on behalf the unknown home-owners.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July a citizen of Berlin Administrative Court decided that those had been illegal evacuation, and later police and construction workers under the jubilation took one day off from sympathizers and adjacents resident.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this summer afternoon the road works peacefully: Parents go walking with children, people sit on the sidewalk before the houses in the sun, other one converse before the Späti.</seg>
<seg id="12">In direct proximity of the house projects a primary school and kindergartens lie.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left force is not the main concern of many adjacents resident: Kerstin Neugebauer, which lives since 1999 in the neighbourhood, and Jana*, who nurse here three children, are particularly made nervous of the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the house projects they divide the concern before rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound after a neighbourhood, which by the majority police protection forwards vandalierenden themselves linking longed for.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, which the citizen of Berlin Senator of the Interiors and the police between squatters and their neighbours opens, so obviously does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional worker quarter, which has a low average income and a high poverty risk also today in the comparison to the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="18">Also house occupations and the apartment projects born from it belong for a long time to the neighbourhood: 1990 numerous houses in the former GDR occupied, among them almost the entire Mainz road close by the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainz under large police presence in a proper street battle one had vacated, many were legalized the projects in the Rigaer and are inhabited partly still today by the people, which had occupied them before 26 years.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time that became quarter in the last years increasing the magnet for tourists and choice elections from all over the world: With them now adjacents resident from GDR times and former squatters their neighbourhood divide.</seg>
<seg id="21">That becomes apparent also with the rents, which rose since 2009 with new lettings around nearly 60 percent.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many the new buildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: One recognizes it by thrown in disks or freshly painted fronts, which were thrown with color bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was so often mentioned this year together with the words “left-autonomous force”.</seg>
<seg id="24">A reason for it that not all neighbours view that as problem, could be that they are not necessarily affected by the crime: Criminal offences such as bodily injury are directed according to statistics almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Damages constitute the largest part of the criminal offences, which meet tendentious rather the new buildings and freshly reconditioned houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, which lives for 17 years in a dwelling house beside the disputed 94, no speech can be from uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">Which concerns acts of violence, she is appeasing: The people in the 94 are their neighbours, those that were not certainly.</seg>
<seg id="28">Also the famous burning cars do not give it directly in the Rigaer already longer no more.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architect its road is not a criminal focus, on the contrary: “Here one helps each other, lives together on the road and receives more from each other, than elsewhere”.</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer pulled consciously remained into the Rigaer road - and.</seg>
<seg id="31">Therefore it was also so important to it that the adjacents resident its road got back: Of the police, the policy and the media, which suddenly claimed all in July the interpretation sovereignty over the quarter.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of inhabitants such as Neugebauer the road is further taken away from them: By faceless new buildings in former building gaps, which displace the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">“Those are finally free-hold flats, which are not interesting for many here - here live rather people, which are not so well moneyed”, say them.</seg>
<seg id="34">“I cannot approve force and destruction absolutely.”</seg>
<seg id="35">But which one is to make, if never someone listens to one?</seg>
<seg id="36">There frustration begins, also with the police and the inhabitants on all sides.</seg>
<seg id="37">For tightening, which is annoyed at color bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: The house projects and the left scene belonged to the neighbourhood.</seg>
<seg id="38">Who pulls, its should be conscious - exactly like someone, which pulls into a bar district, badly about noise to weight there can.</seg>
<seg id="39">All only with first name presented people asked with their correct name to be called</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee-assigned</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the partner in things integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">In addition it is social female worker locally.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle is the refugee-assigned for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social teacher supports the team of the administration around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees herself as a partner for all participants: Refugees, working group refugee work, administration, authorities and who otherwise still mixes together.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine Kunde of the working group suggests that the honorary ones are than grateful more that Deuschle is now there, the egg-laying woolly milch sow, which has above all a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thus some - less scoffing than rather on the variety on desire fields of application aiming at - had meant, when the administration wanted to write the place out.</seg>
<seg id="9">An administration employee was looked for with a talent for languages and humans, connected with an experience of many years within the range of the social work, just an egg-laying woolly milch sow.</seg>
<seg id="10">But clerical work is not their central range, means Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all go it around organization, work with humans locally and also behind the scenes as well as to network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year old participates for approximately six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It limited a 50-Prozent-Stelle on three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">“It was high time”, says Regine Kunde that Annika Deuschle supports honoured and full-time participants.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers are located in the which road</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem is it for some time to find apartments for the connection refugees who were recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">For the connection accommodation the municipalities are responsible.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accommodate the refugees in own or rented dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs of the building, the rent or the renovation of these accommodation must carry the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the district administration office on municipality and job centre.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: There are free objects, but not each landlord wants to offer its apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search turns out for some time as very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">It does not function so far, one is dependent on private dwellings, like that Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore gemeindliche apartments must be trained, as it is called so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">Thus soon new containers in the which road are set up.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, is itself Regine Kunde and Annika Deuschle united.</seg>
<seg id="30">Beside a firm lodging there is internship places, apprentice positions, school places, one-euro-jobs and temporary jobs for refugees and Migranten, who gefundnen or must be furnished.</seg>
<seg id="31">“Would be good more places”, reports Regine Kunde.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help caretakers, settle non-profit work - and motivates and very properly, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">That is not “occupation therapy”.</seg>
<seg id="35">Activity does not however only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a firm structure, says Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">Humans would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">Thus need it offers such as sport, contacts with native ones and above all language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are RSR.</seg>
<seg id="40">Thus administration and honorary ones substitute also here.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central vision that the refugees get the feeling, it is desired and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedures is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They must explain to the refugees that it lasts just and it meaningfully can bridge the time, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Who develops the feeling sometime, he can in Urbach nobody help, may not work and is useless, which will never integrate itself.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">There are cases of problem in addition, say, customer honestly, “people, at which nothing at all does not go”. The work of Deuschle and customer are always also to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a “giant task”.</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: Do the two have fear of radicalization after the recent occurrences, also in a small community such as Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">“No”, Regine Kunde says completely clearly, “which some naively call may”. A residual risk can not exclude and does not want it however.</seg>
<seg id="50">Sensitized however already are the aides.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also topic with the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">Those would have the fear that the assassins bring them completely in disrepute.</seg>
<seg id="53">“You want to show that they have to do thereby nothing”, say Regine Kunde.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would remain gladly in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">Thus head and honorary ones must hold locally and in the region after activities look out.</seg>
<seg id="56">They have always in the background that soon a new impact at refugees and Migranten could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need an upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">This question clearly to answer, is afraid the policy.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to place it to aides locally.</seg>
<seg id="60">“In Urbach we arrived not yet, where we would like”, say Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, which would ease the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine Kunde makes likewise clear that the Urbacher is working at full capacity already to integrate past humans reasonably.</seg>
<seg id="63">Those are at present approximately 100 people, predominantly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But if humans are in emergency, one must help them, is itself both women united.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political international situation is not so complicated, there gives it simple answers.</seg>
