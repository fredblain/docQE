Building ground in double pack
With issues surrounding construction, the local council has focused on the most recent meeting.
With relief, the panel adopted Mayor Robert Putz's message that "at last the marketing of the recently designated residential area can begin."
After clearing the land, parking and development issues and making the applications for surveying, the sale of the plots of land in the residential areas "Road" and "Schönau-West" (Binderstraße - Explanation section 1) is no longer in the process of being sold.
The local council is convinced that the buildings in the rural and quiet residential community of Schönau address young families and mature seniors alike.
As it was said, developers can now sign up at City Hall, the awarding of the parcels is expected to be discussed by the local council at its September meeting.
In order to be able to respond to requests for the settlement of further businesses, linked to the creation of jobs, the Municipal Council decided to amend the land use plan, which was first created in spring this year.
In the area of Untertimlarn, the industrial area already designated there will be extended by two parcels in the direction of the state road 2112.
