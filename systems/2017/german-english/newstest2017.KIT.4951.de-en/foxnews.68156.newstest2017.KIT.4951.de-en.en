Reid says Clinton will remain in the case of an election victory at Garland as a candidate for the Supreme Court
Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell believes the next president will appoint the successor to the late judge at the Antonin Scalia Supreme Court.
Reid said Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects Clinton to select Garland "with some degree of certainty."
A Reid spokeswoman later said he had not yet spoken to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland and he speculated.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team would not provide for unrest with a new candidate.
Garland is the top judge for the U.S. appeals court for the District of Columbia.
Raid said Republicans blocked the Garland nomination, were lackeys and aides of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also noted that Donald Trump was unfit for the presidency.
