Future of Portland's melting plant due to repeal of energy contract
The future of Portland's aluminum smelting in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs from workers - are at stake, as the plant operator will terminate the energy supply contract and thus lift all supply contracts, the energy company said.
That move followed the government's decision in Victoria earlier this year not to grant any further subsidies to operate the plant.
A subsidy set for 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2000 jobs at Alcoa's plant in Portland are at stake.
No less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk when closing.
In addition, there could be knock-on effects, as the melting plant consumes about 10 percent of Victoria's total power generation.
In 2014, Alcoa completed the Point Henry melting plant, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa's melting plant in Portland is losing money and risking a closure.
This move follows years of speculation about the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the electricity price for the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminum melting plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it expects three more owners to terminate their contracts.
The plant is in the majority owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
"AGL assumes that the plant in Portland will continue to operate, which means further physical demand for electricity by the melting plant," the company said.
AGL continued to say that the contracts are so-called "backup business", which should have come into effect from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will end in 2017.
"From that point of view, AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenue in fiscal year 17," said the electricity supplier.
All potential effects on AGL revenues from FY18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL announced that it had already written off the value of the contracts in its annual accounts of $187 million in "expectation of a termination."
Alcoa said the decision to tender the contracts would not affect the "ability of Alcoas... to operate the melting plant or to ensure the power supply to the melting plant."
The U.S. company said it completed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which should have come into effect from November this year, even if it still owes a statement as to why it resigned from the contract.
Analysts are warning about the industry's poor economic conditions ahead of the possible closure of the Portland melting plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.
Referring to analysts ' statements earlier in the week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said Portland had about 600 megawatts and Tomago consume about 900 megawatts of electricity annually.
Should both plants disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [electricity market].
And for us as power producers, that would not be good," he said.
