De Maizière said that after the violence perpetrated by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were concerned about further attacks.
The state must respond calmly and decisively at the same time to terrorist threats.
What is certain is that our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
We will not give this triumph to the terrorists.
If criminals had to leave the country more quickly, however, it would increase the security and strength of the people's support for refugee policy.
De Maizière intends to implement the proposals until the federal election in 2017.
He also announced a further personnel reinforcement of the security forces,"in mid-four-digit magnitude over several years."
Sympathy for terrorism must be punished again.
Video surveillance is to be improved, and gun law is being amended in such a way as to make it more difficult to buy weapons on the Internet.
The last much-discussed duty of silence for doctors is to be respected, according to de Maizières.
However, he wants to seek solutions in the dialogue with the medical profession on how to reduce the vulnerability of citizens, he said, with a view, for example, to mental discoveries.
In order to counter the radicalisation of refugees, the Minister believes that better social care is needed.
Teachers would have to be better prepared for dealing with traumatised people.
In order to prosecute criminals in specific areas of the Internet (Darknet) de Maizière plans to use covert investigators.
SPD chief Gabriel said: "the SPD is ready to talk about anything that helps to further enhance security."
It is important for the Home Secretary to speak out clearly against action.
"That was a slap in the face for the sharpmakers in the CDU/CSU," Gabriel told the newspapers of the Funke Media Group (Friday).
De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the union after a burqa ban and the abolition of dual nationality.
A general ban on full obfuscation is a constitutional problem.
You cannot ban everything you are opposed to, and I reject the wearing of the burqa.
We can talk about rules such as road transport or witnesses in court.
Green leader Simone Peter accused the minister of trying to simulate new anti-terrorist packages and capacity to act.
Left-wing party chief Bernd Riexinger said: "fleet scraps and a tightening of the right of residence do not bring security to the people of this country."
