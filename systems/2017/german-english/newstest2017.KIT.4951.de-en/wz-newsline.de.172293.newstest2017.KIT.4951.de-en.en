Relaxing night: tips against sleep disorders
In the evenings you get around forever, at night you are awake and in the morning you can't think of sleep anymore.
That is far from relaxing.
After all, such problems are in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than 10% feel their sleep often or permanently as not recovering.
How do sleep problems or sleep disorders occur?
There are several forms of sleep disturbances, and they can cause a variety of causes, says Hans-Günter We<unk>, member of the board of the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Schlafforung und Schlafmedizin.
What you mean by this is the insomnie, that is, an insomnia and sleep disorder.
It is precisely the sleep that makes many people feel unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, a member of the Executive Board in the German Home Medical Association with practice in Lower Saxony.
What is behind sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
Behind this can be organic, mental or behavioral factors, but also drugs.
Not infrequently, sleep disorder is an expression of another disease.
"Very early waking up is especially common in a depression," says We<unk>.
And it may be that different factors require each other.
For example, if you have a bandwagon, you can be bad, wake up every two to three hours, and perhaps begin to grapple with everyday problems and worries.
That leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
When should you have sleep disturbances to the doctor?
Anyone who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is impaired on the day should go to the doctor, advises weed.
The impairment may look very different: one is off, tired, idle, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily appealing, has mood swings or physical ailments like stomach or headache.
To ease the sleep disorder, it is important to find out their causes.
Treatment options include behavioral changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or medication - classical sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks.
There are hardly any sleep doctors in Germany, says Prof. Ingo Fietze, director of the interdisciplinary dormitory center of the Charité University Medicine Berlin.
That is why, when it comes to sleep problems, you should first contact the doctor.
The can check with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should go to the sleep lab, and what happens?
For examinations in the sleep lab, medics advise, for example, on snoring with respirators, on sickle dayfatigue, sleep converters or if you do not find the cause of a sleep disorder, Fietze explains.
You do not really have to prepare for the investigation.
You should spend the day normally.
"Just please do not make a luncheon," says Fietze.
After the swirling, you go to bed at his normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body, you wear a nasal glasses, a breast belt and a fan on your finger.
There is also a camera on the ceiling.
How can people get a grip on the problems?
There are quite a lot of screws that can be used for a better sleep.
Weaving counts: regular sleep and uplift times, not too long in bed, do not go to sleep on the day, do not watch TV to sleep, drink alcohol and do not look at the clock at night - then you start counting immediately and that is not conducive at all.
