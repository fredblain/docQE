B27-rehabilitation: restaurants suffer from closure
There is nothing to tinker with the speed with which the B 27 is being cleaned up.
There is a lot of praise for those responsible for the construction work, which starts at 5.30 in the morning and does not end until 20: 00.
"They have made it all pretty tender," says Elvira Tetzlaff of the jet petrol station.
That is a super team.
There is also no delay.
The construction site could be moved to the south at half-time by the end of October, and everything will be ready by the end of October.
Praise will also be given to those responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to setting up temporary vehicles.
Since the construction site migrated to the south on Monday, and the closure of the Aspergstrasse in Ofterdingen has been lifted and the connection to ROTTENBURG has been restored, the traffic situation within the village has been relaxed.
Citizens can now move from Ofterdingen from the B 27.
The alternative traffic through the place seems to go back.
"There were some significant complaints there," says the deputy chief executive, Florian King, who is responsible for the transport management of the remediation.
The residents of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstrasse, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to contend with more traffic noise, because many trails were searched and more familiar to their Navi than the signage.
Which resulted in some lorries being frantic in residential areas.
As the speed limits were also not observed, the municipality increased the measurement vehicle from Mössingen.
"There were significant overruns," says King, who turned himself in on the location on the spot.
Two to three per minute have already been blown away.
The quickest was traveling at 77 kilometers in the Tempo-30 zone.
Since the construction site has moved on, however, it has become calmer.
For the business people at the B 27, it is only a small consolation that for customers from ROTTENBURG the road is now open again.
Business people do not like to look in the cards.
But the fact that the B 27-refurbishment has led to revenue collapses leaves everyone who is asked to look through.
However, some are more and some less affected.
Who has less to do with the "end customer", that is to say, for other companies, for which the restoration has little impact.
Even in the case of the car company MAIER, Thomas Sulz speaks of a "slight decrease", but also admits that of course "the runner-up is missing".
Most battered are the locals along the road.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the steakhouse, formerly crown, finds clear words.
This is already a threat.
Not just him, but all the restaurants have hit it "hard."
Customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.
We have to be happy about every euro sales.
The revenue losses put it at "well over 50 percent."
Road renovation has "thrown back its farm" by two years.
Half of his staff have made him redundant.
If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been made redundant, the policy would have reacted differently.
Instead, the President of the Government, Mr Jörg Schmidt, responded to a request from Göhner on whether there could be financial compensation, with the reference that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the benefits of the situation at the B 27. now, it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the refurbishment.
Göhner knows from other counties where such a thing has been more generous.
For all the complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue.
After all, the family business has been here since 1715, he points to the long history.
He can understand that other regular guests are now less frequent because of the complicated traffic management.
If you can 't drive, it is nice somewhere else.
Göhner has no doubt that his regular clientele will come back after the end of the restoration work.
Despite the crises with BSE and bird flu, Göhner is keeping the impact of the B 27 building on its clientele for the biggest crisis its restaurant has experienced in its long-running history.
Six months of construction work, that is brutal.
