"A generation protested" in Ethiopia, Long a US ally
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters demanding political changes in Ethiopia met with violent resistance from the government.
Witnesses say that tens of protesters were killed in shootings during clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia in the process of collapsing?
Over the last decade, it has been one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months, anti-government protests shook the country and expanded into more and more areas.
Last week, thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.
The government's response was ruthless, according to human rights organizations.
Witnesses said police shot and killed scores of unarmed protesters.
Videos in circulation about the protests, presumably from the last or earlier this year, show how security people beat young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall.
The head of the UN Human Rights Agency is now asking for an in-depth investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project manager of the Horn of Africa International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West.
American military and intelligence agencies are working closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorist threats beyond the region, particularly in Somalia.
Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia has been far from a model for democracy, human rights organisations have consistently led the government's repression - the opposition in the country has been restricted, with dissidents effectively silenced.
Many were sent into exile or in jail, killed or driven into the expanses of the desert.
But that could change.
"If you suppress people and these no other options have other options besides protesting, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia.
The whole youth protests.
A generation is protesting.
There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to the stranglehold on power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies were given the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament.
At the same time, tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea; a battle for this treacherous, controversial line claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts worry that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less defeated in recent years, could exploit the turmoil and rearm themselves.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness now explode beneath the surface after years of gestation.
The first seems innocuous: smartphones.
It is only in recent years that many Ethiopians have been able to communicate via social media, as cheaper smartphones have become increasingly common and Internet services improved.
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are staying.
Several young Ethiopians said they gathered to protest.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
Since eons, the Amharas, who come from the predominantly Christian highlands, have prospered in politics and economics while exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in lowland areas.
But even that is changing.
"We are in the process of coordinating under an umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of Oromos.
The biggest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, who make up about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, the intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third reason for the riots is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia's prime minister until his death on an undisclosed illness in 2012 for 17 years.
He was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.
Analysts say he was particularly savvy at seeing early signs of discontent and using special representatives to edit opponents and make them harmless.
"The current regime lacks this fundamental skill," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected for relatively obscure reasons to take Mr Meles's position.
Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he does not have the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.
Many worry that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such a revolt was in 2005, after thousands protested against elections, which, according to analysts, appears to have been sworn in by the government and then stolen.
During the ensuing raids, many protesters were killed, even if they were less than in recent months, and this time of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in the fight against poverty.
But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal disgust of the Ethiopian government.
And it is taking a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, an amharic city run by Tigray conducted deals and the hatred toward the Tigray is becoming more common on social media.
Analysts say the protests put the U.S. and other Western allies in a strange position.
The American government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, even though it recently announced it had closed that base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile area.
"This," said Mr Abdi,"is a very thin gratuity."
