Once squeezed over price from the market, Caf√© comes back in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby cafe in Williamsburg, where you could only pay cash that had no Wi-Fi but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, prices have been squeezed out of his Bedford Avenue store front.
The store soap Cherie, which replaced verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Locals cheered it as the last loss in a gentrified city.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter,"I know New York is changing, but I still cannot believe that CBGB dead, the Chelsea Hotel excepted and Verb is now a soap business."
But if New York is changing, it is also reinvention.
A revived Verb Cafe opened in Greenpoint last November, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same employees and a similarly simple atmosphere.
The coffee is still good, too.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old cafe who is the owner and managing director of the new cafe.
He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When he offered a client to provide funds for a new outsider, he was excited to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, blasted a lot.
Verb used the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnishes such as capers and sauced onions.
There are natural bowls.
The cafe no longer serves beer, there are fresh juices for it.
After nine months, Rodriguez said he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.
"Many old customers have also been displaced by prices from Williamsburg," he said.
Recently, on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
OLIVEIRA, 34, previously lived in Williamsburg and visited the verb on a regular basis.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would take the road.
After the verb closed, she gave up the coffee rink for a while, she said.
"I became clear that it was in the coffee and the culture in the verb that I liked," she said.
Now she is drinking coffee again, even if she ordered a blended Chai Tea instead of her usual iced coffee, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal is another longtime and loyal customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.
He went there before the work and invariably ordered the same.
"I came quarters after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they are preparing my Everything bagel with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu.
Nowadays, Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he switches his Everything bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said he had no grudge about the soap business taking the old business room.
In fact, the owners of the soap Cherie offered to produce a special soap for verb with the cafe's cold-blooded coffee as an ingredient.
"I think we are still going to go down on their offer," said Rodriguez.
And the traditional Polish inhabitants of Greenpoints have also accepted the cafe.
A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said he plans to issue it soon, so that his new neighbors feel welcome.
The location also has other advantages.
A local juice local wants to fill and sell the cold coffee.
There is a chance that the cafe will expand to a nearby building.
For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the cafe closed.
When the new cafe opened, Whitt said that entering the premises and ordering a new coffee was felt like a return home.
"I had to smell that," he said.
