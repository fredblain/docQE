Police deploy tear gas & rubber floors against protesting Brazilian students
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to demonstrate against the government's reforms for the public education system.
Police set up tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The trouble began when police officers tried to disperse the students, causing the police to use rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their dismay over the plans.
According to the proposals of the governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, slightly fewer than 100 public schools will be closed, while 300,000 students will be implemented to save money.
Some of the protest participants saw graffiti against interim President Michel Temer sprayed on walls.
The latest protests occurred a few days after demonstrators in crowds took to the streets to support the suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been removed from office by a Senate vote on her dismissal.
