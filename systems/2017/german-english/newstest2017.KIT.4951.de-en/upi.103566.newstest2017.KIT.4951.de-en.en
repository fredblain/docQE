NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
Venus was probably once habitable, according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.
Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus could have taken up similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and carbon-dense atmosphere.
Scientists have previously hinted that the slow turn of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus may have had a thin, earthquake-like atmosphere and yet slowly turned on.
The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.
The planet probably had more dry areas than Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to house life and protect it from rapid evaporation.
The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.
"In the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exposed its day side of the sun for almost two months," explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heat.
The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of Earth today.
The model produced a history of Venus similar to the evolution previously suspected of planetary researchers.
Although it was probably habitable, Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over the course of several billion years.
Their oceans evaporated and their water vapour was burned away by the ultraviolet light.
As their Hydrogen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.
