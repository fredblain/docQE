Sunseekers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A portuguese P-3C Orion plane of the Air Force set off an incredible fall flight
The Air Force said it was on a training flight but insisted there was no safety risk
This was the moment when frightened tourists begin to panic after a tipical jet crashed over a full beach.
Dramatic video footage showed how the military plane flew almost in tangible proximity over the sunbathers on the beach section in Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers jumped on when they understandably began to worry about the noise of the jet engines without first seeing what was coming through the clouds on them.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many holidaymakers who posted videos about the dramatic fly-By in social media, said: "it flew twice really deep and there was a moment when it looked like it was going to crash."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was down to me."

The Portuguese air force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to fly so deeply that this was the only way to detect them.
The spokesman said that due to poor visibility conditions, the jet flew slightly deeper than usual due to poor visibility, but the air force insisted that security was at no time at risk.
Land fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer, which also killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese air force today announced that the pilot had to fly so deeply because of the circumstances - strong fog and fire smoke - which restricted his view
