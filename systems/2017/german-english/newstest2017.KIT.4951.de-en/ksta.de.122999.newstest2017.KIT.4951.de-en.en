Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes Internethit
The Olympic Games or world records do not always determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.
This shows the courageous performance of Robel Kiros Habte at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro.
In the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia was so slow that he could not be seen in the TV pictures at times.
He just disappeared - no matter how far the cutout was selected.
In the social networks, Habte subsequently became a viral internethite.
In fact, the 24-year-old finished his previous run with a back-to-back 48 seconds and clinched the 59th place of 59 starters.
But it was rather his not exactly sporting figure that attracted the attention of the international media.
Why the 24-year-old still participates in the Olympics?
The Ethiopian got a special start from the international swimming federation.
This is distributed to make swimming in under-represented countries more known.
Since most athletes are running in aesopia, Habte simply wanted to do something else.
Preparation is all: Robel Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.
The first nicknames quickly made the round.
Some media described him as "Robel the Wal."
Following a "welfare bite", the English tabloid "The Sun" was funny with "Dad Bod".
His time, he first struck with a minute and nearly five seconds left over the 100-meter freehand, played no role there.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.
At the 2000 Sydney Olympics, the run of Eric Moussambani provided media attention.
Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to compete on his own in an advance over 100 metres.
Frenetic, Moussambani was fired at the time.
The then 22-year-old first learned to swim eight months before Olympia and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.
