Amid the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen des Trampolins
Wherever you are, how late it is, it is the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inescapable, a racing staple between competition and aspiration.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning stomach, stretched from the armor to the swimmer to the turner to the triathlete.
You cannot turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour's conversation in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the quarrel between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there is Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is here for the first time at the Olympics and a women's black with greats, could well have been among those familiar names sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising if he were a swimmer, Turner or even Fechter.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is battling gold in the Olympic trampoline.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate each event the same.
Further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports that are not universally recognised: air pistols shooting, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.
We will always have the breast swim and may it be long.
But if I can make modest arguments for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it was perceived the last 16 years so sparingly that many of the ones I had interviewed did not know it is an Olympian type at all.
That could also be regional ignorance.
Although the U.S. sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in the trampoline jump and until 2012 had an athlete who made it to the final round.
The Chinese and Russians tend to share the prices of the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.
DONG Dong of China and Rosie MacLennan of Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
The trampoline jump has a certain outsider charm, in part because for the unenlightened ear it sounds more appropriate for a clowning school than that for the Olympic Games.
At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a naturalized enthusiast.
It has humoristic potential - the cartoonish citation of his never-ending impact - but also the grace of the tournament and diving, the two sports that essentially unites it.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means as much as "springboard."
Aspiring victors jump on a giant trampoline, shoot nearly up to 30 feet into the air and have to make a series of falling movements (turning, hitting and saltos) before they land on their feet.
They are evaluated according to the official Olympic program after execution, difficulty and "flight time".
Second-round athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.
Medal hopefuls have to go further in their pursuit of gold, faster, up and down, sometimes to the goal, sometimes back and forth, up and down the pitch.
They hunt not only the finish line or the starting wall, but also, in television broadcasting, another cavalier goal: that of the world or the Olympiarecord.
The purposeful pursuit is nobel, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to stir even a spectator to tears.
But it is also what I find to be a bit tiring even when watching these games.
Of this, the trampoline offers a breathing space.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is up.
A forward movement is not the goal.
He or she jumps off, seemingly heavy-handed like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
Again there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, just the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.
It is as Zen as the competition at the Olympics can only be.
The women's qualification and final rounds will be held Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; that of the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.
NBC will broadcast the Endrunden as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00.
In the midst of the Olympic mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in the general tumult.
If consciousness can be achieved only by the angling and objectification of male athletes - as the male US Turner suggested recently, according to The Wall Street Journal - Mr Dooley awaits his fledgling, new fan base.
