Post rises in trade with electric transporters
An electric delivery vehicle from Deutsche Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the company appears to be large.
The Post is planning to sell its electric vehicle streetscooter as well.
Shortly, the Group intends to start trading with the transporter.
The Post wants to offer its electric transporters on the free car market as of next year.
"We want to get into the sale to third parties," a Post spokesman said Friday.
The company has been checking for months whether to sell its self-developed streetscooter, with the letters and packs, to other establishments as well.
Post Board Chairman JÃ¼rgen Gerdes had said that there are always enquiries, for example from craftsmen.
According to the news magazine "Der Spiegel", the Bonn Group is about to enter the mass production of the vehicles.
In the poetry factory, the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars a year and layer.
Gerdes had announced that the group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and make a complete transition to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term.
"We will take a very, very robust step towards 2020," he had said at the end of July.
I can imagine that we are switching the entire fleet.
The streetscooter has been active on Germany's roads since 2014.
