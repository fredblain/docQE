CBC commentator for the Olympics apologizes for his statement that Chinese swimmers "died like a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of fourth-place 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at Dr 4x200m freestyle squadron outraged viewers of the CBC live broadcast of the Olmypian Games on Wednesday
Canadian broadcaster CBC had to apologise after one of its commentators said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer went "like Mief" and died during the race like "a pig."
Commentator Byron MacDonalds thought his microphone was off when he made his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m freestyle squad.
MacDONALD, who had been summoned to the CBS commentary team on board to give more "color," could be heard saying,"this little 14-year-old Chinesin has lost the connection, baby."
Too excited, went off like Mief, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swept the second leg of the swimming squad 1: 57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to close the gap with China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly online after being shocked by the tone and language
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted," Hat the CBC commentator just said that the 14-year-old swimmer from China " like a pig has died "????
The idiot did not capitalize that they were still on broadcast. "
Ai Yanhan of China was described in the final 4 x 200m freestyle swimming squad for women: "this little 14-year-old Chinesin has lost the connection, baby."
The criticism against Byron MacDonald on Twitter came fast and hard, at which many asked him to speak
Twitter users did not hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: "wow, _SHARP_ ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and let us all look like racists.
A short time later, Scott Russel, who moderated the CBC broadcast, apologised live for MacDonald's comment and said: "we apologize that the comment was broadcast on a swimming performance."
It was an unhappily chosen phrase, we are sorry it happened. "
CBC apologized at the end over 90 times at the people who responded to the note on Twitter
Fellow commentator Scott Russel had to apologise on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and added his apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about MacDonald's comments
The network also apologized quickly and issued a notice.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that it was possible for them to be broadcast.
Last night we quickly apologised to our viewers on broadcast and our followers on social media.
To make one clear, Byron's comments related to the swimmer's performance and not to her as a person.
Yet they were inadequate and an unhappily chosen phrase. Byron does what he has said, very sorry.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized in the broadcast and tried to justify his comment, saying it was not his intention to be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I would love to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women's swimming squad in the CBC Olympics," he said.
"I was referring to the performance of the swimmers and not to them as a person."
Of course, no disrespect was intended and I am very sorry. "
