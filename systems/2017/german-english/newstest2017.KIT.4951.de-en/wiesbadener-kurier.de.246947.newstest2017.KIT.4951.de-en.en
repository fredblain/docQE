Illness: when the organiser pays
Sick holidaymakers will only receive money after their journey, if the cause of the illness is undoubtedly found in the hotel.
However, that is only the case when more than ten per cent of guests have been proven to show the same symptoms.
In the negotiated case, a family was badly affected by diarrhoea and vomiting on the second day of their Turkish leave.
She spent almost the entire holiday in the room.
Their illness led the holidaymakers back to a faulty sewage plant, which allegedly polled the seawater.
The family believed the trip was flawed - and sounded against the organizer.
In court, the plaintiffs had no success.
It is true that the water treatment plant was broken.
But the organizer learned about it shortly before the departure of the plaintiffs.
He had to assume until then that the sea water was in order.
So he did not violate his information requirements, according to the ruling.
No contamination has been found in the samples of the water.
The illness of several hotel guests - possibly through contagion among themselves - is part of the general risk of life.
Out of 691 guests, only 38 were sickened.
