Trump sees looming election defeat not so tight
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a campaign event in Florida.
If there is nothing wrong with the election to the US president, Donald Trump already has an alternative video.
He will then go on holiday.
If Donald Trump loses the US presidential election in November, he would be relatively indifferent: "ultimately it will either clap, or I have a very, very nice, long holiday," the Republican nominee said in a telephone interview with the US television channel CNBC.
If it was not enough for him in the end, for reasons of political correctness, that is fine," trump said.
So he called U.S. President Barack Obama and the Democrats ' candidate, Hillary Clinton, a founder of the terrorist militia Islamic State (IS).
Within his party, there was more and more resistance.
