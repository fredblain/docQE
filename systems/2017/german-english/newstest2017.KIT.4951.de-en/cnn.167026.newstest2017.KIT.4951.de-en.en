Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That is what I imagine under the women's Olympic team in the tournament, and that for more than one reason.
First, I have been at every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.
And second, this team has three turners, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have been inspiring for many young girls of other skin color.
The structure of this crew, the Aly Raisman, who is Jewish and Madison Kocian, who is a Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the US.
It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
In the last four years, the number one female Turner has been an Afro-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were _SHARP_ 1 and _SHARP_ 2.
That shows strength.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America cheered.
Now the world has been able to witness the incredible performance of the three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected but masterful gym routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American who won gold at an individual multifight event for women.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We are seeing the top of this sport, but so tournament classes across the country do not look out.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all hit the same road as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.
They are the "last five" because the next Olympic team will have only four tournaments in the team, and this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.
But the reality is that Turns is an expensive sport and Turner is primarily in private gyms, which are maintained by parents who pay for the training, deployment, travel, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their Turner and families).
The majority of these tournament clubs are in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.
In these clubs, Turner receives all her training and that is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.
Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, both have trained their athletes since they started the tournament.
We need to allow the communities of Aun countless young girls, inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, to have a more affordable and accessible gym.
I founded my tournament of 20 years.
At my events, we have offered free and affordable tournament in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high quality tournaments to the youth who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
It develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination offers lifetime benefits for health and school and professional success.
It is the inspiration of this team that will make thousands of young girls interested in the tournament and that is great.
It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real portrayal of "girl Power" by the Holen of Olympic team golds and thanks, Fass motivated her so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
