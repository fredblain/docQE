GfK leader resigns after disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GFK is replacing its boss Matthias Hartmann.
The resignations came suddenly - but not entirely surprising.
The difficult situation of the market research firm GFK allowed the chair of CEO Matthias Hartmann to be all the more insecure the longer the success he promised.
Turmoil at the head of the Nuremberg-based market research firm GFK: after once again disappointing business figures and the resignation of the company's management, the world's number five industry faces a human new start.
GfK's board chief wants to leave the company at the end of the year.
The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board Arno Mahlert is already out of the supervisory body with effect from 12 September.
The management on the Board of Directors already acquired the previous member of the Executive Board, Gerhard Hausruckinger, on 1 September.
He is to formally assume the role of a "CEO" until a successor is found for Hartmann.
As a reason for the resignations, the company called "different views" on the long-term business orientation.
Details did not want to call a company spokesman Friday.
Anyone who will lead the market research company in the future is still unclear.
In investors ' circles, it was said on Friday that the disappointment of the further lack of success of the restructuring launched years ago had been great for shareholders.
Mr Hartmann has been at the GfK top since 2011.
"The fruits of the restructuring, however, are not yet visible after 5 years," it said.
Given the latest bad GfK business figures, each shareholder will eventually be restless.
"If that were the case at BMW, that would also make the quandts like that," it said.
The company had also failed to halt its loss in the second quarter of 2016 after setbacks in the previous quarter.
At 361.2 million euros, sales were 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable prior-year quarter.
Related to the first half of the year, sales shrank by 3.4 percent to 721.2 million euros.
The gain in the second quarter mainly weighed on the company's sunken value in the face of its difficult economic situation.
The company's depreciation of EUR 139 million, which was necessary in the Consumer Experience business, gave the Group a loss of EUR 148.2 million.
In the second quarter of 2015, GFK still generated a net profit of 19.7 million.
