Salzburg "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare year, the Salzburg Festival presents the "West Side Story" with Tony and Mary as a tragic love pair, similar to Romeo and Julia.
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquered Salzburg: the "West Side Story", Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.
Artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical to the Temple of Classic and performed a youth dream with the role of Mary.
In the orchestra, the Simón Bolívar Orchestra led by the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "this music is full of rhythm," he joked.
We always say that it is very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody.
It is a wonderful blend, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say that we have Bernstein's music really in our blood!
In this staging, Bartoli plays an older Mary.
She remembers with sorrow at her favourite with Tony, while the younger Mary plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
First, because it is musically exceptional!
And then there would be Marias personality.
She says it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright."
So she is wise, of course, also naive, and very passionate.
"She is very similar to me, my Italian character, which I have as a Roman," laughs Bartoli.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It is such an honour for us to work with her.
She is an immensely generous person.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an exceptional artist and very passionate!"
Conducting is a necessity for him.
You see it in any of his movements, in his eyes, it is his life!
It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a cheerful approach to life, which is very important at all!
For American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the "West Side Story" is highly topical: "this piece is about prejudice and fanaticism."
Today we have the refugees, then the Puerto Ricans went to New York, and the New York residents did not want them.
These are the same issues, and they are as meaningful today as they were then.
59 years later, the piece is still relevant.
