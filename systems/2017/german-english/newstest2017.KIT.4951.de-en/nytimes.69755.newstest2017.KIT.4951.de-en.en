Military leadership falsifies ISIS intelligence information, puts Committee of Congress firmly
Military personnel from the United States Central Command changed intelligence to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than it would have allowed actual conditions on the ground, a congressional investigator said in a report Thursday.
The preliminary report, prepared by a task force of Republican members of the congressional committee, intelligence committees and the Wehrbudget budget committee, reports great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how presenters changed their assessments of U.S. efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.
The Central Command, briefly Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Intelligence information, typically sent by senior Centcom commanders, regularly marked a more positive picture of America's efforts against terrorism than it would have allowed actual conditions on the ground and were consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence services," a newspaper article quoted the report as saying.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our leaders," said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The leadership failures at Centcom extend to the top of the organization.
The 10-page report shows detailed persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in training Iraqi forces.
Although it does not provide direct evidence that government leaders have given instructions under Obama to change the reports, it shows how analysts faced pressure from their superiors to draw a more optimistic picture of the Islamic State's threat, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, opinions and statements before Congress were far more positive than the facts," the report noted.
For example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, so much is clear," said Mike Pompeo, Republican congressman from Kansas, in an opinion.
From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the Central Command's spikes changed the intelligence reports to downplay the danger posed by ISIS in Iraq.
Republicans launched the task force after they conceded that analysts were worried about manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.
The report released Thursday will be supplemented by more detailed findings while the investigation continues.
In addition, further investigation of the Centcom reports is under way by the General Inspector General of the Ministry of Defence.
Democratic members of the News Service Committee released their own findings on Thursday, agreeing with some of the conclusions of the Republican task force.
"In 2014 and 2015, the Centcom created an overly limited process for creating intelligence assessments to ISIL and the Iraqi security services," the highest-ranking Democrat in the committee, a member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, disclosed in an opinion.
That process, according to Mr. Schiff,"delayed the release of intelligence reports," damaging the morale among analysts and "gave overly little room for dissent."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats vowed not to have any indication of White House intervention at the Centcom analysts in terms of a "certain political opinion."
The preliminary results of the congressional investigation were published Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."
Last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon's general inspector general, which was taken after complaints from Centcom analysts.
LT. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon press officer, said in an opinion that the Defense Department would not comment on any reports by Congress, while the general inspector general's investigation was still under way.
But he also admitted that "experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Department of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense."
The investigation has repercussions beyond the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion now made by a growing number of Defense Department members).
Last year's accusations, however, raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
Critique about intelligence about Islamic State reminiscences about the Islamic State more than a decade ago, when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document about how, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, George W. Bush envisioned only a small occupying force in Iraq, and had little time to worry about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current coverage of the Islamic State.
Last year, the team around Mr. Hooker noted, according to government sources, that contrary to the government's statements, airstrikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would have no significant effect on the terrorist group's financial position, since those temporary refineries would have been put into operation to sell oil on the black market.
That finding, however, has not been released, the Times reported in September.
Centcoms's then-commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, has been criticized by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced at the Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
