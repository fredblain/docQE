Rescue at Moelfre Bay: three men ' lucky still alive '
Three men are "lucky still alive" after being thrown from their fishing boat in front of Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station struck at 13: 20 BST on Friday after a crew watched the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulty swimming in safety while their boat moved out of their own.
"We saw how the boat turned around in its vicinity and presented us with the worst," said the head of the rescue station of Moelfre Vince Jones.
"Fortunately, the strong winds have already blown the boat out of their reach until we left to water," he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a Boje hanging without a lifeguard.
They all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were taken back to the rescue station
Mr Jones said: "the three men who were thrown into the water are lucky to be unhurt and still alive.
The boat engine had an emergency stopover, but the boat was pulled out by the person who headed the boat.
Someone has woken up to these men today.
