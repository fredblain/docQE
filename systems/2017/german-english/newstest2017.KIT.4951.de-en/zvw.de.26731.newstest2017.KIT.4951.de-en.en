Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee commissioner
Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organizer.
She is also a social worker on the ground.
Since July, Annika Deuschle has been the refugee agency for Urbach.
The social pedagogy supports the management team around Achim Grockenberger.
It sees itself as a contact person for all actors: refugees, refugee aid workers, administration, authorities and anyone else.
Regine's customer from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the ferocious wool mill, which has a particular problem.
For example, some - less spotty than the multitude of desirable tasks - meant that when the administration wanted to put out the job.
The search for an administrative force with a talent for languages and people, coupled with many years of experience in the field of social work, has just been searched.
But administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deuschle.
Above all, it is about organization, work with people on the ground, and also behind the scenes, as well as network activity.
The 31-year-old has been around for about six weeks.
It has a 50 per cent stake in three years.
"It was high time," says Regine's client, that supports Annika Deuschle's honorary and full-time actors.
There are big and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.
New containers will soon be found in Wasenstraße
A serious problem has been for some time to find homes for the connecting refugees who have been recognised.
The local authorities are responsible for the connection.
They have to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented homes.
The costs of building, renting or renovating these accommodations must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
The responsibility changes from the county office to the municipality and the Jobcentre.
Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer their apartment.
The search has been very difficult for some time.
De facto the administration does not find any private housing.
So far, it is not working to rely on private housing, according to Deuschle.
Therefore, public housing needs to be stimulated, as it is so beautiful.
So new containers will soon be set up in Wasenstraße.
But only housing is not done.
Perspective is the key word, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to a fixed lead, it is internships, training places, school places, one-euro jobs and aid activities for refugees and migrants that need to be funded or set up.
"More places would be good," says Regine's customer.
Many work in the building yard or help house masters, do nonprofit work - and that is motivated and very properly, as Annika Deuschle reports.
It hopes that work for the community will lead to a positive external impact.
That is ' no employment therapy '.
But activity does not just mean work.
The day needs a fixed structure, say Deuschle and customer.
People would need to develop a sense of belonging.
So there is a need for offers such as sports, contacts with locals and, above all, language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
So here, too, administration and honorary officials are jumping in.
It is vital that the refugees feel that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.
The long duration of the procedures is a problem.
They must explain to refugees that it is taking time to bridge the gap, for example, with language courses.
Anyone who eventually feels that he is unable to help anyone in Urbach should not be able to work and be useless, who will never integrate.
The clear majority is motivated.
However, there are also problems, says the customer,"people who have nothing at all", so the work of the Deuschle and the customer is always to motivate others.
All of this is a "mammoth task".
A difficult question: have the two, following recent events, been afraid of radicalisation, even in a small community like Urbach?
"No," Regine tells customers quite clearly,"what some might call naive".
The helpers, however, are already sensitized.
These incidents are also a matter for the refugees.
They would have the fear that the perpetrators would bring them completely into disrepute.
"They want to show they have nothing to do with it," says Regine's customer.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
So principal and honorary officials must look for activities on the ground and in the region.
They always have in the background that a new surge of refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.
Does Germany need a cap?
To answer this question clearly is to shy away from politics.
Actually, it is unfair to put them on the ground.
"In Urbach we have not arrived yet where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would relax the situation.
Regine's customer also makes it clear that the Urbachers are already busy integrating the existing people in a reasonable way.
These are currently about 100 people, mostly young men.
But if people are in need, they need help, both women agree.
The political situation is so complicated, there are no easy answers.
