Community law centres have 160,000 people each year
More than 160,000 of the country's aid needs are rejected annually by community law centres, while the industry is capitalizing on the impact of further cuts on already overloaded transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly elderly people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who do not have funds for unjust delogies and the like - are already dismissed for seeking free legal advice and legal advice.
Legal services of the municipality, which are already over-stretched, are ready for further cuts.
As of June next year, these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds.
The director of community law centres of Queesland James Farrell said the latest survey of the National Association of Local Law Centres revealed that thousands of people are already being turned away each year.
Farrell said the situation would only get worse without a repeal of the federal government's decision.
"Queensland's community law centres are chronically underfunded, which means thousands of people are being turned away from important services you need," he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with unmanageable and crushing debts, families who go through separations, workers who have been unfairly sacked - all these people have problems of a legal nature and this survey shows they cannot get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funds by 30 percent from June 2017, which means that thousands of more vulnerable people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the Federal Attorney General and Federal Minister of Justice, as well as Senators of Queensland George Brandis, to immediately lift these budget cuts so that people can get the help they need in the event of legal problems.
Last year, the national government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of community law centres and their customer communities and that the Palaszczuk Government is investing in this important work.
