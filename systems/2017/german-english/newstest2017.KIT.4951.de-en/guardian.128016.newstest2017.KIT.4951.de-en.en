French court rejects bid over demolition of shops in jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an offer by authorities in Calais to crack down dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the jungles of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.
At a court hearing this week, authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorized to tear down 72 provisional stores where people inside the camp are selling goods ranging from cigarettes to energy drinks, offering hairdressers, or selling tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in makeshift restaurants.
The Calais prefecture argued that these places should be torn down because they would be a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and that pose a fire and sanity risk.
Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important because the free meals offered by the government-backed association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They also said that the makeshift shops and restaurants would often provide shelter and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of people running the 72 provisional shops, but admitted that the concerns of Calais prefecture were "absolutely understandable."
The judge Jean-François Molla said the grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than merely feeding people who "live in extremely precarious conditions."
He said the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the rainfall was the Jungle Book Kids ' Café of the camp, which is commonly operated, and 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as advice on asylum matters for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed the petition to protect the kids ' cafe.
In a letter to the Guardian, it said the closure would be "a disaster for these children, the youngest of whom is eight years old."
The two aid agencies Help Refugees and L ' Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp had risen to over 9000 people - the highest number so far - after a sharp rise in newcomers over the summer.
