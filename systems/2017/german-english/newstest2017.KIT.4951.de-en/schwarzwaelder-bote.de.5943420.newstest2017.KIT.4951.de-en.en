Nagold: game and fun at summer release
Eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and adolescents of the socio-educational day group/social group work of the child protection bishop Nagold with their carers on their summer vacation in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
In the quietly situated Freizeitheim Hardtramdle, the joyful group was hospitalized during the first school holiday week.
Several full-day trips were on the program.
On the one hand, it went to bail with the visit of the string zoo.
Second to Maulbronn, where there was a special children's guide in the world-famous monastery.
The third excursion led to Pforzheim.
In the Celtic Museum in Hochdorf, the group learned a lot about the daily life and the food of the Celts.
On the hot days, the group gathered at the deep lake in Maulbronn, which invited you to jump, swim and plan.
Culinary delights have been pampered by children and caregivers with their self-prepared corpses such as the Sauren Spittle, the Seebronner Pfanznle, Iselshauser-Bloff, English-Breakfast and Tübinger Bolognese.
In workshops was baked, beautiful jewelry made of pearls and stones, or made of wood a Roman mill game.
Other highlights of leisure were fishing in a nearby pond, the evenings on fire and the final "colorful evening".
On the day of the journey home, the sun and the children and young people were happy.
