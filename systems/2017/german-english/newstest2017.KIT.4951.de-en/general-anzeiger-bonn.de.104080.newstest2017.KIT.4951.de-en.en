It is constantly being screened in the name of the fight against terrorism.
After the recent attacks, Interior Minister de Maizière is now presenting a thick security package.
But what has a tolerance status to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say to all this?
Thomas de Maizière gives the reconciler.
All his proposals are "politically reasonable" to the coalition partner, says the federal interior minister at the presentation of his new security package.
They do not overdo anyone.
Other, more far-reaching points would first be discussed within the parties.
I am also involved in this.
As interior minister, however, he is interested in results and in a "achievable consensus" within the coalition.
Following the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, de Maizière has missed a little time before presenting his conclusions on security in the Republic.
However, these are all the more extensive.
Something is already known, announced: that a new security authority should take care of the cracking of encrypted communication is not new.
Nor is the fact that Germany has to implement several EU requirements on passenger data and weapons law.
The call for more video surveillance and personnel for security agencies is not surprising.
In part, de Maizière is launching a second attempt at proposals that have not been made with the SPD: he wants to criminalize sympathy for terrorist groups and strip jihadists with dual citizenship the German passport.
"That will be difficult points for the SPD," admits the CDU man.
He still thinks that this is reasonable and I do not ask for anything, which is not a chance for the coalition partner anyway.
A few new ideas also presents de Maizière.
They have it in part: it plans fast-track procedures for deportation and more opportunities to incarcerate people from deportation.
Refugees targeted in the country should first check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a security review.
In the case of refuges for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse than before - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to conceal their identity.
Some of it is politically and legally sensitive.
Some also do not work out and leave questions unanswered.
And on a number of points, where there is unequal treatment, the question arises: what does this actually have to do with security and terror?
Yes, de Maizière says it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror.
But it cannot be denied that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
Moreover, many people were worried about safety, given the high numbers of refugees.
And things that people deeply employed could not be left out in election campaigns.
Internal security has been very much in the spotlight.
First the attacks in the neighbourhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
There is a great deal of uncertainty.
And yes, there are election campaigns.
The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly in position on the subject of internal security.
Over the past few days, it has been high between the two parties.
Only a gardening dispute over equipping the federal police, then over a security policy collection of some Union interior ministers, in which the department chiefs also call for a burqa ban and a departure from dual citizenship.
De Maizière is also looking for conciliatory tones.
He does not think there is any departure from the double pass.
We have been satisfied with the discussion in Germany.
To reopen it does not make sense.
And in a burqa ban, he has constitutional concerns.
Whether his own package is constitutional on all corners, and whether it is actually "reasonable" for the coalition partner, has yet to show up.
There is a lot in it that could cause a dispute.
But the SPD, too, is currently trying to capitalise on the issue of internal security.
Party leader Sigmar Gabriel has signalled a cautious willingness to talk and says: "the SPD is ready to talk about anything that helps to further increase security."
