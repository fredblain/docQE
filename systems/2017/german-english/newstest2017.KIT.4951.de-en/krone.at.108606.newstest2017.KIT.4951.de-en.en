Bomb blast in Thailand - Austrians injured - multiple deaths
The Austrian embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, said the Foreign Ministry spokesman, Thomas Schnöll, Friday morning.
She suffered cutting wounds and was treated in hospital, but has already been able to leave.
Her home trip was scheduled for early September.
It is still unclear whether the further explosions on the island of Phuket and the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang NGA, Trang and Chumphon also affect Austrian citizens.
The Foreign Ministry is in constant contact with local authorities in this regard, Schnöll said.
In the approximately 200 kilometers (30 miles) south of the capital, Bangkok, Hua Hin was first seen exploding two bombs in a nightclub on Thursday night.
According to police, a Thai woman was killed and some 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
Friday morning, two explosive devices went up again, and another person was killed, according to the authorities.
Phuket also reported a bomb explosion in the morning.
A taxi driver was injured in the detonation near the Badestrands Patong, which was popular with holidaymakers.
Another bomb exploded in Surat Thani on the country's southeast coast, killing an urban employee.
The explosive device had gone into the air, according to authorities in a flower shelter in front of the site of the coastal police.
Finally, detonations in Phang NGA and Trang on the southwest coast, as well as in Chumphon, on the southeast coast, claimed several injured.
One would go from a link to the explosions in Hua Hin, it said.
"The bombings carry the same handwriting," said army general Danai Kritmethavee Friday morning before journalists.
"We assume that this is a coordinated attack."
It is too early to comment on possible motives, but it is probably the actions of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also wanted to identify a pattern in the attacks, typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
The Thai police, however, said the attacks were not related to the Islamist insurgency or with international terrorism.
"That is just local sabotage, which is restricted to limited areas and provinces," said a spokesman in Bangkok.
Rather, it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta.
Authorities would have received intelligence evidence of imminent attacks in the south of the country in the past few days - though they had not been informed of the exact timing and location.
It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.
Police instructed their officials across the country to step up security around key government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.
There are always smaller bombings in Thailand, but they are mostly not against tourists.
In Hua Hin is a palace used for years by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
After the current bomb explosions, the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends on its website to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities.
High security risk (level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla, as well as Preah Vihear and the surrounding area.
There is no need to travel to these provinces after disputes between security forces and Muslim populations.
Increased safety risk (Level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday came a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.
It also gives the military great influence in the years to come.
Junta chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs had been an attempt to create chaos as the country moves toward stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.
The military unta, which seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, is benefiting itself in bringing the kingdom back to stability and order.
However, the military has also failed to rein in the insurgency of Muslim rebels, which has been languishing in the far south of the country for years.
More than 6500 people have already been killed in the conflict.
Just under a year ago, in Bangkok, 20 people were killed in an attack on a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.
It was the bloodiest attack in the country's recent history.
