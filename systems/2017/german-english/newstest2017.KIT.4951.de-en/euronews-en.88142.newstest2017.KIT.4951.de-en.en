London schoolgirl who joined IS was killed in Syria
Kadiza sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, reportedly died in Syria.
The lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said her family learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
It was believed to have been killed by a Russian airstrike in Raqqa, the group's bulwark in the country, ITV News reported Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died shortly after she pretended to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
"One can only hope that the only good thing is - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - stopping people from ever making that decision," said Akunjee.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London climbed into a plane heading towards Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family has been told that she has married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and, within a few months, became the widow.
