Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
Leaders of Russia and Turkey met Tuesday to give up their hands and declare an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gold-plated hall of St Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most.
There was the handshake, yes.
But Putin's smile acted narrowly, and he barely radiated warmth, even for his restrained conditions.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report full five times.
I could not count it any more.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old pre-crisis levels, but will even improve.
The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had behaved as if something bad had never happened.
To me, his enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite.
But a sustainable coolness, broadcast by Putin, showed that Russia's head of state had forgotten nothing.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory remarks: the downing of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border by Turkey.
Moscow's reaction at the time was wrecked.
Putin split out and accused Ankara of having fallen behind Russia.
The offense was even greater as it was committed by an alleged friend.
Rebuilding the veto will be difficult, if not impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has changed since Nov.
For months, state-controlled media conducted a fierce, full attack on Ankara.
At one time, it seemed the Turks were to blame for everything.
Most serious were allegations by senior officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited from the illegal trade in oil in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He vehemently denied this.
But in St.Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward.
After all, that meeting took place only because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan, which he wanted to hear.
Russia was a kind of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are clear.
Erdogan primarily needs all the friends he can get after being unveiled almost by his office last month in a failed coup.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - particularly the ban on charter flights, which typically bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has fallen by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights resume.
They are counting on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.
This week, state television forecast cheaper fruit and vegetables once Turkish farm imports are allowed again.
As a report in Vedemosti put it: "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West as it considers its response to the attempted takeover as a weak response.
To this end, the ongoing resentment comes at the snail's pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - eager to take advantage of the cool mood and reduce Turkey's relationship with the West.
The Russian leader certainly won a bonus in Ankara for calling for support for the elected authorities after the attempted coup.
This is, of course, a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change.
The summit in this glamorous palace on the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey to depict, as an analyst once told me, the "alliance of outsiders": two countries that feel wronged by the West and feel badly treated and are now allied.
However, despite public reconciliation, there are still major differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave itself the role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It could be significant that after nearly three hours of initial talks, both presidents said at the press conference that they had not even jumped the issue.
Turkey's president deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin chose to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on where to find a common denominator on Syria.
But after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a complete disaster, when NATO member Turkey shot down the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state at least talk to each other again.
