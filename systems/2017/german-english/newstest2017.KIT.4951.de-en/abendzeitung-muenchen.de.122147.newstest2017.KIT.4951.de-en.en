Jennifer Aniston: I am always put in drawers
Jennifer Aniston does not always have to be perfect or successful.
That is what the Hollywood star clearly made clear in an interview now.
"I will always be plugged into drawers or glued from outside labels, which with me and reality usually have little to do with it."
"I do not have the desire to always be perfect and successful."
"To be honest, these things are rather snuff to me."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh that she is considered "miss Perfect" as she explains in the current "cosmopolitan."
After all, the actress spends her time at home, TV with loose Dutt and Mexican food, the magazine says.
To the white glut, she raises the question of the child's wish: "we women do not have to be married or have children to be perfect," according to the Hollywood star.
In her new film,"Mother's Day - Love is Not a Children's Game", Aniston is seen as a single mother of two sons.
The film runs with us from the 25th of August.
