Turkey: Kurdish community expects mass exodus
"Anyone who does not adapt and praises Erdogan sits on packed suitcases," says the chairman of the G端len-close foundation dialogue and world, Ercan Karakoyun.
In the short term, the Kurdish community of Germany expects tens of thousands of asylum-seekers to flee from Turkey to Germany.
In the medium term, it could even become "some hundreds of thousands", believes association chairman Ali Toprak.
Following the coup attempt by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan following the attempted coup, the Kurdish community is expecting a mass exodus to Germany.
"In the short term, I expect tens of thousands, in the medium term, with a few hundred thousand asylum-seekers from Turkey in Germany, if the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," says association chairman Ali Toprak of the "world" of Friday.
Because the government overran Kurdish strongholds with punitive actions months ago, 500,000 Kurds inside Turkey were on the run.
After the sworn coup, secular and opposition ethnic Turks would be added.
Many will want to start again in Europe if they continue to be oppressed in Turkey.
"It cannot be that a state that takes even refugees is producing refugees in their own country," Toprak said.
The association's leader lamented the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in ancient towns.
As a result, Erdogan wants to increase exit pressure on the remaining Kurds.
"They are the last large minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been eradicated or driven out in the last hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member.
The association chief demanded that the federal government "position itself as strongly as Austria against Erdogan and his supporters."
In Germany, too, there is a "witch hunt" against Erdogan critics.
I do not feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months.
The German branch of the G端len movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and opposition figures.
The branding as a G端len supporter destroys teachers and other academics.
"Who does not adapt and praises Erdogan, sits on packed suitcases, by the way, the Kemalists and secularists," said Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the G端len-near foundation dialogue and education, the "world".
As the newspaper reported on the basis of figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Turks, even before the coup, represented the largest group of asylum seekers recognised for political persecution in Germany.
At the date of 30 June, this was 11,386 people, representing almost 29% of the total eligible for asylum (39.625).
This survey is not based on war, poverty or lack of prospects.
According to the Basic Law, asylum is only justified politically, in other words by the state, individually persecuted.
