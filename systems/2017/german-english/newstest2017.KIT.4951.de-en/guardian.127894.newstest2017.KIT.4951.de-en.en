Destination plates: who is actually buying records?
Lonely middle-aged men love plates.
Before you rush to the commentary to sow it under the pseudonym of non-alleys with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed resurgence of records is not due to a boom in millennials who want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia.
Those who have recently bought a plate are most likely to be aged between 45 and 54.
In fact, the 18-24 age group is the most unlikely buyer group.
It is also not hordes by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers are more likely to keep their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).
But do the results of YouGov vote?
If this blog were a news report on television I would follow the camera while running in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest grey suit, wearing a modest gray suit before standing, holding my hands and saying something determinate like: "so let us take a closer look at it."
So, let us take a look at it.
Even though the heart of Sohos is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were based - there are still a handful of fantastic record stores.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, in which I am in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to gauge their age and mind through observation.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I got from Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men of middle age) into Reckless Records (data number: eight men middle age, a woman, presumably around the 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
"I appreciate already," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.
These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), dress up the walls of his living room.
The reason he owns such a significant number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and again bought items he sold when he was young and plucked.
"A lot of things I buy are from the late sixties, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12, things where I was probably a little too young to buy them," he says.
He agrees that those who buy plates are more introverted and would like to spend time alone, adding: "I do not smoke and I do not drink very much.
That is my truck.
WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many clients he meets will apply to the YouGov profile.
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media pub, people who have heard about the comeback and are looking to buy back their old records.
From the conversations I have had, people usually got rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records again," he says.
That would explain the boom to supporters of the record reviewer of a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional importance of plates?
It only takes a few seconds in a store like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a reassuring community of like-minded people.
According to WEZ, some of the older customers took advantage of the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record hulls, of objects that call for happy youth memories.
"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation," says WEZ.
That is so with me as a collector and I think it is like that with a lot of people.
It is an easy way to deal with mentally.
"We are like their social workers!" flutes an employee from a record stack.
An ICM poll in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who bought a plate last month had not heard it yet.
The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not own a record player.
At this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried while blowing through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at sounds of the Universe (data number: three men of middle age), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revival.
"Someone just came here recently and said, ' I do not have a record player, but I would love to buy a Radiohead record so I can put it on the shelf, '" he says.
This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.
More product-laser, less musical.
We have people who say,"I do not have a record player."
These are younger people, not older ones, who are slow to come out.
Fopp, who has devoted the record to almost an entire floor, has a blower audience when I rehearse.
There are couples around the 70, tourists who take photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above mentioned shops - Wild Beasts newest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz drunk from the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers.
None of them looks terribly lonely, but nagging mental trauma is hard to detect when standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been running around in the business for a few minutes and considers the variety of the plates for sale.
It is more of a showcase than a big purchase.
She does not deserve much, so collecting plates is not a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It is easy to hear music from a computer or other way, but the beauty of plates is... " she drives off with a loving sigh.
I do not know how to explain it - it is really unique.
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.
While I seem to be giving the jeans hotpants to patterns, I watch a group of young teenagers who group up for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter consider buying a Crosley record player.
To the left is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection.
Nobody sees them - perhaps because they are merely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.
It is pure "record art."
But given that any attraction for these items means more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain about.
It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends most on luxury items like plates.
Even though my research revealed that YouGov's results are true, they, at least in record stores in Soho, do not take into account the large number of female collectors and record lovers who exist in reality, record shops and in online forums.
These people probably work hard at school or in offices.
They certainly do not spend their Thursday morning strolling through record-setting shops of Berwick Street and leaves through plates as they mimic the startling look of an uncanny, 30-year-old false presenter who rises over the shoulders of nothing middle-aged men.
