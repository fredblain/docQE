The soprano Anna Netrebko goes openly with the autism of her son Tiago - and turns to other concerned parents: "you have to have the courage to talk about it."
"The medicine has made great progress," said the 44-year-old Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.
When the disease was detected in her son, she believed she had to die.
The eight-year-old Tiago, however, was well ahead and now learning privately in New York, where there are the best therapists.
"To give an example: if I ask him something, which is two years back when I sang at the Milan Scala, he remembers nothing," said Netrebko.
But he is the happiest person on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebko's connection with Bassbariton Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to the tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
