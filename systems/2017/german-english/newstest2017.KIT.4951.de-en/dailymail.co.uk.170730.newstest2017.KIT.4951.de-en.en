Shoppers in Primark outrage over woman who tried shamelessly underwear amid business
The buyers did not know where to look when a woman pulled out her clothes in the middle of a primark to try underhoses.
To aggravate the situation, she mustered how she looked, pulled her out and put her back on the shelf.
She stumbled further and tried four pairs of underhoses in a shop at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone.

A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear,"she grabbed her again and left the store without buying anything."
She said: "people could not believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the sales floor, she took a pair of underhoses out of the exposition, pulled her own tights and trousers and tried them.
"She did not even try to find a slightly more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, cheeky like Oskar."
"Everybody stared when she pulled out the underhoses that obviously did not like her as she put her back on the shelf."
She repeated the same thing with three other underdogs before she finally decided that she liked nothing, moved back and forth.
"She did not seem to bother that she was watching someone - or thinking about the person who might be buying the underhoses she had tried."
Ms Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: "how disgusting to think that someone would take shelter with someone who had a different person and who was not washed."
The incident occurred Tuesday afternoon.
Ms Davidson added: "as I have been told, the staff have tried to pull the garments out of the sale after it went - which is just as good."
"I would hate to go home with a new pair of underhoses and find out that another woman had them and pulled out again and they did not wash."
A Primark spokesman said: "Primark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday, August 9 at our store in Folkstone."
All eligible products were pulled out of the sale.
