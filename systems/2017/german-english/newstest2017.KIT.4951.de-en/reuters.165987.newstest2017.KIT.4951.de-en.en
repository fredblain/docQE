Condoms with Chilipuder, fireworks promote Tanzanian elephant protection
Nature conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to stop elephants from going into settlements inhabited by humans - they throw condoms at them filled with chilipuder.
The method has proven to be effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea to do so years ago, has intensified its promotion by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a nonviolent four-step method to protect their homes and crops without injuring animals.
Previously, many spears used to defend themselves.
Friday is world telephone day dedicated to animal welfare.
"Since we developed the... toolkit, we have been able to observe a change in attitude within these communities, making them much more confident that they can keep the elephants from their fields without harming the elephant," said Honeyguide's managing director Damian Bell in a statement.
The first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a torch and the blistering into a horn.
If he is not deterred, a so-called "Chiliwolke" will be thrown.
Chilipuder mixed with earth is packed together with a fireworks body into a condom, the end of which is turned down to the ignition.
When it is ignited, the condom bursts with a bang and sprints fine dust to Chilipuder into the air.
A whiff quite usually already out to chase the elephant.
One last possibility is an advertiser that shoots a golfing fireworks into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
