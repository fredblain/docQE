Rain instead of star snuff: hope for weather improvement
The weather caused a stroke in southwest Germany on Friday night, but there is still hope.
The night was ill-suited for clouds and rain to watch the celestial spectacle, said the chairman of Sternwarte Welzheim, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.
Our hope lies on the night of Saturday.
The weather is supposed to be good, then we certainly see a lot of star snuff in the sky.
The stars are Perseids, which, at 216000 kilometers per hour, are among the fastest stars.
They have their name because they seem to come from the constellation of Perseus, which goes up in the northeast.
