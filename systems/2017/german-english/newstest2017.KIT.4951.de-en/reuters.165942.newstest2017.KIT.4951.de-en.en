Gilead receives legal costs from hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A US judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbursement of the legal costs it incurred from the Hepatits C litigation with pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was freed from a $200 million compensation payment for violating two patents of Merck and Harvoni of Gilead, after a U.S. judge discovered a pattern of misconduct by Mercks, including the Meineides and other unethical acts.
In elevating the lawsuit filed Thursday, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead is entitled to enactment of the charges incurred during the defense of the case.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck complained to each other and took ownership of laboratory work involving Sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead's medications.
