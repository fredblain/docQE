A controversial baseball star emerges
The tears ran faster at Alex Rodriguez than the U.S. baseball star in best days from Base to Base.
After his emotional resignation announcement, the 41-year-old professional will wear the jersey of his New York Yankees on August 12 against the Tampa Bay rays.
"I love this game and this team."
"I say ' Goodbye ' to both," explained the 14-time all-star game participant of Major League baseball (MLB).
Rodriguez was voted the league's most valuable player three times, in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees.
His signature under a ten-year contract awarded him $27 million annually since 2007.
Until the end of the contract on December 31, 2017, he will serve as a consultant and youth coach - on full salary.
As a player, it paid Rodriguez back with performance for a long time.
With 696 homers, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("runs") for the Seattle mariners (1994-2000), the Texas Rangers (2001-2004) and the Yankees since 2005, he made some milestones.
With Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie mays, only two other baseball players have similar values in the most important statistics.
But in baseball's glory hall, the 41-year-old is not likely to be included.
Because so successful Rodriguez - nicknamed "A-Rod" - was on the field, so controversial is his appearance outside the square.
As early as 2009, the superstar at "ESPN" admitted to having taken banned steroids between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, it was closed for 211 lots due to involvement in the so-called Biogenesis scandal by the end of 2014.
Rodriguez is considered the prime suspect, for years, to have received performance-enhancing funds through an anti-aging clinic in South Florida.
After a legal battle, the lock was reduced to 162 encounters.
"The league might even have done me a favor for the year 2014, because I have been through 20 years without a break," Rodriguez told reporters at the time.
Even his farewell days do not go straight.
While many baseball legends get the big stage again in their last games, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench.
"My job does not include a farewell tour."
"My job involves trying to win every game," Yankees coach Joe Girardi said.
After all, Rodriguez, who was married to actress Cameron Diaz and echoed relations with pop star Madonna and actress Kate Hudson, expressed sympathy for fans from the Yankee archrival Boston Red SOx.
"We want A-Rod," sang the supporters at the 4: 9 defeat against the Rodriguez team.
