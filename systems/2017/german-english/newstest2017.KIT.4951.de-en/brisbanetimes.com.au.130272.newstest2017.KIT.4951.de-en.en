Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worth
It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.
The fact that teenagers and children do not go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time on screens, has been lamented by many over the last decade.
Pokemon Go is about getting people off the sofa and getting more active.
The time on screen was initially confined to the TV, then to video games and, most recently, to smartphones.
It is therefore great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.
I am referring, of course, to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters created initially for the video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).
Like many phenomena of pop culture, interest decreased before the release of the game in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The market launch in other countries was delayed by the massive demand that the servers overloaded.
Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, players with their smartphones go out and look for Pokémons, which is tracked with a GPS and, once found, can be "photographed" (via a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "captured".
A generation that played the game when she was younger joined the madness and jumped for the search from the sofa.
In the US, the game led to a significant increase in steps that put the "average" person back every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, told the Washington Post recently that within two days of the game's launch, the number of folks who train for 30 minutes each day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data to improve performance.
Many public health education campaigns that want to get people to "take 30 minutes of time to come" "from the sofa" and "to be active every day" came on deaf ears because many public messages to health are boring and come from people who look elder.
However, the importance of sport cannot be overstated.
Whoever drives sports regularly reduces his chances of suffering from cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.
Some people even find new friendships on the hunt.
As always, there are also mammoth gamblers who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could run against a door.
What is to be done?
There has been a breakthrough.
Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to play sports as this game does.
The new will lose its charm and the use will ease with time.
However, because of Pokemon's success, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with the real world, helping many people in the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.
