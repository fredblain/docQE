How to protect yourself with krav Maga from gun attacks
The world out there is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a bit safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a grandmaster of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance.
Regardless of whether you are approaching you from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the tables for your robber.
If you approach you from behind, you should first turn around so you can see your attacker and "get out of the firing line," Mizrachi says.
Then take the gun between your suburb and your shoulder before you hit him in the face with your free elbow.
Then beat him with his knee in the bar and twist, while the attacker crumbles in pain, hands the gun out of his hands, beat him with the run and move backwards while they turn the gun on him.
With attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the firing line, seize the gun and twist it, so the attacker can 't shoot.
At the same time, shift the weight to the gun and beat the attacker to the chest, then twist the gun out of his grip before moving backwards and put the gun on it.
Does it sound difficult?
Watch the video to see exactly how it prefers Mizrachi.
But remember that, in a robbery, it is safest to hand over your money - unless you are a krav Maga grandmaster.
