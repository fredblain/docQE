Berlin/Schwerin: poll ahead of country elections: SPD and CDU lose
In the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (September 4) and Berlin (18 September), there are significant losses for the government parties SPD and CDU.
This resulted in representative surveys of opinion research institute INSA for the "Bild" newspaper (Friday).
While the red-black ruling coalition in the north could continue to govern narrowly, this is not possible, according to the survey figures in Berlin.
In both states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would have a good chance of continuing to put the head of the government.
In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, the SPD plunged from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
The party, according to the poll, was only slightly ahead of the CDU, which could come back to 23 percent.
The third place is controversial between the left and the AfD.
The left would be 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented with 19 percent for the first time in the country Friday.
The Greens, despite slight losses with 6 percent (previously 8.7 percent), were returning to the Schweriner Landtag.
NPD and FDP would not be represented in the Landtag with 3 percent each.
For the Berlin Chamber of Deputies, the SPD would be only 23% (2011: 28.3%).
The CDU reached only 18 percent, after 23.4 percent.
They would still be behind the Greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but before the left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented in the Chamber of Deputies for the first time, with 14%.
With 5%, the FDP could hope to return, but the pirates would miss the move, unlike in 2011.
