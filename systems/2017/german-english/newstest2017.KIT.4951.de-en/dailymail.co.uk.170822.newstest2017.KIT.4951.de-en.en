Asocial family destroys pre-delocation social housing in Saltash, Cornwall
An asocial family left their social housing after a deluge with damage of £ 50,000 because it had terrorised their neighbours.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown out after a long list of complaints from their estate in Saltash, Cornwall.
After being forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an irreparable state.
The walls had gaping holes, wooden diapers were ripped up, rubbish was scattered on the floor and graffiti was tasted to the walls.
The family have been resettled and it is thought she now lives in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for home administration at Cornwall Housing, said she feared the apartment was no longer to be repaired.
She said: "it has been an absolute nightmare for people here and I am of the view that people do not have to live this way.
There are many things to consider, as this property is likely to be considered as not so beautiful part of Cornwall.
The family is notorious and their reputation is also.
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime, and police said the terror that the family had inflicted had included street battles with baseball sleepers, intimidating residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive cries, strife and flukes.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, got an arrangement for anti-social behavior in June.
In some rooms of the house that may be demolished, old garbage was found
In the property in which drugs were traded in the past, the wooden diapers were ripped up
Neighbors said they saw them fighting on the street and regularly called the police
Cornwall Housing deluded her and her partner this week violently from the estate after giving them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to voluntarily pull out.
The delogization was cheered by relieved neighbors who said their lives were made to hell.
One said: "they did not care about anybody."
We lived for 20 years next to them and it was always bad.
The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.
"This morning we could not sleep."
We stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it!
Now where they are finally gone, it will be nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said the family had failed to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house, to which the police were called at regular intervals, for 20 years
Rubbish and old toys were dumped on the overgrown side of the townhouse
He added: "it is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and that of their family, as a delusion is always the last step that Cornwall Housing is considering.
This was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be horrible for their neighbours.
I appreciate all the work that has been done by my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and who have provided us with the information.
I hope that this development will give some comfort to some neighbours and conveys the message that anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated.
FITZPATRICK said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress left in one of the house's bedrooms after dehydration on the floor
Home management workers will now have to clean up rubbish mountains that surround the house
In 2014, the police carried out a raid in the house and found over 70g of cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash of £ 1,700.
Skeldon received a fine after she pleaded guilty to possession of a class B drug in trading terms.
She claimed the money was for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After they were without shelter, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner now live in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many room walls of the house were smeared with graffiti.
Police say they will delve tenants who do not adhere to house order
Angela Crow of the Devon and Cornwall Police said that the delotion was a clear warning to the other tenants who do not abide by the house order.
"This goes to those who think they can behave without self-accusation, as well as to those who have been harmed by such behavior," she said.
The Devon and Cornwall Police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
