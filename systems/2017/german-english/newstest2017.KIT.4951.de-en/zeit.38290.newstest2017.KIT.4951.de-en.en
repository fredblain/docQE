Old buildings, some Lindenbäumchen, interspersed with the rest of the cobblestones: the Rigaer Strasse in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not look like this at first sight, but the police are one of the "dangerous places" of the city.
Walk down the road from east to west, passing on playgrounds, a freshly coated kindergarten and a biolad.
To the facade of a grey house someone has sprayed "ugly!"
Compared to a Lidl, which is soon to be demolished, it is already being built: by 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments will be created.
Articles about this "trendy district", as the real estate company Friedrichshain called it, are, however, preferred in recent weeks with burning cars.
The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, now the residents have rental contracts, but on the ground floor are still occupied spaces and are used for events.
Especially the Berlin interior senator Henkel had argued several times since the beginning of the year for tough police action against the project, describing the area as a "no-go zone" for police officers and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.
After being cleared on June 22, the rooms on the ground floor, the cadtery crews, with 300 police officers, patrolled the police for three weeks, with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on the ground, blocked parts of the road and kept visitors from entering the house with the number 94.
Meanwhile, construction workers renovated the premises on behalf of the unknown homeowners.
On July 13, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the evacuation had been illegal, and a day later, police and construction workers withdrew amid the jubilation of sympathizers and residents.
On this summer afternoon, the road is peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the pavement in front of the houses in the sun, others entertain Späti.
In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens.
Left-wing violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in the Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who has three children here, are mainly generated by the police presence.
With residents of the home projects, they share the concern about rising rents and gentrification.
It does not sound like a Kiez, who mostly wanted police protection against vandalising leftists.
The ditch of the Berlin interior senator and the police between house occupants and their neighbours does not seem to exist.
Friedrichshain, in the east of Berlin, was actually a traditional working-class district, which today also has a low average income and high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city.
Home occupation and the resulting residential projects have long been part of the Kiez: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost all of Mainz Street near the rig.
While the Mainzer had been cleared under great police escort in a veritable street battle, many of the projects in the Rigaer were legalized and are still inhabited by the people who occupied them 26 years ago.
At the same time, in recent years, the district has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and polling liners from all over the world.
That is also evident in the rents, which have risen by nearly 60 percent since 2009 in new rentals.
Many of the new constructions in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: you can recognize them on wrapped slices or freshly coated facades that have been tossed with color bags.
No other street has been mentioned so often this year along with the words "left-wing violence".
One reason that not all neighbors see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as bodily injury are, according to statistics, almost exclusively against police officers.
Most of the crimes are causing material damage, which tends to hit new buildings and newly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived for 17 years in a rental house next to the controversial 94, there can be no talk of insecurity.
As far as violence is concerned, it is appeasement: the people in the 94 are their neighbours, who are certainly not.
Even the famous burning cars no longer exist directly in the Rigaer.
For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "here you help each other, live together on the street and get more from each other than elsewhere".
Neugebauer is deliberately drawn into the Rigaer street - and stayed.
That is why it was so important for the residents to get their street back: the police, the politics and the media, all of whom suddenly claimed the sovereignty over the district in July.
But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: by faceless new buildings in former construction gaps that crowd out the old inhabitants.
"These are, after all, condominiums that are not interesting to many here - they are more likely to be people who are not so good," she says.
"I absolutely do not approve of violence and destruction."
But what should you do if someone never listens?
There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the inhabitants.
Kerstin Neugebauer, who is annoyed by color bombs, has little understanding: the house projects and the left scene belonged to Kiez.
Anyone who moves should be aware of this - just as someone who moves into a pub district can complain about noise there.
