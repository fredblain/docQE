Greenland shark: the oldest vertebrate is nearly 400 years old
Rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually only come to the surface in winter.
This shark was allowed back into the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel Sanna.
He was born in 1624 and swims with well a 1 km/h through the North Atlantic - to this day.
Greenland sharks only get young people with 150 years of age.
The Greenland shark boils down at the bottom of the North Atlantic, and in an hour, on average, it is just 1,220 metres far.
Only when it arrives, the five-metre long animal speeds up to a saturated 2.6 km/h - and is half as fast with this maximum speed as a seal.
This lonely lifestyle, however, seems to be a patent recipe for a high age.
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "science", in any case, from a Greenland shark that could be 392 years old.
"Madness," said Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute of demographic research in Rostock, this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates.
Of course, the evolutionary biologist has long suspected that Greenland sharks will be staged.
Just lacked the evidence.
Greenland sharks are hard to observe, after all they live in the ice sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they tend to dip on the surface only in winter.
Researchers know little about the lifestyle of the Greenland sharks.
They were at a time when they had six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitsbergen.
Looters do this sharks anyway: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jaw of a young polar bear.
They may hunt down sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice sea and look for carcasses that tore down from higher water layers.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now studied 28 Greenland sharks, which caught fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spitsbergen as a by-catch from the depths of the North Atlantic.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 centimeter measured.
To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lineage of the sharks using the carbon 14 method.
This center of the eye lens is created even before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it are not renewed later.
The two smallest sharks had striking a lot of carbon-14 in the linescore.
Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960 ' s, when nuclear weapons tests brought greater quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
On the other hand, in the 220 centimetres of the third smallest animal, the nucleus contained a small surplus of carbon 14 from the nuclear weapons tests, so it should have celebrated its 50th birthday during its investigation in 2012.
In contrast, all the larger Greenland sharks had normal carbon-14 volumes in their lineage, resulting from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon 14-watch for a 493 centimeter long Greenland shark showed an age of 335, while the record shark with 502 centimeters is likely to be 392 years old.
The fact that Greenland females only get young people when they are longer than four metres was well known.
Now the researchers of the length have been able to assign an age.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres was probably on the brink of sexual maturity and their age was determined at 156 years of age, Greenland sharks are apparently allowed at least one and a half centuries.
This, too, is likely to be the world record for vertebrates.
It is no coincidence that such methusaleme is mainly living in icy waters.
Also, the previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale, in whose bacon at the neck was a 120-year-old harpoon tip, was caught before Alaska.
The low temperatures often include the organism of the animals living there.
So they mature later - and aging more slowly.
In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are often particularly large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat.
The heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much greater than with a gram of elephant.
Another advantage: they have fewer enemies.
"So a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many offspring as possible as early as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.
A very large animal, on the other hand, should invest its resources in a long life.
