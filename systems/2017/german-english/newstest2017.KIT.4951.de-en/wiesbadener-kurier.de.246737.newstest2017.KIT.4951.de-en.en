One for all cases
Honda HR-V is flexible and everyday
In the small HR-V, Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coup√© and also the versatility of a minivans.
Sounds pretty overloaded, but the HR-V, constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, turns out to be very flexible in everyday life.
Although only 1.60 m high HR-V looks small, the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear, it does not work at any point.
The materials of the interior are well processed and have a pleasant effect, only the cockpit upper side is there.
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles.
There is not only a trunk of 453 litres at high and 1026 litres, but there are the "Magic Seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: the rear seats of the rear seat can be folded up like cinemas and thus offer storage space, which is 1.24 metres high from the floor to the ceiling.
The trunk can be loaded well, but the load height of 650 mm is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1.6-l diesel with 88 kW/120 horsepower accelerates the HR V thanks to torque of up to 300 nm in wide speed ranges.
However, he is likely to do his job somewhat quieter.
The daily consumption of 4.7 l/100 km is pleasing.
There is another motorization: a 1.5-lb petrol tank with 96 kW/130 horsepower.
An all-wheel drive is not offered.
Driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamism and comfort.
But steering is likely to be a little more direct.
The equipment in the tested top variant "Executive" leaves nothing to be desired.
The security systems include the City emergency brake assistant (works up to speed 32), the collision warning system and the gauge assistant.
The collision warner sometimes irritates, because he evaluates many obstacles as "approaching objects".
The remote light assistant works very reliably.
And the intelligent temporegler responds to the traffic sign detection and drops speed when needed.
The full connectivity is available only for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, Navi, app integration and more.
Two USB and one HDMI connectors are under the armrest and are therefore somewhat difficult to reach.
The approximately 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are in order.
Those who do not want to invest so much will receive the petrol from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23000 euros.
The engines meet the Euro 6 emissions standard.
With the HR-V Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
