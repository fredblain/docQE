Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson fired after he beat producers
Gibson was involved in a physical battle on the set of the series in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced their dismissal in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized publicly on Thursday before announcing his dismissal.
On the set, there were artistic differences and a difference of opinion.
I regret the incident," he said in a statement.
Details of how Gibson's character from the series, which follows a team of FBI agents, will be released, according to the opinion of the ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, likely to be released at a later date.
The 54-year-old, who previously played in the sitcom dharma & Greg, has been with it since the first season of the series in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have plugged my whole cardiac arrest for the last 12 years," Gibson said in a message released Friday.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but that will not be possible now.
I would just like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and, above all, the best fans you can only wish for a series.
The planned broadcast of the twelfth season is scheduled for 28 September.
