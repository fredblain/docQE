Police: 3 victims in serial murder case at music hearing in car shot
According to police reports released Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot dead in one of the deadliest attacks in a decade in Phoenix's first serial murder case while they were staying in the car and listening to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis's daughter Maleah were shot dead June 12 while the car was parked in an entrance, authorities said.
The perpetrator fired eight shots from a handgun while he was on the front passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, the report said.
Police said that the triple murder did not seem to have been the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2.900 that was owned by one of the adult victims.
Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard's police spokesman said the shooting caused investigators to take a closer look at whether it was linked to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people were killed and two others injured, mostly in Hispanic residential areas within four months.
"It is happening in a residential neighborhood in front of a house," said Howard of the KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, earlier this month.
It is believed the suspect used several vehicles, including a brown Nissans from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators refused to reveal the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized because of her injuries and died later.
Liner, 31, and Ellis's daughter Maleah still died on the spot.
A witness told police that it was not unusual for her to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
Authorities also released a police report on the shooting, which was aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and is believed to have been the work of the serial killer.
Investigators found cartridges and secured a bullet from the seat as well as bullet fragments from the engine room.
