Treats wants Nacktkalendar for "women and for men"
The Treats magazine is working with photographer David Bellemere to bring out a 1970s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they would like to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muses Calendar for 2017.
Treats editor-in-chief Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude magazine differs from Oldschool-Playboys because "Playboy is for men."
I am doing this for women.
He seems to believe that it does the calendar.
"We need to return to the depiction of timeless and classical nudity, in which both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body," Shaw said in a press release on the release of the calendars.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit their pictures online or in person at open casting calls in Los Angeles and New York.
