Traveler Ian Wright slams for a travel guide his tongue at Europe's dirtiest places
A British traveller underwent his immune system and WÃ¼rgereflex of a serious examination - leaving some of the dirtiest and most eclectic places in Europe.
The presenter and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shouted his course on a euro note, a railing at the Piccadilly Circus, a sprinkling of a train toilet as well as a public phone in Russia to demonstrate the resilience of his immune system.
Before leaving each object, he used a luminometer to show up and show us what he is going to get into.
But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results to light.
The idea of leaking the wrinkles of a train toilette, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
On his trip through Europe, Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health.
Fortunately, nothing left him, more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.
Mr Wright became known for testing the resilience of his intestine by traveling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
From public purses at stations to spot-buttons of toilets, the task put his immune system definitively under a sample
In the film, he told reporters: "as a child, I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."
In the film, he lived up to his reputation in any case.
The only thing he opposed was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His trial stroke showed a luminous number of over 4000 units.
In comparison, the luminous number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to lick after their luminous number was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands one of less than 60
Mr Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom.
In the film, he says,"that comes close to the worst I have got in a toilet."
There is nothing more dirty than that!
I am not going to spot anything here because it is ecclesiastical here.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.
The company equips Mr Wright with Valio's freezer, which includes both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
Valios senior Venice president for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.
We led crazy brainstormings that ended that we said "Let us call Ian."
They claim that the interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a wider context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and, with the documentary, we have been able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.
I also think the movie shows we have a great sense of humour!
Tom HAKALA, who led the film's directing, added: "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had leaked some of the things I have instructed him to lick, like the eclectic Russian toilet shown in the film."
Of course there were things where it was easier to get Ian to lick them and others where this was quite difficult.
I am glad we have taken some of these dirty treats on film. "
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of all respondents surveyed milk-acid bacteria in particular, with the well-being of stomach and intestine, and 58 percent said they at least occasionally use products containing attached lactic acid bacteria.
