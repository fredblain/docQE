Intercultural journey: cultural offers for schools
The international class of the forest school attended the play "The invisible House".
The association Nima's and the boy theater are now planning a music project.
The association Nima's enables young people with migration and refugee backgrounds to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "class International" of the Waldschule Kinderhaus has visited an idea of the award-winning piece "The invisible house" of the boy Theatre Münster.
In the context of the "Intercultural journey" initiated by the association Nima's, 19 students between the ages of 11 and 15 attended the staging in the small house.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which aims at the cultural integration of young people with migrant and refugee backgrounds, offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster within the framework of this project.
Most of the young people in the class had come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016, including Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria, and spoke little German.
Thanks to the choreography, the scenic images and video animations, they were able to follow the course of action, according to the press release of the boy Theatre Münster.
The association Nima's, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg of Sprakel, and the Young Theater will work together in the upcoming season as part of a musical theater project.
From October to December, young people between the ages of 14 and 20 will be given the opportunity to attend professional courses in the fields of singing, dance, spectacle and music.
Offers for children and families in the area of theatre play and theatrical language placement are in the planning.
The project "Intercultural journey" continues.
Given the increased number of refugees, the association expects many classes to participate.
