Better flow of traffic on the motorway
It regularly blew up on the bypass - here's a picture of Nov.
But this is about to change: the legal trajectory is to be extended.
This is good news for all car drivers who are standing in the traffic on the ambient road every evening when travelling via the motorway (A 43).
Road construction is extended next Tuesday and Wednesday (16/17 August) in the area between Hammer Straße and the exit Weseler Straße.
Motorists can then walk directly from the hammer road to the right.
The great advantage: the traffic divides at an early stage, improving the overall flow on the very busy section of the Bundesstraße 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district agency of Münster-West.
The road narrowing on the accessory nerves motorists, especially between 5 and 19 pm.
On weekdays, the backlog extends to the bridge over the Albersloher route and sometimes beyond.
The reason is the bottleneck on the B 51 just before the departure of Weseler Straße.
From here, traffic will only be channelled across the motorway bridge.
The second track had to be rebuilt well over three years ago.
The reason: static calculations have shown that the bridge no longer has the required capacity to capture, in particular, heavy goods traffic.
It is not possible to say how long this bottleneck and the associated daily traffic jam will continue.
However, for years to come, the bridge has an official residual use up to 2034.
For the extension of the legal trajectory, the national company has consciously chosen the weaker time in the school holidays because of the risk of disability.
Traffic will pass through the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday.
