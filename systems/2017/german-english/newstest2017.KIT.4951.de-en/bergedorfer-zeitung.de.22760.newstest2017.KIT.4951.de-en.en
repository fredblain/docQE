Seriously injured - man stabbed to his ex-girlfriend
A man has attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and seriously injured.
As police said yesterday, the 50-year-old had been given the key to the apartment to pick up his personal things.
Instead, the alcohol-fueled offense cut his ex-girlfriend's clothes.
When she came into the apartment, he stayed on it twice.
The 44-year-old was injured in the hand and on the body.
The police could arrest the perpetrator.
While the 50-year-old destroyed his ex-girlfriend's clothes, he called his mother.
She then alerted his sister.
Together with her partner, the 45-year-old wanted to reassure her brother.
She could not get him to leave the apartment, though.
That is why she went out of the house with her partner.
On the street, they met the man's ex-life companion.
When the two women entered the apartment again, the 50-year-old stabbed his sister to the side and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
