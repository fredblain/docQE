City Council decides unanimously: no Kioskneubau at St. Goarer Rheinufer
Normally, the merchants ' St. Goarer's investment projects with Kusshand – in particular the retail sector in the core city – are clearly expanding.
However, the City Council now unanimously rejected the request for the construction of a sales kiosk on the Rhine shore in the immediate vicinity of the Rheinbalkons under construction.
"Basically we welcome new traders, but at this location in exposed location on the Rhine river, this kiosk does not fit in," said Michael Hubrath for the CDU faction.
