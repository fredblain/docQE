Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania: "go where it hurts"
Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals do not get anything from the summer election campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country day.
In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, they understood.
In 2021, the election will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays, and the Schweriner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
Because blighter than it has been so far, it is not: summer vacation, heat and land election campaign - that bites.
The locals, who are to be persuaded by the pollsters, are on vacation.
The vast majority of holidaymakers travelling in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so they are not allowed to choose the country day.
In addition to this, there are practical problems: during the holidays, helpers hanging up posters, blowing up balloons, distributing flyers and counting votes at the end of the day are difficult to find.
Until September 4, 2016, the last day of the election, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania has yet to campaign.
The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.
And it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD/CDU coalition, must fear for his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls.
Exciting is how much novice AfD cuts off and what is left coalition dust.
Sellering, 66 years old and has been head of government since 2008, is making an almost unobtrusive campaign, seen by his granddaughters.
He travels through the country, distributes roses and chats a little with the people, just as his legendary predecessor, Harald Ringstorff, did.
Otherwise, Seelering has got cold feet and is blaming Chancellor Merkel on the inheritance of the AfD.
Her refugee policy, her "We create that" has accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists, which is likely to cost him the nice job now.
The CDU, with its top candidate, the Home Secretary Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it is like to campaign at the wrong time in the right place.
She has invited twice chancellor Angela Merkel to major rallies; Merkel's federal election circle is in the northeast.
But the target group did not vote, it was more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony than Mecklenburger and Vorpommern.
"There was probably the majority from other states," said Vincent Kokert, general secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently in the NDR.
But it is also a pity to anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel.
Otherwise, the Northeast CDU largely abandons the usual campaign stalls on marketplaces and in front of shopping centers with umbrellas and air balloons.
That, Kokert says, is just playing a "minor role."
The Union, too, has noticed that it is basing itself on the land, that it has to make an effort to find a wire to the people.
It is like the left, the SPD, the Greens: there is little in the way of the country.
However, the CDU campaigner Kokert's advice to his fellow activists is also self-defeating: "you have to go where it hurts, that is where the people are: Dorffeste, golden weddings, every birthday party must be used".
Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called his SPD for a particularly dedicated campaign.
In surveys, the Social Democrats were last with 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just before the AfD (19).
In the 2011 election, the SPD had still clearly won 35.6 percent ahead of the CDU (22).
The Greens, small party with seven percent in the polls, are likely to make the leap into the country day.
They make a modern virtue out of holiday hardship and largely put their campaign on the Internet.
"Online campaigning", it calls the country's president Claudia Müller.
Otherwise, green campaigners are embarking on track searches for local voters among holidaymakers.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, winds straight up with a houseboat through the mecklenburgic lakes and still finds it beautiful.
Her impression: "election holiday in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania is not a punishment".
