Donald Trump election campaign indicted after staff allegedly pulled gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign has been indicted for alleged inaction after she was told that her campaign manager for North Carolina turned a firearm to an employee in February while traveling in a jeep in February.
The incident is described in an indictment filed Wednesday in the District Court of Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in that state.
Bordini admitted for months that the matter would be settled internally before realising that "that would not happen."
The campaign manager, Earl Philip,"drew a pistol, put his right index finger on the deduction, and rammed the run in Vincents Kniekehle," gave Bordini in his indictment.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign manager, Bordini noted that at least four other people had already made the same experience with Phillip, he admitted in the indictment.
"Guns do not have to be fired to cause damage," admitted Bordini.
The indictment comes just two days after the Republican presidential nominee sparked an uproar when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the "second Amendment people" - firearms owners and gun lovers - should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton is elected and judges should appoint.
Trump's campaign made it clear that the media had taken his words out of context and that he would not incite violence.
Bordini's complaint calls for damages from the campaign for due diligence and Philip for bodily injury and sustained psychological damage.
Trump's press secretary, Hope Hicks, was unable to reach an opinion.
Attempts to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local news station in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer employees of the campaign.
Calls at his consulting company, Innovative Consulting Services, did not respond.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has so far held a controversial campaign.
The trial is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
