Volkswagen is still getting through.
Despite diesel scandals, delivery figures rise worldwide
But not all markets are running around.
In the case of recall, there is a term.
Volkswagen will start deliveries in the second half of the year.
Despite diesel affidavits, Europe's largest car manufacturer has continued to show a plus in the past year, thanks to its many brands and some well-run markets.
However, in July, the core brand VW weakened, especially in Western Europe, and thereby reaped the total sales, as notified by the company in the Dax.
Worldwide, the VW brand sold in July with 449100 cars 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous month.
In Western Europe alone, after China the second most important market, sales were up 14 percent below the previous month.
In Germany's home market, deliveries rose by almost one-sixth.
Brand sales chief JÃ¼rgen Stackmann led the weaker figures from July mainly to two sales days less in Europe.
In addition, there has been a buying back in some core markets through "changing economic conditions".
In addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey, the British voted to leave the EU, a spokeswoman said.
In the US, where the exhaust affair escalated first, a minus is also on the way.
Great support for VW is the Chinese market.
Overall, the mainly affected domestic brand of Lower Saxony is still gagged by the diesel scandal: after the first seven months, it is only an extradition minus 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles.
Group sales chief Fred Kappler continued to show a sales stream from January to July.
1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen in that time, worldwide 5.904 million.
Volkswagen had tampered with a software exhaust test.
In Germany alone, VW is calling around 2.5 million cars for conversion to the workshops.
In the course of the conversion, VW confirmed that the conversion of cars has no negative impact.
After the conversion of the vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power.
The car manufacturer provides the customer with a "guaranteed" certificate after the conversion, but I am not talking about a "guarantee", as was stated in the company circles on Friday.
The reason for this is legal niceties.
The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen now guarantees its German customers a guarantee for converted diesel models.
This would have confirmed VW representatives in the Federal Transport Ministry last Monday.
The Ministry of Transport confirmed that there was this meeting.
"VW must fully comply with the conditions of my commission of inquiry and the KBA."
"Deviations from them will not be accepted," said Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), according to the ministry.
VW has taken over the guarantee that there will be no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power after the conversion and that all type-approval relevant vehicle values remain unchanged.
Volkswagen itself uses the term "guarantee" but not, as it was said in corporate circles.
With the broad term "guarantee", Volkswagen sees the possibility that, for example, customers will be able to come back to the new software half a year after conversion - and this could return to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
It is also important, in the interests of the customer, to avoid the possibility that any other damage that has nothing to do with the Abgassal scandal will lead to uncertainty regarding possible warranty arrangements, as has been said.
That is why VW does not use the term ' guarantee '.
