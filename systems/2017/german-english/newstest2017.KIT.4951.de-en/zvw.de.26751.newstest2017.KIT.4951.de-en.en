Schorndorf: burglars sought by helicopter
The police helicopter flew various areas for about an hour - unsuccessfully.
Two unknown men intruded violently into an apartment at 8.50 a.m. on Friday morning in a multi-family house in the Lindenweg.
The resident surprised the two and struck the unholed in the escape.
The two men were about 1.65 to 1.70 meters tall, probably masked, wore both bluejeans and black capuzenpullis.
They flew in the direction of downtown.
To the search, police deployed several strip crews as well as a police helicopter.
The search was carried out without success.
Perhaps the unknowns fell close to the apartment or in their escape.
