Trade between Russia & Iran suddenly rises to 71% - RT Business
With the lifting of sanctions, according to the Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 percent year-on-year.
Since international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, interest on the part of Russian companies in shops in the country has grown sharply, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are taking on existing links with Iran, while new firms are willing to gain access to the market.
Of course, the further trade expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," said Dzhagaryan.
He noted that trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent in the first five months of the year 2016 compared with the same period in 2015, and was $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports into Iran jumped by 91.5 percent and totaled $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose 16 percent to $158 million.
The trade recovery has been achieved by supplies of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," said the ambassador.
Dzhagaryan is out for this year from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia.
Last year, Russian expatriate representatives issued some 35,000 visas, primarily travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
Iran also reached the top 20 of the countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia.
You could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia from last year, will be broken," he said.
At the same time, only relatively few Russians visit Iran, something the ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally can recommend the visit of the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have preserved the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
