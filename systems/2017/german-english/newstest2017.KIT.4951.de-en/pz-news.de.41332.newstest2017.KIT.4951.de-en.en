Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
So, in competition with Paris, Dublin, and Luxembourg, the city of Main has the best chance of attracting jobs and firms relocating from London.
"It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit vote," says Michael Voigtländer, head of the IW's financial markets and real estate markets.
After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether money houses can continue to run from London to financial transactions across the EU.
For the so-called EU passport, they have been granted authorisation in the United Kingdom.
That is what large US banks are using.
Several banks have already announced to relocate jobs.
The lobbying association "Frankfurt Main Finance" anticipates 10000 new jobs in the Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, IW, the headquarters of the European Central Bank (ECB), which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the eurozone's largest banks, as well as other key authorities such as the European insurance supervisor EIOPA and the ESRB risk council.
In Paris, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has its headquarters, but it is less important for the financial industry than the ECB.
"Proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with oversight," says IMF professor Voigtländer.
Luxembourg is a large fund industry, but, like Dublin, it is worse off in terms of infrastructure.
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport.
Furthermore, the city with easily available commercial real estate.
"In Paris, it is not so easy to find free high-quality offices," says Voigtländer.
At the Seine, rents for first-class commercial real estate are 50 percent higher than in the Main.
In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition, thanks to good medical care and infrastructure, as well as less crime.
In a ranking of business consultancy Mercer, the city stands at No. seven, Luxembourg at No. 19, Dublin at No. 33 and Paris in 37th place.
Even if quality of life is a question of preferences: "with its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market, Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors," the IW concludes.
But, despite Brexit's vote, London will remain the most important financial center in Europe, economic researchers say.
This is also true of the balance of power: in London, according to the figures of Landesbank Helaba, around 144000 people worked in the banking industry at the end of 2015; in Frankfurt it was 62500.
