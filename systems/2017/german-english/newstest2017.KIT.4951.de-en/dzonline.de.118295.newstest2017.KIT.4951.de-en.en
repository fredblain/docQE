Olympics: triple fraud in doping test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary commission on the case.
Kenya's athlete is in danger after the second doping affair at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.
After a fraud attempt at a doping control in the Olympic village, Kenya sent a trainer home.
The International Olympic Committee said it would immediately set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official had announced that the former sprinter and current coach, John Anzrah, had made a urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich.
This was reported to the team management of Kenya by the doping controllers.
The World Association of IAAF has asked the IOC for information on the case to appeal its own investigations, an IAAF spokesman said.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent actions of the IOC, the IAAF will make an assessment," it said in an IAAF statement.
"He (Anzrah) has gone to the doping control station and has spent himself as Ferguson Rotich, the sample surrendered and signed," said Kenya's chief of mission Stephan Arap SOI.
He was in possession of the athlete's accreditation, which was on the list for training inspections of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
Ferguson Rotich was in Beijing World Cup fourth over 800 meters in 2015.
Four days earlier, Kenyan athletics delegation chief Michael Rotich had been stripped of the Rio Games.
He is alleged to have informed his country's money payments athletes about upcoming doping tests.
Media reports said he was arrested on his return at Nairobi airport.
Kenya has been under special observation at the IOC after numerous doping offences.
In announcing the more than 2000 doping target checks issued by the IOC before the Rio Games, it was unusually pointed out that particularly athletes from Kenya and Russia are being targeted.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was passed a few weeks before the Olympics began.
As a result, WADA took Kenya from the list of countries whose doping control is in line with WADA rules.
Kenya is considered a major runner nation.
The country's athletics won the most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.
In a series of ARD television reports, there have been repeated accusations that doping funds are easily accessible in Kenya and that there should be a significant mentality of sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound last called for a similar investigation into Kenya as he had employed them in Russian athletics.
It has been demonstrated that there has been a systematic and systematic approach to this sport.
Russia's athletics were subsequently ruled out of the Summer Games.
