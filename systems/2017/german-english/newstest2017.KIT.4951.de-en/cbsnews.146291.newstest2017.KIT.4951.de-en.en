Heavy rain, flooding give rise to rescue in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and large-scale flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with more rain expected throughout Saturday.
Numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippis flooded their shores and threatened with large-scale flooding after extreme rains, the National Weather Service reported.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on the way to help affected communities.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said that requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags were multiplying.
Steele said that only the municipality of Tangipahoa had requested tens of thousands of sandbags.
A flood warning system will be deployed across much of southern Louisiana until Saturday.
The weather service indicated that an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area.
A tsunami warning system was set up in the south of Alabamas on Friday, while it continued to rain in the Mobile area.
The River Comite near baton Rouges and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both of which are located in Louisiana, are all likely to reach record levels over the weekend.
The metereologist Alek Krautmann says both rivers could flood many homes into the suburbs near baton Rouge.
He also said that a stroke-down exuberance in Ascension Parish poses a danger, as these are going to flow slowly into Lake Maurepas across the river.
The Tickfaw River, south of the Mississippi State border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded at 09.00 on Friday.
Rescue teams still trapped people from the floodwaters in the Amite district and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued Friday near Gloster.
Hansford, 62, says water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet away from his home, rose sharply overnight.
He said another stepson, who lives nearby, had been warned.
"We woke up and the water flowed and poured in," said Hansford.
It reached my waist.
His wife told Hansford that in the 48 years in which she lived there, she had never seen such a high tide of the river.
Hansford said he and his family members all had disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim.
Hansford said that Nothelfer had rescued all three in a large military truck and brought them to the nearest fire station in Gloster, where they were staying until Friday.
Krautmann said the flooding had "spread quickly" as there continued to be heavy rains and that the authorities were considering evacuation orders.
According to Krautmann, an observer arrived near Livingstone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.75 inches of rain.
Krautmann said the ground had been considerably swollen by the rains since Wednesday.
Authorities said heavy rains and street flooding caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and tuition failure in five school districts.
The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that a subordinate in Tangipahoa gave up 200 flooded homes.
Residents were evacuated in two churches, which were now both flooded.
The suburb of the municipality of Robby Miller said authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets that were strapped from the floods.
In the cities of Amite and Hammond, emergency shelters were set up to house the evacuees.
"Once the water starts to go back, they will be able to go back to their homes," he said.
In the town of Hammond of the municipality of Tangipahoa, nearly two dozens of roads were closed due to the flooding and provided sandbags to residents who hope to keep the water out of their homes and shops.
"The last major flooding we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum of the city government.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississipp, emergency manager Rupert Lacy of the Harrison Countys said it continued to rain on the Gulf Coast.
According to his figures, a handful of homes were to have been reported flooded Thursday, but none were reported on Friday.
Keith Townson, manager at shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I have seen water in places I have never seen before," said Townson,"and it is still coming."
