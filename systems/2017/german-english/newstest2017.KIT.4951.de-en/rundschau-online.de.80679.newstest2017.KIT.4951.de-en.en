Witnesses sought: beverage market in forest oil surges
A robbery was carried out Thursday evening on the drinks market of Rewe XXL on the forest fire Gerberstraße.
Under the guise of a firearm, three darkly dressed people who had their faces mummified were asked by the employee of the drink market to release cash and then flew first foot and then presumably with a silver VW golf.
How much money has been collected does not involve the police.
The perpetrators should have been between 1.60 and 1.70 meters tall, so relatively small.
The beverage market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the Rewe market.
After the raid in the direction of Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg, and from the gravel parking in front of the car park, it is possible to fly with the silver car, possibly in the direction of B 256.
Anyone who made observations at the time of the crime (at 7: 45.00 p.m.), in connection with the robbery, is to report to the police as a matter of urgency.
