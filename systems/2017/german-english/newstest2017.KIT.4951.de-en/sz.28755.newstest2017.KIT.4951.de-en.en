Nokia 9000 Communicator: the first smartphone
E-mail and Internet in slow motion: 20 years ago, the Nokia Communicator came onto the market.
The successors dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed nearly half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it was not good either.
On the contrary, it was pretty scary.
The built-in memory initially averaged eight megabytes, which would be enough today for about two Selfies with high resolution.
An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" came in exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, into the shops - and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the equipment on the Internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age.
20 years ago, however, the Communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the CeBIT computer fair in Hannover, Germany.
In fact, the new mobile phone could provide a lot for then-standards: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax was the Communicator to reach.
Even access to websites was possible via HTML browser, albeit agonizingly slow.
A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the cellphone could be folded up like a laptop.
Then there was a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.
Pretty proud was the price: 2700 D-mark, so about 1400 euros.
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.
No one was able to predict in August 1996 that the Communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.
Since then, everything has been different.
The smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.
The mobile phone division of the Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster, was eventually sold to Microsoft and settled.
The market now dominates suppliers, all of which came much later than Nokia.
Always and everywhere online, this is everyday life for a lot of people.
In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.
About 1.4 billion devices were sold, Samsung and Apple alone accounted for 555 million pieces.
Global sales of equipment are around â‚¬ 400 billion.
In addition, there are the good business of the countless app providers and the telecommunications groups.
Around the smartphone, an entire industry has now emerged.
The crucial breakthrough to the mass market came only in early 2007, when Apple chief Steve Jobs announced the launch of the iPhone at the Mac World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an Internet communicator, all easy to use by touch screen.
Apple's winning streak began, and today the iPhone is the most important product of the group.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, which dominated the market, had the downside.
They eventually disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.
The sayings now have Apple and Asian suppliers such as Samsung.
The smartphone is taken for granted 20 years after its invention.
On average, every German now looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone.
"We all need to learn to put the smartphone away, too," said Janina Kugel, in the Siemens board of staff.
Permanent accessibility is now a curse and a blessing.
