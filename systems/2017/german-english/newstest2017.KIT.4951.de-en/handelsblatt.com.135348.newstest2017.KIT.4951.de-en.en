Here comes the Enforcement trailer
Germany's Raser must adapt to the next generation of speed knives: in various German states, including Hesse and Brandenburg, new flash devices are being tested, which are meant to be particularly effective.
The futuristic Enforcement trailer of the Vitronic company from Wiesbaden can be used, for example, at accident points where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, at highway construction sites or rehabilitating bridges with temporary speed, there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that the speed limit is observed with a stationary flash.
However, a permanent mobile structure can be too dangerous or costly.
The Enforcement trailer is self-sufficient: its battery holds five days for continuous measurement operation, and the case data is transmitted encrypted over a modem.
Laser measuring technology can also cover all vehicles across multiple tracks simultaneously.
Variable speed limits as well as transit bans after time, driving strips and vehicle class can also be monitored.
In high condition you can move the trailer, according to the manufacturer, with each car with trailer clutch.
In order for it not to be simply cloned, it is lowered in the measurement operation, so that the wheels disappear in the armored and, by the way, shot-proof external hull.
In addition, a built-in alarm system is designed to protect the flash from vandalism.
Since 2015, according to Vitronic, the trailer has been tested in various federal states and is now also used.
Foreign authorities also flash the new technology: recently, France has recovered 100 pieces, following an order of 150 pieces last year.
