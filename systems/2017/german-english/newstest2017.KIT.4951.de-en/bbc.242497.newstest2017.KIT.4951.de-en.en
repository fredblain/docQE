Queensferry Crossing: bridge now linked to Fife
The £ 1.35 billion project is due to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have linked the north deck of the Queensferry crossings with the viaduct - meaning the bridge is now linked to Fife.
It is the first of four closures of the "cover blower," which is nearing completion around each of the bridge's three towers.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 swirls.
The £ 1.35 billion project is due to be completed by May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown visited the building site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.
He said: "this is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry crossings.
We are all witnesses to an engineering of a truly epic degree in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used for this part of the bridge alone.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for fit.
Overall, nearly 79% of the total bridge checks are in their place and the final section of the deck gets a betting ring for the deck today in Rosyth, which means the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge constructors said: "the first closure represents a significant milestone in each bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the shutter represents forward-looking high and deep construction.
After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the northern tower deck, we had to close the remaining gap on the north or land side.
This was achieved by dragging the northern accessory bridge 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and, at the same time, very delicate activity.
Massive, as the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and has had to be pulled up at a slope of about 3%.
Delicate, as the tolerances to which the team was working were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimetres away.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
