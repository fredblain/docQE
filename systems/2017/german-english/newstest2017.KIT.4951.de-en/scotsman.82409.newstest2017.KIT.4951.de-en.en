Scots Callum Skinner stormed home as Briton wins gold for cycling
Scotland's Callum Skinner raced last night in the men's team sprint at the Velodrom in Rio for glory when the British team defended the London 2012 title.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took on the anchor role that his compatriot Sir Chris hoy had embraced and made the legend proud when he stormed home to capture a victory from New Zealand's favourites.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while hoy picked up the fifth of six Olympics medals.
They repeated the trick after they holed only a modest sixth place in March at the London World Championships in London despite the resignation of Hoys.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.
They did so in good time as a hint.
Hoys's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the Scot that has now unfolded.
Hindes, Kenny - who won with hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standings the New Zealanders won in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
Hindes fell short after his round, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.
A change of strategy made much of the transformation, in which Hindes drove in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenny and, above all, Skinner to keep the pace.
Hoy watched from his position as BBC expert and dropped Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they rose to the podium.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said: "it is a flattering comparison."
I am just here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final round and beat the world champions.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win this.
After the 2012 triumph at Kennys and Hoys, Hindes admitted he deliberately fell on the train after a weak start.
He later withdrew that statement and there was no objection from England's rivals.
This time there was no such problem with such a surprising victory.
Hindes said: "it feels with all the GB flags in the gallery like London."
We have come together as a team in the last three months.
We have come away so badly in so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.
That is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which has won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.
If that is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days in the velodrome.
With the form of Kennys, it is in the realm of the possible that he repeats Hoy's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.
That would be for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than hoy, who was also born on March 23 (an apparently sacred date for British sport; on the day were also born Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.
That would be the equivalent of hoy.
Kenny is next in the sprint, which starts today and will go over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I am enjoying this just for the moment."
The team event is always best.
You can win it with his colleagues.
It feels a bit lonely to win alone.
Hindes said: "if he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."
It was the only medal contest of the day, but there was further good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-four-kilometer race.
They came in at 3: 51.942 on goal.
The world record holder, who won gold in London in 2012, was third at 3: 51.659.
The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the contest, where Wiggins will certainly be in focus.
He had struggled with appointees before the qualification yesterday, when officials called him to measure his body size.
In the corresponding women's competition, which will be continued and finished tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13.260.
The GB team relies on its strong rail cycling team to dominate the middle period of the Olympics and pick up a bar of medals.
After a truly extraordinary display of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio were lowered.
It played out drama in the background, according to the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid sexism and bullying allegations, as well as the retirement of sizes such as hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
But if you look at the first evening of the competition at the velodrome, it looks like the now legendary reputation of GBS, which reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated again.
