Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee demands punitive interest rates from wealthy savers - as the second institute in Germany.
Bank chief Josef Paul said Thursday: "it is only about 139 customers who parked 40 million euros on giro or daytime bank accounts."
The German Bundesverband Deutscher Banken speaks of an individual case and does not see it as a signal: normal savers would have to "not worry about paying for their Spartan penalty."
Camp banks money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they have to pay their 0.4 percent penalty rate.
As of September, Raiffeisenbank Gmund will require private and corporate customers to spend more than 100,000 euros on giro or daily money accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
"The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year," Paul said.
He has been hitting EUR 40 million for some time, which could be lifted from one day to the next and which he could not use.
"Those are with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent costs," the bank chief said.
"I cannot lay down for every million 4000 euros."
In accordance with the ' polluter pays ' principle, the cost is now continuing.
Leaving the cash simply in the Raiffeisenbank's coffers would be far too dangerous: "I have already experienced four assaults, I do not want to be the fifth!" said the bank board.
Most customers would have understood and switched to other forms of investment.
Only a few migrated to other banks.
The Bavarian Cooperative Association said: "the ECB's extreme monetary policy is causing significant costs at all banks."
To wear it on its own is ' not possible in the long term '.
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or transfers.
With punitive interest rates for deposits from three million euros, the Thuringian People and Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land had made headlines with its Skatbank branch in 2014.
Michael Kemmer, chief executive of the banking association, said: "we do not expect private customers to pay nationwide fees for deposits, the competition in Germany among banks and savings banks is far too strong."
One banker said that at Tegernsee, there is "a clientele that is somewhat more exuberant from the assets."
"That can become a problem for a small bank" if it hires free money.
The cooperative bank Gmund, founded in 1911, has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
Well-known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region.
The Bavarian Confederation "is currently not known to any other banks that charge an outlay for deposits from private customers," said spokesman Ernst.
The President of the Bundesverband der deutschen Volksbanken und Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), Uwe fr√∂hlich, declared at the end of June: "the threshold to go negative towards the private customer is very, very high".
The competition is tough, and it drops the drain on investors.
Customers in Germany will not like it in width.
