U.S.-backed troops say they have regained full control of Manbij from Islamic State
U.S.-backed troops have regained full control of the northern town of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city left them, a spokesman for the group said Friday.
The Democratic Forces of Syria (DKS) are now combing the city after the excerpt of the remaining group of fighters buried inside the city.
They freed more than 2,000 civilians held hostage by the fighters, Sharfan Darwish of the Manbij military council with the DKS told Reuters.
"The city is now under complete control, but we are currently conducting clean-up operations," he told Reuters.
