Podolski attacks ' gala ' after Supercup
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, an arrest warrant has been issued against former football star Hakan Sükür.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time after the attempted coup, a major football match is taking place in Turkey.
Before the duel of the archrivals between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolski's Galatasaray Istanbul around the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: "business as usual".
Even when the state of emergency was declared after the attempted coup in July, the government insisted that the daily lives of ordinary citizens should not be affected.
This does not, however, apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is responsible for the attempted coup.
This does not stop before football.
The prosecution issued an arrest warrant against former strongman Hakan Sükür.
Thus, the South American now living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
South Africa is said to be supporters of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is blamed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup attempt.
It is true that the state of emergency imposed for 90 days is still in force until October, but in fact it has virtually no effect on the lives of most Turks.
The nightly "democracy guards" in public places across the country, Erdogan said Wednesday.
Sport - like the whole country - is divided into supporters and opponents of Erdogan.
Especially fans of the workers ' club Besiktas are traditionally not among the president's friends.
What unites the majority of Turks, however, in the face of dramatic experiences in history, is the strict rejection of military coups.
Even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
At Pokalwinner "Gala" it will come back to Lukas Podolski again.
The Kölner in the past season proved his athletic value: with 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions, the 31-year-old finished his first season as the top scorer of his club.
In the final game against Fenerbahce, he scored the 1: 0 victory.
The newspaper "Fanatik" cheered him: "he was the best in the place."
He finished the season in an excellent way and his team secured the Cup.
Thanks to "Poldi," the disappointing season for the record champion was a conciliatory finish.
After the pre-round K.o in the Champions League, the "lions" also dropped out in the Europa League early on.
In the South Lig, it was only to rank six.
The season was not good.
The Cup was the only way to win something.
"That is what we did and that is the most important thing," said Podolski.
For Masters Besiktas, the game year ran better.
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who, with 26 seasons as a South Florida goalkeeper, put the base to the 14th title.
That is also the reason fans continue to hope for the 31-year-old's return.
In the case of the AC Florence under contract and Besiktas only borrowed Gomez after the attempted coup, he announced that he had failed to return because of the political situation in the country after his EM holiday.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say it," said the trade magazine "Kicker" club chief Fikret Orman.
To do this, however, the Stürmer would have to be prepared to renounce about a third of his annual salute estimated at 7.5 million euros, Orman said, adding: "his salary at Florence we cannot pay."
