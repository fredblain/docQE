Culture of political correctness allows electoral fraud to flourish in Muslim areas
Former mayor of Tower hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed last year at the instigation of a government report for corruption
A culture of political correctness has meant that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is knowingly ignored, as a damning government report revealed today.
Former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally blames police, election observers and town halls for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse due to "over-sensitivities regarding Ethnie and Religion."
The former minister of integration and municipal government, who is now an anti-corruption royal, said intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that police should be allowed to set up roadblocks outside polling booths to protect intimidated voters.
He recommends that voters should have an identity card to prove their identity in elections.
At the moment, a voter only has to name his name and address.
The report suggests not wearing removable ink on a person's finger when they cast their ballot to prevent someone from voting twice.
Whistleblower should get more protection, says Sir Eric
He calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions from non-official committees or working groups.
"That is not just against electoral fraud, but is also intended to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that goes with it," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower hamlets campaign scandal in east London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that incumbent Mayor Lutfur Rahman should be removed from his office after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had "cynically perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community" and that he had silenced his critics with racissism and Islamophobia.
Rahman is said to have "led his campaign on the basis that it is the religous duty of Muslims to choose him."
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the consequence of an imitation in which one person chooses someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.
In particular, he expressed an alarm at the fraudulent election - where the older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice.

His report says: "as evidence, it was appropriate to put pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, to vote according to the will of the elderly, especially communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds.
"There were concerns that... state institutions had knowingly ignored such behaviour because of" politically correct "over-sensitivities regarding Ethnie and Religion."
Sir Eric said 50 recommendations had been made to clean up the system, including the ban that political activists are editing letter papers to stop "polling."
The report, which is being considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher registration checks to prevent the election directory from being used for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask voters before the election, according to your ID.
Do not use removable ink on a person's finger once she has cast her vote to prevent someone from voting twice.
To carry out systematic checks on a person's nationality to ensure they are eligible to vote.
A three-year limit on applications for automatic mail votes.
Ban that political activists process full postal elections and envelopes of letter elections.
The police give the authority to set up closures around polling stations.
A change of law that facilitates an indictment of intimidation in accordance with the Representation of the People Act 1983 (People's Rights Act 1983).
Photography ban in polling stations.
Requirement that only English should be used in polling stations (with the exception of Wales).
Intensification of training to ensure that staff enforce the rule that voters go to the polling booths alone.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that after the Tower hamlets case no criminal complaint was made.
"The electoral court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy to be unfit for purpose because of a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.
He was found guilty on a number of grounds for sufficient - according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings.
He also criticizes the ineffective "quake controls" of the city halls ' election registration departments.
Sir Eric said: "the court ruling in Tower hamlets last year was a warning sign.
Our country has a proud heritage as the mother of parliaments, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation.
