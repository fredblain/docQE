Russia's Putin fires chief of staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's closest confidant for many years.
The 63-year-old has been appointed Special Envoy for Environmental and Transportation Affairs.
In an opinion from the Kremlin, it is that, without giving reasons, Putin "ordered the dismissal of Ivanovs from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration."
Anton Vaino, who has been Ivanov's deputy since 2012, has been appointed to his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the embassy in Tokyo.
The Kremlin's website says (in Russian) that he was later the chief executive and chief executive of the government staff.
On his appointment, he said to Putin: "thank you for your confidence."
I think that it is the government's most important task to support your activity as head of state on draft legislation and controls to implement your instructions.
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and advised Vaino as his successor.
Do you see the smiling faces?
This move has kept Moscow shrouded in mystery.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidants and works like he did for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.
As chief of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigned at his own request.
But despite the smiles for the cameras, few are convinced here - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So is this the result of a kind of power struggle?
Nobody knows that at the moment.
But the official claim - that a man once touted as a potential president would want to head Russian environmental policy at once - met with great skepticism.
In his remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said " it is true that I asked you in a conversation in early 2012 to entrust me with this very complicated post - you could almost say - arduous posts for four years.
As it turns out, I have been the chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took the post in December 2011.
Previously, he was deputy prime minister and defense minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB State Security Service.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov as one of five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin's second term, as a third term of Putin would have violated the constitution.
But this post was taken by another, close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before he became president again three and a half years later.
