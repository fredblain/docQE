Assistant doctors want to organize further strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunts proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistant doctors who voted in an election rejected it.
In July, Hunt had revealed plans to introduce the contract forced and said the NHS would be in a "no-man's land" and any further delay would be harmful to staff and patients.
The first assistant doctors are to receive a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend work in order to improve care at uncomfortable times.
Dr Ellen McCourt, the BMA's chairman for assistant physicians told a news conference last night: "assistant physicians still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and fail to treat all doctors fairly."
With only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors are under the new contract, progress must be made and time is running out.
Efforts by the BMA to resolve the disputes through talks resonated with the government's reluctance to take part, and sometimes to deafening silence.
That was the one promise that Jeremy Hunt had made only last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, lift the imposition and address the concerns of assistant doctors."
If he fails to do so, the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further industrial action.
The latest strike in late April saw an upswing of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 schedules, as nurses and specialist doctors were involved to provide cover to doctors on the strike mail chain.
The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting the reformed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants a better weekend reward for the 54,000 assistant doctors who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, director-general of the NHS staff, urged the assistant doctors to stop the strike.
Mortimer said: "labor action measures do not achieve anything of the little, but already strain teams and service providers and prepare the patients, carers and their families only for concern, distress and disruption."
Over the last two months, we have spoken to the committee of assistant doctors and responded positively to the concerns about the guardianship and whistleblowing with the Ministry of Health and other ministries.
Employers hoped that the continued positive engagement on other important issues - such as posting, flexibility in training, training leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - was a sign of how seriously employers, the Health Education England and the Department of Health were about to comply with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.
