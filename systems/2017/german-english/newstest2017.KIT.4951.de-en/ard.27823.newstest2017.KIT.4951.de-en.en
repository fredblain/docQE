Clinton's and Trump's economic policies in comparison: it's all about the money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing the trade agreement TTP - that is what both Clinton and Trump want.
However, the two US presidential candidates are divided on fiscal and energy policy, as well as on a fundamental issue.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, more philosophical difference.
The, about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns of how the state can hurt the economy - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.
He himself would be very different, claims Trump.
He will drive back regulation massively, and he is pushing for far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for businesses.
Clinton, however, says the state has certain tasks to perform, it has disadvantaged opportunities and needs money for it.
That is why taxes would be increased for the rich, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to the subject of infrastructure.
It must be invested in, say, Trump and Clinton almost word-for-word.
The Democratic candidate even announces the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II.
Government investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies, and are strongly opposed by Republicans ' state-critical teaparty-wing.
So there could be partisan discussions on Trump.
The differences in energy and climate policy are clearer.
Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and boost coal production in the US.
Oil production is also expected to be possible in areas protected so far, and the Paris climate agreement is to be terminated.
Clinton, on the other hand, wants to explicitly expand renewable energy with her investment program, and demands that "a country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs."
"It will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be."
But not only in terms of infrastructure, but also in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart.
TPP, the trans-Pacific trade agreement, both do not want to sign.
At the same time, both do not want to isolate the US from international trade, but simply to better protect American jobs.
They are also supposed to be paid better, asking for Clinton.
The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a starvation wage.
It wants to raise it to $15 an hour.
What Trump wants to do on this issue is not entirely clear: once, he says, the minimum wage must be up, then he says he should not be changed.
But the big debate in the coming months is likely to be more about the fiscal policy of the two camps.
On the one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens in order to boost growth.
His critics believe that this would only increase the budget deficit.
On the other hand, Clinton, who at least wants to ask the wealthy to pay more tax, and whose critics say more taxes are not the solution, either.
