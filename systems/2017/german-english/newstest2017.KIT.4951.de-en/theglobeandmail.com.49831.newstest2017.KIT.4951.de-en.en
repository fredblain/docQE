Adblock Plus, Facebook in ' cat and mouse game ' on ad blocking
For companies that make money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers, attempts to bypass ad blocking, a "cat and mouse game" are the same.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block ad blocking on its desktop site, Adblock Plus published a blogpost in which it said users could update their filters in the program to block advertising on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the coding of its advertisements to make it more difficult to detect what part of the page is advertising.
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to circumvent the new codes.
In a blogpost, Adblock Ben Williams spokesman Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of hit-and-go battle between the notifying open source community and the bypass has already been underway since the invention of ad blockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution.
The fact that the world's largest corporate social media company has entered the fray is a strong indication of how worrying ad blockers have become for the industry.
Worldwide, according to a study last year by Pagefair and Adobe, about 200 million people use ad blockers; nearly four times as much in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of advertising revenue Facebooks.
The company has it on ad blockers on desktop PCs, as mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a spokesman said.
Advertising on desktop PCs accounts for a sufficient share of revenue, so Facebook seems to be worth the investment of such a step.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update its "ad preferences tool" to give people more control over advertising aimed at them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters would be worrying because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising.
"For users, that is not a positive experience, so we plan to address the problem," said a spokesman for Facebook in an e-mail message.
Ad blockers are a blunt means, which is why we have focused instead on developer tools like Ad Preferences to put more control into people's hands.
