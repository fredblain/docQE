Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland no longer available
The RBS brand is about to be reduced to a back-office role, according to the bank's CEO.
Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank has since distanced itself when it almost collapsed and had to be rescued eight years ago.
During that time, brand strategist RBS has used "RBS" to protect other end-consumer financial brands.
She supported international sport with millions of pounds in sponsorship, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now it has decided to put more national brands in focus.
Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralised headquarters and the stock exchange listing will change to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for retail banking that will be given more prominence - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "the RSB brand will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our staff will be busy as we become more a bank of brands now."
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I am now saying that we are not pursuing global objectives, but local objectives.
Each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work with the customers under these brands.
RBS has already said it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the perceptibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship.
"It is time for us to develop into the bank of brands, because how do we focus on inside (we have asked) to make this a better bank for customers?" said the CEO.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and have launched these brands.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think we will see many changes.
We can launch these brands again, so I think the time has come.
