Jewish director crushed Berlin hotel because Israeli pre-election was removed after ' Arab ' call - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media revolt after he had betrayed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli pre-selection as it asked Arab guests, according to an employee. "
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah", left his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel's country selection list.
The country, however, was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and deleted?
Wrote Lanzmann.
Instead, the Kempinksi Bristol offers a way to select Israel via its own call center.
After a statement, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received there,"shocked him," Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said the measure was a "deliberate decision by the management of the Kempinski hotels."
The reason behind it sparked even more fury in the director.
"The bulk of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the preselection be deleted," Lanzmann's employee was quoted as saying.
Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great shame," the Süddeutsche Zeitung reported.
We were appalled and dismayed by this event.
This is really very shameful.
The fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even more shameful.
That does not require any explanation.
We expect the hotel "to draw the right conclusions," said the official.
The incident caused quite a lot of resonance on the Internet, in which people called the whole thing a scandal.
Some told the Kempinski Hotel that it had "succumbed to the alleged calls of Arab guests."
"Shame on you," it said in another post, noting that the hotel, located at the noble Kurfürstendamm, is near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly dismissed all allegations of itself and called the incident an "oversight" and "apologized" at Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reported.
" There has never been a direct statement " not to include Israel in the Quick List," quoting the Süddeutsche Zeitung a spokesman for the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the country selection has now been added.
