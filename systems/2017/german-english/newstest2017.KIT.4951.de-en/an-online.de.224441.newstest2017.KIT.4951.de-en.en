Golfer Langer gets the sports pyramid
His experience on the horse is manageable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer was looking for a bit of variation on the beach with some colleagues.
It was a premiere for the 58-year-old.
CHIO: "golden sports pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses remembered their holiday, they hunted in the fast gallop home to the fodder troughs.
One kilometer at this pace, I was scared.
"It was not a good experience," Langer says.
And so the riding career ended up again.
On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament victories - was again close to horses.
He left with his family over the plant of the ALRV, on a horse he did not even bother for photo purposes.
Langer was the first time in Aachen and also with the CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German sports aid was given to the man from Anhausen as part of a small gala the Golden Sports pyramid.
At awards, the likeable athlete is not lacking.
Federal Cross of Merit, Silver's laurel, Champions Tour Player of the year...
Even the British Queen has already adored him.
Langer is the 18th winner of the sports pyramid.
In Aachen, he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
"This award means a lot to me," says Langer,"because it is awarded not only for sporting successes, but also for social engagement."
For decades, Langer has been promoting the young.
And so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time U.S. Masters champion was inducted into the "Hall of Fame of German Sports" on Saturday.
The performances include the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the Fechter Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the rowers Peter-Michael Kolbe, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumping rider Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumously the handballer Erhard Wunderlich.
Many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrious society wandered into the Springstadion, where the Lavazza Prize was running.
Bernhard Langer kept distance from the big animals.
