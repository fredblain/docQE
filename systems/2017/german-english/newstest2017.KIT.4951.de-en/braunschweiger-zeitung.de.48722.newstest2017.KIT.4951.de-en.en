Who is building Braunschweig's cheap homes?
The SPD and the Greens believe that investors should be made much more accountable in the future.
How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap homes in the next few years?
The SPD proposes a "living concept" for the next Council meeting.
But dispute is programmed.
First of all, the question is: who is supposed to build the cheap housing?
There is no regulation so far.
SPD group chairman Christoph Bratmann said: "we agree with the Greens: anyone who wants to build on urban areas will have to designate 20 percent of all homes as social housing in the future."
However, the cheap apartments can also be created in the stock.
However, the big point of contention in the town hall, Bratmann said, is "how do you deal with investors who want to build on private land?"
"We want investors on such land to build at least 10 percent, but as much as 20 percent of homes as social housing."
A new urban housing support programme, which will cost millions and still needs to be funded, is designed to provide incentives.
The problem, Bratmann said, is "there is still no agreement between the groups at the moment."
The CDU wants investors to make as few rules as possible.
The left still wants tough conditions for investors.
Despite this, Bratmann said, the situation in the housing market is deteriorating.
If the concept of action is implemented, it will provide additional tasks in the construction administration.
More staff is needed.
It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.
But the programme is not yet complete: the approximately 1260 new homes, which should be built anyway.
But how do you compensate for the loss of some 1300 cheap homes, the promotion of which will expire in the next few years?
By 2020 alone, it will be 500 homes.
To prevent that, according to planning policy spokeswoman Nicole Palm, running ties should now be purchased from the city.
Consideration should also be given to getting housing back into price-fixing.
This is possible in the western city.
At one stroke, the problem could be solved.
Because in the western city, deadlines expire at the end of the year.
Around 1800 homes could be put back into price-fixing for cheap housing.
Only: that is what the owners want, the housing companies do not want.
There will be a drastic increase in the number of social housing in the western part of the city, away from the objective of the so-called mixing.
There should be no more concentration of socially weak in just a few parts of the city.
The Greens expect there to be some movement in the debate.
Group chairman Holger Herlitschke says: "for a broad majority, the CDU needs to go on board."
That has focused on more building sites for single-family homes.
But this does not mean that a compromise cannot be found.
