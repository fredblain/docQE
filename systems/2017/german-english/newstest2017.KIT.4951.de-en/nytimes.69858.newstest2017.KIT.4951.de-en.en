Donald Trump explains his claim Obama had founded ISIS was "sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump tried on Friday to dispel the latest controversy surrounding his campaign, saying that his oft-repeated claim that President Obama and Hillary Clinton had been the "founders" of the terrorist group Islamic State was not serious.
That clarification raised new questions about the communications skills of the Republican presidential nominee, whether he was able to communicate clearly and intelligently with the American public.
It also brings his comrades, who seek to protect him during an eventful phase, into the peculiar position of having to explain statements he might not have meant at all.
After making the suggestion at a campaign event Wednesday night, Mr. Trump rested on the claim Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to indicate that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was simply being sarcastic.
The tweet was the contrast to the previous day, when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews he meant the accusation was entirely serious.
When conservative radio writer Hugh Hewitt sought to help Mr. Trump to soften the statement somewhat by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential nominee did not want to know anything about it.
The last storm of criticism cracked down on Mr. Trump, while trying to steer the focus of his campaign because of falling poll numbers on the economic situation.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this issue again.
Speaking on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already raised sarcasm to his defense.
At the end of July, he drew strong criticism when he suggested that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but he later declared,"Of course, I meant the sarcastic."
This method allows Mr. Trump to shift the linguistic boundaries in politics and then back down as needed.
"I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans, how they arrive, and then, if necessary," clarify "depending on how the reaction is out," said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who monitors the language of both candidates.
But I also think he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways.
Instead of defying the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more corrosive tone, as his poll ratings have continued to decline.
A new poll by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, released Friday, showed a lead with a big lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump is generally trying not to apologize for his provocative remarks, he frequently accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misinterpreting his humor.
But, while he has been the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's joke has put his loyal fellow Democrats in the uncomfortable position of having to stand up to him, no matter how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent advocacy groups, made great efforts to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview from Thursday.
"I think what he is saying are legitimate, political comments," said Mr. Giuliani, adding he was questioned about the accuracy of Mr. Trump's statements on whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
It is true in this sense that before Obama was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backbenchers, completely wrong, and that is why it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State, it allowed ISIS to spread out by failing to aggressively control the situation in the Middle East.
Before the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of spying on each of his words and being biased against him.
He scorned the "poor, jolly" TV experts who try to understand him and said,"you can 't!"
Some of the Democrats scoffed at Mr. Trump's apology as just one more proof that he was unfit for the presidency.
