U.S. win fourth match in women's field hockey, showdown with Britain
A day after she scored three goals during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the women's American field hockey team in a match Thursday against India that the Americans won by 3-0.
Five goals in two games should actually be a memorable achievement, but Bam (27) said she could not remember having ever done that.
"I have no idea." she said.
I do not belong to the people who keep their doors in mind.
However, she knows that: the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the Britons in the first place, who remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan.
Britain and the United States will meet Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which of the two within their group from six teams will each gain the first and second place.
The first place will go a little longer for the strong Dutch, who will lead the other group.
Whatever the game on Saturday, the American women have sparked a surprising upset by their success story, four years after they landed at the last of 12 places at the past London Games.
BAM was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey sleeper in hands (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), with 16 years she became national playwright, the youngest in the team's history.
She missed the Olympics in 2008 as she failed to qualify for the caddie.
Then came 2012, in which for her and her team everything went wrong.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the national team, began to turn things around for the better.
"A culture change, a mental change and a physical change," Bam said.
We did not have the workload in London that we have now.
We have been able to take the helm completely.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the torch in the first half of the game with a rebound from close range.
India had gone into the game without a win in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1-0 down into the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.
She completed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved to the middle and lubricated the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the final quarter.
The shutout was the first of the entire tournament for the US goalkeeper, Jackie Briggs, who has so far had to concede a gate in each of the previous games.
She has a run.
Same as Bam.
"We are in a good position," said Parnham, but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday.
