The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a rich meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his ascension to the president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch in the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt had a faible for refined delicacies of Fifth Avenue like p√¢te de foie gras and Maryland water-turtle soup.
His menu on that day was slightly more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, potato pepper and as dessert a plum pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew CoE added,"it was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."
The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
CoE's latest book,"chop Suey," was about Chinese cuisine in the US, while Ziegelman was told about life in a home on the Lower East Side from the food perspective in her book "97 Orchard."
Her latest collaboration,"a decent meal," which will appear in the Harper Verlag on Tuesday, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small snack snack in the Flatiron District, which has been in store since the 1929 stock market crash.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive groves, while CoE, 57, made turkeys with potato pepper and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered Hackbraten, this found the pair fit for a discussion about food in the era of the Great Depression.
"Rich foods were very popular," Ziegelman said.
There was peanut broth, liver cheese and bean bread.
They were made from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinners.
Coe grinned.
"It must have been in the stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an All-You-Can-Eat-Buffet.
Teams of women cooked for male field workers and it was served freshly baked pastures for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War.
"It was a time when food for the Americans became a central, tense issue," CoE begged, why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally tense was the new budget diet: mysterious dishes such as broth and casserolls became staple foods, the casserole as "wonderful way to recycle food," noted Ziegelman, as cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dry fruit.
Meat, which has been the center of American cuisine for years, became a rarely served luxury.
Strange mixtures were tried, as a calorie rich and nutritious satisfaction took precedence over taste or even healthy cuisine.
During her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from that era, baked onions with peanut butter.
"It was not a popular addition at lunch," says Coe.
Ziegelmann continues: "it was surreal."
Peanut butter and baked onions do not match each other.
It was typical for many of the house economic recipes.
As never before, or ever since, budget economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - were so keen on the country's eating habits.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "budget politicians" and meet the challenge of turning Pampe like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
"A Square Meal" is a celebration of historical delicacies.
Especially tasty are the reports of the government's response to the starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's Lass-mich-cake-eating attitude.
While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen, he dined like the million-strong man of world to which he has become.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with Gurkensauce," said Coe.
He ate in an almost gold-plated dining room and wore a Smoking.
He was wonderfully unrealistic.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if not his wife Eleanor had asked him to set an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, the hiring of a housekeeper with no interest in flavors by Ms. Roosevelt meant that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most dismal. "
Many of the species from the Great Depression era to deal with food was discarded as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy is based on our continuing focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as how science was applied to food.
The couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother-in-law when writing the book - for example, how they could not throw away food.
"She had a real fear of wasting food," said CoE.
Ziegelman recalled,"she made people really sick."
There was the windbag incident.
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg, they and CoE drew a dessert that they had prepared at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate at lunchtime.
"It is called prune whip," said Ziegelman and added that it was a usual trick to miss modest recipes a send name.
There were no battered cream, just plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Each appeared somewhat reluctant to have a spoon in the tough, brown glibber.
Amazingly, it was not bad.
CoE picked up an aftershock three times.
Like a Can-Do buddy, he said to his wife,"A couple of chopped walnuts would help."
