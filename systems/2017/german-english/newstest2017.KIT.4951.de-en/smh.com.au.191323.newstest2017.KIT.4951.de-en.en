More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, KENDALL is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue
KENDALL Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner clan Kris is on the cover of the coveted September edition of US Vogue.
KENDALL, who is the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran to the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"In a room full of people I love, brought me the sight of this cover to the cry," wrote KENDALL.
The unveiling of the covers followed a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians similar?), scripted reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (with the exception of problem cases Rob and Caitlyn, and in the presence of the most popular showbiz uncles and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest) as they forget the cover of their sister and that ends with a classic twist: they have all planned a surprise party.
That represents the clich√©d plot of almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence,"you would have forgotten that we had forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit on a sink at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to somehow let her other girls take part in this publicity.
With a view to the September issue of Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall's big sister Kim may have beaten her on the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were to see it in April 2014), but the cover of the September edition of the magazine is a league for itself.
The September issue is for Vogue the most sold edition of the year.
With a scale that resembles an imagery rather than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista were advertising from the 832 pages of rolling 615 pages of advertising).
The unveiling of his cover stars is so eagerly anticipated that images of the magazine leaked in the past two years even before the official announcement.
Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have been clearly more "celebrities who are modelling" as "models who are celebrities" on the cover.
Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honor.
But even with the low chance that Ms Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the previous category, she is in good company.
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or youths from today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even if it is all about Jenner).
They are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had with the release of Lemonade one of the most successful years of her career.
Of course, Jenner's success does not suit everyone.
With her reality TV story, Jenner's position in the fashion world was always somewhat tense.
In June, the former Victoria's Secret model criticized Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid and called it "the mist of the moment."
Those feelings cooked up again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue cover.
But, at the point of dissatisfaction, the point seems to be getting off the ground.
KENDALL Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
It is, in the truest sense of the word, a supermodel.
She runs for Marc Jacobs.
She makes adverts for your Grunting of Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.
She sells from her made pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine LOVE.
And in her spare time she is seen in reality TV, presumably only to see her sister Kourtney and their children.
