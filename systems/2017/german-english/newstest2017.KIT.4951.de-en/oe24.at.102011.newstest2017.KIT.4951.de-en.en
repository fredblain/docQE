Killed in bomb attack: he was the hero of Aleppo
He put his own life at risk to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria.
He risked everything to save others ' lives.
Now the 30-year-old himself has died in a Fassbomb attack by the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the White Helmets, a civil protection group that, according to the Bild newspaper, has saved nearly 60 000 lives so far.
2900 volunteers put their own lives at risk to pull people out of bombed homes and to provide first aid in the war zone.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: a video of the Civil Guard showing him in an 11-hour rescue of a baby from the rubble of a house went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrians a shining symbol in the horror of war.
As a hero, however, he never saw himself, saying, according to the picture,"for me, that is the real jihad."
"If I am dying to save lives, I think God sees in me a martyr."
Shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack, he had spoken in a video about the latest bombing in Syria.
Helicopters dropped four barrel bombs over the Alzadia district, one was filled with chlorine gas.
A woman and two children died, seven people were suffering from breathing.
"We are now eliminating the poisonous remains of the bomb, lest children play with it," the Bild quoted his last words before he died.
The Assad regime's deadly bomb was supposed to hit terrorists.
