Haigerloch: pilgrims to the gates of mercy
The ministrants from the peace group Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the move on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Together, four stages have been dealt with.
In order to bridge the period up to the next romantic ride of all mini transmitters in probably two years, the Saint-Anna Oberministrantenround has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.
Various pilgrimage goals were examined and it was decided finally for the bishop's town of Freiburg, where this year on the occasion of the Holy Year of mercy with the open gates of mercy at the Freiburger Münster, a special pilgrimage destination was offered.
16 Minis from Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Heiligenzimmern were on the way.
Earlier in the evening, Pfarrer Storost sent out the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrims and gave the pilgrims.
From Horb it was driven by train to the starting point of Villingen, where there was also a Munster of Our Lady, and so the pilgrimage was taken by the Münster.
The individual day tours were framed in the morning and in the evening by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and lyrics.
On the other hand, the minis at field crossings, chapels or churches were also on the way to sing together a song from Pilger-Liedheft.
For the overnight stays, parish heaters of the local parishes were available.
At the milestones, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller cared for a tasty as well as strengthening dinner and breakfast.
It went on for the second day on Furtwangen to Gütenbach.
The day after St. Peter, which was the most strenuous stretch of road, had to first descend at around 500 meters of altitude and then come back again.
The deserved reward was in the evenings a common barbecue on the beach.
After the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, it went to the final stage to Freiburg.
Visibly relieved and happy, the Minis met in the later afternoon at the Freiburger Münster and went through the gates of mercy.
With a little impulse, God was thanked here.
At the evening fair in the Münster, the mini was greeted by collaborator Markus Obert on the pilgrimage.
After the service, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.
The next day was still time for the Breisgau metropolis.
In the afternoon it went back to Horb by train.
In the end, all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked.
