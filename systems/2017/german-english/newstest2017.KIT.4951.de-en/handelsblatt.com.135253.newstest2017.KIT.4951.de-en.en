Despite Olympic disappointment: Martin remains combative
Despite his disappointing performance in Olympic time, cycling professional Tony Martin does not want to be subdued.
"I continue to keep the World Cup in mind, stay confident and fight on," the 31-year-old wrote Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook.
He does not have a statement for his miserable twelfth place on the sugar front.
"I honestly find it difficult to comment on yesterday's time," Martin said.
He had to analyse calmly the reasons for the debacle.
At the time World Cup in Qatar in October, Martin actually wanted to fight for the title.
"I am going to look at everything that we have changed recently."
"This includes my position," wrote the three-time time world champion who lost on Wednesday to the 54.5 km more than three minutes on Olympic champion Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland).
