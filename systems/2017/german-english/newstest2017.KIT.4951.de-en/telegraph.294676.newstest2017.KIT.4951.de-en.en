England must guide the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country.
For me, that represented the biggest attraction of Heathrow, just as it did in London at the time in 2012, when we ran a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for locals and businesses near Heathrow.
For our local communities, we alone will create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.
Just as they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of the expansion of Heathrow is too great.
I was told that England will never be ready for the Games and that we will embarrass ourselves on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcoming, but Heathrow answers every question put to him.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is for many, not individual, an infrastructure project.
Enlargement is a way of creating up to 180,000 new jobs, £ 211bn of sustainable growth and leaving a legacy of skills and employment both to the airport and to the whole of the GB.
We have a great team at Heathrow that has implemented a £ 11bn expensive infrastructure investment programme in time and budget, from the T5 - which was chosen for five years in a row to the world's best airport terminal, to the T2, which was built amid the world's two most frequented runways.
Now they stand ready to deliver a third runway, which is backed by £ 16 billion of private investment.
The 2012 London Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.
It is time for us to steer this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, thereby securing our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.
