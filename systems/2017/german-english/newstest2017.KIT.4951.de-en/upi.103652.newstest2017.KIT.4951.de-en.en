Kepler measures rotation rate of stars in star cluster of Plejades
The newest mission with the Kepler Space telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates under the stars of the Plejades ' star building.
The new data helps astronomers to understand why stars rotate at different rates in star clusters, as well as in what context the rotation periods are with the planetary structure.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The star cluster of the Plejades is 445 light years away from Earth.
Many stars in this cluster of stars, created about 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.
They are now turning the fastest.
At peak rotation rates, these mature stars produce large amounts of star winds.
As these winds travel through the stars ' magnetic fields, they have a braking effect on the stars.
When a star is aging, his rotation rate starts to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star flecks -- such as sunflecks --.
The latest catalog of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars turn slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with bigger stars turning slower pirouettes than smaller ones.
"In the" ballet "of the Plejades, we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," said Rebull.
As the star of the Plejades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates.
"The star cluster of Plejades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.
There is much in front of us that we would like to know more about how the How, When and Why Stars slow down their rotation rates and hang up their "dance shoes".
Rebull and her colleagues have extensively reported in three newspaper reports on their latest analysis of the Pleijades ' rotation rates, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
