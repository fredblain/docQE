Mahaj Brown, 6,"riddled with bullets," survives shooting in Philadelphia
Police say the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week already the second time a 6-year-old child is being shot.
The boy's grandparents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents said Brown suffered several stab injuries, including in the lender, leg, arm and belly, but that he was hospitalized when he was transported to the hospital.
"He has gone through a lot, his little body was riddled with bullets," shared his grandmother Delores Melendez told the station.
I simply cannot believe that.
The boy's condition was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several surgeries.
The boy's family told the station that he is expected to recover.
He should have started the first class at a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot at Germantown.
Also shot down were three men: two at the age of 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The boy was found on the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old, who is in a critical condition, the station reported.
The other two victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether one of the injured men could be among the injured men.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that there appeared to be a crossfire between several shooters.
Cartridges for storm guns, traced to various storm guns, overturned the scene.
It seems that this has clearly been an ongoing struggle.
On the street, on both sides of the trail, there were hugs.
So there seems to have been several armed fighters who were very actively involved," shared police chief Anthony Ginaldi of police in Philadelphia told the station.
Several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area.
No arrests have been made and police are currently reportedly reviewing the surveillance video.
On Tuesday, another 6-year-old girl was hit by a transcript at the arm when she played in front of her home in the residential area of West Oak Lane.
She is recovering and police are still searching for a suspect.
