Woman killed in suspected suicide on Swiss highway
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are calling witnesses after a woman was ousted in the early hours of Thursday amid a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a highway.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.
A woman took to the streets in the Dark "in an act of desperation" and was hit by several cars, police said in Vaud.
It is obvious that a Swiss woman aged 49, who was overrun by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill himself.
She still died on the ground.
Several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, said the police, who asked these as well as any witnesses of the incident to sign up.
An investigation has been opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter told the Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether any of the drivers will be shown.
Was a collision preventable?
That is something the prosecutor has to decide," said Hofstetter.
Two similar cases in the past five years show that drivers are not being held accountable.
In each of the two cases - where a person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that motorists do not have to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the highway, the newspaper said.
Last year, a policewoman accused of negligent killing was acquitted after she overran and killed a man who was on the A1 near Payerne in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and had become unconscious on the street, the court heard.
The court found that the policewoman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- drove in a justified manner and that the presence of a man on the street was a "completely extraordinary and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone who has any further information on the incident Thursday near Morges should contact police under the number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
