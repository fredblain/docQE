Escape: "any fleeing woman has experience of sexual violence"
Sexual violence is part of everyday life for women who flee on their own.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers refuge.
In a large kitchen, there are four women.
Each has a baby, which is no more than a year old.
One has put her little son in the arm.
He looks with big eyes curious in the room.
His mother stares at the table plate.
Until she realizes she is being watched.
She smiles short and kisses the little one.
The scene looks normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is a division manager of Condrobs, a carrier for social assistance in Bavaria, and deals with, among other things, women on the run.
The four women in the kitchen are fleeing.
They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralized accommodation for women and their children in Bavaria.
In January, Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid.
It has recently been officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
Men do not exist - even as a visitor.
The exception is a guard at the door.
"It is not an exaggeration to say that any woman who arrives here has made on her escape experiences with sexual violence," Bahr says.
"Men are fleeing because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they are threatening torture or death or because their families send them as hopefuls to Europe," she tells.
In women, there are other reasons for the escape: "many are stealing from it because they see no other way out."
In their homeland, they have experience of sexual violence, forced marriages, honour killings, slavery or forced prostitution.
That is what drives them.
On the run, that goes on.
"That smugglers, for example, demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a rarity," says Bahr.
And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Anyone who thinks that the end as soon as they arrive in Germany is mistaken, tells Bahr.
Here, too, single women in refugee camps would often be regarded as inferior and, at worst, abused.
That means that about 90 percent of the women who live in the accommodation in the Munich North are traumatized, she estimated.
"Some of the children certainly did not come up voluntarily."
Many women are so used to saying nothing.
"Or they do not dare to speak openly about the experience because the shame is too big."
As they often do not know how to help, there is a need for more accommodation only for them, Bahr asks.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for accommodating refugees.
On the question of whether they knew of a project similar to that in Munich in their area of responsibility, some answer no.
In Oberpfalz and Oberfranken, for example, there is no such thing in government accommodation.
Even in Swabia, abandoned women are not being accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press officer of the government.
In Oberbayern, Unter- und Mittelfranken, there are only for single women and their children in some dormitories or their own houses.
The exception is Lower Bavaria, where there are two central accommodation exclusively for women.
The European Parliament's Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality also calls for women to be separated from men.
In a study published for the committee, it said: "it is very important for men and women to be accommodated separately."
"Lacking the privacy, or getting men and women together, it can turn into - perpetual - violence against women."
In particular, the laundry rooms should be separated and easily accessible to women, the study says.
The way in which women feel this need for protection can be seen at the arrival of the house in Munich.
"Since it has been around, that there is us, we have a long waiting list," Bahr says.
You could easily set up a second house.
