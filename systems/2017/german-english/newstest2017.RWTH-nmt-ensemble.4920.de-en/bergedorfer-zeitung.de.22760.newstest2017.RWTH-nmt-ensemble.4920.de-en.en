Seriously injured - man sticks to his ex-girlfriend
A man has attacked and seriously injured his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife.
As police said yesterday, the 50-year-old had got the key to the apartment to pick up his personal things.
Instead, the alcoholic offender cut the clothing of his ex-girlfriend.
When this one came into the apartment, he stole on her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured at hand and on the body.
Police were able to arrest the offender.
While the 50-year-old destroyed his ex-girlfriend's clothing, he called his mother.
This then alerted his sister.
Together with her life companion, the 45-year-old wanted to reassure her brother.
However, she could not persuade him to leave the apartment.
That's why she walked out of the house with her life companion.
On the road, they met the man's ex-life companion.
When the two women re-entered the apartment, the 50-year-old shuffled his sister to the side and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
