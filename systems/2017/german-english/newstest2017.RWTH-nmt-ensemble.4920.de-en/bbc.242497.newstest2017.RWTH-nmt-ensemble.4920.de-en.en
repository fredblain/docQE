Queensferry Crossing: bridge now linked to Fife
The £1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have linked the North deck of the Queensferry crossings with the viaduct - meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four closures of the "cover blowers" that are approaching the completion around each of the bridge's three towers.
Fife's bridge section is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 swirling ropes.
The £1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017.
Business Minister Keith Brown visited the building site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.
He said: "this is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry crossings.
We are all witnesses to an engineering art of a truly epic extent in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the bridge between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for the pitch.
In total, nearly 79% of the total bridge decks are in their place and the last section of the deck is getting a bedtime for the deck in Rosyth today, meaning the entire deck is ready to be raised on the bridge to its place.
Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the closure represents forward-looking high and low construction.
After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the northern tower deck in the expansion, we then had to close the remaining gap on the north or land side.
This was achieved by dragging the northern train bridge 700 millimetres south.
This was a massive and, at the same time, very delicate activity.
Massive, as the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighed about 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled up at an increase of about 3%.
Delicate, as the tolerances the team is working towards were tiny - on each side they were just a few millimetres.
Thankfully, everything went very well.
