Patrick Roy resigns as coach of the Avalanche
Patrick Roy resigned as coach and vice president Of Hockey Operations of the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, leading to too little co-determination in the team's decision-making process.
Alternative President / General Manager of Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the club will immediately search for a new coach.
"Over the last three years, I have fulfilled my duties as chief trainer and Vice President Of Hockey Operations of the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," said the 50-year-old Roy in an opinion.
I've been thinking long and much over the summer about how I could improve this team to give it more depth, this needed it and bring it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the coach and Vice President Of Hockey Operations must be perfectly matched to that of the organization.
He must also have a right of co-determination in decisions that affect the team's performance.
These conditions are not being met at the moment.
Sakic, who had recruited Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me of this decision today," said Sakic.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organisation and wish him only the best for the future.
Roy was honored during his debut season at the Avalanches 2013 - 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards as the league's best coach.
He led the club to 112 points and in first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was beaten in the first round of Minnesota's playoffs and missed the postseason in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches recorded a 39 - 39 - 4 mark in the 2015 - 16 season and fell behind the Wild for a second wildcard spot in the Western Conference by five points.
As Hall of Fame goalkeeper Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
