Soprano Anna Netrebko openly deals with the autism of her son Tiago - and turns to other concerned parents: "you have to have the courage to talk about it."
"Medicine has made great progress," said the 44-year-old of the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.
When the disease had been detected at her son, she believed she had to die.
However, the now eight-year-old Tiago has come forward well and is now learning privately in New York, where there are the best therapists.
"To give an example: if I ask him something that is two years back when I sang at the Milan Scala, he remembers nothing," said Netrebko.
But he is the happiest person on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebko's connection with the Bassbariton Erwin scrap.
She is now married to the Tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
