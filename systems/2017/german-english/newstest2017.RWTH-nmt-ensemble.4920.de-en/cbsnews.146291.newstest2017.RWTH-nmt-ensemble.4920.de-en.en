Fierce rains, flooding gives cause for rescue in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rainfall and large-scale flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to call out the state of emergency on Friday.
Numerous rivers in south-east Louisiana and the south of the Mississippi flooded their shores and threatened with large-scale flooding after extreme rainfall, the National Weather Service reported.
The governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards announced that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and that assistance to the affected communities is already on the way.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, announced that requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags were increasing.
Steele said that the municipality of Tangipahoa alone would have requested ten thousand sandbags.
A flood warning system is being deployed across much of the south of Louisiana until Saturday.
The weather service indicated that an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area.
In southern Alabama, a flood-early warning system was deployed on Friday, while it continued to rain in the Mobile area.
The River Comite near Baton Rouges and the River Amite near Denham Springs, both of which are located in Louisiana, are likely to reach record levels over the weekend.
The metereologist Alek Krautmann says both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a strom-downward flood in Ascension Parish poses a danger, as these will only flow slowly in the Lake Maurepas across the rivers.
The River Tickfaw, south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, already reached 09,00 the highest level ever recorded on Friday.
Rescue teams still poured people out of the floodwater in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house, rose sharply overnight.
He said that another stepson who lives nearby would have warned him.
"We woke up and the water flowed and flowed," Hansford said.
It reached my waist.
His wife told Hansford that in the 48 years she lived there, she would never have seen such a high of the river.
Hansford said that he and his family members had all the disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim.
Hansford said that Nothelfer had saved all three in a major military truck and had brought them to the next fire guard in Gloster, where they were housed until Friday.
Krautmann said the flood had "spread rapidly" as there continued to be heavy rainfall and that authorities were considering evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livingstone reported from midnight to Friday morning of 13.75 inches of rain.
Krautmann said the ground had been significantly softened by the rains since Wednesday.
Authorities said heavy rainfall and road flooding caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and teaching failure in five school districts.
The CBS subsidiary, WWL, reported that an associate in Tangipahoa gave 200 flooded houses.
Residents were evacuated in two churches, which have now both been flooded.
The premiere of the community of Robby Miller said authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets, which were battered by the flooding.
In the cities of Amite and Hammond, temporary shelters were set up to house the evacuees.
"Once the water begins to go back, they will be able to go back to their homes," he said.
In the town of Hammond of the municipality of Tangipahoa, nearly two dozen roads were closed due to flooding and sandbags provided for residents to take part, hoping to keep the water from their homes and shops.
"The last major flood we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum of the city administration.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississipp, the emergency manager Rupert Lacy of the Harrison County said it continued to rage on the Gulf Coast.
According to his data, a handful of houses were reported to have been reported as flooding on Thursday, but none were reported on Friday.
Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," said Townson, "and it's still coming."
