What to have the Jungle camp with missing medals in swimming
Former German swimmer Markus Deibler has spoken out via Facebook to the disappointing cut-off of the DSV team at Olympis.
In December 2014, he first picked up gold at the short world championships in Doha, while at the same time setting up his first world record.
Now the former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has been protective of his ex-team-mates in the critique.
"In a country where an Olympic champion gets Â£20,000 premium and a jungle 150,000 Euroshould no one wonder about missing medals," the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday.
The support system in the swimming pool is bad, but the doping controls are very good.
This will not allow us to compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look so closely at the issue of doping or even operate it.
"I am not saying that the controls should be stopped here," he continued.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler would already have to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA).
That is exactly how we should keep it with countries.
"Anyone who cannot be controlled for some time before WM / OS by independent inspectors of WADA / FINA is not allowed to participate," says the electoral hamburger, who now runs an ice cream.
