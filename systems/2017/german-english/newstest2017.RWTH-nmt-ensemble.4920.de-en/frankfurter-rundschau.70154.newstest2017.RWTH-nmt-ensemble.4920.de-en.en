Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "go where it hurts"
Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals don't get anything from the summer election campaign - and holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country day.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, they understood.
In 2021, the country's election will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays, the heavy parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
After all, this is not the case: summer holidays, heat and council campaign - that is what is happening.
The locals, who are to be persuaded by the campaigners, are on holiday.
The vast majority of holidaymakers who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so they are not allowed to choose the country day.
In addition, there are practical problems: in the holidays, helpers who hang up posters, blow up air balloons, distribute flyers, and end up counting voices, are only laborious.
Until September 2016, 4, the election and last day of the holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has yet to pass election campaigns just over the people.
The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.
And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, has to fear for his post.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls.
Thrilling will be how strongly Neuling AfD cut off and what's left coalition dust at the end of the day.
Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, is making an almost inconspicuous campaign, you see from his large posters.
He travels through the land, distributes roses and ploughs a little with the people, just as his legendary predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.
Otherwise, Seelering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame at the bloom of the AfD.
Her refugee policy, her "we create this" has accelerated the rise of right-wing populists, which is now likely to cost him the beautiful office.
The CDU with its top candidate, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already seen how it is when you are campaigning in the right place at the wrong time.
She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to major rallies; Merkel Bundestag is located in the northeast.
But the target group did not vote, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony than Mecklenburger and Vorpommern.
"There was probably the majority from other federal states," said Vincent Kokert, Secretary-General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR.
But it is also a pity to no one from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel.
Otherwise, the north-east CDU largely waives the usual campaign levels on marketplaces and in front of shopping centres with umbrellas and air balloons.
This, Kokert says, only plays a "subordinate role."
The Union, too, has noticed that it is breaking the ground in the countryside, that it must make a great effort to find a wire to the people again.
It is like the Left, the SPD, the Greens: there is little in the way of the country.
However, the council of CDU campaigner Kokert to his co-workers is also self-evident: "you have to go where it hurts, namely where the people are: village, golden weddings, every birthday party must be used."
Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called for his SPD to be a particularly committed election campaign.
In polls, the Social Democrats last stood at 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just just before the AfD (19).
In the 2011 election, the SPD had still clearly won at 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).
The Greens, small party with seven percent in the polls, are likely to create the leap into the land day.
They make a modern virtue from the holiday distress, and largely move their campaign to the Internet.
"Online campaigning," it calls the national chairman Claudia Müller.
Otherwise, green campaigners will go on trace search for local voters among holidaymakers.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, is curvy with a pet boat through the mecklenburgic lakes and still finds it beautiful.
Your impression: "election holiday in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment."
