Future of Portland's meltdown due to lifting of energy
The future of Portland's aluminium meltdown in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workers "jobs - are at stake, as the plant operator will terminate the energy supply contract, thereby lifting all supply contracts, as the delivering energy company announced.
This move followed the government's decision in Victoria earlier this year not to award any further subsidies to operate the plant.
A subsidy set for 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2000 jobs at Alcoa's plant in Portland are at stake.
No less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure.
In addition, it could come to domino effects, as the meltdown consumes about 10 percent of the total electricity generation Victorias consumed.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry Schmelzerei, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa's meltdown in Portland is losing money and risking a closure.
This move follows years of speculation about the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and, most recently, due to the electricity price for the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminum meltdown with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that it expects three other owners to cancel their contracts.
The plant is in the majority possession of a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity through the meltdown," the company said.
AGL also said the contracts were so-called "back-up deals" that should have come into effect from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period so they will end in 2017.
"Therefore AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenue in the 17 financial year," the electricity supplier said.
All potential impacts on revenue on AGL from GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL announced that it had already written off the value of the contracts in its $187 million annual report in "expectation of a termination."
Alcoa said that the decision to book the contracts, the "ability of Alcoas... To operate the meltdown or to ensure the power supply to the meltdown" does not impair.
The U.S. company said it had completed a 20 -year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which should have come into effect from November this year, even if it is still guilty of a statement as to why it resigned from the contract.
Analysts warn of the industry's poor economic conditions ahead of the possible closure of the Portland meltdown in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.
In reference to the analysts "statements earlier this week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumed around 600 megawatts and Tomago about 900 megawatts of electricity each year.
Should both plants disappear from the market, that would mean a significant reduction in demand in the [electricity market].
And for us as electricity producers, that would not be good, "he said.
