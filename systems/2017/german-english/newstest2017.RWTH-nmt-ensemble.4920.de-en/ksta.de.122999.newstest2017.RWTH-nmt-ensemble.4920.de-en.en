Rio 2016: ROBEL Kiros Habte becomes an internethit
Not always the Olympics or world records determine the headlines at the Olympics.
This shows the brave appearance of Robel Kiros Habte at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro.
At the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that at times he was no longer seen in the TV images.
He simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut was selected.
In the social networks, he subsequently became the viral internethit.
In fact, the 24-year-old finished his forehand with a backlog of 48 seconds and ranked 59th place of 59 starters.
It was, however, his not exactly sporting figure that attracted the attention of the international media.
Why the 24-year-old nevertheless takes part in the Olympics?
The Ethiopian got a special start from the international swimming association.
This is distributed to make swimming in under-represented countries more familiar.
As most athletes run in Ethopia, they just wanted to do something different.
Preparation is all: ROBEL Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.
Quickly, the first nicknames made the round.
Some media described him as "ROBEL of the Wal."
The English tabloid "the Sun" with "dad Bod" made it funny.
His time, he only struck with a minute and nearly five seconds over the 100 metre freestyle, played no role there.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.
At the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, the run of Eric Moussambani provided media attention.
Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea when he had to go on his own in a forehand over 100 metres of free style.
Frenetically, Moussambani was fired at the time.
The then 22-year-old only learned to swim eight months before Olympia and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.
