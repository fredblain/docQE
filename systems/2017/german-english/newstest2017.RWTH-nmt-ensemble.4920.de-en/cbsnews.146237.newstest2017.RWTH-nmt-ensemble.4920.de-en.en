Police: 3 victims shot in serial murder case at music hearing in car
According to police reports released Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot dead in one of the deadliest attacks for a decade in Phoenix's first serial murder case while they were entertaining in the car and listening to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot dead on June 12 while the car was parked in an entry, authorities said.
The offender fired eight shots from a handgun while he was on the car's front-passenger side and then fled with another vehicle, is read in the report.
Police announced that the triple murder did not appear to have been the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 that were owned by one of the adult victims.
Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard's police spokesman said the shooting was giving investigators a closer look at whether it is linked to four previous attacks.
In total, seven people were killed and two others wounded in Hispanic residential areas within four months in nine attacks.
"It happens in a residential area in front of a house," Howard told KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, earlier this month.
It is believed the suspect used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990 s, a black BMW from the late 1990 s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators refused to disclose the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same murderer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to her injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah still died on the ground.
A witness told police that it was not unusual for her to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
Authorities also released a police report on the shooting, aimed at an empty pickup truck half a hour before the triple murder and is believed to have been the work of the serial murderer.
Investigators found patron hulls and secured a bullet from the seat as well as bullet fragments from the engine room.
