Witnesses sought: beverage market covered in forest fires
A robbery was carried out on Thursday night on the beverage market of Rewe XXL at the Waldbröler Gerberstraße.
Under the aegis of a firearm, three darkly dressed people who had muzzled their faces were asked by the employee of the beverage market to release cash and then first flew on foot and then presumably with a silver-coloured VW golf.
How much money has been exploited does not divide the police.
The perpetrators should have been between 1.60 and 1.70 metres in size, so relatively small.
The beverage market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the Rewe-Market.
After the assault, the perpetrators must be in the direction of Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Way, and be flushed by the Scots car park with the silver-coloured car, possibly in the direction of B 256 (Schladernring).
Anyone who has made observations in connection with the robbery at the time of the attack (at 19,45 p.m.) is to report to the police as a matter of urgency.
