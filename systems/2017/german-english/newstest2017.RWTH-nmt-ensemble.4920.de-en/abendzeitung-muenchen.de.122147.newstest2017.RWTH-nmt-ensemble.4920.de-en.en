Jennifer Aniston: I'm always put in drawers
Jennifer Aniston doesn't always have to be perfect or successful.
That's what the Hollywood star has now made unequivocally clear in an interview.
"I always get stuck in drawers or get glued from the outside label, which has little to do with me and the reality."
"I myself do not want to be perfect and successful."
"Frankly, these things are more snug to me."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh at the fact that she is considered a "Miss Perfect" as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan."
After all, the actress spends her time at home, premiering TV with loose Dutt and Mexican food, the magazine says.
To the white glut, they raise the question of children's desire: "we women do not have to be married or have children to be perfect," according to the Hollywood Star.
In her new movie "Mother's Day - Love is not a Children's Game" Aniston is seen as a single mother of two sons.
The film runs with us from 25 August.
