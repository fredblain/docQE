Culture of Political Correctness leaves electoral fraud flourishing in Muslim areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year at the instigation of a government report
A culture of political correctness has meant that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is knowingly ignored as a devastating government report disclosed today.
Former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles is verbally attacking the police, election observers and town halls for having ignored evidence of electoral abuse due to "oversensitivities concerning ethics and religion."
The former Minister for Integration and Local Government, who is now an anti-corruption royal, said that intimidating voters from religious motives would be so bad that police should be allowed to set up lockout bands outside electoral cabins to protect intimidated voters.
He recommends that voters should have an identity card to prove their identity in elections.
At the moment, a voter only has to name his name and address.
The report proposes to put non-removable ink on a person's finger when they cast their voting votes to prevent someone from choosing twice.
Whistleblowers should receive more protection, says Sir Eric.
It calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions from non-official committees or working groups.
"This is not only against electoral fraud, but is also intended to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that goes with it," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlets election scandal in east London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that the acting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be dismissed after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his office.
The court found that Rahman would have "perverted" the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical way" and that he would have silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobia accusations.
Rahman is said to have "led his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."
Up to 300 votes were either dubious or the consequence of an imitation where one person chooses as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.
He was particularly alarming about the fraudulent letter election - where older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including driving out expulsions to prove the identity
In his report, it says: "As proof has been given that pressure has been put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, to vote in accordance with the will of the elderly, especially communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds.
"There were concerns that... State institutions had knowingly ignored such behavior because of" politically correct "oversensitivities concerning ethics and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including banning political activists from editing letters to stop "electoral harvesting."
The report, considered by Theresa May, also requires tougher registration reviews to prevent the electoral directory from being used for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask voters before choosing your card.
Non-removable ink on a person's finger as soon as she has cast her vote to prevent someone from choosing twice.
Carry out systematic reviews on a person's nationality to ensure they are eligible to vote.
A three -year limit on applications for an automatic letter choice.
Ban that political activists edit full letter elections and envelopes of letter elections.
Giving the police the power to set up lockouts around election stations.
A change in the law that facilitates an indictment of intimidation in accordance with the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Photography ban in polling stations.
Requirement that only English be used in the polling stations (except for Wales).
Intensifying the training to ensure that staff enforce the rule that voters go to the electoral cabin alone.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "astonishing" that after the Tower Hamlets case, no criminal charges were made.
"The electoral court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy to be inappropriate for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.
He was found guilty of a number of reasons, according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings.
He also criticizes the ineffective "hawkish controls" of town halls "electoral registration departments.
Sir Eric said: "the court ruling in Tower Hamlets of last year was a warning sign.
Our country has a proud heritage as the mother of the parliaments, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation.
