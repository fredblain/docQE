Nokia 9000 Communicator: the first smartphone
Email and Internet in slow motion: 20 years ago the Nokia Communicator came to the market.
The successors today dominate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed nearly half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it was not good either.
On the contrary, it was pretty kloy.
The built-in memory initially averaged eight megabytes, which would today be enough for roughly two selfies with high resolution.
An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" came to the shops exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996 - and it was the first smartphone.
For a few€, lovers can still buy the devices on the internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age.
20 years ago, however, the Communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair Cebit in Hanover as a "office in the West End format."
In fact, the new mobile phone could be a lot for then: SMS and emails could be sent and received, even by fax was the Communicator to reach.
Even access to websites was possible via HTML browser, albeit slowly slowly.
A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be folded up similar to a laptop.
Then found a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.
Quite proud was the price: 2700 D-mark, that is, about €1400.
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was €392 in 2015.
No one was able to guess in August 1996 that the Communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.
Since then, everything has been different.
The smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.
The Finns "mobile phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster, was eventually sold to Microsoft and wrapped up.
Today, the market dominates the market, all of which came much later than Nokia.
Always and everywhere online, this is today for a lot of people everyday.
In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.
Some 1.4 billion devices have been sold, and Samsung and Apple alone account for 555 million pieces.
Global sales with the equipment are around €400 billion.
On top of that, the well running business of the countless app providers and the telecoms corporations.
Around the smartphone, a whole industry has now emerged.
The crucial breakthrough to the mass market came only in early 2007, at the time Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced on the Mac-World the introduction of the iPhones.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an internet communicator, easy to use all by touch screen.
Apple's victory move began, still today the iPhone is the corporation's most important product.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who dominated the market, had the aftermath.
They eventually disappeared, Blackberry has struggled.
The saga now has Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung.
The smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention.
On average, every German now looks at his mobile phone 88 times a day.
"We must all learn to put the smartphone away," said Janina Kugel, in the Siemens Board of Human Resources.
Permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time.
