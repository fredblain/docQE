Disease case: when will the organiser pay
After their journey, diseased holidaymakers will only get money back if the cause of the disease can be found without doubt at the hotel.
However, this is only the case if more than ten percent of guests prove the same symptoms.
In the negotiated case, a family was severely ill on diarrhoea and eruption on the second day of their Turkish holiday.
She spent almost the entire holiday in the room.
Their illness led the holidaymakers back to a defective sewage treatment plant that had allegedly polluted the seawater.
The family felt that the journey had been flawed - and complained against the organiser.
In court, the plaintiffs had no success.
Although the treatment plant was in fact defective.
But the organiser only learned about it shortly before departure of the plaintiffs.
He had to assume by then that the sea water was in order.
So he did not violate his information obligations, according to the ruling.
Especially as no contaminations were found in the samples of the water.
The illness of several hotel guests - possibly by contagion among themselves - is part of the general risk of life.
Of 691 guests, only 38 were ill.
