Podolski attacks with "Gala" after Supercup
Hakan Sükr is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hakan Sükr.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time after the coup attempt, an important football match is taking place in Turkey.
Before the duel of the arch-rivals between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul around the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: "business as usual."
Even when the state of emergency was imposed after the accident in July, the government begged that the everyday life of ordinary citizens should not be affected.
However, this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, which is blamed for the coup attempt.
It does not stop at football.
Against the former Starkicker Hakan South, the prosecutor issued an arrest warrant.
As a result, South America, now living in America, is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
Sükr is said to be supporters of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is blamed by the state president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, for the coup attempt.
Although the state of emergency, which was initially imposed for 90 days, still applies until October, in fact, this has almost no impact on the lives of most Turks.
The night "democracy guards" in public places across the country declared Erdogan to be finished on Wednesday.
The sport - like the whole country - is divided into followers and opponents of Erdogan.
Especially fans of the Besiktas working-class club are traditionally not among the president's friends.
What unites the bulk of the Turks, however, in the face of dramatic experiences in history, is the strict rejection of military coups.
Even the fans themselves agree - no matter whether their heart beats for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
In the case of gala winner "Gala" there will be a special return to Lukas Podolski.
His sporting value showed the Cologne in the past season: with 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions, the 31-year-old finished his first game time as his club's top scorer.
In the final game against Fenerbahce, he scored the 1:0 victory.
The newspaper "Fanatik" joked him: "he was the best in the place."
He has completed the season in an excellent way and secured his team the trophy.
Thanks to "Poldi," the disappointing season for the record champion found a conciliatory conclusion.
After the pre-run-k.o in the Champions League, the "lions" also differ in the Europa League early.
In the South Lig, it only ranged to rank six.
The season was not good.
The trophy was the only way to win something.
"We did this and that is the most important thing," said Podolski.
For Master Besiktas, the game year ran better.
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who, with 26 seasons, laid the base for the 14th title as a South League goalkeeper.
That's also the reason fans continue to hope for the 31 -year-old's return.
At the same time, the Gomez, who was under the auspices of the AC Florence, and which was only borrowed at Besiktas, had announced that he would not return because of the political situation in the country after his EM holiday.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he only has to say it," said the magazine "Kicker" club chief Fikret Orman.
In order to do this, however, the storm would have to be prepared to renounce around a third of its annual salary estimated at €7.5 million, and Orman made it clear: "we cannot pay his salary at Florence."
