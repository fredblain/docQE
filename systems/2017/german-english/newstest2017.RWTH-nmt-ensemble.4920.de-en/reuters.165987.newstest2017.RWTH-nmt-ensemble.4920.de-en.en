Condoms with chilipuders, fireworks promote Tanzania's elephant protection
Naturalists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to stop elephants from going in man-made settlements - they throw condoms on them filled with chilipuders.
The method has proved effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which already had the idea to do so years ago, has stepped up its promotion, along with U.S. nature conservation, by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four -step method to protect their homes and harvests without hurting animals.
Previously, many spears used to defend themselves.
Friday is World Telephone Day dedicated to animal welfare.
"Since we developed this... Toolkit, we have been able to observe a change in their attitudes within these communities, and they are much more confident that they can hold the elephants off their fields without hurting the elephant," the CEO of Honeyguide Damian Bell said in a communication.
The first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a torch and the blaze into a horn.
If he is not deterred, a so-called "chili cloud" is thrown.
Chilipuder mixed with earth is packed together with a fireworks body into a condom, the end of which is turned up to the ignition.
When it is ignited, the condom bursts with a bang and sprays fine dust to chilipuder into the air.
A hint quite usually already already out to jail the elephant.
One last possibility is an advertiser who shoots a golden fireworks in the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
