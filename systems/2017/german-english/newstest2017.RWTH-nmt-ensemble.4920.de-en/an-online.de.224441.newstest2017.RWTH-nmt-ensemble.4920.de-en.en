Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid
His experiences on the horse are manageable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer, with some colleagues, sought a bit of change with an exit on the beach.
For the 58 -year-old, it was a premiership.
Chio: "golden sports pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses remembered their holidays, they jailed in the fast gallop home to the feedingstuffs.
One kilometre at that pace, I've been scared.
"It was not a good experience," says Langer.
And then the riding career ended again.
On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament wins - was back near horses.
He left with his family over the plant of the ALRV, on a horse he didn't even swap for photo purposes.
Long was the first time in Aachen and therefore also at the CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German sports aid handed over the Golden Sports pyramid to the man from Anhausen as part of a small gala.
At awards, the sympathetic athlete is not lacking.
Federal Cross of Merit, Silver's Lorbeerblatt, Champions Tour Player of the year...
Even the British Queen has already adored him.
Long is the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid.
In Aachen, he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
"This award means a great deal to me," says Langer, "because it will be awarded not only for sporting success, but also for social engagement."
For decades, Langer has been promoting the offspring.
And so he also gave the prize money of €25,000 straight away.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the dual U.S. Masters winner was admitted to the "hall of Fame of German Sports" on Saturday.
The exhibits include the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the Father Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob-driver Meinhard Ner, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumping rider Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumously the handballer Erhard Wunderlich.
Many of these sports legends had come to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrious society migrated to the Springstadion, where the Lavazza prize ran.
Bernhard Langer kept distance to the big animals.
