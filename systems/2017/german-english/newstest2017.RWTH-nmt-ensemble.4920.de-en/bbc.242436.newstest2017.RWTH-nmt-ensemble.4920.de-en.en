Russia's Putin fired chief of staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly sacked his chief of staff, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of Putin's closest confidence circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has been appointed a special envoy for environmental and transport matters.
In an opinion from the Kremlin, it is that, without giving reasons, Putin "ordered the dismissal of Ivanov from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration."
Anton Vaino, who has been Ivanov's deputy since 2012, has been appointed to his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the embassy in Tokyo.
On the Kremlin's website, it says (in Russian) that he was later protocol chief and chief executive of the government staff.
On his appointment, he said to Putin: "thank you for your confidence."
I think that it is the government's most important task to support your work as head of state on draft legislation and controls to implement your instructions.
Putin told the Russian TV broadcaster on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Convince the smiling faces?
This move has made Moscow mysterious.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidants and works like he did for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.
As a chief of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, broadcast on television, both men claimed that the chief of staff resigned at his own request.
But despite the smile for the cameras, here are few convinced - especially now, just before the general election.
So, is this the result of a kind of power struggle?
Nobody knows that at the moment.
But the official claim - that a man who was once praised as a potential president at once would want to guide Russian environmental policy - came to great scepticism.
In his remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said "it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 to give me this very complicated post - one could almost say - to entrust burdensome posts for four years.
As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took the post in December 2011.
Previously, he was deputy prime minister and defence minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, former member of the state security service KGB.
In the late 1990 s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov one of five people he trusted most.
It was once believed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term, as Putin's third term would have violated the Constitution.
But this post was taken by another, nearby ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before becoming president again three and a half years later.
