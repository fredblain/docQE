Building ground in double pack
With issues around construction, the local council has been focusing on the most recent meeting.
With relief, the body noted the communication from Mayor Robert Putz that "finally the marketing of the recently designated residential areas can begin."
After the plot, parenting and development issues have been clarified and applications for surveying could be made, the sale of the land in the residential areas "road" and "Schönau-West" (area Binderstraße - Exhibition section 1) is no longer in the way of interested parties.
The local council is convinced that the building areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schönau are addressing young families and rugged seniors alike.
As it was said, from now on, builders can report themselves at the town hall, on the award of the parcels the local council is expected to advise in its September meeting.
In order to be able to comply with questions relating to the setting-up of other commercial enterprises, together with the creation of jobs, the local council decided to amend the land use plan, which was only re-established in the spring of this year, in sub-areas.
For example, in the area of subtime, the commercial area already designated there is extended by two parcels towards State Road 2112.
