Salzburger "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare year, the Salzburg Festival presents the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic love pair, similar to Romeo and Julia.
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story," Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.
The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical to the temple of the classics and met with the role of Maria a youth space.
In the orchestral ditch the Simón Bolívar Orchestra led by the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "this music is full of rhythm," he warmed.
We always say that it is very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and melody.
It's a wonderful mixture, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say that we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this staging, Bartoli plays an older sought-after Maria.
She remembers waking up to her love with Tony, while the younger Maria plays and dances.
The role of Maria has always fascinated me.
First, because it is musically extraordinary!
And then there would be Maria's personality.
She says it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright."
So she's smart, of course, also naive, and very passionate.
"She resembles me very much, my Italian character, which I have as a Roman," laughs Bartoli.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It's such a honour for us to work with her.
She is an immensely generous person.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
Conducting is a necessity for him.
You see it in each of his movements, in his eyes, it's his life!
It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a more southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a cheerful approach to life, which is very important at all!
For American director Philip Wm McKinley, the "West Side Story" is highly topical: "this piece is about prejudice and fanaticism."
Today, we have the refugees, at that time the Puertorians went to New York, and the New York residents did not want them.
They are the same issues, and they are just as meaningful today as they were then.
59 years later, the piece is still relevant.
