Olympia: triple fraud in doping test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary commission on the case.
Kenya's athletes are dropping Ungemach after the second doping affair at the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
After a fraud attempt at a doping control in the Olympic village, Kenya sent a coach home.
The International Olympic Committee announced that it would immediately set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official had announced that the former sprinter and present-day coach, John Anzrah, had handed out an urine probe in the Olympic village under the name of the 800 -metre runner Ferguson Rotich.
This was reported to Kenya's team management by the doping inspectors.
The IAAF World Federation has asked the IOC for information on the case to make its own inquiries, an IAAF spokesman said.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent actions of the IOC, the IAAF will carry out an assessment," an IAAF statement said.
"He (Anzrah) has gone to the doping control station and has spent himself as Ferguson Rotich, the probe handed out and signed," declared Kenya's chief of mission Stephan Arap Soi.
He was in possession of the athlete's accreditation, which was on the list for the World Anti-Doping Agency's training checks.
Ferguson Rotich had become more than 800 metres in Beijing in 2015.
Four days earlier, Kenyan athletics leader Michael Rotich had been deducted from the Rio Games.
He is said to have informed sportsmen of his country about upcoming doping tests.
According to media reports, he should have been arrested on his return at Nairobi airport.
Kenya has been under special observation for a long time at the IOC after numerous doping offences.
In announcing the IOC's more than 2000 doping target controls before the Rio Games, it was unusually pointed out previously that athletes from Kenya and Russia are being targeted.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was passed a few weeks before Olympic start.
As a result, the WADA Kenya took from the list of countries whose doping is compliant with the rules of WADA.
Kenya is considered a major runner nation.
The country's athletes won the most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.
In a series of television reports from the ARD, accusations have repeatedly been made that in Kenya doping funds are easily accessible and there is to be a significant mentality of sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound last called for a similar investigation in Kenya, as he had done in Russian athletics.
It has been proven that this sport has been covered in a comprehensive and systematic way.
Russia's athletes were then excluded from the summer games.
