Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by battle with the coach's cancer to rowing victory
There will be no more emotinous gold than in those games and that's what what is going to mean.
From the first rowing strike to the last, 220 hard Hieve, who go down in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an extra meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though it was only the ones who sat at the helm, there were three votes in the boat, the echo of the coach Robin Williams, who was alluding to the second Olympiagold in two without a tax woman in a row, the first women in the history of British sport who put such a scale.
Their dominance was absolutely, after all, their 39th unbeaten use, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes gliding across the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the nature of the triumph.
Behind every gold in rowing is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental advances that make up the difference and it was no one more helpful than the coach who did not know 30 months ago whether he would survive that day at all, when cancer was diagnosed with him.
As he said, he's risky.
I had bladder cancer that is operable and that they did.
If you don't, he's spreading everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes a little the outlook.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were lucky that he was able to start treatment in early 2014, outside the season, which kept the interruption to a minimum if that is the right term in such circumstances.
I needed money, so it had to go better again soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in hospital and ran around at the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice.
That's how it starts.
Rowing in itself is already a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one.
In the immediacy of victory, her first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve-wracking morning talking a little more than usual, trying to process his own fears.
Stanning, who was the main man in the Royal Artillery Regiment in a bet in Afghanistan, said "I was an emotional wreck this week, which is perhaps something extreme, but it means so much."
It only repeats how much this means to me, how much I and Helen and also Robin have worked.
It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin we would be no one, so a massive thank you to him, he is the best coach in the world.
I wouldn't have wanted a better person for training or a better coach.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the past five years.
The pair had a tough rhythm with which their opponents couldn't keep up.
Even in the last 500 metres, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to open up, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very caught at the moment.
Helen called "stay in the process, stay in the process."
It is really important not to get involved.
We had a good start and at the same time we weren't looking to make some tolls.
We didn't want a fireworks today, we just wanted to achieve a good result, go out and win the race, which we did as well.
The pair will take a break for a year before making decisions about his future.
Glover must appear on a wedding next week, her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say that was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London, it took about six months to realise that I am an Olympic champion.
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed.
Here it took about four minutes.
That feels so much better, "she said.
