A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local shopping centre.
The victim's brother said he can't imagine anyone who would want to hurt him, "at last, he went uphill again."

A spokesman for the Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and destroyed at the ground" over his death.
"We are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss him painfully," the spokesman continued.
Our thoughts and condolences are at this difficult time at Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia admitted that Frank first lived in hostels, but that "things went uphill for him at last."
"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend," said Louis Garcia KGO.
Louis Galicia said that he could not imagine anyone wanting to harm his younger brother.
He was a friendly person with a big heart.
His way of connecting with his family was to always cook us to prepare dinner, "said Louis Galicia.
