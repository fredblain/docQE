Volkswagen is still glimpsed.
Despite diesel scandals, extradition figures worldwide are rising.
But not all markets are running around.
In the case of recall, there is a term for a term.
Volkswagen is staring at the deliveries more forcefully into the second half of the year.
In the past year, despite the diesel affair, Europe's largest automobile can continue to show a plus, thanks to its many brands and some well-running markets.
But in July, the core brand, VW, weakened mainly in Western Europe, and thus again burdened the total sales, as the company listed in the Dax said.
Worldwide, the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles in July than in the previous month.
In Western Europe alone, after China the second most important market, sales were up 14 percent below the previous month.
In Germany's home market, deliveries sacked by almost a sixth.
Brand sales chief JÃ¼rgen Stackmann attributed the weaker figures from July, mainly to two sales days less in Europe.
Moreover, in some core markets, there has been a retention of purchase by "changing economic conditions."
In addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey, the UK vote to leave the EU also strained, a spokeswoman explained.
In the US, where the exhaust affair first escalated, there is also a minus to beech.
Big support for VW is the Chinese market.
In total, the mainly affected house brand of Lower Saxony is still glimpsed by the diesel scandal: after the first seven months, only an extradition minus of 0.9% to 3.37 million vehicles is to be found.
Group sales chief Fred Kappler was able to continue to show a sales luck from January to July.
1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen at this time, worldwide 5.904 million.
Volkswagen had manipulated exhaust tests with a software.
In Germany alone, VW calls about 2.5 million cars to convert to the workshops.
In the course of the conversion, VW reiterated that the conversion of the cars has no negative impact.
After the conversion of the vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power.
After retrofitting, the automobile exhibits a "guarantee" certificate, but it does not talk about a "guarantee," as it said on Friday in business circles.
The reason is legal.
The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen now guarantees its German customers a guarantee of converted diesel models.
This would have confirmed VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday.
From the Department of Transportation, it was confirmed that there was this meeting.
"VW has to comply fully with the requirements of my commission of inquiry and the KBA."
"Deviations from this are not accepted," said Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), according to the ministry.
VW has taken on the guarantee that, in the case of fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power, no deterioration will occur after the conversion, and that all typical vehicle values will remain unchanged.
Volkswagen itself uses the term "guarantee" but not as it was called in corporate circles.
In the broad term "guarantee," Volkswagen sees the possibility for customers, for example, to get into a workshop half a year after retrofitting, for example, and to return this to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
Even in the interests of the customer, it is important to avoid the fact that, in the event of any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust scandal, it will be insecure in terms of possible warranty arrangements, as it was called.
That is why VW does not use the term "guarantee."
