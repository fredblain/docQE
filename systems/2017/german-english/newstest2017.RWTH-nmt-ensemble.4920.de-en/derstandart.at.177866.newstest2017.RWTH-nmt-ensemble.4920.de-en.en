Ma Long in a separate league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis champion.
The 27-year-old defeated his countryman and "title defender" Zhang Jike 4:0 (12.5,4.4) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro in an one-sided final.
As a result, the world class first picked up the "golden Grand Slam" with successes at World Cup, World Cup, World Tour Final Tournament and Olympia.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
The two Chinese, as expected, got into the final game and made the title of each other.
So it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would pick up the single title in the sign of the Five Rings.
Last non-Chinese on the top Olympic stairwell was former SVS NÖ-legionnaire Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left on the plate alone, between the sentences and at time-outs they had no coaches at themselves.
They had withdrawn to the grandstand and left their shooters alone in the fair competition.
"The matches to here I played for my country."
"In the final I play for me," Zhang had said folly.
After the match, gold and silver medal winners with the China flag.
The match itself was unexpectedly one-sided.
Ma had only really struggled with his 28-year-old opponent in the first set.
After that, he determined the pace at the plate, leaving Zhang with only a total of 13 points.
The superiority of Ma did not develop the expected matching match.
But, nevertheless, there were plenty of breathtaking ball changes to be seen.
Mizutani won the game around bronze against the 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4:1.
In his quarter-final against German European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov, the Belarusian had suffered a rib injury, after which he was in medical treatment, had to "ultimately" settle with bleach.
The Swedes Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) were, by the way, in similarly high table tennis Olympia-Fourth.
