Adblock Plus, Facebook in "cat and Mouse Game" on ad blocking
For companies that earn money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers, attempts are made to bypass ad blocking, a "cat and mouse game."
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block display blockages on its desktop side, Adblock Plus released a blog post saying that users could update their filters in the program to again block advertising on the social network.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop side would change the encoding with regard to its advertisements to make it more difficult to detect the detection of which part of the page advertising is.
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.
In a blogpost, Adblock Ben Williams' spokesman wrote that "this kind of Hin-and-Her-fight between the ad blocking open source community and the bypasses has already been under way since the invention of display blockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution.
The fact that the world's largest company has entered the fight for social media is a strong indication of how worrying ad blockers have become for the industry.
Around the world, according to a study published last year by Pagefair and Adobe, about 200 million people use display blockers; nearly four times as much in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile advertising makes up 84 percent of advertising revenue Facebooks.
The company has it on display blockers on desktop PCs, as mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a spokesman said.
Advertising on Desktop PCs accounts for a sufficiently large proportion of revenue, so that Facebook appears to be rewarding the investment of such a step.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update its "ad preference" tool to have people more control over advertising aimed at them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that adblock new filters would be worrying because they would also block content on the page that is not advertising.
"This is not a positive experience for users, so we plan to address the problem," a spokesman for Facebook said in an email message.
Ad blockers are a stump means, which is why we have instead focused on developer tools like Ad Preferences to put more control in people's hands.
