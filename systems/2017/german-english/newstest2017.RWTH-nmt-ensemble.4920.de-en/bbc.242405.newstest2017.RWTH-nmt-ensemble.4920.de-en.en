Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland no longer available
The RBS brand is expected to be reduced to a back-office role, according to the bank's chief executive.
Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank has since distanced itself when it had to be almost collapsed and rescued eight years ago.
During this time, brand strategists have used "RBS" to protect other end consumer finance brands.
She supported international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship, from Six Nations rugby to the Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now it has decided to put more national brands in focus.
Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralised headquarters and the stock market listing will switch to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller brands for retail banking, which will be more important - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a sighting tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "the RSB brand will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed, as we now become more of a bank of brands."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I say now that we are not pursuing global goals, but local goals.
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers under these brands.
RBS has already said it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the perceptibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship.
"It's time for us to develop to the bank of brands, because how do we focus inside (we asked) to make this a better bank for customers?" Said the CEO.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think you will see a lot of changes.
We can launch these brands again, so I think the time has come.
