Treats wants nude calendars for "women and for men"
The Treats magazine works with photographer David Bellemere to bring out a 1970 s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they would like to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muses Kalendar for 2017.
The editor-in-chief of Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude magazine was different from Oldschool-Playboys, since "Playboy is for men."
I do that for women.
He seems to think that it does the calendars.
"We need to return to the display of timeless and classic nudity, where both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body," Shaw said in a press release on the publication of the calendar.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a wonderful work of art.
Models can submit their images online or personally at open casting call in Los Angeles and New York.
