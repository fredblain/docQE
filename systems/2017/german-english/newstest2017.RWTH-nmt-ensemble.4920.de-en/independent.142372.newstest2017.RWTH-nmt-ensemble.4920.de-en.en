Britain picks up silver in 7 -er rugby after Fiji Masterclass catches gold
Britain's impressive performance at the 7 -er rugby came in the final on Thursday night to an abrupt hold at the last hurdle in the form of the Fijis when they were beaten with a 43 - 7 result at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji issued a masterclass in the handling, side-stepping, retrofitting, line run and raw force to win gold - their first Olympics medal of any colour.
The defeat was sweetened by the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth that day - and they were able to be very proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The clear defeat of the Boks, 7 - 5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall back on them in the final.
But regardless, Fiji would have beaten a 15 -man team in best form at that form.
It could be a consolation for GB - but it probably won't - that at least one Briton will hang a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's chief trainer Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult path behind.
Eight years ago, they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens under Ryan.
Here they lost only one.
This sap will hurt, but progress is astonishing.
Fiji began miraculously, leaving the attacking GBs out of fun.
It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. as if you were running into driving buses, and the World Series winners went up 5 - 0 when Osea Kolinisau was in the corner.
With still four minutes of game time, Jerry Tuwai added yet another attack from the right corner he converted.
12 - 0 and GB hardly touched the ball.
A hevorraging Tackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa reaching a third gate, but it only held up Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua lured a touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0 - 17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the rematch and there was still over a minute of game time... In the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou pressured through further weak Tacklings of the GB team and stumbled down to the line to make a gate.
The conversion brought a 29 - 0 to the break.
It is as if Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB is still learning.
That is the way it is.
GB carried out fundamental changes at half-time and closed the fijian gap... For whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half until Josua Tuisova ran through after a brilliant intermediate play by Fiji.
Dan Norton launched a try for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36 - 7, but the game has long been in favor of the South Seasons, whose fans sang, flags swapped and danced in the grandstand.
It was not hard to admire Fijis "playful approach.
Mata Viliame set the i-TÃ¼pfelchen with another try in the final seconds.
The Pfiff tweeted, the Fijis hugged himself and GB kicked devastated in the lawns.
Earlier on the day, Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi-finals with 20 - 5 and Britain urged South Africa in a tight semi-final match from the race - Britain's transformation of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the Boks forward in the first half but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate among the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late Tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15 -Aside team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.
