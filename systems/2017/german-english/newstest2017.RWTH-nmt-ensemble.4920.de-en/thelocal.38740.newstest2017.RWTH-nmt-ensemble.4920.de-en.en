Woman in suspected suicide on Swiss highway
The victim was in the middle of the night on the highway.
Police are calling on witnesses after a woman was overturned in the early hours of Thursday in a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a highway.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the Canton of Vaud just after midnight.
A woman put herself in the dark "in an act of despair" and was hit by several cars, police said in Vaud.
It is obvious that a Swiss at the age of 49, who was overrun by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill himself.
She still died on the ground.
Several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, the police said, urging these as well as any witnesses to the incident to sign up.
An investigation has been opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter told the Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed.
Was a collision avoidable?
This is something the prosecutor has to decide, "said Hofstetter.
Two similar cases over the past five years show that drivers are not being held accountable.
In each of the two cases - where a person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that motorists would not have to assume that a pedestrian was running on the highway in the middle of the night, as was said in the newspaper.
Last year a policeman was acquitted of negligent killing after she had overrun and killed a man who was on the A1 near Payerne in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and has become unconscious on the street, the court heard.
The court found that the policeman -- who had replied to an emergency call -- drove in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a "completely extraordinary and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone who has more information on Thursday's incident near Morges should contact police at number 021.644 83 46 or 021.644 44 44.
