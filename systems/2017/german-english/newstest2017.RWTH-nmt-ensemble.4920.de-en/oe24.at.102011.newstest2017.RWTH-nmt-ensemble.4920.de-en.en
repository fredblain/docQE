Killed in bomb attack: he was the hero of Aleppo
He put his own life at risk to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar devoted his life to the people of Syria.
He risked everything to save others.
Now the 30-year-old himself has died in a face-bomb attack by the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the "white Helmets," a civil protection group that, according to the Bild newspaper, saved nearly 60,000 people so far.
2900 volunteers put their own lives at risk to pull people out of crushed houses and to provide first aid in the war area.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: a video of the civil protector showing him at a 11 -hour rescue of a baby from the rubble of a house went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrian to the luminous symbol figure in the horror of war.
As heroes, however, he has never seen himself, according to the picture: "for me, this is the real Jihad."
"When I dare to save lives, I think that God sees a martyr in me."
Shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack, he had spoken in a video about the last bombings in Syria.
The helicopters have thrown off four facial bombs above the Alzadia district, one was filled with chlorine gas.
A woman and two children died, and seven people are suffering from breathing.
"We are now eliminating the toxic remains of the bomb so that not children play with it," the picture quotes his last words before he died.
The Assad regime's deadly bomb was supposed to hit terrorists.
