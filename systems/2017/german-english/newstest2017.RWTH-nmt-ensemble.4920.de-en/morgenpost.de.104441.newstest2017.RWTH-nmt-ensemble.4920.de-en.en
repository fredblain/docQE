Post rises in trade in electric transporters
An electric delivery vehicle of Deutsche Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the hazard appears to be great.
The post plans to sell its electric vehicle StreetScooter as well.
In the near future, the Group intends to launch the trade with the transporter.
The post also wants to offer its electric transporters on the free car market from next year.
"We want to enter the sale to third parties," a post spokesman said on Friday.
The company has been investigating for months whether to sell its self-developed streetScooter, with which letters and packs are delivered, to other establishments as well.
Post board member JÃ¼rgen Gerdes had said there were repeatedly enquiries, such as from craftsmen.
According to the news magazine "der Spiegel," the Bonn Group wants to enter the mass production of vehicles shortly.
In the post-own factory, the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and layer.
Gerdes had announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and in the long term a complete conversion to the environmentally friendly vehicles.
"We will take a very, very robust step towards 2020," he said at the end of July.
I can imagine that we are changing the whole fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on Germany's roads since 2014.
