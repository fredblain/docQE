Gilead receives legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A U.S. District Court judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to the reimbursement of the legal costs incurred by her from the Hepatits C legal battle with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was freed from a $200 million damages payment for breaching two patents of Merck, which were in connection with the blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead, after an U.S. judge revealed a pattern of misconduct by Mercks, including the opinion of opinion and other unethical acts.
In charging the lawsuit on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead is entitled to decree the costs incurred while defending the case.
Merck is trying to equalise with Gilead, which dominates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can heal over 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed property on laboratory work, which Sofosbuvir was based on, the active ingredient in Gilead's medications.
