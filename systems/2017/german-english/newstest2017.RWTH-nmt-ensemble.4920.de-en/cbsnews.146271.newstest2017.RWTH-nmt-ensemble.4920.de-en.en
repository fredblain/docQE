Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It's getting better '
Like most 6 -year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But like the least of his contemporaries, Edmund has microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder about which his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing during her pregnancy.
When he came home for the first time, my first thought was, I'm not creating that.
I'm not creating that.
I did not admit that.
What is not true at all -- of course, it has been adhered to, "she said.
Her husband Vincent and her has been told that Edmund may never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far as to suggest that they institutionalize it.
"My first answer to that was" I didn't know that people still do, "" explained Picciuto.
Edmund can run with the help of a remedy.
Edmund could not sit or crash until his third year of life and he still can't speak.
But he is making slow progress.
He can run with support and bike ride.
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the character language that Edmund thought for "please sing me something before."
"We bring it to him," Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not a typical character language -- she says, Edmund has invented some characters alone.
Microcephaly has a variety of causes: genetic as well as Edmund, as well as infections with viruses such as measles or the Zikavirus during pregnancy.
The symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it will affect the lives of those infected with the Zikavirus.
Picciuto remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I constantly asked what will happen?
What will happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven't asked for the prediction for a long time, because I don't expect them to be able to tell me anybody really.
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth damage caused by the Zikavirus.
It's getting better.
You know it's going to get better for you.
You'll love your child and your child will love you.
