Clinton's and Trump's economic policies in comparison: it's all about the money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade deal - that's what both Clinton and Trump want.
However, the two U.S. presidential candidates are divided on fiscal and energy policy, as well as on a fundamental issue.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical, difference.
The, about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small, and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate to death, he says.
He himself, on the other hand, would be very different, Trump claims.
He will cut back on regulations massively, and he is strongly committed to wide-ranging tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for businesses.
Clinton, on the other hand, says that the state has certain tasks to perform, it has disadvantaged opportunities to open up and needs money for it.
That's why taxes would be increased for the rich, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure.
In the need to be invested, Trump and Clinton say almost worthwhile.
The democratic candidate is even announcing the biggest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.
Government investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic politics, and are, for example, strictly rejected by the Republican state's state-run Teaparty wing.
So, on Trump, bipartisan discussions could still be held.
The differences in energy and climate policy are clearer.
Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and drive up coal production in the U.S. again.
Oil extraction should also be possible in previously protected areas, and the Paris climate change agreement is intended to terminate it.
Clinton, on the other hand, explicitly wants to expand renewable energies with her investment program, calling for "a country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs."
"It will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be."
But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other.
TPP, the Trans-Pacific Trade Agreement, both do not want to sign.
At the same time, however, both do not want to isolate the U.S. from international trade - but simply to better protect American jobs.
They should then be paid better, for example, for Clinton.
The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger wage.
It wants to raise it to $15 a hour.
What Trump wants to do on this issue is not entirely clear: once he says: the minimum wage has to go up, then he says he should not be altered.
But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more about the tax policy of the two camps.
On one side is Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth.
His critics believe that this would only increase the budget deficit.
On the other hand, Clinton, who, at least, wants to ask the rich to pay more taxes, and whose critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.
