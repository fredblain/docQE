Buyer in Primark outraged over woman who shamelessly tried underwear in the middle of business
The buyers didn't know where they should look when a woman pulled out her clothing amid a primark to try underpants.
To make the situation worse, she mustered how she looked in it, pulled her out and put her back to the shelf.
She continued to stoke and tried four pairs of underhoses in a shop at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone, Feb.

A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the business at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear, "she attracted herself again and left the business without buying anything."
She said: "people couldn't believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the sales area, she took a pair of underpants from the outlay, pulled out her own tights and pants and tried her.
"She didn't even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, freaking out like Oskar."
"Everyone starred when they pulled out the underhoods, who obviously didn't like it, as they put them back into the shelf."
She repeated the same with three other underhoods before finally deciding that you liked nothing, got back and ran out.
"She didn't seem to disrupt it that she was watching someone - or thinking about the person who might buy the underhoods she had tried."
Ms Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: "how disgusting to think that someone would take underhoods with home that had a different person and who were not washed."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms Davidson added: "As I got along, the staff tried to pull the garments out of the sale after it went - which is just as good. '
"I'd hate to go home with a new pair of underhoods and find out that another woman had her and pulled out again and they weren't washed up."
A spokesman for Primark said: "Primark is aware of the incident that occurred in our branch in Folkstone on Tuesday 9 August."
All the products in question were pulled out of the sale.
