Schorndorf: burglary searched with helicopter
The police helicopter flew different areas for about a hour - unsuccessful.
Two unknown men are forcibly penetrated into an apartment in a multi-family home in the Lindenweg on Friday morning at 8,50 am.
The resident surprised the two and struck the unholy into the escape.
The two men were about 1.65 to 1.70 metres large, arguably masked, wearing both bluejeans and black hood pulses.
They fled towards the city centre.
To punish, police set up several strip crews as well as a police helicopter.
The punishment went without success.
Perhaps the unknown in front of the apartment was close to the apartment or when it was fleeing.
