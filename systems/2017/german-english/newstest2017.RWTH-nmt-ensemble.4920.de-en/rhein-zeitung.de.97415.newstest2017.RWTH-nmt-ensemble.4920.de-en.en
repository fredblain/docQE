Councillor decides unanimously: no Kioskneubau at St Goarer Rhine Rhine
Normally, the St. Goarer investment projects by tradesmen with Kusshand are taking place - in particular, the retail trade in the core city is considered to be significant.
However, the city council now unanimously rejected the request for the new construction of a sales skip on the Rhine bank in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine Balcons under construction.
"In principle, we welcome new tradesmen, but at this location in exposed location on the Rhine bank, this kiosk does not fit," said Michael Hubrath for the CDU Group.
