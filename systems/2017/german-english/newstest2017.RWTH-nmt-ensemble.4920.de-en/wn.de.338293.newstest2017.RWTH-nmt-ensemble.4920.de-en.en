Intercultural journey: cultural offers for schools
The international class of the Waldschule visited the play "the Invisible House."
The Nima's Association and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project.
The Nima's Association allows young people with a migrant and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "class International" of the Waldschule Kinderhaus has visited an idea of the award-winning piece "the invisible house" of the boy Theatre Münster.
In the context of the "intercultural journey" initiated by the association Nima's, 19 students between eleven and 15 years of age attended the staging in the Little House.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which aims at the cultural integration of young people with a migrant and refugee background, has been offering schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster within the framework of this project.
Most of the youngsters of the class came to Münster from September 2015 to March 2016, among others, from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria.
Thanks to the choreographies, the scenic images and video animations, they had been able to follow the course of action, according to the press release of the boy Theaters Münster.
The Nima's Association, founded by Dr Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel, and the Young Theatre will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project.
From October to December, young people with and without an escape and migrant background between the ages of 14 and 20 are to be given the opportunity to attend professional courses in the areas of singing, dance, spectacle and music.
Offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theatrical language mediation are in the planning.
The "intercultural journey" project continues.
Given the increased numbers of refugees, the club reckons with many classes wanting to participate.
