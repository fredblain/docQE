Snapchat "Anime" effect criticised as Asian cartoon
Snapchat says this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to breeds.
With its filter tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that already borders on the absurd.
You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The filters are blunt, stand-alone tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All mistakes are made to the public.
Snapchat filters have attracted criticism in the past, in which they were accused that the app would propel blackface or white skin as a beauty deal.
When, this week, some users suggested a filter that gave them slashes, false teeth and woven cheeks, some critics called a racist caricature of Asians - "yellow face."
They wondered whether these repeated controversies pointed to a bigger problem that the company has with diversity.
The news and outrage were widely shared on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced it would have deactivated the feature.
The company offered an apology: the filter was thought to be a tribute to anime characters rather than as a caricature of Asians.
But outsiders who have experienced racism reminded the filter of offending clich√©s.
Others strongly rejected the anime comparison.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about the photos became widespread, wrote that the filter was "offensive and, to say the least, uncomfortable."
She added that "it is difficult to argue with the counter-rendition of a very disgusting Asian caricature and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow, but that the yellow face has been dragged into the devalued extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stumbling wire.
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand.
And Snapchat's big audience of young people - who are in terms of race different than their older counterparts - might be more likely to expect sensitivity.
If one of Snapchat's filters creates an image that is offensive to an user, "so it's much harder that such things remain unnoticed than it used to be," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for Medium, decided to extinguish her Snapchat account urged others to do the same.
In an upset for medium and in a phone interview, she said that she believes racial controversies reflect a lack of diversity in recruitment practices at Snapchat.
Zhu criticized the largely white, only male leadership and finished her upset with a hashtag:\ HASH DeleteSnapchat.
"Either they have no representation of people with other skin colours in their workforce, so they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colours who work there but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say what."
Others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely left unanswered.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its staff, but according to a spokesman, the company recently recruited a staff member focused on under-represented populations and on internal integration efforts.
For her part, Zhu said that she will leave her Snapchat account closed and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to be able to say that this is not O.K."
