Scots Callum Skinner storms home when Briton erects gold for cycling
Scotland's Callum Skinner raced last night in the men's team-sprint in the Velodrom in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role that his fellow countryman, Sir Chris Hoy, had embraced, making the legend proud when he stumbled home to win a victory from New Zealand's favourites.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy picked up the fifth of six Olympics medals.
They repeated the trick after they picked up only a modest sixth place in March at the rail world championships in London despite the resignation of Hoys.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver, Jamie Staff.
They did so in time as Hindes appeared.
Hoy's retirement produced a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man they stayed at when they saw potential in the Scot, which has now unfolded.
Hindes, Kenny - who sided with Hoy four years ago - and skinners set an Olympics record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds, the New Zealanders won in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
Hindes was barely back after his round, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.
A change of strategy made up a large part of the transformation, at which Hindes drove in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep the pace.
Hoy looked from his position as a BBC expert and dropped skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they rose to the podium.
The 23-year-old skinner from Glasgow said: "it's a flattering comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make me a name.
We set up an Olympic record in the end and defeated the world champions.
It was just unbelievable.
There is no better way to win this.
After the 2012 triumph at the Kenny and Hoys side, Hindes admitted that he deliberately fell on the railways after a weak start.
He later withdrew that statement and there was no objection from England's rivals.
With such a surprising victory, this time there was no such problem.
Hindes said: "it feels with all the GB flags in the gallery like London."
We've come together as a team in the last three months.
We got away so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which has won seven of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of our progress over the last five months, that expects us to be successful five days in the Velodrom.
With the form Kenny, it is in the area of the possible that he repeats Hoy's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a contest.
That would be for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on 23 March (an apparently sacred date for British sport; on the day also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.
That would be the same as that of Hoy.
Kenny takes part next in the sprint, which starts today and will go over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I'm just enjoying this for the moment."
The team event is always best.
You can win it with his colleagues.
It feels somewhat lonely to win alone.
Hindes said: "if he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knighthood."
It was the day's only medal contest, but there was further good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four -four -kilometre race.
They arrived at the goal in 3:51.942.
The world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was at 3:51.659.
The first and final round (22,42) will take place today on the second day of the contest, where Wiggins will certainly be in focus.
He had stepped in yesterday with Officers before qualifying when officials called for him to measure his body size.
In the appropriate women's competition, which will continue and end tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4:13.260.
The GB team is relying on its strong rail team to dominate the middle period of the Olympics and pick up a shar of medals.
After a truly extraordinary portrayal of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio were downgraded.
It played off dramas in the background, according to the resignation of technical head Shane Sutton in April amid sexism and mobbing allegations as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks as if the now legendary reputation of GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated again.
