Berlin / Schwerin: poll before country elections: SPD and CDU lose
In the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September), there are significant losses for the government parties SPD and CDU.
This resulted in representative surveys of the INSA opinion research institute for the "picture" newspaper (Friday).
While the red-black government coalition in the north could barely continue to govern, this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin.
In both federal states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would have a good chance of continuing to put the head of government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD plunged from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
The party, according to the survey, would only be just ahead of the CDU, which could come back to 23 percent.
The third place is controversial between the left and the AfD.
The left would be 19 percent (previously 18.4 per cent), the AfD would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the country's day.
The Greens are reluctant to return to the heavyweight Landtag, despite slight losses at 6 percent (previously 8.7 per cent).
NPD and FDP would not be represented in the Landtag with 3 percent each.
According to the Berlin Chamber of Deputies, the SPD would only be 23% (election 2011:28.3%).
The CDU only reached 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
It would still be behind the Greens at 19 percent (2011:17.6 per cent), but before the left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 per cent).
The AfD would be represented at 14% for the first time in the House of Deputies.
With 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, but the pirates would miss the entry, as opposed to 2011.
