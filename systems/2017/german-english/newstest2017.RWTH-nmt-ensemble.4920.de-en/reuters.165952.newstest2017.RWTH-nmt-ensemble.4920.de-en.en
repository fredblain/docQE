Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
On Friday, Hillary Clinton released her tax return for 2015, which revealed for the Democrats "presidential candidate and her husband an income of USD 10.75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million for charitable purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton generated nearly $5.3 million in speech honors; the former Secretary of State gave an income of $3 million from the publisher Simon & Schuster for her book about her tenure in the foreign ministry.
Clinton's candidate for the vice presidency, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, along with his wife Anne Holton, is publishing his tax returns over the past decade.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency," Clinton's campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri announced in an opinion.
In a stark contrast, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and retreats in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax returns.
It is common for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, although they are not obliged to do so by law.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have indicated a tax audit by tax authorities as a reason for his refusal.
"They are on the train," Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams wrote on Twitter, referring to the release of the Democrats "presidential candidate.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's special adviser, said to CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish anything before the tax exams are not completed.
Trump's critics, including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, have already made it clear that his refusal raises questions about wealth, his donations for charitable organizations, his business conduct, and various other connections, particularly with Russia.
Clinton has already rushed to the issue and released a video on the internet on Friday in which high-ranking Republican Trump is calling for his tax return to be published.
On Thursday, she also addressed the issue during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax returns." She said to the crowd.
Politico has reported that Trump paid no or very little tax during the 1990 s for two years, and a New York Times economic journalist quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advisers on Friday saying that that could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign.
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, who would make sure people pay the more than USD 1 million a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During a campaign event for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate here has his seat, called for Trump to a meeting to exchange their tax returns.
Buffett said he had also undergone a tax review of the IRS and Trump had "fear" in front of voters and not in front of the tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has released tax returns back to 2007.
The Clintons, now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid an effective federal tax rate of about 32% between the years 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
The Clintons "tax return of 2015 showed that these only amounted to USD 100 of their income as a wage, unlike most of the Americans.
Their main asset was a low-cost index fund, from which Clinton's dividends and earnings of USD 109,000 were taxed.
