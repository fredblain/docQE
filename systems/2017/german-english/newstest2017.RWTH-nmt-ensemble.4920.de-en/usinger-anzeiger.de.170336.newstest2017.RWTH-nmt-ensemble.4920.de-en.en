A controversial baseball star resigns
The tears ran at Alex Rodriguez faster than the U.S. baseball star in best days from Base to Base.
After his emotional resignation announcement, the 41-year-old professional will wear the jersey of his New York Yankees on August 12 against the Tampa Bay Rays.
"I love this game and this team."
"I say" Goodbye "to both," said the 14 -time All-Star Game participant of the Major League Baseball (MLB).
Three times Rodriguez was voted the most valuable player in the league, and in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees.
His signature under a ten -year contract has given him $27 million annually since 2007.
By the end of the contract on December 31, 2017, he will act as a consultant and youth coach - at full salary.
As a player, it paid Rodriguez back for a long time with performance.
With 696 homeruns, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and since 2005 the Yankees created some milestones.
With the Hall-of-Fame-members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two other baseball players in key statistics show similar values.
But in the baseball's glory hall, the 41-year-old is still unlikely to be included.
Because so successfully Rodriguez - nicknamed "A-Rod" - was on the field, so controversial is his appearance outside the square.
As early as 2009, the superstar at "ESPN" admitted to having taken banned steroids between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, he was locked up for 211 lots by the end of 2014 due to a settlement in the so-called biogenesis scandal.
Rodriguez is considered the main suspect to have received performance-enhancing funds for years via an anti-aging clinic in South Florida.
After a legal battle, the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters.
"The league could even have done me a favor for the year 2014, because I played 20 years without a break," Rodriguez said at the time.
Even his farewell days are not running smoothly.
While many baseball legends have been given the big stage again in their last games, Rodriguez has often had to sit on the bench.
"My job does not include a farewell tour."
"My job includes trying to win every game," said Yankees-Coach Joe Girardi.
After all, Rodriguez, who was married to actress Cameron Diaz and to the relationship with pop star Madonna and the actress Kate Hudson, received sympathy from fans from the Yankee-arch-rival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod," sang the supporters at the 4:9 defeat against the Rodriguez team.
