For 31 years exemplary for clarity
The managing director of the "Veitenstein Group," Ruppert Göller, is retiring.
The association is considered to be "bay-wide exemplary."
A small flimsy drinking water association as a model for the large water producers.
For example, some time ago in the original, it was in a contribution from the Bayerische Rundfunk.
Little later, the water forum of the government of Unterfranken paid tribute to the purpose association.
The work of the Veitenstein group is "bayernwide as exemplary."
Behind all this is Rupert Göller, who was 31 years in the purpose association, of which 28 years as CEO.
Now, at the age of 65, he was retired.
The drinking water association of the Veitenstein group, based in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, promotes about 150,000 cubic metres of water every year and provides 32 places and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants.
The municipalities are the municipalities of Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.
There are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities.
The current chairman, Breitbrunn's Mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was recruited as a watershed in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director in 1988.
"Its tasks have been very diverse and they stretched from water management and maintenance work to office and organisational activities, budgeting, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations at weekends," the chairperson said.
As outstanding events, she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells (1994), land purchases in the area of the new wells (1998) and compensation for farmers, the refurbishment of the high containers (1999), the re-creation of a central computer control (2004) and the partial renewal of water pipelines.
There has been no stalemate and there have been repeated innovations, because water means life and drinking water is the most important food.
In her Laudatio, she praised Göller's loyal, reliable and correct service over 31 years.
He has worked with a lot of heartthrob for his Water Confederation and he has lived up to the Water Confederation as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was able to present the concept of success of the Veitenstein group to the nitrate cut in front of the Water Forum of the District of Unterfranken.
He has received a great deal of recognition and praise for this.
Rupert Göller, for his part, praised water wart Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.
He is the best watershed and he was a loyal crunch.
Together we were an unbeatable team.
As highlights from his point of view, he described the Brunnenbau and the reorganisation of the purpose association.
The biggest challenge and the most difficult bet, however, were the pipe breaking at the high container at Kirchlauter on a 3 January.
Here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night, so that the localities could be supplied with water.
It was also possible to maintain the supply of Neubrunn only because the high container of Pettstadt was filled with hoses.
The management of the drinking water association has been handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who follows the succession of Rupert Göller.
