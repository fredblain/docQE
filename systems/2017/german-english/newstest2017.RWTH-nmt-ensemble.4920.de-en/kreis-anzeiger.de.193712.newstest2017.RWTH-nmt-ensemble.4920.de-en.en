Community, spirit, health: singing does seniors well
The singing has already accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in the Lehram studies she belted the compartment music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior chorus.
"Singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.
After a probe, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall more alive, she says.
By the way, she does something good about her health and her mind.
Because singing is equal from several perspectives a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler of the German senior league.
Most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describing Hackler.
Through regular interaction, seniors can establish and maintain social contacts.
Because often social and family structures are settled in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "to speak out and to organize, to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of association."
Singing can be exhausting in the positive sense, Hackler says.
Because in doing so, seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.
Those who regularly call for their lungs do not get out of the puste as quickly as they are in everyday life.
Even when it comes to getting the sound of voice in age, singing is an optimal hobby.
On older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the federal Labor community of senior organisations.
In the older generations, common singing had a much higher priority, it belonged to everyday life, both at school and in leisure, she explains.
Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people awakens many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth time.
By means of lyrics and especially melodies, even dementia sufferers are devoid of long-standing events.
In the case of singing, a special performance is also required for the head, Lenz explains.
At the same time, focusing on your own voice and on a predetermined rhythm, adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.
Just elderly people who live alone do not just focus on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition given by singing in the chorus, Hackler says.
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.
Self-esteem is also growing by singing in the choir.
To show yourself: if I long for something, I will be better and wake up beyond me - this experience strengthens.
So there's good reason to start singing, so there's enough.
Anyone who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks they have little talent, Lenz advises.
You are not singing alone - with 50 singing people, who is listening when a tone goes on?
In search of the suitable offer, seniors have different options, Hackler says.
Sings someone from the familiar circle in a senior chorus, you can easily join.
Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the surrounding area.
If you want to sing in a church choir, you can turn directly to the municipality or the church.
Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.
Anyone who does not have access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbours for help with the Internet search.
Anyone who wants to sing should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler.
Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that applies to any age.
