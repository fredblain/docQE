Once squeezed over the price from the market, café comes back in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shameful café in Williamsburg, where you could only pay cash, which had no Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, prices were squeezed out of his Bedford Avenue shop front.
The Soap Cherie business, which replaced verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Locals charged it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea hotel gutted and verb is now a soap business."
But if New York is change, it is also reinvention.
A revived verb cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the old cafe, who is the owner and managing director of the new cafe.
He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a customer offered him to provide funds for a new outpost, he was excited to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, maintained a lot of things.
Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment as well.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garments like capers and sucked onions.
There are natural treasures.
The café no longer serves beer, there are fresh juices for it.
After nine months, Rodriguez said he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.
"Many old customers were also displaced by prices from Williamsburg," he said.
Recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.
Even after she had moved to Greenpoint, she would take the path on her own.
After the verb had closed, she gave up the coffee drinking for a while, she said.
"It became clear to me that it was the coffee and the culture in the verb that liked me," she said.
Now she is drinking coffee again, even if she ordered a blended Chai Tea on that day instead of her usual Iced Coffee, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal has been another long-time and loyal customer since the start of the verb in 2003.
He went there before work and invariably always ordered Dassel.
"I came after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket clock and they prepare my Everything-Bagel with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and include new ingredients in the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his Everything-Bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said that he hadn't been hungry about the soap business taking the old business space.
In fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered to produce a special soap for verb with the cafe's cold-blown coffee as an ingredient.
"I think we're still going to go on their offer," Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish inhabitants of Greenpoints have also accepted the café.
A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said he prefers to exhibit them soon, so his new neighbours feel welcome.
The location also has other benefits.
A local juice locale would like to fill and sell the cold-blowed coffee into the bottle.
There is a chance that the café will expand to a neighbouring building.
For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favourites.
Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said that he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed.
When the new cafe opened, Whitt said that entering the venue and ordering a new coffee felt like a home return.
"I had to smell that," he said.
