Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
The city on the Main, therefore, has the best chance of attracting jobs and companies relocated from London in the competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg.
"It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit vote," says Michael Voigtländer, head of the IW's financial markets and real estate markets.
After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether money houses may continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU.
As far as the so-called EU passport is concerned, they have so far been admitted to the UK.
This is just using big U.S. banks.
Several banks have already announced that they will relocate jobs.
The "Frankfurt Main Finance" lobby group expects 10,000 new jobs to be created within five years.
For Frankfurt, the IW says, the headquarters of the European Central Bank (ECB), which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the eurozone's largest banks, as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Supervisory Authority, EIOPA and the ESRB risk council.
In Paris, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has its headquarters, but it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.
"Proximity to the central bank is important for banks, as they can communicate so directly with the oversight," says IMF Professor Voigtländer.
Although Luxembourg has a large fund industry, it is doing worse than Dublin in terms of infrastructure.
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport.
The city also has easy access to commercial real estate.
"In Paris it is not so easy to find free high-quality offices," says Voigtländer.
At the Seine, rents for first-class commercial real estate are also 50% higher than on the Main.
In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure, as well as less crime.
In a ranking of the company's consultancy Mercer, the city is ranked 19 th, Luxembourg ranked 33 th, Dublin in 37th place and Paris in th place.
Even if quality of life is a matter of preference: "with its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market, Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors," the IW concluded.
London, however, will remain the most important financial center in Europe despite Brexit vote, the economic researchers say.
For this, the balance of power also speaks: in London, according to figures from Landesbank Helaba, around 144,000 people worked in the banking sector at the end of 2015, in Frankfurt it was 62500.
