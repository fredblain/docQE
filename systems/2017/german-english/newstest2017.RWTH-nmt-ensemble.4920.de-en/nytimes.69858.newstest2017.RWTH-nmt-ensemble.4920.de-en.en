Donald Trump explains his claim Obama had established ISIS had been "sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy on Friday that surrounds his campaign by indicating that his repeatedly repeated claim that President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the "founder" of the Islamic State terror group had not been serious.
This clarification raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate's communication skills, whether he was able to communicate clearly and comprehensively with the American public.
It also brings his co-workers, who are trying to protect him during an eventful period, into the peculiar position of having to explain statements that he might not have meant at all.
After making the suggestion at a campaign event on Wednesday night, Mr. Trump resigned in relation to the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that the president and Mrs. Clinton would have created ISIS.
But in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic.
The tweet was the opposite to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews he meant the accusation was completely serious.
When conservative radio presenter Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump mitigate the statement somewhat by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know anything about it.
The last storm of criticism prone to Mr. Trump while trying to steer the focus of his campaign on the economic situation because of falling polls.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to the issue again.
Speaking on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he had found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already put forward sarcasm to his defense.
At the end of July, he drew strong criticism when he said that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but he later declared "of course I meant the sarcastic."
This method allows Mr. Trump to shift the linguistic boundaries in politics and then rub back as needed.
"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive, and then, if necessary," clarify "depending on how the reaction is out." Said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who watches the language of both candidates.
I also believe, however, that he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more predictable tone, as his poll values have continued to decline.
A new poll by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, released on Friday, showed a lead with big lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump is generally trying not to apologise for his provocative remarks, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humour.
But while he is stepping up the focus of attention in the final months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's jokes have put his loyal co-workers in the uncomfortable situation of having to stand up to him, regardless of how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent advocates, gave himself great trouble to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview Thursday.
"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments" said Mr. Giuliani he was questioned about the accuracy of Mr. Trump's statements, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backbenchers, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he pulled off the troops from Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread by refraining from aggressively bringing the situation in the Middle East under control.
Before the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of getting around on each of his words and being biased against him.
He mocked the "poor, jolly" television experts who try to understand him and said, "you can't!."
Some of the Democrats spotted Mr. Trump's apology as just another proof that he was unfit for the presidency.
