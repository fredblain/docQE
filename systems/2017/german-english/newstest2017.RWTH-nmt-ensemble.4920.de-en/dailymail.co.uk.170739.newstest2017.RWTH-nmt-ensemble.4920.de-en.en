How to protect yourself with Krav Maga from gun attacks
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make him a little safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a grandmaster of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance.
Regardless of whether you are approaching you from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the spy around for your robber.
If you are approaching you from behind, you should first turn around so that you can see your attacker and "get out of the firing line," says Mizrachi.
Then take the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before you beat him with your free elbow.
Then beat him with the knee in the bar and turn, while the attacker crumbles from pain, the weapon from his hands, beat him with the run in the face and move backwards while turning the weapon on him.
In attackers approaching from scratch, the technique is similar - move your body out of the firing line, take the weapon and turn it down so the attacker can't shoot.
Shift the weight to the weapon at the same time and beat the attacker to the chest, then turn the weapon out of his grip before moving backwards and targeting the weapon on him.
Sounds difficult?
Watch the video to see exactly how it prefers Mizrachi.
But remember that in a robbery, it is safest to pass your money - unless you are a Krav Maga grandmaster.
