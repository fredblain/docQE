Municipal centres have 160,000 people each year
More than 160,000 of the country's aid figures are dismissed annually by the municipal centres, while the industry is looking at the impact of further cuts on already overburdened transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly elderly people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who have no funds for unjust delusions and similar - are dismissed in their request for free legal advice and legal assistance.
Legal services of the community, which are already overly exploited, are ready for further cuts.
From June next year, it is envisaged that these legal centres will lose another 30% of their federal funds.
The director of community law centres of Queesland James Farrell said the last survey of the National Association of Community Law Centres revealed that thousands of people are already being dismissed every year.
Farrell said the situation would only get worse without a repeal of the federal government's decision.
"Queensland's municipal centres are chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people are dismissed from important services you need," he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with unmanageable and crushing debt, families who go through separations, workers who have been unfairly sacked - all these people have problems of a legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funds by 30 percent from June 2017, meaning thousands of more vulnerable people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the General Public Prosecutor and Federal Justice Minister and Senators of Queensland George Brandis to lift these cuts immediately so that people can get the help they need in legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its pledge to raise funds for legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of the municipal centres and their customer communities, and that the Palaszczuk government is investing in this important work.
