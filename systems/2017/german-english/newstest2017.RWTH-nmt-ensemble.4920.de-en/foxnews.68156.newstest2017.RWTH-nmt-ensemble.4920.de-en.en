Reid says that Clinton will remain a candidate for the Supreme Court in the case of an election victory at Garland
Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the Democrats "presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland's confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
The majority leader in Sen. Mitch McConnell believes the next president will appoint the late judge's successor to Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on Thursday during a phone conference that he expects Clinton to select Garland "with some degree of certainty."
A spokeswoman for Reid later said that he had not yet spoken to Clinton whether she would nominate Garland and he speculated.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team would not care for unrest with a new candidate.
Garland is the supreme judge for the U.S. Appellation Court for the District of Columbia.
RAID said Republicans blocked the Garlands nomination, being Lakaien and helper workers of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also noted that Donald Trump is unfit for the presidency.
