North East oil workers take talks again, set off strike
Labor struggles with regard to pay for North Sea oil workers will be suspended, while all the parties to the dispute will get to the table for a new round of talks, negotiators said.
Strikes against the oilfield service provider Wood Group have been carried out sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group as well as the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the settlement process of the current dispute," says a joint statement.
We will hold some all-day meetings in the next few weeks, which will begin early next year to readdress the problems.
Unions said their last strike, which is the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible pay cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group this year cut rates to its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressures.
The company's council cut follows a 10 percent drop for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said additional cuts give the company the space needed to get through the market downturn.
Shell has sacked thousands of people for its part and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its business activities as a result of its mega-merger with UK energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices, an economic situation that had been reinforced by the British decision to leave the European Union in June.
Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met with worker leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes that took place in the North Sea for a generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for many and not just for few," he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected compared to an average of around $7 billion over the past five years.
