The Raiffeisenbank Gmund at the Tegernsee is demanding punitive interest rates from rich savers in the future - as a second institute in Germany.
Bank chief Josef Paul said on Thursday: "it's only about 139 customers who park 40 million€ on giro- or daily money accounts."
The Federal Association of German Banks speaks of an isolated incident and sees no sign that ordinary savers would "not be afraid to pay for their savings banks."
Camps banks money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they must pay their 0.4 percent penalty rate.
This fee will require Raiffeisenbank Gmund to return from private and corporate customers for deposits of more than €100,000 on giro- or day-money accounts from September.
"The first €100,000 is free."
"The next 100,000 will cost €400 a year," said Paul.
He has been wary of €40 million for some time, which could be lifted from one day to the next and which he cannot use.
"These are with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent costs," the bank chief said.
"I cannot go for every million €4000."
According to the polluter pays principle, the costs will now continue.
It would be far too dangerous to leave the cash in the Raiffeisenbank's safes: "I have already seen four falls, I do not want the fifth!" Said the bank board.
Most customers would have understood and changed to other forms of investment.
Few migrated to other banks.
The Cooperative Society of Bavaria said: "the ECB's extreme monetary policy is causing significant costs for all banks."
To carry them on their own is "not economically viable."
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or remittances.
With penalty rates for deposits from three million€, the Thuringian People's and Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land had made headlines with their Skatbank branch in 2014.
Michael Kemmer, chief executive of the Banking Association, said: "we do not expect private customers to have to pay for deposits for deposits, and competition in Germany among banks and savings banks is far too strong."
A banker said that at the Tegernsee there is "a clientele that is a little more fitted by the fortunes."
"This can become a problem for a small bank" if it hurts money for free.
Founded in 1911, Gmund has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
In the region, well-known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs live.
The Cooperative Association of Bavaria "is not currently aware of any other banks that calculate an outlay for deposits of private customers," spokesman Ernst said.
The president of the Federal Association of German People's Banks and Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), Uwe Fröhlich, declared at the end of June: "the threshold to go to the negative towards the private client is very, very high."
The competition is tough, and it threatens the brain drain to compete.
Customers in Germany will not let this happen in width.
