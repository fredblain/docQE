The charges per cubic metre of waste water are from 1 October 2016 for the area of the waste water plant Neudorf / Reuth / Welschenkahl 3.44 instead of €2.10; for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp €3.36 (so far €2.26) and for Azendorf €3.64 (so far €2.18).
At the plant in Azendorf, the wastewater fee will be increased again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are required.
After an excess calculation, the sewage price in Azendorf will be €4.37 per cubic meter.
As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, during the approval of the budget by the Countess of Kulmbach, it was found that undercover for these sewage plants was underway.
As a result of legal bases, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the facilities in a cost-effective manner.
From 1 October 2016, the citizens, as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg, will have to go deeper into the purse.
The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.
As Managing Director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the body, a new calculation of the fees for the sewage systems of the market community was necessary.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, it is also possible to compensate for over- or undercover discoveries from the previous calculation period.
The serious increase in fees justified Schmidt with the fact that all three wastewater facilities are relatively small, with a very low sewage, which is between 6800 and 12,000 cubic meters per year.
For example, due to the low distribution base, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand€ would have a serious impact.
In addition, the volume of wastewater in all three plants is slightly decreasing.
In addition, in the last calculation period, all three plants have been significantly reduced, not least because of their ageing and repair costs.
The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the facilities for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years.
Schmidt pointed out that in the Azendorf wastewater plant the mechanical ventilation plant had to be exchanged due to a damage.
In the Pumpwerk Welschenkahl, the nearly 20-year-old conveyor plants had to be overhauled from scratch and at the Lopp pond plant, after nearly 20 years of operation, the first sewage pond had to be excavated, sewage sludge had to be disposed of and an additional ventilation facility had to be installed in order to continue to comply with the water requirements.
Schmidt: "to these extraordinary expenses came the continuing care and maintenance costs to be taken into account in the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs, which were still well below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011/2012.
Stone houses made it clear that, in the small waste water in the three plants, the expenses for the operation and maintenance are "full."
At the same time, Schmidt added, the market community has been spared major entertainment costs in sewage plants over the past 20 years.
The situation for the aforementioned plants will, in the view of stone houses, continue to remain precarious in the long term, especially as the supply area of the Friesenbachtal wastewater will not be extended to include these facilities, because these are deficient facilities.
