Legislation is constantly being screened in the name of the fight against terrorism.
Following the recent attacks, Interior Minister de Maizière is now presenting a thick security package.
But what has a tolerance status to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say about all this?
Thomas de Maizière gives the concierge.
All his proposals are "politically reasonable" for the coalition partner, says the Federal Minister of the Interior at the presentation of his new security package.
They don't overcharge anyone.
Other, more far-reaching points would first be discussed within the parties.
I am also involved in this.
As Minister of the Interior, however, he is in a position to achieve results and to achieve a "achievable consensus" within the coalition.
De Maizière has missed a little time after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach before presenting his conclusions for security in the Republic.
However, these are now all the more extensive.
Some things are already known, proclaimed, pronounced: that a new security authority should take care of the cracking of encrypted communication is not new.
Nor is the fact that Germany has to implement several EU requirements on passenger data and gun law.
The call for more video surveillance and staff for the security authorities is equally unsurprising.
In part, de Maizière is launching a second start for proposals that have not been made with the SPD so far: he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under punishment, and to crack down on jihadists with dual citizenship the German passport.
"This will be difficult points for the SPD," the CDU man admits.
He still thinks this is reasonable and does not call for any chances in the coalition partner anyway.
A few new ideas presents de Maizière as well.
They have it in part: it plans fast-track procedures for deportation and more opportunities to detain people before deportation.
Refugees who are targeted in the country are expected to chase their smartphones before and disclose social media accounts for a security review.
In the case of tolerances for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to put some even worse than hitherto - for example, those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to disguise their identity.
Some of this is politically and legally sensitive.
Some of them are still unbalanced and leave questions open.
And, on a number of points - with regard to the inequality of patience, for example, - the question arises: what does this really have to do with security and terror?
Yes, de Maizière says it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror.
But it cannot be denied that the offenders of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
Moreover, many people worried about security, given the high numbers of refugees.
And things that people were deeply concerned about could not be excluded even in campaign times.
Internal security has been tremendously focused.
Only the attacks in the neighbourhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The uncertainty is great.
And yes, there are election campaigns.
The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly in position on the issue of internal security.
Over the past few days, it has been high between the two parties.
First a garnish dispute over the equipment of the federal police, then about a security policy gathering of some Union interior ministers, in which the Ressortchefs also call for a Burka ban and a departure from dual citizenship.
De Maizière is also looking for conciliatory sounds.
He does not think of a departure from the double pass.
We have befriended the discussion in Germany.
It does not make sense to reopen it.
And in a Burka ban, he has constitutional concerns.
Whether his own package is constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually "reasonable" for the coalition partner, it has yet to be shown.
There is something in it that could cause dispute.
But the SPD is also trying to prop up the issue of internal security.
Party leader Sigmar Gabriel first signals caution and says: "the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security."
