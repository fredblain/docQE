Destination Platten: who actually buys records?
Lonely middle-aged men love plates.
Before rushing to the commentary in order to overthrow it under the pseudonym non-AlleEinsamenmen Mittlerenage with rough insults, this statement derives from current data.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed resurgence of records is not on a boom in Millennials that want to welcome the novelty of physical items, but due to midlife nostalgia.
Those who recently bought a plate are likely to be aged between 45 and 54.
In fact, the 18 - 24 age group is the most unlikely buyer group.
It is also not a horden by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers retain their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).
But do YouGov's results vote?
If this blog were a news report on television, the camera would follow me while running in the midst of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest grey suit and stealing wildly before standing, holding my hands and saying something like: "so, let's take a closer look at it."
So, let's take a look at it.
Even though the heart of Sohos is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were based - there are still a handful of fantastic record specialty shops.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and vegetation through observation.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I have from Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (data number: eight middle-aged men, a woman, probably around the 20) is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
"I already appreciate," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.
These records, pictured above (he sent me the snap by email, I didn't follow him home), dress up the walls of his living room.
The reason he owns such a significant number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy plates he couldn't afford when they appeared and again buy items he sold when he was young and bankrupt.
"A lot of things I buy are from the late 60 s, early 70 s, who appeared when I was 11 or 12, things where I was probably a little too young to buy them," he says.
He agrees that those who buy plates are more introverted and happy to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.
That's my laster.
WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets apply to the YouGov profile.
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people being influenced by the media hub, people who have heard about the comeback and are looking to buy their old plates again.
Of the conversations I have had, people have usually devoured so at 1998 or 1999 of their collection.
Customers who once sold their plates to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their plates again, "he says.
That would explain the boom to supporters of the record revision of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional significance of plates?
It takes just a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realise that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers took impetus to the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar soundproofing hulls, from items that wake up happy youth movements.
"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or the possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation," says Wez.
This is the case with me as a collector and I think that is the case with many people.
It's an easy way to look at it mentally.
"We are like their social workers!" An employee is flying from a record stack.
A survey by the ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who bought a plate last month have not yet listened to them.
The survey also found that 41% possess a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a plate do not own a record player.
At this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried while bleeding through a stack to Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data number: three middle-aged men), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revival.
"Someone came here only recently and said:" I don't have a record player, but I would like to buy a Radiohead record so I can put them on the shelf, "he says.
This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.
More product-like, less musical.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not older ones, who are slowly coming in.
Fopp, which has devoted almost an entire floor to the records, has a blower audience when I'm talking.
There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenage young and middle-aged women.
Even though the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops - Wild Beasts' latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz drenched from the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers.
None of them looks particularly lonely, but nagging mental trauma is hard to detect if you are standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been running around in the shop for a few minutes and considers the varietal of the plates for sale.
It makes a storytelling rather than a big purchase.
She doesn't deserve much, so collecting plates is not a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It's easy to hear music from a computer or in other ways, but the beauty of plates is... "she drives off with a loved sigh.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.
While I look to muster the jeans hotpants, I watch a group of young teenage girls grooming for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter consider buying a Crosley record player.
To the left is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are only purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.
It is pure "record art."
But considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain about.
It's no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends most on luxury items such as plates.
Even though my investigation revealed that the results of YouGov are voting, they leave, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors who exist in reality, record shops and in online forums.
These people probably work hard at school or in offices.
They are certainly not spending their Thursday morning with the bump through record shops of Berwick Street and the blazing through plates while avoiding the starring look of an intriguing, 30-year-old false presenter who raises over the shoulders of nothing of middle-aged men.
