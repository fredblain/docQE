England must steer the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and across London, but across the country.
For me, this represented the biggest attraction of Heathrows, just as then in 2012 in London, when we operated a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and firms near Heathrow.
For our local communities, we alone will create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.
Just as they were ahead of us in London in 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of expanding Heathrows is too big.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be blaming on the world stage.
The doubters had 2012 wrongs and they will also be wrong at Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcoming, but Heathrow answers every question put to him.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project.
Enlargement is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in wide-ranging growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and in the whole of GB.
We have a great team at Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from the T5 - which was chosen five years in a row to the world's best airport terminal, up to the T2, which was built amid the world's two most frequented runways.
Now they are ready to deliver a third runway, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment.
The London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that Heathrow's expansion will also be one.
It is time we steered this Olympic spirit and expanded Heathrow, securing our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.
