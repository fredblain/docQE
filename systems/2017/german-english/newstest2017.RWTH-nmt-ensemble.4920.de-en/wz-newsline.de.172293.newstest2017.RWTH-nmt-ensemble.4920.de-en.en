Relaxing night: tips against sleep disturbances
In the evening you can walk around forever, at night you will be awake for hours, and in the morning you can no longer think of sleep well before the wake-up.
This is far from recovering.
After all, such problems are in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep is often or permanently unrecoverable.
How do sleep problems or sleep disturbances speak?
There are several forms of sleep disorder, and it can be based on a variety of causes, emphasizing Hans-Günter Week, the board member of the German Society for sleep research and sleep medicine.
What one understands, however, is the Insomnie, that is, a disorder and a sleeping disorder.
In particular, many people feel unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the Board of Directors of the German Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxony.
What is behind sleep disturbances?
The causes of sleep disturbances are complex.
Behind it can be organic, mental or behavioral factors, but also medicines.
Often the sleep disorder is an expression of another illness.
"Very early waking up is often the case with depression," says Week.
And it may be that different factors are mutually dependent.
For example, anyone who has a disc incident may be bad, wakes up every two to three hours and may start to greet about everyday problems and worries, Week gives an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
When should I have sleep disturbances to the doctor?
Anyone who doesn't sleep well over a period of a month in at least three nights a week and is impaired on the day should go to the doctor, Week advises.
The impairment can look very different: one is beaten, tired, undisclosed, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily riddled, has mood fluctuations or physical ailments such as stomach or headache.
To alleviate sleep disorder, it is important to find out the causes.
As treatment options come, among other things, behavioral changes, cognitive behavioral therapy, or even medication - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks.
Established sleeping medical practitioners rarely exist in Germany, insists Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medical centre of Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.
Therefore, if you have sleep problems, you should first contact the doctor.
This can be used to investigate whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should go to the sleeping lab, and what happens?
For the study in the sleeping laboratory, for example, medical practitioners advise on snoring with breathing suspenders, in sick day fatigue, in sleeping converters or if you don't find the cause of a sleeping disorder, Fietze explains.
It is not really necessary to prepare for the investigation.
You should spend the day normally.
"Just don't make a lunchtime sleep," says Fietze.
After the cabling, you go to bed at its normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body, one wears a nasal glasses, a chest belt and a feather at the finger.
In addition, a camera on the ceiling features the sleeper.
How can people get to grips with the problems?
There are quite a lot of pitch screws that can be used for better sleep.
Week counts on: regular sleeping and upcoming times, not too long in bed, not sleeping on the day, not watching TV to sleep, avoiding alcohol and not looking at the clock at night - then you start to expect immediately, and that is not conducive at all.
