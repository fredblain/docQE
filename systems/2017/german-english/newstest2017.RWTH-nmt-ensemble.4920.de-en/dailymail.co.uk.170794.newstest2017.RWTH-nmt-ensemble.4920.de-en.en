Traveller Ian Wright is chasing his tongue at the dirtiest places in Europe for a travel guide
A British traveller underwent his immune system and dignitaries of a serious test - by ditching some of Europe's dirtiest and most eclectic places.
The presenter and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shabbed his course on an euro note, a balloon at the Piccadilly Circus, a dishwasher of a train toilet as well as a public phone in Russia to demonstrate the resilience of his immune system.
Before dragging each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he is going to get into.
But the experiment, filmed under the title "the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results to light.
The idea of leaking the dishwasher of a train toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchenette.
On his journey through Europe, Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about promoting intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health.
Thankfully, nothing he left behind left more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.
Mr Wright became known for testing the resilience of his intestines by traveling through the world and enjoying peculiar and wonderful things.
From public money to train stations to washing buttons of toilets, the task definitely put his immune system under a probe
In the film he told: "already as a child, I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."
In the film, he was in any case fair to his reputation.
The only thing he opposed was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His trial discovery showed a luminometer number of over 4000 units.
In comparison, the luminometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet he refused to lick after her luminometer number was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60
Mr Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the bacteria number in different places like the bathroom
In the film, he says: "this comes close to the worst I've got in a toilet."
There is nothing dirtier than that!
I'm not going to lure anything here because it's indoors here.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.
The company is equipping Mr Wright with Valio freezing, which includes both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
Valio's Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we really wanted to offer something new to consumers.
Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.
We carried out crazy brainstormings that ended that we said "let us call Ian."
They claim that interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a wider context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we have been able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!
Tom Hakala, who led the film's directions, added: "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had put some of the things that I instructed him to lick, just like the eclectic Russian toilet shown in the film."
Of course, there were things where it was easier to get Ian to lick them and others where this was quite difficult.
I'm glad we've included some of these dirty leaks on film. "
In a 2015 survey carried out by Valio, 84 percent of all respondents associated lactic acid bacteria in particular with the wellbeing of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said they at least occasionally use products containing attached lactic acid bacteria.
