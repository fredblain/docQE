Asocial family destroys social housing in Saltash, Cornwall
An asocial family left their social housing after a deluge with a £50,000 damage because it had terrorised their neighbours.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown from their property in Saltash, Cornwall, according to a long list of complaints.
After being violently removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an irreparable condition.
The walls pointed out glowing holes, wooden dieles were ripped up, rubbish was scattered on the floor and graffiti was smeared to the walls.
The family have been resettled and it is believed she now lives in a private shelter
Donna McEvoy, who works for house administration at Cornwall Housing, said she fears the apartment was no longer to be repaired.
She said: "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I think people don't have to live in this way.
There are many things to take into account, as this property will probably be seen as not such a beautiful part of Cornwall.
The family is notorious and their reputation is also.
The pair had three sons who lived in the flat in the meantime and police said that the terror that had inflicted on the family included street fighting with baseball blasts, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive cries, strikes and flight.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, got an arrangement for anti-social behaviour in June.

Neighbours said they saw them fighting on the street and had to be regularly called to the police
Cornwall Housing deleted her and her partner this week violently from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily pull out.
The deluge was cheered by facilitated neighbors who said their lives were being made to hell.
One said: "they did not care about anyone."
We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad.
The countless times we tell the police here are unbelievable.
"This morning we could not sleep."
We stood up because it was so quiet here - we're not accustomed to that!
Now that they are finally away, it will be nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it would have failed the family to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house, to which police were called at regular intervals, for 20 years
On the overgrown side of the community house, rubbish and old toys were thrown down
He added: "it is a disgrace that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and that of their family, as a deluge is always the last step to consider Cornwall Housing.
This was a very difficult case, as the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be terrible for their neighbours.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the community who have been courageous on us and have provided us with the information.
I hope that this development will give consolation to some neighbours and convey the message that anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.

In 2014, police carried out a raid in the house and found over 70 g of cannabis, as well as scales, paraphernals and cash of £1,700.
Skeldon was given a fine after she pleaded guilty to the possession of a drug B drug in trade view.
She claimed that the money was for a tombstone of her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car crash in 2013.
After they were without a shelter, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner now live in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many room walls of the house were decorated with graffiti.
Police say it will delight tenants who don't stick to the house order
Angela Crow from Devon and Cornwall Police announced that the deluge was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not abide by the house order.
"This goes to those who think they can behave without self-accusations and to those who have been damaged by such behaviour," she said.
Devon and Cornwall Police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
