Jewish director shatters Berlin hotel because Israeli preselection was removed after "Arab" call - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media uproar after he had betrayed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli preselection as it had "requested" Arab guests, according to an employee.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah" left his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel's list of countries.
However, the country was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and deleted?
Wrote Lanzmann.
Instead, the Kempinksi Bristol offers a way to select Israel via its own call center.
According to a statement, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received there, "shocked him," as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said that the measure was a "deliberate decision of the management of Kempinski hotels."
The reason behind it was even more rage in the director.
"Most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the preselection be deleted," the Lanzmann employee was quoted as saying.
The Israeli Ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great shame," the Süddeutsche Zeitung reports.
We were appalled and dismayed by this event.
This is really very shameful.
The fact that this has taken place in Germany in this very hotel chain is even more disgraceful.
This does not require any explanation.
We expect the hotel to "draw the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident triggered a pretty big resonance on the internet where people called the whole thing a scandal.
Some subjected the Kempinski Hotel to the alleged demands of Arab guests.
"Shame you," said another post stating that the hotel, located on the noble Kurfürstendamm, is close to a synagogue.
The hotel quickly dismissed all the accusations of itself and called the incident a "provided" and "apologised" at Lanzmann, reports The Mirror.
"There was never a direct instruction" not to include Israel in the fast-track list, "the Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman for the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the country preselection has now been added.
