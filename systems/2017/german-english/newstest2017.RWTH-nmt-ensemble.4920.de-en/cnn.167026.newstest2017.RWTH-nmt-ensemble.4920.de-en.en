Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I imagine under the women's Olympic team in the turf, and that's for more than one reason.
First of all, I have been at every summer Olympics since 1984 and the U.S. has never been so dominant.
And second: this team has three turners-up, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who were inspiring for many young girls of other skin colour.
The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, who is JÃ¼din and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team is finally reflecting the US.
It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
In the last four years, the number one among the female turner has been an Afro-American.
Last year were Simone and Gabby\ HASH 1 and\ HASH 2.
That shows strength.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America cheered.
Now the world has been able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez as they delivered unexpected but masterful gymastic routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American to win gold at an individual multi-campaign event for women.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We are seeing the top of this sport, but that's not how turf classes across the country look like.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all beat the same way as Aly and Madison to create it into the Olympic team.
They are the "last Five," because the next Olympics will only have four female players in the team, and this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.
But the reality is that turkeys are an expensive sport and Turner is primarily in private turf clubs that are maintained by parents who pay for the training, set-up, travel, competition and hotel costs (for the coaches and their turners and families).
The majority of these turf clubs lie in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.
In these clubs, the Turners receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started playing with the turkey.
We need to give the communities countless, young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie a more affordable and more accessible turf training.
I founded my turnstile of 20 years.
At my events, we have offered free and affordable turkeys in Harlem for over 15,000 urban young people (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high quality turkeys that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Turnen develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the spirit.
This combination offers life-long benefits for health, as well as for school and professional success.
It's the inspiration of this team that causes thousands of young girls to be interested in the turf and that's great.
It's so important to participate in sport, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real portrayal of "Girl Power" by the Holen of the Olympic team and thank you so many young girls with different background motivated to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
