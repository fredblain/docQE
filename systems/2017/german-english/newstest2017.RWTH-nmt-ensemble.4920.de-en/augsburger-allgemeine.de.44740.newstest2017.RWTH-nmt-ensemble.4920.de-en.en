Escape: "every whipped woman has experience of sexual violence"
Sexual violence is part of everyday life for women who are fleeing alone.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatised.
A house offers refuge.
In a large kitchen, four women sit.
Each has a baby that is at most a year old.
One has put her little son in the arm.
He guys with great eyes curious into the room.
His mother stares at the table plate.
Until she notices she is being watched.
She smiles short and kisses the little one.
The scene works normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is the managing director of Condrobs, a carrier for social assistance in Bavaria, and deals with, among other things, the issue of women on the run.
The four women in the kitchen are poultry.
They live in the Munich north in one of the few decentralised shelters for all-embracing women and their children in Bavaria.
In January, Condrobs made up the establishment along with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid.
It has recently been officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
Men don't exist - even as visitors.
The exception is a guard in front of the door.
"It is not exaggerated to say: every woman arriving here has had experience of sexual violence on her flight," says Bahr.
"Men are fleeing for wars because they are being pursued politically because they are threatening torture or death or because their families are sending them to Europe as a hopper," she says.
In the case of women, there are other reasons for the escape: "many are stealing secretly because they do not see any other way out."
In their homeland, they have made experience of sexual violence, forced marriages, honour killings, slavery or forced prostitution.
That is what is driving them.
On the run, that goes on.
"For example, that smugglers are demanding a sexual activity for a bottle of water is not a rare occurrence," says Bahr.
And women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Anyone who thinks that the end, as soon as they arrive in Germany, is mistaken, tells Bahr.
Here, too, single women in refugee shelters would often be regarded as inferior and at worst abused.
That leads to about 90 percent of women living in the shelter in Munich's north, she estimates.
"Some of the children have certainly not been voluntarily created."
Many women are so accustomed to saying nothing.
"Or they don't trust to speak openly about the experience, because the shame is too big."
As they often don't know to help, it needs more shelter only for them, calling for Bahr.
In Bavaria, the seven county governments are responsible for accommodating refugees.
On the question of whether they knew of a similar project as in Munich in their area of competence, some responded with no.
In the Oberpfalz and Oberfranken, for example, there is no such thing in government shelters.
Even in swabs, only fled women are not submerged separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, the government's press secretary.
In Oberbayern, Unter- und Mittelfranken, there are floors or own houses in some Community accommodation only for single women and their children.
The exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central shelters exclusively for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommodated separately from men.
In a study published for the committee, it says: "it is very important for men and women to be accommodated separately."
"Lack of privacy, or men and women are housed together, can come to - perpetual - violence against women."
In particular, the washrooms should be separated and easily accessible to women, is in the study.
How much the women feel this need for protection can be seen at the Andrank, which there is on the house in Munich.
"Since it has been around, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr.
You could easily make up a second house.
