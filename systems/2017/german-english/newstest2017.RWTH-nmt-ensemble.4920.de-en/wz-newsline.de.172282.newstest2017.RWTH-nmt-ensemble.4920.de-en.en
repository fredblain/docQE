Rain rather than star snuggling: hope for weather improvement
The weather has made the star snuff Guckers in south-west Germany a stronghold by the bill on the night of Friday - but there is still hope.
The night was badly suited for clouds and rain to watch the sky spectacle, the chairman of the star warden Welzheim, Hans-Ulrich Keller, said on Friday morning.
Our hope is on the night of Saturday.
The weather is supposed to be good, then we'll certainly see a lot of star snuff in the sky.
The star shoes are Perseids, which, at 216,000 kilometres per hour, are among the fastest star snuff.
They have their name because they seemingly come from the star image of Perseus, which goes up in the northeast.
