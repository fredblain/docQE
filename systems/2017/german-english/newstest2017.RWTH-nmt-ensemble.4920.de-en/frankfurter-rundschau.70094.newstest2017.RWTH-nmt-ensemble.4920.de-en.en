Turkey: Kurdish community expects mass flight
"Anyone who does not suit and praises Erdogan sits on packed caffeine," says the chairman of the G端len Foundation Dialogue and World, Ercan Karakoyun.
The Kurdish municipality of Germany expects in the short term tens of thousands of protective seekers fleeing Turkey to Germany.
In the medium term, it could even become "a few hundred thousand," the association's chairman, Ali Toprak, believes.
Because of the hard push by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish municipality of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany.
"In the short term, I reckon with tens of thousands, in the medium term, with a few hundred thousand protective seekers from Turkey in Germany, if the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," says the Association chairman, Ali Toprak of the "world" of Friday.
Because the government had already overrun Kurdish strongholds with punitive actions months ago, 500,000 Kurds within Turkey were on the run.
After the thwarted coup, secular and opposition ethnic Turks would be added.
Many will want to restart in Europe if they are further oppressed in Turkey.
"It is not acceptable for a state that itself is taking up refugees to produce refugees in their own country," said Toprak.
The chief of staff complained of the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish but also in alevitic cities.
In this way, Erdogan wants to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kurds.
"They are the last large minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have been eradicated or displaced over the last hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member.
The chief executive called for the federal government to "position itself as sharply as Austria against Erdogan and its supporters."
A "witch-hunt" against Erdogan critics is also taking place in Germany.
I don't feel safe in Germany for the first time in recent months.
The German branch of the G端len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and opposition activists.
The fire mark as a G端len supporter destroys teachers and other academics the professional existence.
"Anyone who does not adapt and praise Erdogan sits on packed caffeine, by the way, the Kemalists and seculars," said Ercan Karakoyun, Chairman of the G端len Foundation Dialogue and Education, the "world."
As the newspaper reports on figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Turks presented the largest group of asylum-seekers recognised for political persecution in Germany before the coup.
On the date of 30 June, this was 11,386 people and, therefore, almost 29% of all recognised as asylum seekers (39,625).
This survey does not cover war, poverty or the lack of prospects.
Asylum rights under the Basic Law are exclusively political, that is to say, from the state side, individually persecuted.
