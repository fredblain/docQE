Despite Olympic disappointment: Martin remains battling
Despite his disappointing appearance in the Olympic timeline, cycling pro Tony Martin does not want to be under-cried.
"I continue to keep the World Cup in mind, remain confident and fight further," the 31-year-old wrote on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro at Facebook.
He did not have an explanation for his miserable twelfth place at the sugar hut.
"I honestly find it hard to comment on the timing of yesterday," said Martin.
He must analyse in peace the reasons for the debacle.
At the time driving World Cup in Qatar in October, Martin actually wanted to fight for the title.
"I will look at everything we have changed in recent times."
"This also includes my position," the three -time time world champion wrote on Wednesday on the 54.5 km more than three minutes on Olympic champion Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland).
