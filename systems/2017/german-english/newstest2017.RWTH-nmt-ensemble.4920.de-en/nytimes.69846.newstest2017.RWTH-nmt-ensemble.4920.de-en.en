"A generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the US
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters demanding political change in Ethiopia encountered violent resistance from the government.
Witnesses say that tens of protesters were killed during clashes with police during shot changes.
Is Ethiopia just collapsing?
Over the past decade, it has been one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.
But in recent months, protests against the government rocked the country and expanded into more and more areas.
Last week, thousands of people rushed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.
The government's response was relentless, according to human rights organisations.
Witnesses said that police officers shot and killed on tens of unarmed protesters.
Videos in circulation about the protests that are probably from the last or the beginning of this year show how security people beat young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall.
The head of the U.N. Human Rights Authority is now demanding an in-depth investigation.
"It has always been difficult to hold this country together and it will become even more difficult in the future," said Rashid Abdi, the Project Leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West.
American military and intelligence agencies are working closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats beyond the region, especially in Somalia, and only a few countries in Africa, if any, receive so much Western aid.
Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Even though Ethiopia was far from a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually cited oppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, with dissidents effectively silenced.
Many were sent into exile or in prison, killed or driven into the wits of the desert.
But that could change.
"If you suppress people and they have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia.
The entire youth protest.
A generation protests.
There are numerous complaints covering everything from land use to stranglehold in terms of power of the ruling coalition.
After a largely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions along the border with Eritrea are rising; a battle for this zealous, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts worry that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden's National Liberation Front, which have been more or less beaten in recent years, could exploit the turmoil and arm themselves again.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness are now exploding after years of precipitation under the surface.
The first seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years have a very large number of Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones became increasingly common and Internet services improved.
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, which it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies that hide where they are staying.
Several young Ethiopians said they gathered to protest.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
Since eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethopia's predominantly Christian highlands, prospered in politics and economics, while exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and living in lowland areas.
But that, too, is changing.
"We are in the process of coordinating under an umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The biggest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, which accounts for around 6 percent of the population, and who are dominant in the military, in the intelligence services, in trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years until his death in 2012.
He was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think of corners.
Analysts say that he was particularly keen to perceive early signs of discontent and use special envoys to edit opponents and make them harmless.
"The current regime lacks this fundamental skill," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected for relatively opaque reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.
Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he doesn't enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.
Many worry that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such an uproar was in 2005, after thousands protested against elections, which, according to analytics, were seemingly catered for by the government and subsequently stolen.
During the subsequent raids, many protesters were killed, even if it was less than in recent months and this period of unrest went over relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in the fight against poverty.
But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the Ethiopian government's internal misgivings.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, an amharic city, attacked by Tigray and the hatred towards the Tigray is becoming increasingly common on social media.
Analysts say the protests put the U.S. and other Western allies in a peculiar position.
The American government used Ethiopia as a base for droning flights over neighboring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it has closed that base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile area.
"This," Mr Abdi said, "is a very thin grate."
