Sun worshippers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A Portugal's P- 3 C Orion plane of air forces put an incredible fall flight
Airstrikes said it was on a training flight but insisted that no security risk was ahead
This was the moment when scared tourists began to panic after a tipping jet crashed over a full beach.
Dramatic video recordings showed how the military plane flew almost within tangible proximity above the sunshine on the beach section in Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers sprang up when they understandably began to worry about the noise of the diet engines without first seeing what came through the clouds on them.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many holidaymakers who posted videos about the dramatic fly-by on social media, said: "it flew twice really very deep and there was a moment when it looked like it was going to crash."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was just on the surf and it felt like the plane was falling down on me. '

The Portuguese air forces today indicated that the pilot of the P- 3 C Orion plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast, flying so deep that this was the only way to detect them.
The spokesman said the jet flew slightly deeper than usual due to poor visibility conditions by nearby area fires, but the air forces insisted that safety was at no time at risk.
Land fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer, where four people were killed on the island of Madeira.
