Simone Biles creates gold in the doorway
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamic on the jump horse.
Effortlessly on the bar.
Breathtaking on the floor.
On whole line brilliant.
And now, finally, Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American Turnerin erupted to the multi-campaign title on Thursday, widening the gap between himself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the headlight of the Olympics.
Their overall result of 62.198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and "final Five" team cameradin Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.
The American Simone Biles is touring on the weaving beam during the women's single multicampaign in the art turf at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American to win a multi-campaign title and overall the fifth, while solidifying her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.
She broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end.
This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated her sport the last three years, winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the 1984 Mary Lou's Olympic champion said of her that she is "the best turner I've ever seen."
It was expecting a last test in Brazil, a contest that did not go so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between it and a load of oversized expectations.
Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas would be seen as a disappointment.

Biles picked up the first medal on Tuesday while she served as an exclamation mark on the farewell celebration of team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles insisted that during her long journey to the top, never planned the future, that's not really true.
Part of their ground exercises - which contain their typical tumbling passport - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
This is not a coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the gym where Boorman trained, became a force.
She hasn't lost a multi-campaign contest since the summer of 2013, a victory series that will last for as long as it wants Biles.
Even though Mustafina led easily by two rotations, the image declined.
Weaving beams and ground turkeys - in which Biles holds the world championship title - lurked.
She picked up again with 15.433 on the wearing beam - and set one on it with a 15.933 on the floor.
Raisman gently embraced her as they were expecting her final glue - a pure formality - and tears streamed on Biles gleefully red, white and blue Eyeliner when the vision she once described in her collection book became a reality.
Raismans "performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she struggled around third place, but the bronze medal in a tiebrake went to Mustafina.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, called "grandma" by the Americans, had a lead.
After her ground exercise, she accused the audience of cushions, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes appeared doubtful.
As for Biles, the 19 -year-old's rapidly spreading tweet has a whole new meaning from earlier this week:
