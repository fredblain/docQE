The right-wing "identitarian movement" has been targeted by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection.
According to several national offices, the constitutional protectors in the federal government have also put the group under observation.
"We see in the" Identitarian Movement "evidence of aspirations against the liberal democratic basic order," said constitutional chief Hans-Georg Maaßen of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
In this way, immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are being defamed in an extremist manner.
That is why we are now watching the movement.
The "identitarian movement" is a grouping with French roots, which has been active in Germany since 2012.
It is opposed to "multicultural madness," "uncontrolled mass immigration" and the "loss of its own identity by foreigners."
Constitutional protesters in nine federal states - Bremen, Bayern, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - are already watching the "identitaries."
Maaßen said his authority had voted closely with the national offices in the decision.
"Groups like the" Identity Movement "are trying to pick up their target group where it stands," said the constitutional chief.
In general, extremists try to address them with youthful language, often with poppy music.
The Islamists as well as right-wing extremists.
This is not a beguiling advertisement for one's own cause.
Propaganda is supposed to address people emotionally.
Young people are particularly vulnerable.
That is dangerous.
Most recently, there had been reports from several federal states about contacts of the "identitarian" to AfD politicians.
Maaßen said he did not have any findings to do so.
For constitutional protection, possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point of view.
What matters is whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - will change its direction and become so extremist by certain people who are extremist.
What is crucial, then, is whether such individuals have a steady influence on the party.
This is unrecognisable.
Looking at the significant increase in right-wing offences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelters, Maaßen said he would not yet speak of new right-wing terrorism in this context.
But we have noticed in recent years that there can be right-wing structures.
There was the group "Old School Society" or the Freital Group.
It may well be that other right-wing groups or micro-groups are forming that plan attacks against asylum-seekers, refugee homes or attacks from other far-right motives.
However, a German-wide or Europe-wide control of legal terrorism is not recognisable.
The previous groups were created at the regional level or in social networks.
Worried about the fact that many assaults went to the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right scene.
That is the cause of concern.
Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum shelters had not previously been known as criminals, politically motivated criminals or supporters of the right scene.
"So many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists, who may have been politically indifferent, or who, for example, chose CDU, SPD or Left, but who then radicalised themselves by right-wing extremist mood."
