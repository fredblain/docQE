Baden-Württemberg: police investigate after rocker attack on snack
After an attack on an Ulmer snack, police are investigating six suspects from the rocker milieu because of severe land peace breaks.
In housing searches, evidence and narcotics were secured, police said on Friday.
Around 20 masked men of a rock-like grouping had thrown bottles and stones against the storefront of an imbecile, according to police in July.
After that, they are said to have attacked two guests and injured one slightly.
After that, they fled.
At the snack and at the adjacent building there was a damage of €10,000.
According to the investigators, it is a dispute in the Ulmer Rockermilieu between a Kurdish and a Turkish gear.
