B27 refurbishment: restaurants suffer from blocking
There is nothing to mock at the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated.
For those responsible for the construction work, which starts at 5,30 o "clock in the morning and only end at 20 p.m., there is all the praise.
"They have done everything quite zealously," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet petrol station.
This is a superteam.
There is no delay either.
The construction site could be moved to the south at half-time at the halfway point, until the end of October everything is expected to be ready.
Praise will also be given to those responsible for the construction work, for example, when it comes to the setting up of containers.
Since the construction site has moved south on Monday and the blocking of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen has also been lifted and the connection to Rottenburg has also been restored, the traffic situation within the village has been relaxed.
The citizens can now return from Ofterdingen to the B 27.
The traffic through the place seems to be going back.
"There were some significant complaints," says the Deputy Chief Executive Officer, Florian King, responsible for the transport management of the refurbishment.
The residents of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had struggled with more traffic noise because many cheques were searching and were more likely to trust their Navi than the signage.
What led to some trucks being franked in residential areas.
As the speed limits were not met, the municipality increased the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.
"There have been significant excesses," says King, who made himself aware of the situation on the ground.
Two to three per minute have already been bleached.
The fastest was travelling at 77 kilometres in the Tempo- 30 zone.
Since the construction site has moved on, however, it has become calmer.
For the businessmen at the B 27, it is only a small consolation that, for customers from Rottenburg, the road is now open again.
In the cards, businessmen do not like to look.
But that the B 27 refurbishment at them has led to turnover breaks, leaving everyone to look through.
However, some are more and less affected.
Who has less to do with the "end customer," that is to say for other companies, for which the refurbishment has little impact.
At the Maier car dealership, Thomas Sulz also speaks of a "at most slight decline," but also admits that, of course, "the running customer is missing."
The most battered are the locals along the road.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly crown, finds clear words.
This is already threatening.
Not only him, but all the restaurants have "hit hard."
The customers were missing from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil.
We have to be happy about every euro turnover.
Sales losses are estimated at "well over 50 percent."
Road rehabilitation has "rebuffed" its operation "by two years."
He has had to sack half of his staff.
If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been made redundant, the policy would have reacted differently.
Instead, President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a question from Göhner as to whether there could be financial compensation, with the hint that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation at the B 27.
Göhner knows of other counties where such a thing has been handled more generously.
In all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue.
After all, the family business has been here since 1715, it refers to the long history.
He can understand the fact that other regular guests are now less frequent because of the complicated traffic management.
If you can't drive, it's beautiful elsewhere too.
Göhner has no doubt that his tribal clientele will come back after the end of the rehabilitation work.
Despite the crises with BSE and avian influenza, Göhner keeps the impact of the B 27 construction work on its clientele for the biggest crisis its restaurant has experienced in its long-standing history.
Six months of construction work is already brutal.
