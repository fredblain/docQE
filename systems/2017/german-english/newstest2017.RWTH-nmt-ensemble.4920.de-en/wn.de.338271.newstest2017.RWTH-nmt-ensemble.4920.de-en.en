Better traffic flow on the motorway carrier
It regularly stops on the bypass - here's a picture of November.
But this is to change: the legal blaze is to be extended.
This is good news for all car drivers who are in congestion on the ambient road every night when they drive through the highway (A 43).
The provincial road construction extends next Tuesday and Wednesday (16th / 17th August) in the area between the Hammer Straße and the exit Weseler Straße 700 meters.
Motorists can then turn right from the Hammer Strasse to the right.
The big advantage: the traffic divides more early, improving the overall flow on the much-vaunted section of the Bundesstraße 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district of Münster-West.
The carriageway on the carrier nerves the motorists mainly between 17 a.m. and 19 pm.
Working days stretch back to the bridge over the Albersloher route and sometimes beyond.
The reason is the Nadelöhr on the B 51 just before the exit Weseler Straße.
From here, traffic is only steadily channelled through the highway bridge.
The second track had to be rebuilt just over a quarter of a century ago.
The reason: static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer possesses the necessary power to include, above all, heavy goods traffic.
For how long this bottleneck and the associated work-day congestion will continue, the competent national operation cannot say.
However, there are years to come: the bridge has an official residual duration up to the year 2034.
For the extension of the legal abbey, the national operation has deliberately chosen the weaker time in the school holidays because it is expected to be disabled.
Traffic will be spurred on the construction site on Tuesday and on Wednesday.
