Donald Trump admits there are tremendous problems â€³ in campaigning
The leadership of the U.S. Republicans is plagued by massive worries about losing their majority in traditionally conservative states.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump now admitted weaknesses of his election campaign in the previous Republican high of Utah.
A rare moment in which the normally large-scale and self-assured multimillionaire expressed something like concerns, as correspondents reported.
Having thrown 16 rivals within his own Republican camp out of the race, the doubts are now growing about his success in the battle for the White House.
"We have huge problems in Utah," Trump said before evangelical Christians he asked for support in key states such as Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
Guilt were false reports of his candidacy, he resumed his well-known media outlets.
Republican high bursts waking up
Utah is normally a safe bank for the Republicans.
According to a survey by SurveyUSA from June, Trump and his competitors were equal to the Democrats, Hillary Clinton.
Other institutions see Trump ahead, but not with the distance that is common to Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also at risk.
In an interview by the broadcaster CNBC, Trump responded to the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton's advance again: "just as I have done so far."
And afterwards: this will be "either successful, or I will make a very nice, long holiday."
He is not doing anything other than "telling the truth."
If it's not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness, that's fine, Trump continued.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the party should have threatened Trump to remove funds in support of his campaign, should he not be able to present better polls.
Instead of that, the Republicans "candidates for Congress are more likely to get to grips with it.
