Mystery around fish that landed in garden in Banff
A resident of Banff called for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that the 75 fish could be sand eels sparked by a fountain.
Mr Bain, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, released a video of the spectacle on Periscope in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inch long fish.
