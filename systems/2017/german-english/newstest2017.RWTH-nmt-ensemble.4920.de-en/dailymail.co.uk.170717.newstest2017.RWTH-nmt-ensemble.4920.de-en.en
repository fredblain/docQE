CBC commentator for the Olympics apologises for his statement that Chinese swimmer "died like a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis on the fourth place of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at dr 4 x200m freelance swimmers outraged viewers of the CBC's Livetransfer of the Olmypical Games on Wednesday
Canadian broadcaster CBC had to apologise after one of his commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "went off like Mief" and during the race like "a pig died."
The commentator Byron MacDonalds thought his microphone was switched off when he handed out his own opinions at the end of the 4 x200m freelance swimming pool.
Macdonald, who had been picked into the CBS's commentator team to lend more "colour," could be heard saying: "this little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby."
Too excited, went off like Mief, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second stage of swimming staffing 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to close the gap to China.
Viewers across Canada quickly reacted online after they were shocked by the tone and language
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "has the CBC commentator just said that the 14-year-old swimmer from China" died like a pig "???
The idiot did not capture that they were still on broadcast. "
Ai Yanhan from China was described at the final 4 x 200 m outdoor swimming pool for women: "this little 14-year-old Chinesin has lost the connection, baby."

It was an unfortunate wording, we are sorry that it happened. "

The commentator Scott Russel had to apologise on behalf of MacDonald
CBC coped and added his apology at more than 90 other Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments
The network also apologised quickly and issued a communication.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast.
We quickly apologised to our viewers last night on broadcast and our followers on social media.
To make one thing clear, Byron's comments related to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person.
Yet they were inappropriate and an unhappily chosen wording; Byron is very sorry about what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologised in the broadcast and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that she be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I'd like to take a moment to apologise for the comment I made after the women's swimming squad in the CBC Olympics, he said.
"I was referring to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person."
Of course, no disregard was intended and I am very sorry. "
