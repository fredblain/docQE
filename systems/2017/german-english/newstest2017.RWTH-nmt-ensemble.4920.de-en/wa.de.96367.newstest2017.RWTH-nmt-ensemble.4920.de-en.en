Olympia 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
Caught: due to a positive doping test, weight theater Adrian Zielinski from Poland is not allowed to start in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.
A caught athlete would have won almost a medal.
Before the seventh competition day, the first official doping cases have become the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000 -metre obstacle runner Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Polish weight theater Adrian Zielinski have been tested positive and ruled out in Brazil - immediately before the start of the already critically acclaimed athletics contests, these messages come to an end.
At Chen last Sunday, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide was proven to be used as a masked means for doping substances.
The International Sports Court CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympics on Friday afternoon local time.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old had ranked fourth place in the final over 100 m butterfly, only by 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.
On Friday, Chen should have attended the precincts over 50 m free style.
Chen has requested the opening of the B probe and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
The national association takes the matter "very seriously and requires Chen to cooperate fully in the investigations," Xinhua quoted from a communication: "we will work with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the judgment."
For the first time in history, the IOC is no longer responsible for the sanctioning of athletes with positive cases.
Also on the night of Rio sickened the news about the positive probe at Danekowa, the 33-year-old went on the offensive herself.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," this was "an incredible shock," she told the Bulgarian TV station BNT.
She is innocent, "the only explanation could be food supplements," said the athleticist.
According to the report, the banned substance should be the blood doping instrument EPO.
Danekowa has been suspended provisionally, according to BNT, the B probe is also expected to have been positive.
Bulgaria's prime minister, Bojko Borissow, immediately voiced criticism of the Athletin.
"I do not understand why the athletes do not draw the right conclusions," he said, "we Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."
For example, all weight theorists from the chronically doping nation may not participate in Rio.
On Friday, the case of "Adrian Zielinski" was also known, the London-based Olympic champion in class up to 85 kg was tested positive to the anabole steroid Nandrolon three days earlier.
Both deny the intake, but both are not allowed to start in class up to 94 kg.
Before the launch of the athletes, especially the case of Danekowa is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport.
The International Federation of IAAF had banned the complete Russian team, except for an exception due to systematic doping, and Kenya also produced a lot of bad news in Rio.
In swimming sport, the previous offences in China had also ensured fierce clashes between the athletes.
So the Frenchman, Camille Lacourt, attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang harshly.
"Sun Yang pinches purple."
"When I see the podium over 200 m free style, I want to surrender," Lacourt said on French radio.
Sun was also at the heart of a dispute with Australian Mack Horton.
"I have no time and no respect for doping fraudsters," said this.
Sun had been tested positive for the stimulus trimetazidin in 2014 at the Chinese championships, but had to sit down only a three-month lock.
