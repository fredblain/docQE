GfK leadership resigns after disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK exchanged its boss Matthias Hartmann.
The resignations suddenly came - but not entirely surprising.
The difficult situation of the market research firm GfK was that the chair of chief executive Matthias Hartmann becomes all the more uncertain the longer the successes he promised.
Turbulence at the top of the Nuremberg market research company GfK: after again disappointing business figures and the resignation of corporate governance, the global number five of the industry is facing a new beginning.
GfK board boss wants to leave the company at the end of the year.
The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board, Arno Mahlert, is already leaving the supervisory board with effect from 12 September.
The leadership on the board is already taking over the previous board member Gerhard Hausruckinger as of September 1, the company announced.
He is expected to officially take over the function of a "board spokesman" until a successor to Hartmann is found.
As a reason for the resignations, the company called "different views" on the long-term business orientation.
Details did not want to name a company spokesman on Friday.
Anyone who will be the market research company in the future is still unclear at the moment.
In investor circles, it was said on Friday that the shareholder was most recently disappointed with the continued successes of the restructuring that took place years ago.
Mr Hartmann has been at the GfK top since 2011.
"The fruits of the restructuring have not yet been seen after 5 years," it said.
Given the last bad GfK business figures, any shareholder will eventually become troubled.
"If this were the case with BMW, that would also make the quandaries so," it said.
The company had not been able to stop its loss journey in the second quarter of 2016 after setbacks in the prior quarter.
With 361.2 million€, sales were up 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable prior-year quarter.
Related to the first half of the year, sales shrank by 3.4 percent at 721.2 million€.
The profit in the second quarter, in particular, has burdened the company's sunken value in the face of its difficult economic situation.
The company's depreciation of €139 million, which was necessary in the Consumer Experience Division, gave the Group a loss of €148.2 million.
In the second quarter of 2015, GfK had still generated a group profit of 19.7 million.
