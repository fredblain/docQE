Russia and Turkey: a "alliance of outsiders"?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gold-plated hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most.
There was the handshake, yes.
But Putin's smile worked narrowly and he barely radiated warmth, even for his restrained conditions.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke repeatedly of his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report whole five times.
I couldn't count it any more.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old pre-crisis level, but will even improve.
The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have behaved as if there had never been anything bad.
It seemed to me that his enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite.
But a Sustainable Killed, sparked by Putin, showed that Russia's head of state had forgotten nothing.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory remarks: the shutdown of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border by Turkey.
Moscow's response at the time was wrapped up.
Putin shared and accused Ankara of falling into the back of Russia.
The offence was even greater as it was committed by a supposed friend.
Rebuilding the vetting will be difficult, if not impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the government-controlled media carried out a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara.
At once, it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.
The most serious were the accusations by senior officials that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He has vehemently denied this.
But in St.Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan, who he wanted to hear.
Russia was able to make a kind of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are clear.
Erdogan needs in the first place all the friends he can get after he was unveiled last month at a failed coup d "état almost his office.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - particularly the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has decreased by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be facilitated when flights are resumed.
They count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean.
This week, state television predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.
A report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows: "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."
But the visit had an added political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West as it considers its response to the attempted seizure of power as a weak response.
On top of that, the persistent resentment is about the snail's pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is keen to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey's relationship with the West.
The Russian head of state certainly won a bonus in Ankara for calling for support for the elected state bodies after the attempted coup d "état.
This is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change.
The summit in this glorious palace at the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portray one, as one analyst once described to me, "alliance of outsiders": two countries that feel the West and feel badly treated and now allied.
Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still major differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave itself the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It could be telling that after nearly three hours of initial talks both presidents said at the press conference that they wouldn't even have stripped the issue.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize it.
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator on Syria can be found.
But after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey shot down the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state at least talk to each other again.
