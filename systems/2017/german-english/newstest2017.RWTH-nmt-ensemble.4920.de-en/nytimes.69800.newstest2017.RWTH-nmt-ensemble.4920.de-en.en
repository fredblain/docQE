Amid the Rage of the Olympics, the Zen of the Trampoline
Wherever you are, however late it is, it is the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel steady and inescapable, a rushing squeeze between competition and quest.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning stove, which is passed from the bracelet to the swimmer to the turner to the triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour's conversation in the queue at the Coffeshop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is here for the first time at the Olympics and a women's swarm with greens, could well have been among those familiar names sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising if he were a swimmer, turner or even a fan.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting gold in the Olympic trampoline turf.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event the same.
Further from the centre, partly in the shadows are the sports that are not universally recognised: air gun shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always have the breast swim and may it prevail for a long time.
But if I should modestly make arguments for my particular favourite, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline rush has already been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it was perceived so sparingly the last 16 years that many the, I had interviewed, did not know it was an Olympic sport at all.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the U.S. sent athletes to compete, it has never won a medal in the trampoline rush and has had an athlete by 2012 who has managed it to the end.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians who share for the women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
The trampoline rush has a certain outsider charm, in part because it sounds more fitting for the unenlightened ear for a clownish school than that for the Olympics.
At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert but just an earnest enthusiast.
It has humorous potential - the cartoonish trembling of its never-ending impact - but also the grace of the turf and diving, the two sports that essentially unite it.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El Trampolin, which means as much as "springboard."
Rising sieges jump on a gigantic trampoline, shooting almost up to 30 feet into the air and having to take a series of falling movements (turning, hitting and saltos) before landing on their feet.
They are assessed according to the official Olympic program after execution, difficulty level and "flight time."
Twenty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight.
Medal hopefuls must go further, faster, up and down in their quest for gold, sometimes up to the goal, sometimes back and forth, up and down in the playground.
Not only are they hunting the finishing line or the starting wall, but also in television broadcasting another heightened goal: that of the world or of the Olympics.
The purposeful pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical - and it's enough to even stir a spectator to tears.
But it's also what I feel as something tiring even when watching these games.
Of this, the trampoline offers a breathing space.
The vector of the trampoline controller is above.
A forward movement is not the goal.
He or she collides, seemingly heavy-handed like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.
Here, too, there is competition, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.
It's as Zen as the competition at the Olympics can only be.
The women's qualifying and final will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming around 13,00 Eastern Time; that of men on Saturday, also at 13,00.
NBC will broadcast the final hours as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14,00.
Amid the Olympic mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in the general tumult.
If the increase in awareness can only be achieved by the anxiety and objectification of male athletes - as the male U.S. Turner suggested recently, according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr Dooley expects his new fan community to be rushed to air.
