Donald Trump election campaign indicted after staff allegedly pulled weapon
New York: Donald Trump's campaign has been charged with alleged inaction after it was announced that her campaign manager for North Carolina had directed a firearm on an employee in February while travelling in a jeep in February.
The incident is described in an indictment filed on Wednesday in Charlotte's National Court by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in this state.
Bordini admitted to having waited for months that the matter would be settled internally before he realised that "this would not happen."
The campaign manager, Earl Philip, "drew a gun, put his right pointer on the deduction, and rammed the run in Vincents Kneekehle," Bordini admitted in his charge.
After complaining at the local and regional campaign management, Bordini noted that at least four other people had already made the same experience with Phillip, he admitted in the indictment.
"Weapons do not need to be fired to cause damage," Bordini said.
The indictment comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate sparked an uproar when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the "second Amendment people" - firearms owners and gun enthusiasts - should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton is elected and appointed judges.
Trump's campaign made it clear that the media had ripped his words out of context and that he would not incite violence.
Bordinis' complaint requires damages from the campaign for the breach of due diligence and from Philip for injury and lasting mental damage.
Trump's press secretary, Hope Hicks, was not to be reached for an opinion.
Attempts to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local news channel in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer a member of the campaign.
On calls at his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, was not reacted.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has run a controversial campaign so far.
The procedure is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16 -CS- 14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
