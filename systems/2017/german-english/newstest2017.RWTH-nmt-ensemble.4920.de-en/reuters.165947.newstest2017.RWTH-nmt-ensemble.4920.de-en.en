The Democratic Forces of Syria (DKS), after the excerpt of the remaining group of fighters who have buried within the city, are currently the city.
They have freed over 2,000 civilians held hostage by the militants, Sharfan Darwish of the Manbij Military Council allied with the DKS told Reuters.
"The city is now under complete control, but we are just carrying out clean-up work," he told Reuters.
