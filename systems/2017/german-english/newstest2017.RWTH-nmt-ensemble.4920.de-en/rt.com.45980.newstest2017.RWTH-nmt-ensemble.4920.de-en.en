Trade between Russia & Iran suddenly rises to 71% - RT Business
With the lifting of sanctions, according to the Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 percent year-on-year.
Since international sanctions on Iran were lifted, interest on the part of Russian companies in shops in the country grew sharply, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are taking up existing links with Iran, while new firms are willing to gain access to the market.
Of course, further trade expansion is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran, "said Dzhagaryan.
He noted that trading turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9% in the first five months of 2016 compared with the same period in 2015, and was $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports into Iran rose by 91.5%, and $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16% to $158 million.
The trade recovery has been achieved by supplies of machines, land vehicles and weapons, "the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan goes from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia for this year.
Last year, Russian foreign representation issued about 35,000 visas, primarily rice evisas, to Iranian citizens.
Moreover, Iran reached the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia.
You could say that record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia are being broken last year, "he said.
At the same time, only relatively few Russians visit Iran, something the ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, who have received monuments of ancient Persian civilisation in a good state," he said.
