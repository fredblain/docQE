The U.S. wins fourth match in women's field hockey, a showdown with Britain faces
A day after she shot three goals during a 6 - 1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the women's American field hockey team in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 - 0.
Five goals in two games should actually be a memorable achievement, but Bam (27) said she could not remember having ever done that.
"I have no idea," she said.
I'm not one of those people who keep their gates in mind.
However, she knows this: the Americans are in the Olympic competition at 4 - 0 and are in their group with the British in the first place, who remain unbeaten after their 2 - 0 victory against Japan.
Britain and the United States will meet in the last game of the first round on Saturday.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which of the two within their group from six teams will each gain first and second place.
The first-place finish will be a little longer out of the way that the other group cites.
Whatever the game may be on Saturday, Americans have sparked a surprising hurricane through their success story, four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 places.
BAM was part of that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey sleeper in hands (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), with 16 years she became a national player of the United States, the youngest in the team's history.
She missed the Olympics in 2008 as she couldn't qualify for the cadre.
Then came the year 2012, in which everything went wrong for her and her team.
In the following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, became a coach of the national team, and so things began to turn to better.
"A change of culture, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.
We didn't have the workload in London that we have now.
We've been able to rip the helm completely.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the goalkeeper in the first half of the game with a retreat from the close range.
India had gone into the game without a victory in the tournament, but the team were surprisingly tough and held the game stand from 1 - 0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.
She performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and lugged the ball into the gate to give American women a 2 - 0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.
The shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the United States goalkeeper, Jackie Briggs, who so far had to have a gate in each of the previous games.
She has a run.
Just like Bam.
"We're in a good position" said Parnham, but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday.
