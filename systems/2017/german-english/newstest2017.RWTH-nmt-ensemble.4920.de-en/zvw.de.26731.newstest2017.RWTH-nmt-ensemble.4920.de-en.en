Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee officer
Annika Deuschle is the contact person in terms of integration and organizer.
She is also a social worker on the ground.
Since July, Annika Deuschle has been the refugee officer for Urbach.
The Social Pedagogist supports the management team around Achim Grockenberger.
It sees itself as a contact person for all actors: refugees, working groups, administration, authorities and anyone else.
Regine customer from the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the ice-legged wool mill, which, above all, has a problem.
For example, some - less intense than the multitude of requests for tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the post.
An administrative power has been sought with a talent for languages and people, coupled with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, an ice-legged wool mill.
But administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deuschle.
Above all, it is about organisation, work with the people on the ground and also behind the scenes as well as network activity.
The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.
It has a 50 percent limit on three years.
"It was high time," says Regine customer, that Annika Deuschle supports honorary and full-time actors.
There are big and small problems, organisational, human and understanding problems.
Soon new containers stand in the Wasenstraße
A serious problem has been for some time to find homes for the connecting refugees who have been recognised.
Local authorities are responsible for the connection.
They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms.
The cost of the construction, rent or renovation of these shelters must be borne by the local authorities themselves.
The responsibility changes from the Countess to the Commune and Jobcenter.
Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been very difficult for some time.
De facto, the administration does not find private homes.
It has not worked so far, so it is necessary to rely on private housing, according to Deuschle.
That is why it is necessary to make public housing esteemed, as it is so beautiful.
So soon new containers will be set up in the Wasenstraße.
But only with homes is it not done.
Perspective is the key word, are Regine Customer and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to a firm bust, it is internships, training places, school places, one-euro jobs and aid activities for refugees and migrants who need to be funded or set up.
"More places would be good," reports Regine Customer.
Many work in the building yard or help house master, do non-profit work - and that motivates and very properly, as Annika Deuschle reports.
It hopes that work for the community will lead to a positive outlook.
This is "no employment therapy."
However, activity does not just mean work.
The day needs a firm structure, say Deuschle and customer.
People would have to develop a sense of belonging.
So it needs offers such as sports, contacts with locals and, above all, language courses.
Professional courses are rar.
So, here too, administration and volunteers are jumping.
It is central that the refugees feel they are wanted and welcome in Germany.
The long duration of the procedures is a problem.
They must explain to the refugees that it is just that it takes and that they can bridge the time, for example, with language courses.
Anyone who eventually develops the feeling that he can't help anybody in Urbach should not work and be useless, who will never integrate.
The clear majority is motivated.
However, there is also a problem, says the customer, "people who do nothing at all." The work of Deuschle and the customer is therefore always to motivate others.
All this is a "mammoth task."
A difficult question: have the two been afraid of radicalisation after recent events, including in a small community like Urbach?
"No," says Regine customer very clearly, "what some may call naive." A residual risk cannot and does not want to exclude them.
However, the helpers are already aware of this.
These incidents are also subject to refugees.
Those would have the fear that the offenders will bring them completely into disrepute.
"They want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine customer.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
So the main and honorary people on the ground and in the region must look for activities.
In doing so, they always have in the background that a new thrust of refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.
Does Germany need a ceiling?
To answer this question clearly, politics is shy.
In fact, it is unfair to put them on the ground.
"In Urbach we have not yet arrived where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would relax the situation.
Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbachers are already in the process of being able to integrate the previous people sensibly.
These are currently around 100 people, mostly young men.
But when people are in need, they have to help them, both women agree.
The political world situation is so complicated, there are no easy answers.
