Police set up tear gas & rubber shells against protesting Brazilian students
Students joined the police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday when they gathered to demonstrate against the government's reforms for the public education system.
Police set up tear gas and rubber shells against the protesters.
The difficulties began when police officers tried to drive the students apart, resulting in the police deploying rubber shells and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their dismay over the plans.
According to proposals from the governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, a little less than 100 public schools will be closed, while 300,000 students will be implemented to save money.
Some of the protest participants looked at graffiti against the provisional president, Michel Temer, on walls.
The latest protests took place a few days after protesters took to the streets in masses to support suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been unveiled by a vote of the Senate to her defiance from office.
