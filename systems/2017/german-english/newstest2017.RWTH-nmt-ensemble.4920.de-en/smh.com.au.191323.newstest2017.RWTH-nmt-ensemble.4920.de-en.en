More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September edition of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September edition of U.S. Vogue.
Kendall, who is a brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran to Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to the wine," Kendall wrote.
The cover's revelation followed a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians similar?), scripted reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (except the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn, as well as in the presence of the most popular showbiz uncle and producer of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as they forget the cover of their sister and that ends with a classic turn: they have all planned a surprise party.
This represents the cliched action of almost every birthday episode of a child's broadcast (Seacrest brought the phrase, "you thought that we would have forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon canine on a transmitter at 8 in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity somehow.
With regard to the September edition of Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall's big sister Kim may have beaten her as far as the Vogue-cover is concerned (she and her husband Kanye West were seen on it in April 2014), but the cover of the September edition of the magazine is a league for itself.
The September edition is the most sold edition of the year for Vogue.
With an amount that resembles an image band rather than a fashion magazine, the output attracts a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista was of the 832 pages of the roller 615 pages advertising).
The revelation of his cover star is so eagerly awaited that in the past two years images of the magazine have been sickened even before the official announcement.
Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have clearly been more "celebrities who are modeling" than "models, the celebrities are" on the cover.
Oscar winner and dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honor.
But even with the low chance that Mrs Jenner - described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the previous category, she is in good company.
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or youngsters of today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even if it's all on Jenner).
They are really talented women who are distinguished in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, Jenner's success doesn't like everyone.
With her reality TV story, Jenner's position in the fashion world was always somewhat tense.
In June, the former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized them and called them "the mistes of the moment."
Those feelings boiled again high when the news came out with the appearance of Jenner on the Vogue cover.
But the point seems to be on the point of displeasure.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of Vogue.
She is in the truest sense of the word a supermodel.
She runs for Marc Jacobs.
It makes advertisements for your grunting of Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of yourself on their respective paywall-apps.
She sells from her made pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to the journal LOVE.
And in her spare time she is seen in Reality TV, probably only to see her sister Kourtney and her children.
