Haigerloch: pilgrims to the gate of mercy
The ministrants from the Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were travelling on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Together, four stages have been managed.
In order to bridge the time until the next romance of all the ministries in two years "time, the St. Anna Supreme Council has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.
Various pilgrimage destinations were examined and the Bishop city of Freiburg was finally decided, where this year, during the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage destination was offered with the gate of mercy at the Freiburg Munster.
16 minis from Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Heiligenzimmern were on the way.
In the evening before, pastor Storost sent the pilgrims out in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrimage crosses and issued the pilgrimage.
From Horb, it was taken by train to the starting point of Villingen, where a Munster of Our Lady is also a woman and so the pilgrimage was joined by the Munster.
The individual day tours have been surrounded by a short impulse in the morning and in the evening, with different prayers, songs and texts.
But even on the way, the minis at field crosses, chapels or churches repeatedly made roast to sing together a song from specially assembled pilgrimage lyrics.
For the overnight stays, the parish homes of the local parishes were available.
At the stages, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty as well as strong dinner and breakfast.
On the second day, we went through Furtwangen to Gütenbach.
Day after day, the stage to St. Peter, which was the most strenuous route, had to climb around 500 meters of altitude in the wake of a sluggish heat.
The earned reward was a common barbecue at the Badweiher in the evening.
After the morning impulse on the fourth pilgrimage day in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, it went to the final stage to Freiburg.
Visibly relieved and happy, the Minis met at the Freiburg Münster later in the afternoon and passed through the gate of mercy.
With a little impulse, God was thanked here.
In the evening fair in the Münster, the minis arrived at the Pilgrim target were greeted by collaborator Markus Obert.
After the service, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.
The next day was still time for the Breisgaumetropole.
In the afternoon it went back to Horb by train.
In the end, all participants agreed that the days were marked by spirituality and a strong community experience.
