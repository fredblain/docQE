Military leadership distorts ISIS intelligence information, notes congressional committee
Military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than it would have allowed actual conditions on the ground, a congressional committee of inquiry reported in a report on Thursday.
The provisional report, created by a Task Force of Republican members of the Armed Forces Committee, Secret Service Commitees and the WehrBudget Command, reports of major discontent among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how prescriptions changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against Islamic State.
The Central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Intelligence information, typically sent off by high-level Centcom commanders, regularly featured a more positive image of American efforts against terrorism than it would have allowed the actual conditions on the ground, and were consistently more positive than analysis of other intelligence services," a newspaper article quoted the report as saying.
"What happened at the Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The leadership flaws in the Centcom range to the top of the organization.
The ten -page report shows detailed problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.
Although it does not provide direct indications that government spikes under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts faced pressure from their pre-laws to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, opinions and statements in front of Congress were much more positive than the facts," the report noted.
For example, a Centcom associate publicly announced that a military recapture of Mossuls could start as early as April or May 2015.
Mossul, Iraq's second largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, it is so much clear," said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in an opinion.
From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, Central Command's peaks changed intelligence reports to downplay the danger posed by ISIS in Iraq.
Republicans called the task force into life after they were told that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on Islamic State.
The report, published on Thursday, will still be completed by more detailed findings while the investigation continues.
In addition, further investigation by the Centcom reports is under way by the Department of Defense's inspector general.
Democratic members of the intelligence committee released their own findings on Thursday, coinciding with some of the Republican task force's conclusions.
"In 2014 and 2015, the Centcom created an overly limited process for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," the highest-ranking Democrat in the Committees, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, announced in an opinion.
This process, according to Mr. Schiff, "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," damaged the morality among analysts and "gave excessively little room for divergent opinions."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said not to have found any evidence of a White House intervention at the Centcom analysts about a "certain political opinion."
The preliminary results of the congressional investigation were published on Tuesday by "the Daily Beast."
Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon's inspector general, which were recorded following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon press secretary, admitted in an opinion that the Department of Defense would not comment on any reports from Congress, while the inspector general's investigation was still under way.
But he also admitted that "experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions about the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense."
The investigation has repercussions beyond the issue of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim that is now being made by a growing number of defense ministry members).
Last year's accusations, however, raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and other crisis regions.
Criticizing the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of constraints from more than ten years ago, when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, drafted a document on how the then government under George W. Bush, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, foresaw only a small occupying force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current coverage of the Islamic State.
Last year, the team around Mr. Hooker, according to government offices, notes that, contrary to the government's statements, airstrikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would not have a significant impact on the terrorist group's financial position, as these provisional refineries would have been commissioned to sell oil on the black market.
However, this finding was not published, the Times reported in September.
Centcoms then commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
