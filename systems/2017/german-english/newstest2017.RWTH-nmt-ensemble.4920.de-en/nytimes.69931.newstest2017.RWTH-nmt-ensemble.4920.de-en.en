The depressing food of the economic crisis in "an abundant meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his rise to the president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch in the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt had a Faible for refined delicacies of Fifth Avenue such as PÃ¢te de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup.
His menu that day was slightly more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, potato purple and as dessert a plum pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "it was also a message to Americans how they should eat."
The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coes' last book, "Chop Suey," handled from Chinese cuisine in the US, while Ziegelman was told in her book "97 Orchard" about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side from the food perspective.
Her latest collaboration, "a decent meal," which will appear at Harper Verlag on Tuesday, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at the Eisenberg's Sandwich shop for dinner, a small, snarling snack in the Flatiron District, which has already been in store since the 1929 stock market crash.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive groves, while Coe, 57, had Truthahn with potato purple and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered hackbrats, this found the pair fit for a discussion about eating in the era of the Great Depression.
"Rich foods were very popular," said Ziegelman.
There was earth bread, liver cheese and bean bread.
They were prepared from an ingredient and something billionaire that stretches the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many Earth nuts that they serve them as dinner.
Coe grinned.
"It must have been in the stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table was an all-you-can-eat buffet in an American household, especially in rural areas.
Teams of women cooked for male field workers and it was served freshly baked pasta for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who, during the first world war, sent food to starving Europeans. "A Square Meal" sets out the ways in which the country could no longer be the country of origin.
"It was a time when food was a central, tense issue for Americans," Coe said, why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Just as tense was the new budget diet: mysterious dishes such as bread and casserole became basic foods, the casserole as a "wonderful way of restoring eating remains," noted bricks, as chefs were able to hide unappetising ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry fruit.
Meat, which was the centrepiece of American cuisine for years, became a rarely served luxury.
Peculiar mixtures were tried, as a calorific and nutritious satisfaction took precedence over taste or even healthy kitchen mind.
During their search for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from this epoch, baked onions with earth nut butter.
"It was not a popular addition at lunch," says Coe.
Brick man continues: "it was surreal."
Nut butter and baked onions do not match each other.
It was typical for many of the house economic recipes.
As never before, or ever since, household economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 - 1943 - have been doing the country's eating habits.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "household politicians" and meet the challenge of turning pamps like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
"A Square Meal" is a celebration of historical delicacies.
In particular, the reports of the government's response to the starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoovers' Lass-Mich-Kuchen-Essen-attire, are very palatable.
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen, he feeds like the millionaire man of world to which he has become.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," said Coe.
He was in an almost gold-plated dining room and was wearing a smoke.
He was gloriously alien to reality.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not asked him to set an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, the arrival of a householder with no interest in flavours by Mrs Roosevelt meant that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most dismal. "
Many of the species from the era of the Great Depression to deal with food was discarded once the country came back on its feet.
The legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food, Ziegelman said, as well as how science was applied to food.
The pair gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother-in-law when writing the book - for example, how she couldn't throw food away.
"She had a real fear of wasting food," said Coe.
Ziegelman remembered: "she actually made people sick."
There was the windbag incident.
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, they and Coe drew a dessert that they had prepared at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt had at lunchtime.
"It is called Prune Whip," said Ziegelman, adding that it was a common trick to miss modest recipes a chic name.
There was no bearded cream, just plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Each one appeared somewhat reluctant a spoon in the tough, brown Glibber.
Amazingly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe picked up a surcharge three times.
Like a Can-Do budgeter, he said to his wife, "a few hacked walnuts would help."
