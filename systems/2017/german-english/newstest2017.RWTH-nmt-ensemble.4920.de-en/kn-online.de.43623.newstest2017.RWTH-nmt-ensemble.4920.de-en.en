Steel - Light for German steel industry
The crisis-hit and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared from additional costs in millions of€.
Financial burdens that threatened the industry from eco-electricity support are off the table.
In the case of the liberation of the renewable-energy levy in the stock systems for the so-called equity production in the German steel industry, German Minister of Economics Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "West German General Newspaper" (WAZ, Friday edition) said.
"I am really pleased that we have finally managed to achieve this after two years of tough negotiations."
As a result, the European Commission had initially planned to ask the steel producers who use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption.
The steel industry threatened additional costs of between 120 and 240 million€ per year, according to the German industry association.
Gabriel told the WAZ that there is now a basic agreement with the EU Commission following talks with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
It is only when the generators are replaced in the steel plants that an EEG levy of 20 percent is applied.
This, too, is not being raised in the steel industry.
The IG Metal welcomed Germany's agreement with the EU Commission on the production of equity.
As a result, the status quo of the previous scheme is largely enshrined.
The successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry are particularly important.
"With regard to our" steel "campaign, this is a first step."
"Others must follow."
"Climate and employment targets are also to be weighed in the reform of emissions trading," said IG Metal Chief Executive Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
The steel industry in Europe has been suffering from overcapacity and significant price pressures since the 2008 financial crisis.
Last year, the situation further intensified when the world's largest producer of producers threw mass steel into the world market, given the weakening domestic demand.
European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel corporations of price dumping.
In the course of this spring, the situation has been somewhat relaxed.
On the one hand, import tariffs on import steel have been effective and, on the other hand, the economic outlook in China has arisen.
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.
The German industry primus Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.
Most recently, prices would have been more stagnant.
The industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
ThyssenKrupp also did not want to exclude closures of individual works.
Around 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015.
In July, German steel manufacturers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.
They produced a good six percent less crude steel with 3.4 million tonnes than in the previous month, as the Stahl Economic Association announced on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the crowd now declined the second month in succession.
Since the beginning of the year, production has been up by two percent below the previous year's level.
In the coming months, the association expects an increase in the volume of orders.
