Fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio have come out this week over the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, out of edge and band, who has proved to be an impressive doppelgänger of the Duchess of Cambridge.

The team member of the U.S. team in arch shooting Brady Ellison has caused a rush on Twitter after images on which he sees the Wolf of Wall Street star intriguingly similar.
In fact, the arch protector got the madness on social media and admitted that he has been hearing since his childhood that he looks like Leo.
"I do not see a great similarity, except for facial hair," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He is a good-looking guy, so I am a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will no doubt be even more focused this year: the upsetting similarity between British wife Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
