NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably once habitable.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether the Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and CO2 dense atmosphere, could once have shown erratic conditions.
Scientists have previously hinted that the slow revolt of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus may have had a thin, erratic atmosphere and yet slowly turned on.
The model also lit up the topography of early Venus.
The planet probably dismissed more dry areas than de Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to house life and protected from rapid evaporation.
The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.
"In the GISS model simulation, the slow revolt of Venus exposed its daily side of the sun for almost two months," said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the sun's heat.
The result is average temperatures, which are some degrees cooler than that of Earth today.
The model brought forth a history of Venus similar to the evolution that was previously believed by planetary researchers.
Although it was once presumably habitable, the Venus -- over the course of several billion years -- was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans darkened and their water vapour was burned away from the ultraviolet light.
As their hydrogen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a lethal greenhouse effect -- the Venus, which as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.
