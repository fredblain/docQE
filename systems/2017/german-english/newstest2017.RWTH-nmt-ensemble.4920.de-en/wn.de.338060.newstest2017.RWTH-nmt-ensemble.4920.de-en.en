De Maizière said that after the violence perpetrated by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people would have worried about further attacks.
The state must respond positively and decisively to terrorist threats.
What is certain is that our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and split.
We will not treat this triumph to the terrorists.
If criminals would have to leave the country more quickly, it would increase the security and strength of the population's support for refugee policy.
De Maizière wants to achieve the implementation of the proposals until the 2017 federal election.
He also announced a further staffing of the security forces, "on a medium four -digit scale over several years."
Sympathy for terrorism must be punished again.
Video surveillance is to be improved, the gun law is so novel that, above all, the purchase of weapons on the Internet is made more difficult.
The most recently discussed confidentiality for doctors is to be preserved according to de Maizière's words.
However, in dialogue with the medical profession, he wants to seek solutions to how to reduce the vulnerability of citizens, he said, with a view to mental health.
In order to counter the radicalisation of refugees, the Minister considers that better social care is needed.
Teachers would have to be better prepared for dealing with traumatised people.
To prosecute criminals in special areas of the Internet (Darknet), de Maizière plans to use concealed investigators.
SPD leader Gabriel said: "the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security."
It is important that the Minister for the Interior has made a clear opposition to action.
"This was an earnest for the sharemarkets in the CDU / CSU," Gabriel told the newspapers of the Funke Media Group (Friday).
De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the Union for a Burka ban and the abolition of dual nationality.
He considers a general ban on full concealment to be constitutionally problematic.
You cannot ban everything that you reject, and I reject the wearing of the burqa.
It is possible to talk about rules, for example, in the field of road transport or for witnesses in the courts.
Greens leader Simone Peter accused the minister of wanting to simulate power and ability to act with ever new anti-terror packages.
Left-wing party leader Bernd Riexinger said: "fleet spray and a tightening of the right of residence do not bring more security to the people of this country."
