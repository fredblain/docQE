Trump doesn't see the looming election defeat as close
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a campaign event in Florida.
If there is nothing to do with the election to the U.S. president, Donald Trump already has an alternative video.
He then goes on holiday.
If Donald Trump loses the U.S. presidential election in November, it would be relatively irrelevant to him: "ultimately it will either clap, or I have a very, very beautiful, long holiday," the Republican candidate said in a phone interview with the U.S. television broadcaster CNBC.
If it's not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness, that's fine, Trump said.
So he described U.S. President Barack Obama and the Democrats "candidate, Hillary Clinton, as the founder of the Islamic State (IS).
Within his party, more and more resistance was formed.
