Rescue in Moelfre Bay: three men have "luck still to be alive"
Three men have "luck still to be alive" after being thrown from their fishing boat before Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station struck at 13:20 BST alarm on Friday after a crew watched the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulty swimming in safety while their boat was moving on their own.
"We saw how the boat turned around and presented us with the worst," said the head of the rescue station of Moelfre Vince Jones.
"Thankfully, the strong winds have already won the boat apart from their reach until we left to water," he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man at the age of 60 was exhausted and hanged on a boje hanging without a lifeguard.
They all arrived aboard the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
Mr Jones said: "the three men thrown into the water are lucky and still alive.
Although the bootengine had an emergency stopplein, it loosened the boat from the person who steered the boat.
Someone has woken up about these men today.
