At first glance, the Rigaer Street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not work like this, but the police are one of the "dangerous places" of the city.
If you go down the road from the east to the west, you will arrive at playgrounds, a freshly deleted nursery and a biolade.
To the facade of a grey house, someone has sprayed "ugly!"
Compared to a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, it is already being built: a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments is to be created by 2017.
Articles about this "trendy district," as the relevant real estate company Friedrichshain calls it, are, however, preferred in recent weeks with burning cars.
The reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have lease contracts, but on the ground floor are still occupied rooms and are used for events.
In particular, since the beginning of the year, the Berlin interior senator, Henkel, has argued several times for a tough action by the police against the project, calling the area a "no-go zone" for police officers and the 94 as the starting point for autonomous violence.
After on June 22 the rooms on the ground floor, the cadtersmiths, had been cleared with 300 police officers, police patrolled official statements for three weeks with 30 to 40 officers and three team cars on the ground, locked up parts of the road and kept visitors from entering the house with number 94.
Meanwhile refurbished construction workers on behalf of the unknown homeowners the rooms.
On July 13, a Berlin administrative court ruled that clearance had been illegal, and a day later, police and construction workers moved under the cheer of sympathisers and residents.
On this summer afternoon, the road works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the pavement in front of the houses in the sun, others entertain themselves in front of Sp√§ti.
In the immediate vicinity of the house projects lie a primary school and nursery school.
Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in the Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who has three children here, are mainly generous from the police presence.
With the residents of the house projects, they share the concern about rising rents and gentrification.
It doesn't sound like a Kiez, who wanted a majority of police protection against vandal left.
The ditch that the Berlin interior senator and police make up between house occupiers and their neighbors does not appear to exist.
Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district, which today has a low average income and high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city.
Home occupations and the housing projects that have been born have also long been part of the Kiez: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainz street near the Rigaer.
While the Mainzer had been cleared under great police force in a real street battle, many of the projects in the Rigaer were legalised and are still inhabited by the people they had occupied 26 years ago.
At the same time, in recent years, the district has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and election berliners from around the world: with them, residents from DDR times and former house occupiers are now sharing their jaws.
This is also noticeable in the rents, which have risen by nearly 60 percent in new rents since 2009.
Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: one recognizes them on inserted slices or freshly removed facades, which have been thrown with colour bags.
No other road has been mentioned so often this year along with the words "left-autonomous violence."
One reason that not all neighbors view this as a problem may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as bodily injury are almost exclusively directed against policemen.
Most of the offences make up property damage, which tends to hit the new buildings and freshly refurbished houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a rental house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, there can be no talk of uncertainty.
As far as acts of violence are concerned, it is appealing: the people in the 94 are their neighbors, who have certainly not been.
Even the famous burning cars no longer exist in the Rigaer.
For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "here one helps each other, lives together on the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere."
Neugebauer is deliberately pulled into Rigaer Street - and stayed.
That is why it was so important to her that the residents get their road back: from the police, the politics and the media, who all suddenly claimed the authority over the district in July.
But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away from them: through faceless new buildings in former building gaps that crowd out the old residents.
"These are, after all, property flats that are not interesting for many here - here are more people who are not so well beguiled," she says.
"I absolutely cannot endorse violence and destruction."
But what should you do if you never listen to someone?
There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the inhabitants.
For Zugezogens, who are annoyed by colour bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.
Anyone who draws on should be aware of this - just like someone who moves into a pub district, can complain badly about noise there.
