The £2 -per day drug that can lower heart attack risk
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £2 per day drug after being recommended by the authorities to administer this more people for a longer period of time.
The germinating drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with a heart disease.
The drug is already administered for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
The NHS's regulator NICE has recommended a four -year long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.

Around 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or a stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the artery walls that make up coverings.
When the Belag breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot that closes blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.
If the blood clot solves, it can flow through the bloodstream and clog the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, which is produced by the British company AstraZeneca and is distributed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more unlikely.
NICE's draft bill, published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90 mg of Ticagrelor, followed by 60 mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre said: "despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all those who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or a stroke - often with disastrous consequences."
The fear of a renewed heart attack can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
Experience shows that in combination with aspirin, Ticagrelor is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who already had a heart attack.
Through a provisional recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
The information on the effectiveness and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years.
