Olympia: tennis professional Siegemund miss semi-finals
Laura Siegemund's victory ended in the quarter-finals of Rio: the world-class 32th from Metzingen missed by a 1:6, 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico / WTA-Nr.
34) the semi-finals of the Olympic tennis tournament.
Siegemund, who was plagued by back problems, was able to get her surcharge through only once and acted powerlessly compared to the previous rounds.
On Thursday, medal hopeful Angelique Kerber (Kiel / No. 2) still had the chance to jump into the preview round.
The Australian Open winner met on the Britin Johanna Konta (No. 10).
As the last German tennis pro, Tommy Haas had picked up a medal (silver) in Sydney in 2000.
Two German DTB starters in the quarter-finals of summer games had last given it in 1992.
There has never been a German duo in an Olympic single-semi-final.
