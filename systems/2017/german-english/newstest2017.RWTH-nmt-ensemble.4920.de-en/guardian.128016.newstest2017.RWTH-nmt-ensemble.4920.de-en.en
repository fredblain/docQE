French court rejects offer over demolition of shops in Jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an offer by authorities in Calais to tear down dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the Calais Jungle where thousands of refugees live.
At a court hearing this week, authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorized to tear down 72 provisional deals where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hairdressing services, or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few€ in provisional restaurants.
The Calais prefecture argued that these places should be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would pose a risk of fire and sanity.
Humanitarian groups informed the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the government-backed association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They also carried out that the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille decided that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of people running the 72 provisional deals, but acknowledged that the concerns of the Calais prefecture were "absolutely understandable."
The judge, Jean-François Molla, said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than simply feeding people who "live in extremely precarious conditions."
He said the areas provide quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the defeat was the Jungle Book Kids "Café of the camp, which is operated nonprofit and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as a consultancy on asylum matters for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to uphold the kids "cafe.
In a letter to the Guardian, it said that the closure would be "a disaster for these children, the youngest of whom are eight years old."
The two aid agencies Help Refugees and L "Auberge des Miert estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the Jungle camp had risen to more than 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in newcomers over the summer.
