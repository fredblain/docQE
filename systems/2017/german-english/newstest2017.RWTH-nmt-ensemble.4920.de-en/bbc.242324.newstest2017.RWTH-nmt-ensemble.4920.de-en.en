Assistant doctors strike: calls for new workplace action
Deputies of the assistant doctors have called on their union to approve new workplace measures in their disputes regarding a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called for its entire council to approve more work measures from the beginning of September.
The JDC said that ministers had failed to respond to the concerns about the Treaty.
Assistant doctors and medical students voted on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA in July.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to members released on Twitter on Thursday evening, the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said the government had remained "persistently quiet" to problems, resulting in the contract being rejected.
She said: "in view of this, the JDC Board of Directors has voted to reject the proposed new treaty completely and to call for official renegotiations on all of them."
In response to the government's silence, the JDC Board today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing program of escalating workplace measures that begins at the beginning of September.
The disputes led to assistant doctors striking six times this year, the first overall outages in the history of the NHS.
The head of BMA assistant doctors Dr Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed terms of the contract, which had been recommended by the BMA.
He informed BMA members during the meetings, which took place before the vote by 54,000 assistant doctors and medical students, that the contract was beneficial and should be adopted.
After the vote, the Health Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said the contract would be forcibly introduced for doctors in England.
