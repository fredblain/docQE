Corporation rises in start-up for live video game broadcasts
Watching other people playing video games is a giant trend - of which Microsoft also wants to benefit.
The technology group buys the start-up Beam, which specializes in this hobby.
How much money flowed for the takeover, Microsoft did not share on Thursday.
Beam went to the launch with his offer only in January and already has more than 100,000 users.
You can watch others when playing, but you can also interfere with yourself.
For example, they can give up missions to players and confront enemies and provide equipment.
