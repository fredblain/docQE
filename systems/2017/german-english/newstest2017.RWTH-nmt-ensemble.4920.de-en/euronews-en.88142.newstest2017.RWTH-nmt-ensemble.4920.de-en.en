London schoolgirl who joined ISIS has been killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, died in Syria.
The lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said her family learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
It was believed she was killed by a Russian air raid in Raqqa, the group's bulwark in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and died, according to her family, shortly after she pretended to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
"One can only hope that the only good thing is - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war zone - discouraging people from ever making that decision," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London rose into a plane towards Turkey and then entered a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family have been told she has married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months.
