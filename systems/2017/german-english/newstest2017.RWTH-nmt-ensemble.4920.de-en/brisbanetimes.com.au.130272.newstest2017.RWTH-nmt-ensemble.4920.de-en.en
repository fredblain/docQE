Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that's worth it
It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.
That teenagers and child no longer go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time staring at screens, has been lamented by many in the last decade.
Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and making it more active.
The time on the screen was initially on the TV, then limited to video games and most recently on smartphones.
So it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.
I am referring, of course, to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters first created for the video games in the 1990 s (later created a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).
Like many phenomena of pop culture, the interest sank ahead of the release of the game in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that the servers overloaded.
Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, the players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokémons, which are traced with a GPS and, once they have been found, can be "photographed" (via a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "captured."
A generation that played the game when she was even younger, joined the whip and jumped for the search from the sofa.
In the US, the game led to a significant increase in steps that the "average" person puts back every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, told the Washington Post recently that within two days of the game's launch, the number of tracked people who train 30 minutes each day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance.
Many public health campaigns to get people to "take themselves 30 minutes" to "come from the sofa" and "be active every day" encountered deaf ears because many public messages to health are boring and come from people who look elusive.
Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overvalued.
Anyone who regularly drives sports reduces his chances of suffering from cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here.
But the miraculous thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.
Some people even close new friendships on the hunt.
As always, there are also mysterious gamblers who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could run against a door.
What is to be done?
A breakthrough has occurred.
Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier in the day, they gave us no reason to drive sport as it does this game.
The new will lose its charm and the use will decrease over time.
However, due to Pokemon's success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.
