Who is building Braunschweig's cheap homes?
The SPD and the Greens mean that investors should be given much more responsibility in the future.
How do you respond to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap homes in the next few years?
The SPD proposes a "concept of action" for the next Council meeting.
But contention is programmed.
First of all, the question is: who is supposed to build the cheap homes?
There is no provision so far.
SPD group chairman Christoph Bratmann says: "we are in agreement with the Greens: those who want to build on urban areas will have to expel 20% of all homes as social housing in the future."
However, the cheap apartments can also be found in the stock.
However, the big point of contention at the town hall is, according to Bratmann: "how do you deal with investors who want to build on private land?"
"We want investors to build at least 10 percent on such land, but as much as 20 percent of homes as social housing."
A new urban housing support programme, which will cost millions and still needs to be funded, is intended to provide incentives.
The problem, Mr Bratmann said, is "there is no agreement at the moment between the political groups."
The CDU wants to make as few rules as possible to investors.
The left wants even tougher conditions for investors.
Notwithstanding this, Mr Bratmann said, the situation in the housing market is tightening.
If the concept of action is implemented, this will provide additional tasks in the building administration.
More staff are needed.
It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.
But the programme is not yet complete: the roughly 1260 new homes, which should be built anyway.
How, though, is the loss of more than 1300 cheap homes, whose support will be phased out over the next few years?
By 2020 alone, it will be 500 homes.
To prevent that, according to Planning Policy spokeswoman Nicole Palm, expiring ties should now be purchased from the city.
In addition, consideration should be given to getting homes back into price fixing.
This is possible in the western city.
In one blow, the problem could be solved.
Because in the western city, deadlines run out at the end of the year.
About 1800 homes could be retrieved there into price fixing for cheap homes.
Only: that is what the owners, the housing companies, do not want.
If the number of social housing in the western city is dramatically increased, it will be removed from the objective of so-called meddling.
There should be no more concentration of social weaknesses in just a few parts of the city.
The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion.
Group chairman Holger Herlitschke says: "for a broad majority, the CDU must be on board."
This has focused on more building sites for single-family homes.
What does not mean, however, is that a compromise cannot be found.
