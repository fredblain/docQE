Airline is not liable: fall on air passenger bridge
An airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the Passenger Bridge.
Because liability is only possible in the case of dangers typical of air traffic, the Oberlandesgericht DÃ¼sseldorf (Az.: 18 U 124/14) argued.
The plaintiff had broken a knee stick during the fall.
However, the accident could have happened anywhere - it was a general risk of life, according to the court.
The airline had to pay no compensation to the man.
