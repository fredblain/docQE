Kepler misses rotation rate of stars in Plejades "star cluster
The latest mission with the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates under the stars of the Plejades star.
The new data helps astronomers to understand why stars in star clusters are rotating at different rates and in what context the rotation periods are with the planetary formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his age and even the history of his solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The star cluster of the Plejades is 445 light years away from Earth.
Many stars in this star cluster, which emerged around 125 million years ago, are now reaching adulthood.
They are now turning the fastest.
At peak rates, these maturing stars encounter large quantities of star winds.
As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.
When a star is ageing, its rotation rate begins to slow.
Kepler misses the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a discernible star fleck -- such as sunshine.
The latest catalogue of rotation rates points out that more massive stars are turning more slowly than fewer massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with larger stars turning slower pirouettes than smaller ones.
"In the" ballet "of the Plejades, we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said.
As the star cluster of the Plejades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic lab to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates.
"The star cluster of the Plejades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
There is still much ahead of us what we would like to know more about how the How, When and Why stars slow their rotation rates and hang up their "dance shoes."
Rebull and her colleagues have reported extensively in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Plejades, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
