Here comes the Enforcement Trailer
Germany's Raser has to adapt to the next generation of speed knives: in various federal states, including Hessen and Brandenburg, new flash devices are being tested that are supposed to be particularly effective in transmitting tempos.
The futuristic Enforcement Trailer of the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden, for example, can be used for accident areas where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, at highway construction sites or bridges with temporary templates, there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide a stationary lightning for compliance with the speed limit.
However, a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or elaborate.
The Enforcement Trailer is autark: its battery holds five days at uninterrupted measurement, the case data is encrypted via a modem.
With laser measuring technology, all vehicles can also be captured across multiple tracks simultaneously.
Variable speed limits as well as transit bans after time, driving strips and vehicle class can also be monitored.
In the high-powered state, you can move the trailer with every car with a trailer clutch, according to the manufacturer.
In order for him not to be simply cloned, he is lowered in the measuring operation, so the wheels in the armored and, incidentally, also shouted outside shell disappear.
In addition, a built-in alarm system is designed to protect the lightning from vandalism.
Since 2015, the trailer has been tested and used in various federal states, according to Vitronic.
Foreign authorities are also flashing with the new technique: recently, France has reordered 100 pieces, after an order of 150 pieces last year.
