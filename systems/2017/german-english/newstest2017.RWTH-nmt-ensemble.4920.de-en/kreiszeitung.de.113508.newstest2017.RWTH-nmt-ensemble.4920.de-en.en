Cats react more sensitively than hangovers to cries of young animals
Biologists have examined in Hannover what effect the call of cat babies has on adult animals.
To her surprise, the males also didn't leave the males cold - however, unlike the females, they always behaved the same way.
Female cats can detect the excitement of cat babies at the minds of the little ones.
They respond by ten percent more quickly to sounds of kittens, which are in great distress, as scientists have found out from the veterinarian high school and the Medical University of Hannover (MHH).
Hangovers are also responding to the calls of kittens - but always the same.
"Apparently, the acoustic differences between the middling of less and heavily excited young animals for the males are either unperceptible or not important," said the biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
She is a director of the study published this Friday in the journal "BMC Evolutionary Biology."
In a previous investigation, the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the kittens cries differ with the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine adult hangovers and eight kittens were observed from the animal husbandry of the MHH.
They were pre-played on the one hand by little ones who were taken from the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings.
On the other hand, they were confronted with cries of more excited kittens, which were additionally elevated.
The researchers consider their results to be meaningful despite the low sample.
"All females, even those who have not had their own offspring, reacted differently to the cries," said Konerding.
They turned more quickly to the loudspeaker when this call of the very more erroneous kittens played off.
This ability may be inherent or evolving with gender maturity.
"A surprise was that the males reacted at all," the biologist said.
In the past, scientists have already examined the reactions of women and men to baby noises on several occasions.
Also, some studies showed that women were more sensitive to infants, whether they were mothers or not, the biologist Marina Scheumann reported.
