Bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - multiple deaths
The Austrian embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, the State Department spokesman, Thomas Schnöll, said Friday morning.
She had suffered cut wounds and had been treated in hospital but has already been able to leave this one again.
Her home trip was scheduled for early September.
Whether from the further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket, as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon, also Austrian citizens are still unclear.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities in this regard, according to Schnöll.
In the roughly 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok, Hua Hin was first seen exploding two bombs on Thursday night in a nightmare.
According to police, a Thai change was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrians, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
Friday morning, two explosives went up again, and another man was killed, according to the authorities.
A bomb explosion was also reported by Phuket in the morning.
A taxi driver was injured in the detonation near the beach resort of Patong, which was popular with holidaymakers.
In Surat Thani on the country's south-east coast, another bomb then exploded that killed an urban employee.
The explosive rate has gone into the air, according to authorities in a flower beet in front of the coastal police force.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwest coast, as well as in Chumphon on the south-east coast, called for several injured.
One goes from a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it said.
"The bomb attacks carry the same handwriting," said Armeegeneral Danai Kritmethavee Friday morning before journalists.
"We assume that this is a coordinated attack."
It is too early to comment on possible motives, but it is probably the actions of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country in the attacks.
The Thai police, on the other hand, said that the attacks were not related to the Islamist insurgency or to international terrorism.
"This is only local sabotage, which is limited to limited areas and provinces," a spokesman in Bangkok said.
Rather, it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta.
In the past few days, the authorities have received intelligence indications of impending attacks in the south of the country - but they have not been informed about the exact date and the places.
It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.
Police dismissed their officials across the country to step up security around important government buildings, as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and amusement districts.
In Thailand, there are always smaller bombings, but they are mostly not directed against tourists.
In Hua Hin lies a palace used for years by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
After the bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends that the Thai security authorities should follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities.
High security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and surroundings.
After clashes between security forces and Muslim populations, it is not necessary to travel to these provinces.
Increased security risk (security level 2) for the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.
This gives the military a great deal of influence over the coming years.
Junta chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to stir chaos while the country moved towards stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.
The military unta, which had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, is holding itself up to have led the kingdom back to stability and order.
However, the military has not managed to get to grips with the uprising of Muslim rebels that has been simmering in the country's extreme south for years.
More than 6500 people have already been killed in the conflict.
Just over a year ago, 20 people were killed in Bangkok in an attack at a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.
It was the bloodiest attack of the country's younger history.
