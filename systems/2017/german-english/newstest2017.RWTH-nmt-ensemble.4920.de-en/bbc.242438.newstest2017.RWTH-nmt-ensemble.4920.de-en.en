On the set, there were artistic differences and a difference of opinion.
I regret the incident, "he said in a statement.
Details of how the character Gibsons is written out of the series, which follows a team of FBI agents, are expected to be published at a later date, according to the opinion of ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.

"I love Criminal Minds and have put my whole heartbreak down the last twelve years," Gibson said in a statement released on Friday.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but that will no longer be possible now.
I would just like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you can only wish for a series.
The planned broadcasting of the twelfth season is scheduled for 28 September.
