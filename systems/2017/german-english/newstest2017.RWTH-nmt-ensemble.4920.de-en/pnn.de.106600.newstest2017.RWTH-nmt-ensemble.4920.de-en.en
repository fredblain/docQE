Greenland hai: the oldest vertebrae is nearly 400 years old
Rare sight.
Greenland sharks mostly come to the surface only in winter.
This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation aboard the Sanna research vessel.
He was born in 1624 and swims with well a 1 km/h through the North Atlantic - to this day.
Greenland sharks only get offspring at 150 years old.
The Greenland halfway through the North Atlantic Ocean, in a hour's time, is an average of just 1,220 metres.
Only when it arrives, the five -metre long animal accelerates to sat 2.6 km/h - and is half as fast as a seal with this maximum speed.
This slow lifestyle, however, seems to be a patent recipe for a high age.
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "science" at any rate from a Greenland hai that could be 392 years old.
"Madness," commented Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this lifespan, which means a world record for vertebrae.
Although the evolutionary biologist has long suspected that Greenland sharks are being stoned.
Just lacked the evidence.
Greenland sharks are hard to watch, after all, they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in winter.
Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks.
Their tempo of time, when they took out six animals with a broadcaster in front of Spitsbergen.
Prey still make this sharks: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear.
They may be hunting sleeping animals or patrolling at the bottom of the ice sea and looking for cadavers that torch down from higher water layers.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now investigated 28 Greenland sharks, which picked up fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Spitsbergen as a by-catch from the depth of the North Atlantic.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long, while the largest 502 centimetres measured.
To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens of the sharks with the carbon 14 method.
This centre of the eye lens is created even before the birth of the sharks, and the proteins contained therein will no longer be renewed.
The two smallest sharks had striking a lot of carbon 14 in the lens.
Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960 "s, when nuclear weapons experimented with larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
On the other hand, in the 220 -centimetre length of the third smallest animal, the lens contained a small surplus of carbon 14 from the nuclear weapons tests, so it was likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in its 2012 investigation.
All larger Greenland sharks, however, had normal carbon 14 quantities in their lens, resulting in cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
Indeed, the carbon 14 -clock for a 493 centimetre long Greenland hai showed an age of 335, while the record shark with 502 centimetres is expected to be even 392 years old.
That Greenland hai females only get offspring when they are longer than four metres was known.
Now the researchers of the length have been able to assign an age.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres was probably on the threshold of sexual maturity and his age was 156 years old, Greenland sharks, with the proliferation, can obviously be used for at least one and a half centuries.
This, too, is likely to be world record for vertebrae.
The fact that such methane alems live mainly in icy waters is not a coincidence.
Even the previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale in whose bacon at the neck was stuck a 120-year-old harbor tip, was caught in front of Alaska.
Due to low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on savings flame.
So they mature later - and ageing slower.
In addition, in order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are often particularly large.
Because the volume is growing much faster than its surface, by which the animal loses heat.
The heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much larger than a gram elephant.
Another advantage: they have fewer enemies.
"A smaller animal thus lives more dangerously and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as early as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.
A very large animal, on the other hand, should invest its resources in a long life.
