Assistant doctors want to organise further strikes after they rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the British Medical Association's officials, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistant doctors who voted in an election rejected him.
In July, Hunt had unveiled plans to forcibly introduce the contract, saying that the NHS would be in a "no-man's land" and that any further delay would be harmful to staff and patients.
The first assistant doctors are to receive a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend work to improve care at inhospitable times.
Dr Ellen McCourt, the chairman of the BMA Committees for Assistant Doctors, announced last night in a communication: "assistant doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and admit it will treat all doctors fairly."
At just eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress has to be made and time is running out.
Efforts by the BMA to resolve the disputes by conversations joined the government on reluctance to participate, and sometimes on deafening silence.
That happened to a promise made by Jeremy Hunt just last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, lift the stir and address the concerns of assistant doctors."
Should he not do so, the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further work measures.
The last strike at the end of April saw a postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and specialist doctors were involved to grant cover to doctors on the strike pocket chain.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting the reformed contract with the British Medical Association's officials.
The BMA wants a better weekly pay for the 54,000 assistant doctors who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, director general of the NHS staff, urged assistant doctors to end the strike.
Mortimer said: "work measures do not achieve anything of the very little, but already overburdened teams and service providers, and only cause concern, distress and disruption to patients, carers and their families."
Over the past two months, we have spoken to the Committees of Assistant doctors and have responded positively to concerns about the guardianship and whistleblowing with the Department of Health as well as other ministries.
Employers hoped that continued positive engagement on other important issues - such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a professional outbreak, training kits, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was for employers, the Health Education England and the Department of Health to comply with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.
