One for all cases
Honda HR-V is flexible and everyday
In the small HR-V, Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan.
Sounds quite overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, is actually proving to be extremely flexible in everyday life.
Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V is rather small, passengers have plenty of space both in the first row and in the fond, it doesn't work tight at any point.
The materials of the interior are well processed and pleasant, only the cockpit upper side comes down.
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles.
There is not only a boot of 453 l at the top and 1026 l at refolded back, but there are the "magic Seats."
This is less magical than it sounds: the seating areas of the backbench can be folded up like cinema chairs and thus offer closet space, which is 1.24 m high from the ground up to the ceilings.
The boot can be loaded well, but the loading height with 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1.6 -l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed areas.
However, he is likely to do his job a little more quietly.
The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing.
There is another motorisation: a 1.5 l gasoline with 96 kW / 130 hp.
An all-wheel drive is not offered.
Driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamism and comfort.
The steering, however, is likely to be a little more direct.
The equipment in the tested top variant "Executive" leaves nothing to be desired.
The security systems include the City-emergency brake assistant (works up to Tempo 32), the collision warning system and the track record assistant.
The collision warner sometimes irritates because he rated many obstacles as "approaching objects."
The remote light assistant works very reliably.
And the intelligent Temporegler responds to the traffic mark recognition and drops the speed if needed.
The full connectivity, however, exists only for the top equipment: 7 -inch touchscreen, Navi, app integration and more.
Two USB- and HDMI bookings are under the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome to reach.
The around €29,000 for the well-equipped top diesel are in order.
Those who do not want to invest so much will receive the gasoline from €20,000, the diesel from €23,000.
The engines meet the Euro 6 exhaust standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
