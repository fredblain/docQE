Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available to customers outside Scotland
According to the chief Executive officer of Bank only, the RBS brand is to be reduced to a back office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McEwan shared with BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was connected with the bank's global ambitions.
The bank has since distanced itself, when it almost collapsed and had to be saved eight years ago.
During this time, brand strategists have used "RBS" to protect other end users ' financial brands.
She supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to put more national brands in the spotlight.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales all RSB references, the decentralised headquarters and the stock exchange listing will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller brands for the retail business that will be more important-Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's military bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in Inverness-shire.
He said to BBC Scotland: "The RSB brand will become our investor brand and the brand under which our employees will be employed, as we are now becoming a bank of brands."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I am saying now that we are not pursuing global objectives, but local objectives.
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers under these brands.
RBS has already testified that it will not continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the visibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship.
"It is time for us to develop into the bank of the brands, because how do we focus on the inside (we asked) to make this a better bank for customers?" said the chief Executive officer.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and that we would have launched these brands.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think one will see many changes.
We can re-launch these brands, so I think the time has come.
