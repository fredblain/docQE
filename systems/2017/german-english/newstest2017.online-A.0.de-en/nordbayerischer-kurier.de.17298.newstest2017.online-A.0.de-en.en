The fee per cubic metre of wastewater is from 1 October 2016 for the area of the wastewater plant Neudorf/reuth/Welschenkahl 3.44 instead of 2.10 euros; For Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp 3.36 euro (previously 2.26 euro) and for Azendorf 3.64 euro (previously 2.18 euro).
At the plant in Azendorf, the wastewater charge will increase once again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary.
After an approximate calculation, the wastewater price in Azendorf will be at 4.37 euros per cubic metre.
As Mayor Bernd Steins (CSU) reported, when approving the budget by the District Council of Kulmbach, it was found that these sewage plants were under cover.
The market Kasendorf is obligated to operate the plants in a cost-comprehensive and legal basis.
From 1 October 2016 the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial enterprises from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to dig deeper into the purse.
The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.
As managing director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the panel, a recalculation of the fees for the sewage systems of the market community was necessary.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over-or under-coverings from the previous calculation period were also to be offset.
The serious increase in fees was justified by Schmidt's fact that all three sewage plants were relatively small facilities with a very small wastewater attack, which was between 6800 and 12000 cubic metres per year.
For example, due to the low distribution base, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.
In addition, the volume of wastewater in all three plants is slightly declining.
In addition, the previous calculation period for all three plants was not least due to their old-age renovation and repair expenses to a considerable extent.
The plant in Azendorf was nearly 30 years old, the plants for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years.
Schmidt pointed out that in the sewage system Azendorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage.
In the pumping Welschenkahl the nearly 20 years old conveyor systems had to be overhauled from the ground up and at the pond sewage treatment plant Lopp had to be excavated after nearly 20 years of operation of the first Kl√§rteich, the sewage sludge is disposed of and an additional ventilation facility can be installed in order to be able to comply with the water regulations.
Schmidt: "These extraordinary expenses were attributable to the amortisation and maintenance costs, which have to be taken into account in the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs, which were still significantly below the current level during the previous calculation in the years 2011/2012.
Stone houses made it clear that in the small wastewater seizure in the three plants the expenses for the operation and maintenance are "fully penetrated".
In the process, Schmidt added that the market community had been spared from large-scale entertainment costs in wastewater treatment facilities over the past 20 years.
According to stone houses, the situation for the aforementioned plants will remain precarious in the long term, especially since it is not possible to extend the supply area of the sewage Zweckverbandes Frisian Brook around these plants because they are deficit facilities.
