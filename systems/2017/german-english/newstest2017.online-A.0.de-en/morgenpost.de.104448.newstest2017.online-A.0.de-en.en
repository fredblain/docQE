GfK leadership takes off after disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK exchanges its chief Matthias Hartmann.
The resignations came suddenly-but not surprisingly.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK suggests that the chair of CEO Matthias Hartmann becomes all the more unsure, the longer the successes he promises.
Turbulence at the forefront of the Nuremberg market research company GfK: After disappointing business figures and the resignation of corporate management, the world's number five in the industry is facing a new beginning.
GfK Executive Board chairman wants to leave the company at the end of the year.
The chairman of the GfK Supervisory board, Arno Mahlert, has already resigned from the supervisory board with effect from 12 September.
As early as September 1, the Management board member Gerhard Hausruckinger, the company, has already taken over the leadership.
He should officially assume the function of a "board spokesman" until a successor to Hartmann is found.
As a reason for the resignations, the company called "different views" on the long-term business policy orientation.
Details did not want to call a company spokesman on Friday.
Those who will lead the market research company in the future are still unclear at the moment.
In the case of investors, it was said on Friday that the shareholders had recently been disappointed with the continuing success of the restructuring initiated years ago.
Mr. Hartmann has been at the top of GfK since 2011.
"The fruits of the restructuring are still not visible after 5 years," it said.
Given the recent poor GfK business figures, each shareholder will eventually become restless.
"If that were the case with BMW, that would also make the Quandts so," it said.
After setbacks in the previous quarters, the company had not been able to stop its loss-taking in the second quarter of 2016.
At 361.2 million euros, sales were 6.1 percent below the level of the same quarter of the previous year.
In relation to the first half of the year, sales shrank by 3.4 percent, with 721.2 million euros.
Profit in the second quarter was mainly due to the lower value of the company in view of its difficult economic situation.
The goodwill amortization of 139 million euros, which was necessary in the Consumer experience business unit, gave the group a loss of 148.2 million euros.
In the second quarter of 2015, GfK still generated a net profit of 19.7 million.
