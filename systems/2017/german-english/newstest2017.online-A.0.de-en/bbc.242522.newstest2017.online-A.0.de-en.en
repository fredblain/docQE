Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men have "luck still to be alive"
Three men have "luck still to be alive" after they were thrown from their fishing boat before Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station struck on Friday at 13:20 BST Alarm after a crew watched the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had trouble swimming in safety, while their boat moved on their own.
"We saw how the boat was spinning in its vicinity and presented us with the worst," said the head of Moelfre's rescue station, Vince Jones.
"Fortunately, the strong winds have already blown the boat out of their reach, until we left to water," he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man aged 60 was exhausted and found hanging on a buoy without a life vest.
They all came aboard the coastal rettungsboots and were brought back to the rescue station
Mr. Jones said, "The three men who have been thrown into the water are in luck uninjured and still alive.
The boat had a emergency leash, but it was dissolved by the person who controlled the boat during the kenting of the boat.
Someone woke up today about these men.
