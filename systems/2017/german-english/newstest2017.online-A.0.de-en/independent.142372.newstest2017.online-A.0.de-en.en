Britain clinches silver in 7-er rugby after Fiji Masterclass Gold Holt
The impressive performance of Britain's 7-er rugby came in the final on Thursday night to an abrupt halt at the last hurdle in the form of the Fijis, when they were beaten with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji awarded a master class in handling, side stepping, back, line and raw power to win gold-their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was sweetened by the not too bad consolation price of the silver medal-Britain's fourth on that day-and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semifinals on the same day could fall back on them in the final.
But regardless of this, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in its best form.
It might be a consolation for GB--but it probably won't--that at least one Brit tomorrow will have a gold medal hanging around his neck: Fiji's head coach Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult path behind it.
Eight years ago, she lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens under Ryan.
Here they lost only one.
This setback will hurt, but the progress is amazing.
Fiji started out wonderfully and made the attacks GBS bounce out of fun.
It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. as if they were running in buses. The World Series winners went 5-0 up as Osea Kolinisau in the corner of RÃ¼berhechtete.
With another four minutes of playtime, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner he converted.
12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.
A an tackle by Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa to score a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute lete Jasa Veremalua in the right corner a touchdown and it stood 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the kick-off and there were still over a minute playing time... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou dashed by further weak tackles of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a goal.
The conversion brought a 29-0 until the break.
It's like Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB still learns.
That's the way it is.
GB introduced fundamental changes at halftime and closed the Fijianische Gap... for a whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half until Joshua Tuisova went through a brilliant intermediate play of Fiji.
Dan Norton started a trial for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game was long in favor of the South Pacific Islander, whose fans sang, waving flags and danced in the grandstand.
It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fiji.
Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds.
The whistle sounded, the Fijis hugged each other and GB kicked devastatingly beaten in the lawn.
Earlier that day, Fiji had defeated Japan in the semifinals with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a tight semi-final match from the race-Britain's transformation of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the Boks to the front in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive work and scored a goal among the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late tackling of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-aside team, secured the win and thus the silver medal.
