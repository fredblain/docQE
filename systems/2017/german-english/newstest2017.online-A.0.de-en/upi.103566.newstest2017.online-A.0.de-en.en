NASA climate model: Venus was once livable
According to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably once livable.
Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere, could once have shown Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggest that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and still slowly turned on.
The model also illuminated the topography of early Venus.
The planet probably had more arid areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protect it from rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.
"In the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exposed their day-side of the sun for almost two months," explained Giss scientist Anthony del Genio in a press release.
This heats up the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the sun's warmth.
The result are average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those of the Earth today.
The model produced a history of Venus similar to the evolution that was previously suspected by planetary scientists.
Although it was once presumably habitable, Venus--over several billion years--was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned away by the ultraviolet light.
When their hydrogen escaped, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect was left behind--the Venus that we know today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.
