Olympia: Brazen fraud in doping test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary commission on the case.
Kenya's light athlete threatens to adversity after the second doping affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
After a fraud attempt at a doping control in the Olympic Village, Kenya sent a coach home.
The International Olympic Committee informed that a disciplinary commission should be set up immediately to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official had informed that the former sprinter and today's coach, John Anzrah, had given a urine sample in the Olympic Village under the name of the 800-metre runner Ferguson Rotich.
This was reported to the team leader of Kenya by the doping inspectors.
The IAAF has asked the IOC for information about the case in order to exert its own investigations, a IAAF spokesman shared.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent actions of the IOC, the IAAF will make an assessment," it said in an IAAF statement.
"He (Anzrah) has gone to the doping control station and has issued himself as Ferguson Rotich, given the sample and signed it," declared Kenya's Chief de mission Stephan Arap Soi.
He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete who was on the list for the training controls of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
Ferguson Rotich had become in Beijing World Cup fourth over 800 meters in 2015.
Four days earlier, the Kenyan athletics delegation chief Michael Rotich had been deducted from the Rio Games.
He is said to have informed the athletes of his country about the upcoming doping tests.
According to media reports, he was to be detained on his return to Nairobi airport.
Kenya has been under special observation by the IOC for a long time after numerous doping offences.
In announcing the IOC's more than 2000 doping target controls before the Rio Games, it was unusually pointed out that athletes from Kenya and Russia are particularly targeted.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had exerted a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer Games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympic start.
As a result, WADA Kenya took the list of countries whose anti-doping measures are in conformity with WADA's rules.
Kenya is considered a great runner nation.
The country's light athletes won most of the medals at the World Cup 2015 in Beijing.
In a series of ARD television reports, accusations have repeatedly been made that doping drugs are readily available in Kenya and that there should be a significant mentality of sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound last requested a similar investigation in Kenya, as he had hired her in Russian athletics.
It was possible to demonstrate that in this sport the area was doped and systematic.
Russia's light athletes were then excluded from the summer Games.
