Intercultural travel: Cultural offers for schools
The international class of the Forest school visited the play "The Invisible House".
The association Nima's and the young theatre are now planning a music project.
Nima's Association enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Class international" of the Forest school children's House has visited an idea of the award-winning piece "The Invisible House" of the Young theatre Münster.
In the context of the "Intercultural Journey" initiated by the Verein Nima, 19 students between eleven and fifteen attended the staging in the small house.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which has set itself the goal of cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee backgrounds, offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster within the framework of this project.
Most of the class's youngsters came to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016, among others from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria, and spoke little German.
Thanks to the choreography, the scenic pictures and video animations, you have been able to follow the course of action, according to the press release of the Young Theatre Münster.
The association Nima's, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel, and the Young Theatre will work together in the upcoming season as part of a musical theatre project.
From October to December, young people with and without an escape and migration background between 14 and 20 years will be given the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing, dancing, acting and music.
Offers for children and families in the area of theatre play and theatrical language teaching are in the planning stage.
The project "Intercultural Travel" continues.
In view of the increased number of refugees, the association expects many classes that want to participate.
