Pokémon go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
It's fascinating to watch the world change.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go out to play, rather prefer to spend their free time on screens, was lamented by many in the last decade.
Pokemon Go is about getting people off the sofa and making them more active.
The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then to video games and most recently to smartphones.
It is therefore great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.
I refer, of course, to the Pokémon go craze, an app based on the characters that were first created for the video games in the 1990s (later a series of cartoons, playing cards and other spin-offs).
Like many phenomena of pop culture, the interest before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand declined somewhat in early July.
The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that overwhelmed the servers.
Within a few days, Pokémon had go more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, the players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokémon that are tracked with a GPS and, once they are found, can be "photographed" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "captured".
A generation who played the game when she was younger, joined the craze and jumped for the search from the sofa.
In the United States, the game led to a significant increase in steps that the "average" person returns every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch tracking 35,000 users, recently shared the Washington Post that within two days of the game's launch, the number of tracked people exercising every day 30 minutes jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon go-it only sees the raw data to improve performance.
Many public awareness campaigns on health that make people want to "take 30 minutes to come" from the sofa and "to be active every day" came across deaf ears because many public messages are boring to health and come from people who look miserable.
However, the importance of sport cannot be overrated.
Anyone who regularly drives sports reduces his chances of getting cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead you here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon go is that it makes people do something outdoors that they enjoy.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered-movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.
Some people even make new friends on the hunt.
As always, there are also grumpy spoilers who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could run against a door.
What's the matter?
A breakthrough has occurred.
Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to do sports as this game does.
The new will lose its allure and the use will diminish over time.
Due to Pokemon's success, however, there will be more games that will connect apps and virtual reality with the active in the real world and will help many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.
