Clinton's and Trump's economic policy in comparison: it's all about the money
Invest in infrastructure and prevent the trade agreement TTP-that is what both Clinton and Trump want.
However, the two US presidential candidates disagree on tax and energy policy and on a fundamental issue.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.
The, about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns against how the state can harm the economy-with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.
He himself, by contrast, would be quite different, Trump says.
He will drive back regulations massively, and he makes up for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates-for private individuals and for businesses.
Clinton, on the other hand, says: The state has to perform certain tasks, it has to open up disadvantaged opportunities and needs money.
Therefore, the taxes would be increased for the wealthy, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.
In which must be invested, Trump and Clinton say almost the same word.
The Democratic candidate is announcing the biggest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.
State investment programs in the infrastructure are classical democratic politics and are strictly rejected by the Republican state-critical Teaparty wing.
In other words, Trump could still have party-internal discussions.
The differences in energy and climate policy are clearer.
Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and boost coal production in the United States.
Oil production is also to be possible in protected areas, the Paris climate Protection agreement intends to cancel.
Clinton, on the other hand, wants to use its investment programme to explicitly expand renewable energies and demand: "A country will become the superpower of clean energies and create millions of jobs."
"It will probably be either China, Germany or America-I want it to be us."
But not only in terms of infrastructure, but also in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart from each other.
TPP, the Trans-Pacific trade agreement, do not want to sign either.
At the same time, however, both do not want to isolate the US from international trade-but simply to better protect American jobs.
They're supposed to pay better, too, calls for Clinton.
The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger reward.
He wants to raise them to 15 dollars an hour.
What Trump wants to do in this question is not entirely clear: once he says: The minimum wage must go up, then he says he should not be changed.
But the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be more about the tax policy of the two camps.
On the one hand is Trump, which wants to relieve the economy and the citizens in order to boost growth.
His critics believe that the budget deficit would only be greater.
On the other hand, Clinton is at least asking the rich to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.
