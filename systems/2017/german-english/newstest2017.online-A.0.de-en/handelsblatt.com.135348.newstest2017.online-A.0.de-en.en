Here comes the enforcement trailer
Germany's speeders have to adapt to the next generation of speedometers: in various federal states, among others in Hesse and Brandenburg, new flash units are being tested, which are intended to make the speed sinners particularly effective.
The futuristic enforcement trailers of the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example in accident areas where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, on motorway construction sites or on refurbished bridges with a temporary speed limit, there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide a stationary flasher for adherence to the speed limit.
However, permanent mobile construction can be dangerous or costly.
The enforcement trailer is self-sufficient: its battery lasts five days with continuous measuring operation, the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem.
With laser measurement technology, all vehicles can also be recorded across several tracks simultaneously.
Variable speed limits as well as transit bans by time, lane and vehicle class can also be monitored.
In the raised state you can move the trailer according to manufacturer with any car with trailer hitch.
So that it is not simply stolen, it is lowered in the measuring mode, so that the wheels disappear in the armored and by the way also bulletproof outer shell.
In addition, a built-in alarm system should protect the flasher from vandalism.
Since 2015, the trailer has been tested by vitronic in various federal states and has now also been used.
Also foreign authorities flash with the new technology: Recently, France has ordered 100 pieces after an order of 150 pieces last year.
