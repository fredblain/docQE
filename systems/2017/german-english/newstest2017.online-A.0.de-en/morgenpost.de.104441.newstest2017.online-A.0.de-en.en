Swiss Post enters the trade with electric transporters
An electric delivery vehicle of Deutsche Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the vehicle is obviously great.
The post plans to sell your electric vehicle StreetScooter also.
The group intends to start trading with the transporter shortly.
Swiss Post wants to offer its electric transporters on the free market as of next year.
"We want to go on sale to third parties," said a post-speaker on Friday.
The company has been examining for months whether to sell its self-developed StreetScooter, with which letters and parcels are delivered, to other companies as well.
Post-board member JÃ¼rgen Gerdes had said that there are always questions, such as craftsmen.
According to information from the news magazine "The Spiegel", the Bonn group intends to enter into mass production of the vehicles shortly.
In post-production, the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift.
Gerdes had announced that the group wanted to significantly enlarge its fleet of electric cars and aim a complete changeover to the environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term.
"We are going to make a very, very robust step towards 2020," he said at the end of July.
I can imagine that we are readjusting the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on Germany's roads since 2014.
