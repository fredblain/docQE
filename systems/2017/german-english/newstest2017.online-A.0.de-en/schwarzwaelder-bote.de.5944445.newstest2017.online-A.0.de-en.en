Haigerloch: Pilgrims to the Gate of Mercy
The altar from the pastoral unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Four stages have been managed together.
In order to bridge the time to the next ' of all altar in probably two years, the Oberministrantenrunde St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a pilgrimage lasting several days.
Various pilgrimage destinations were examined and finally, it was decided for the Bishop's City of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy with the Open Gate of Mercy at the Freiburg Minster, a special pilgrimage destination was offered.
16 Minis from Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and holy rooms made their way.
The evening before, Pastor Storost sent the pilgrims out in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the Pilgrims ' crosses and granted the pilgrim blessing.
From Horb it was driven by train to the starting point of Villingen, where there is also a cathedral of Our Lady and so the pilgrimage from Münster was started.
The individual day trips were framed in the morning and evening by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and written texts.
But also on the way, the Minis on field crosses, chapels or churches repeatedly made a rest to sing together a song from a specially assembled pilgrim Liedheft.
The church of the local parishes were available for the overnight stays.
At the stage goals, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller made for a tasty as well as invigorating dinner and breakfast.
It continued on the second day via Furtwangen to Gütenbach.
The next day, the stage to St. Peter, which was the most route, had to be climbed at first around 500 meters of altitude and then re-ascended after a sultry heat.
The deserved reward was a communal barbecue at the Badweiher.
After the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the imposing convent church of St. Peter, the final stage went to Freiburg.
Visibly relieved and happily, the Minis met at the Freiburg Minster later in the afternoon and passed through the Gate of Mercy.
With a little impulse, God was thanked here.
At the evening fair in Münster, the Minis of Kooperator Markus Obert arrived at the Pilgrim's destination.
After the service the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.
The next day was still time for the Breisgaumetropole.
In the afternoon we went back to Horb by train.
At the end, all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked.
