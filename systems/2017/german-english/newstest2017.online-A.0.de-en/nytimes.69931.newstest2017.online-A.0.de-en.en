The depressing food of the economic crisis in "an abundant meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his ascent to the president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.
As a foodie, President Roosevelt had a penchant for refined delicacies of Fifth Avenue such as pâte de foie gras and Maryland water Schildkrötensuppe.
His menu on that day was somewhat humbler: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and as a dessert a plum pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."
The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coes last book "Chop Suey" was about Chinese cuisine in the USA, while Ziegelman in her book "97 Orchard" tells about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective.
Her latest collaboration, "A decent meal" that will appear on Tuesday at Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at the Eisenberg's Sandwich shop for dinner, a small, straightforward snack in the Flatiron district, which has been in business since the 1929 stock market crash.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive scraps, while Coe, 57, ate turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered Meatloaf, this was due to the couple for a discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression.
"Rich foods were very popular," said Ziegelman.
There was peanut bread, loaf and bean bread.
They were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve you as dinner.
Coe grinned.
"It must have been placed in the stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Women's teams cooked for male field workers and it was served freshly baked pate for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
They were the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War. "A square Meal" records the ways in which the country was no longer the land of paradise.
"It was a time when food for the Americans became a central, tense topic," Begündete Coe, why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally tense was the new budget diet: Mysterious foods such as breads and casseroles became staple foods, the casserole as "wonderful way to eat leftovers recycle," noted Ziegelman, as cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which was the focus of American cuisine for years, became a rare luxury.
Peculiar mixes were tried, as a calorie and nourishing gratification had precedence over taste or even healthy kitchen mind.
During her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from that epoch, baked onions with peanut butter.
"It was not a popular addition to the Mittagstsich," says Coe.
Brick man goes on: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter and baked onions do not match.
It was typical for many of the housekeeping recipes.
Like never before or ever since, household economists-including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943-drove the eating habits of the country in such a way.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "household politicians" and to meet the challenge of turning mush like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
"A square meal" is a feast of historical tidbits.
Particularly palatable are the reports of the Government's response to the starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's Lass-me-cake-eating posture.
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen, he dined like the million-dollar man of the world to which he has become.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," said Coe.
He ate in an almost gilded dining room and wore a tuxedo.
He was gloriously alien to reality.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake, unless his wife Eleanor asked him to make an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, hiring a housekeeper with no interest in flavours by Mrs. Roosevelt led the White House to produce the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most bleakly prepared. "
Many of the species from the era of Great Depression, dealing with food, were discarded as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy is based on our continued focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as on how science was applied to food.
The couple gave a better understanding of Ziegelmans's eating habits when writing the book-for example, how they could not throw food away.
"She had a real fear of wasting food," said Coe.
Ziegelman remembered: "She actually made people sick."
There was the wind bag incident.
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, they and Coe drew out a dessert they had prepared at home: The plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It is called Prune whip," said Ziegelman, adding that it was a common trick to miss modest recipes a chic name.
There was no whipped cream, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Each one reluctantly dipped a spoon in the tough, brown goo.
Surprisingly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe picked up three times a repercussion.
Like a can-do Budgetierer, he said to his wife, "a couple of chopped walnuts would help."
