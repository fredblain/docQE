Greenland: The oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old
Rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually only come to the surface in winter.
This shark was allowed to return to sea after an investigation aboard the research vessel Sanna.
He was born 1624 and swims with a good 1 km/h through the North Atlantic until today.
Greenland sharks only get offspring with 150 years.
The Greenland swims slowly along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it is on average just 1,220 meters wide.
Only when it counts, the five-metre-long animal accelerates to a whopping 2.6 km/h-and is half as fast as a seal at this maximum speed.
This lifestyle, which is characterized by slowness, seems to be a panacea for a high age.
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" in any case from a Greenland that could be 392 years old.
"Madness", commented Alexander Scheuer from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock This life span, which means a world record for vertebrate animals.
The evolutionary biologist has long suspected that Greenland sharks are old.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland sharks are difficult to observe, after all they live mainly in the Arctic Ocean in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in winter on the surface.
Researchers know little about the lifestyle of the Greenland sharks.
They measured their slow-motion tempo as they were equipping six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitsbergen.
Prey still make these sharks: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, and another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.
They may be chasing sleeping animals or patrolling at the bottom of the Arctic Ocean, looking for carcasses staggering from higher levels of water.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues were now examining 28 Greenland sharks, which caught fishermen from Greenland or Spitsbergen from the depths of the North Atlantic between 2010 and 2013.
The smallest shark was just 81 inches long, while the largest 502 centimeters in size.
To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens core of the Sharks with the carbon 14 method.
This center of the eye lens arises even before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein are later no longer renewed.
The two smallest sharks had a remarkable amount of carbon-14 in the lens core.
Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons attempts hurled larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
In the 220 cm length third smallest animal, the lens core, however, contained a small surplus of carbon 14 from the nuclear weapons trying, so it should have celebrated its 50th anniversary in its investigation in 2012.
In contrast, all the larger Greenland sharks had normal carbon-14 amounts in their lens core, which is caused by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon 14 clock for a 493 centimeters long Greenland showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimeters might even be 392 years old.
The fact that Greenland females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters was known.
Now the researchers could assign the length to an age.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres was probably on the threshold of sexual maturity and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland sharks with the multiplication obviously can be at least one and a half centuries.
This is also likely to be the world record for vertebrate animals.
The fact that such Methusaleme mainly live in icy waters is no coincidence.
The previous record holder, a 211 year old whale, in whose bacon on the nape of a 120 year old harpoon tip, was also trapped in front of Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on a saving flame.
So they ripen later and age slower.
In order to keep themselves warm in the cold water, the animals are also often particularly large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal heat losing.
The heat loss of a Gram mouse is therefore much larger than a gram of elephant.
Another advantage: they have fewer enemies.
"A smaller animal lives more dangerously and should concentrate on having as many offspring as possible in the early days," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuer.
A very large animal should instead invest its resources in a long life.
