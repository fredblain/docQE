Cats respond more sensitively than hangovers on cries of young
Biologists in Hanover have investigated the effect of calling cat babies on adult animals.
To her surprise, the meowing also caused the males not to be cold-however, in contrast to the females they always behaved the same.
Female cats can recognize the level of arousal of cat babies at the meowing of the little ones.
They react by ten percent faster to the lute of kittens, who feel in great distress, as scientists have found out from the veterinary college and the medical School Hannover (MHH).
Tomcats also react to the calls of kittens-but always the same.
"Apparently the acoustic differences between the meowing of less and strongly excited young animals for the males are either not perceptible or not significant," said the biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
She is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the "BMC Evolutionary Biology" magazine.
In a previous investigation, the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the kitten cries differed with the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine adult hangovers and eight females from the animal husbandry of the mhh were observed.
They were played on a call of little ones, who were taken out of the litterbox for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings.
On the other, they were confronted with cries of more excited kittens who were additionally lifted.
The researchers consider their results to be meaningful despite the small sample.
"All the females, even those who have not had their own offspring, reacted in a differentiated manner to the cries," said Konerding.
They turned faster to the loudspeaker when this call of the more excited kittens played.
This ability may be inbred or develop with sexual maturity.
"One surprise was that the males reacted at all," said the biologist.
In the past, scientists have been investigating the reactions of women and men to baby sounds several times in humans.
Some studies also showed that women reacted more sensitively to infants, whether they were mothers or not, reported the biologist Marina Sage.
