Rio 2016: Robel Kiros have become internethit
The Olympians or world records do not always determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.
This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro.
In the aquatic center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that he was temporarily no longer seen in the TV pictures.
He just disappeared-no matter how far the neckline was selected.
In the social networks, they then became viral Internethit.
In fact, the 24-year-old ended its lead with a backlog of 48 seconds and occupied the 59. Place of 59 starters.
But it was rather its not just a sporty figure, which attracted the attention of the international media.
Why does the 24-year-old still participate in the Olympic Games?
The Ethiopian was given a start to the International Swimming Federation.
This is being distributed to make swimming in the underrepresented countries more famous.
Since in Ethiopia most athletes run, they just wanted to do something different.
Preparation is everything: Robel Kiros got ready for the big race.
The first nicknames quickly made the rounds.
Some media referred to him as "Robel of the Whale".
Following a "Prosperity belly", the English tabloid "The Sun" made fun of him with "dad bod".
His time, he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter freestyle, played no role.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.
At the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Eric Moussambani's run provided media attention.
The appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea was unforgettable when he had to compete on his own in a prerun of 100 metres of freestyle.
frenetically, Moussambani was cheered at that time.
The then 22-year-old learned to swim only eight months before the Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.
