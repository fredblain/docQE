Donald Trump concedes "daunting problems" in election campaign
The leadership of the US Republicans is plagued by massive worries, even in traditionally conservative states, to lose their majority.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump now admitted weaknesses in his electoral campaign in the former Republican stronghold of Utah.
A rare moment in which the usually cocky and self-confident multimillionaire expressed something like concerns, as correspondents reported.
After throwing 16 rivals from the race in their own Republican camp, the doubts about his success in the battle for the White House are now growing.
"We have huge problems in Utah," Trump told evangelical Christians that he asked for support in important states such as Ohio, Florida, or Virginia.
Guilt was false reports of his candidacy, he resumed his well-known media scolding.

Utah is usually a safe bank for the Republicans.
According to a survey by SurveyUSA from June, Trump and his competitor were the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, at par.
Other institutes see Trump in the front, but not at the distance that is common to Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also at risk.
In an interview by CNBC, Trump answered the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton's advance: "Just as I have done so far."
And pushed afterwards: this will "either be successful, or I will make a very very nice, long holiday".
He's not doing anything other than telling the truth.
If it is not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that is fine, Trump said.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to the press reports, the party Trump has threatened to withdraw funds to support its campaign, it should not be able to present better survey values.
Instead, the Republicans ' candidates for Congress would be more under their arms.
