Escape: "Every woman who has fled has experience of sexual violence"
Sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone, almost to everyday life.
When you arrive in Germany, you are often traumatized.
A house offers refuge.
In a large kitchen sit four women.
Each one has a baby that is at most one year old.
One has put her little son in the arm.
He looks curiously into the room with big eyes.
His mother stares at the table top.
Until she notices she's being watched.
She smiles briefly and kisses the little girl.
The scene looks normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is an area managing director of Condrobs, a supporter of social services in Bavaria, and deals with the issue of women on the run.
The four women in the kitchen have fled.
They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralized shelters for single-fled women and their children in Bavaria.
In January, Condrobs set up the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's assistance.
Recently it was officially opened.
Sixty people live there-about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men-even as visitors.
The exception is a security guard outside the door.
"It is not exaggerated to say that every woman who arrives here has made experiences of sexual violence on her flight," says Bahr.
"Men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they are threatened with torture or death, or because their families send them as hopefuls to Europe," she says.
In women, there are other reasons for escape: "Many secretly steal from it because they see no other way out."
In their homeland, they have experience of sexual violence, forced marriages, honor killings, slavery or forced prostitution.
This is driving them away.
On the run this goes on.
"For example, for a bottle of water, tugs demand a sexual act is not a rarity," says Bahr.
And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Who believe that the end, as soon as they arrive in Germany, is mistaken, says Bahr.
Here too, single women in refugee shelters would often be regarded as inferior and at worst abused.
This leads to the fact that about 90 percent of the women living in the accommodation in the north of Munich are traumatized, she appreciates.
"Some of the children have certainly not voluntarily emerged".
Many women are so accustomed to saying nothing.
"Or they do not dare to speak openly about what has been experienced, because the shame is too great".
Since they often do not know how to help, they need more accommodation just for them, asks Bahr.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for accommodating refugees.
The question of whether you know of a similar project as in Munich in your area of competence answers some with No.
In the Oberpfalz and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in government housing.
Even in Swabia, women who have fled alone are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, government spokesman.
In Upper Bavaria, under-and Middle Franconia there are in some common accommodation floors or own houses only for single women and their children.
The exception is Lower Bavaria, where there are two central accommodation exclusively for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and gender equality in the European Parliament also calls for men to be accommodated separately.
In a study published for the Committee, it says: "It is very important that men and women be accommodated separately."
"If the privacy is lacking or if men and women are accommodated together, there may be continual violence against women."
Especially the washrooms should be separate and easily accessible for women, is in the study.
How much the women feel this need for protection can be seen in the crowds that exist on the house in Munich.
"Since we've been around, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr.
You could easily open a second house.
