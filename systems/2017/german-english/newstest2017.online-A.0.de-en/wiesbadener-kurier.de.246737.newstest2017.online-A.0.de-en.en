One for all cases
Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupe and even the versatility of a minivan.
Sounds rather cluttered, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.
Although the only 1.60 m high hr-V is rather small, the passengers have a lot of space in the front row as well as in the rear, it does not work closely at any point.
The materials of the interior are well processed and work pleasantly, only the cockpit top falls off.
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in storage space.
There is not only a trunk of 453 l at raised and 1026 L with folded backs available, but there are the "magic seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: the seat surfaces of the back bench can be folded up like a movie chair and thus offer storage space that is up to the ceiling 1.24 metres high.
The trunk can be loaded well, but the height with 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1.6-L-diesel with 88 kw/120 HP speeds up the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 nm in wide speed ranges.
However, he should do his job a little more quietly.
The daily consumption of 4.7 L/100 km is pleasing.
There is another motorization: a 1.5-litre petrol engine with 96 kw/130 hp.
A four-wheel drive is not offered.
The driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamism and comfort.
But the steering should be a little more direct.
The equipment in the tested top variant "executive" leaves nothing to be desired.
The security systems include the city-emergency assistant (works up to Tempo 32), the collision warning system and the tracking assistant.
The collision detector sometimes irritates because it evaluates many obstacles as "approaching objects" when shunting.
The remote lighting Assistant works very reliably.
And the intelligent tempo control responds to the traffic signs detection and throttles, if required, the speed.
The full connectivity is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, Navi, app integration and more.
Two usb and one HDMI jacks are located under the armrest and are therefore somewhat awkward to reach.
The approximately 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.
Those who do not want to invest so much will receive the petrol from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23000 euros.
The engines meet the Euro 6 standard.
With the HR-V Honda offers a versatile and everyday suitable car.
