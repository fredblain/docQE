Gilead receives legal costs from hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A U.S. magistrate ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc was entitled to a refund of the legal costs incurred by it from the hepatitis C litigation with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was exempted from a compensation payment of $200 million for the infringement of two patents by Merck, in connection with the Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead's blockbuster drugs, after a US judge revealed a pattern of wrongdoing by Merck, including the perjury and other unethical acts.
When bringing the lawsuit on Thursday, U.S. Magistrate Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead has the right to waive the costs incurred during the defense of the case.
Merck is trying to equate with Gilead, which dominates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case goes back to the year 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed property on laboratory work, which Sofosbuvir based, the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead.
