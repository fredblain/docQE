Ground in Double pack
In the recent meeting, the municipal council focused on topics related to construction.
With relief, the Panel adopted the communication of Mayor Robert Putz that "finally the marketing of the recently designated housing areas can begin".
After the land, Parzellierungs and development issues have been clarified and the applications for surveying could be made, the sale of the land in the residential areas "Straßlweg" and "Schönau-West" (Section 1 of Binder Road-expansion) is no longer in the way of interested parties.
The municipal council is convinced that the land in the rural and quiet residential community of Schönau will appeal to young families and spry senior citizens alike.
As it was said, building volunteers can immediately report to the city Hall, and the municipal council is expected to advise on the allocation of the parcels in its September meeting.
In order to be able to make inquiries about the settlement of further businesses, coupled with the creation of jobs, the municipal council decided to change the land use plan, which was newly created in the spring of this year, in sub-areas.
Thus, in the area of Unterzeitlarn, the already designated industrial area is extended by two parcels towards the state Road 2112.
