Rain instead of shooting stars: Hope for weather improvement
The weather has made the star-shooting peepers in the southwest of Germany on the night of Friday a stroke through the bill-but there is still hope.
The night was ill-suited for clouds and rain to observe the spectacle of the sky, said the chairman of the Observatory Welzheim, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.
Our hope is on the night of Saturday.
The weather is supposed to be good, then we certainly see many shooting stars in the sky.
The star scales are Perseids, which belong to the fastest shooting stars at 216000 kilometers per hour.
They have their name because they appear to come from the constellation Perseus, which is emerging in the northeast.
