Killed in bomb attack: He was the hero of Aleppo
He put his own life to the game to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar devoted his life to the people of Syria.
He risked everything to save the lives of others.
Now the 30-year-old himself died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the White Helmets, a civil protection group that, according to Bild newspaper, saved almost 60,000 people's lives.
2900 volunteers put their own lives at risk in order to attract people from bombed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: a video of the civil Protector, which shows him in an 11-hour rescue of an infant from the rubble of a house, went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrian a shining symbolic figure in the horror of war.
As a hero, however, he never saw himself, said according to the picture: "For me this is the real jihad."
"When I die to save lives, I think that God sees a martyr in me."
Shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack, he had spoken in a video about the last bombing in Syria.
The helicopters threw four barrel bombs over the Alzadia district, one was filled with chlorine.
A woman and two children died, seven people suffer from shortness of breath.
"We are now eliminating the toxic remnants of the bomb so that children do not play with it," the picture quotes his last words before he died.
The deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists.
