Future of the melting of Portland due to repeal of the energy contract questionable
The future of the aluminium smelting of Portland in Victoria, as well as hundreds of workers ' jobs, is at stake as the plant operator is announcing the energy supply contract and thus canceling all supply contracts, as the delivering energy company announced.
This step followed the government's decision in Victoria earlier this year to award no further subsidies to the operation of the facility.
A subsidy for 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2000 jobs at Alcoa's facility in Portland are at stake.
No less than 2000 jobs-direct and indirect-could be at risk of closure.
In addition, domino effects could occur as the melting consumes around 10 percent of Victoria's total power generation.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the point Henry Melting, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa's melting in Portland is losing money and risking closure.
This step follows the years of speculation about the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and lastly due to the electricity price for the plant.
AGL, who supplies the large aluminium melting with his Loy Yang a power plant in Latrobe Valley, said that it is assumed that three other owners will terminate their contracts.
The plant is in the majority ownership of a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, the Chinese company Citic and the Japanese Marubeni Corp. hold smaller shares.
"AGL assumes that the Portland facility will continue to operate, which means a further physical demand for electricity through the melting," the company said.
AGL continued to say that the treaties were so-called "hedges", which should have entered into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period so that they will end in 2017.
"Therefore, AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenue in the financial year 17," said the electricity supplier.
All potential effects on revenue on AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong futures markets for wholesale current prices.
AGL stated that it had already depreciated the value of the contracts in its Jahresabschlus of $187 million in "expectation of termination".
Alcoa said that the decision to book the contracts, the "ability of Alcoa... to operate the melting or to ensure the power supply to the melting" is not affect.
The US company said it had completed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to enter into force from November this year, even if it is still guilty of a statement as to why it has resigned from the treaty.
Analysts warn about the poor economic situation of the industry before the possible closure of the Portland melting in Victoria and the Tomago facility near Newcastle.
In reference to the statements of analysts at the beginning of the week, the head of operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes around 600 megawatts per year and Tomago around 900 megawatts of electricity.
If both plants disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand in the [electricity market].
And for us as power generators, that wouldn't be good, "he said.
