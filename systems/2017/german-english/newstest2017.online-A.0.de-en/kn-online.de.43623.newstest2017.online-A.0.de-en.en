Steel-light view for German steel industry
The crisis-stricken and energy-intensive German steel industry remains unaffected by additional costs in millions of dollars.
Financial burdens that threatened the industry from the promotion of green electricity are off the table.
It remains in the liberation from the renewable energy distribution at the existing plants for the so-called own-electricity production in the German steel industry, said federal minister of Industry Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "West German General newspaper" (Waz, Friday edition).
"I am really pleased that we have finally been able to achieve this after two years of tough negotiations."
The European Commission, therefore, had initially planned to ask the steel producers who use gas from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption.
According to the German Industry association, the steel industry was threatened with additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.
Gabriel told the WAZ that there is now a fundamental agreement with the EU Commission after talks with competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators are replaced in the steel mills will an EEG-deposit of 20 percent be used.
But this is also not being raised in the steel industry.
IG Metall welcomed Germany's unification with the European Commission for the generation of own electricity.
In this way, the status quo of the previous regulation is largely enshrined.
The successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry were of particular importance.
"With regard to our ' steel is Future ' campaign, this is a first step."
"More must follow."
"Climate and employment targets are also to be weighed in the reform of emissions trading," said IG Metall chief JÃ¶rg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
The steel industry in Europe has been suffering from overcapacity and a considerable price pressure since the 2008 financial crisis.
Last year, the situation intensified as the world's largest producer country, China, threw mass steel on the world market in the face of weakening domestic demand.
European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel companies of price dumping.
In the course of this spring the situation has eased somewhat.
On the one, import duties imposed on imported steel have an effect, and the economic outlook in China has brightened.
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.
The German industry Primus ThyssenKrupp remained cautious on Thursday.
Lastly, prices were again rather stagnant.
The industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Last but not least, ThyssenKrupp did not want to exclude the closure of individual works.
In the German steel industry, around 86000 people were employed at the end of 2015.
In July, the German steel manufacturers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.
With 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less steel than in the same month of the previous year as the Steel Industry Association on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the quantity produced went back the second month in a row.
Since the beginning of the year, production has been two percent below the prior-year figure.
In the coming months, the Association anticipates an increase in output due to an improved order situation.
