Salzburg "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare year, the Salzburg Festival presents the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic pair of lovers, similar to Romeo and Juliet.
With doing a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical captured Salzburg: The "West Side Story", Leornard Bern Stein's masterpiece.
The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical to the Temple of classical music and fulfilled a youth dream with the role of Mary.
In the orchestra, the Simón Bolívar Orchestra is buried under the leadership of the Venezonalischen conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm," he raves.
We always say that it is very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody.
It is a wonderful blend, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say that we really have amber music in our blood!
In this staging, Bartoli plays an older Maria.
She remembers with sadness at her love with Tony, while the younger Maria plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
First, because it is exceptional musically!
And then there is Mary's personality.
She says it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright".
So she's smart, of course naïve, and very passionate.
"She is very similar to my Italian character, whom I have as a Roman", Bartoli laughs.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It's such an honor for us to work with her.
She is an immensely generous man.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
Conducting is a necessity for him.
You can see it in each of his movements, in his eyes, it is his life!
It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a cheerful approach to life, which is very important at all!
For the American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the "West Side Story" is highly topical: "This piece is about prejudice and fanaticism."
Today we have the refugees, at that time the Puerto have gone to New York, and the New York residents did not want them.
They are the same subjects, and they are as meaningful today as they were then.
59 years later, the piece is still relevant.
