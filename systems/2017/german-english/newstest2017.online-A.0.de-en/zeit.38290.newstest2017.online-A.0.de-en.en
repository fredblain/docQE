Old buildings, a few linden trees, in between a remnant of cobblestones: The Riga Street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not look like this at first sight, but the police are one of the "dangerous places" of the city.
Walking down the street from east to west, you will pass by playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a grocery store.
Someone sprayed "ugly!" on the fa√ßade of a grey house.
Opposite of a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, is already built: by 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new rented apartments will be created.
Articles about this "trendy district", as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, are, however, in the last weeks preferably illustrated with burning cars.
The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have lease agreements, but on the ground floor are still occupied rooms and are used for events.
Since the beginning of the year, Berlin's senator Henkel, in particular, had repeatedly spoken out for a crackdown on the project by the police, the area as a "no-go zone" for police officers and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.
On the 22nd of June, the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers had been vacated, patrolled the police for three weeks, according to official statements, with 30 to 40 officials and three team wagons on site, blocked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94.
Meanwhile, construction workers refurbished the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners.
On July 13th, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the eviction had been illegal, and a day later, police and construction workers withdrew under the cheers of sympathizers and residents.
This summer afternoon the road is peaceful: Parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the Sun, others entertain themselves before late.
In the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and kindergartens.
Left-wing violence is not the main concern of many local residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in the neighbourhood since 1999, and Jana *, which draws three children, are mainly annoyed by the police presence.
With the residents of the house projects they share the concern about rising rents and gentrification.
It does not sound like a neighborhood that has a majority wished for police protection from Vandalierenden left.
The ditch that the Berlin Interior senator and the police open between squatters and their neighbors does not seem to exist.
Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district, which also today has a low average income and high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city.
House occupations and the resulting housing projects have long been part of the neighbourhood: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer Strasse near the Rigaer.
While the mainzers had been evacuated under great police command in a regular street battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigas and are still inhabited by the people they had occupied 26 years ago.
At the same time, the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and the choice of Berliners from all over the world in recent years: with them, residents from GDR times and former squatters now share their neighborhoods.
This is also noticeable in the rents, which have risen by almost 60 percent in the case of newcomers since 2009.
Many of the new buildings in Riga are being attacked as symbols for this development: they can be seen on the rolled-up discs or freshly painted facades that have been pelteded with color bags.
No other street was mentioned this year so often along with the words "left-autonomous violence".
One reason why not all neighbors see this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as bodily injury are almost exclusively directed against policemen.
Most of the offences are subject to damage that tends to hit new buildings and newly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a tenement house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, there can be no question of uncertainty.
As for acts of violence, it is appeasing: the people in the 94 are their neighbors, they certainly have not been.
Even the famous burning cars have been out of the rigaer for a long time.
For the architect studied her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "Here one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more from each other, than elsewhere".
Neugebauer was deliberately dragged into the Riga road-and remained.
That's why it was so important to her that residents get back their streets: From the police, politics and the media, who all of a sudden claimed the sovereignty over the district in July.
But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away from them: through faceless new buildings in former construction gaps that displace the old inhabitants.
"These are, after all, condos that are not interesting for many here-people who are not so well-heeled," she says.
"I absolutely cannot tolerate violence and destruction."
But what do you do if someone never listens?
There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the residents.
For those who are annoyed by color bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the House projects and the left scene belonged to the neighbourhood.
Those who move here should be aware of this-just like someone who pulls into a pub district, can complain about noise there badly.
