Treats will Nacktkalendar for "women and for Men"
The treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemere to bring out a 1970 's Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, you want to find the next generation of models for your Nu muses calendar for 2017.
At the beginning of this year, the editor-in-chief of treats Steve Shaw told us that his nude magazine was different from Oldschool Playboys, because "Playboy is for Men".
I do this for women.
Apparently, he thinks it's the calendar.
"We have to return to the depiction of timeless and classic nakedness, where both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by these pictures of a female body," said Shaw in a press release on the publication of the calendar.
Women will want to take part in this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit their images online or in person at the open casting call in Los Angeles and New York.
