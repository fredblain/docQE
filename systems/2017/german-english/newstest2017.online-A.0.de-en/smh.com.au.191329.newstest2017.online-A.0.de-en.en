Municipal law centres have 160,000 people per year
More than 160,000 of the Hilfsbedürfigsten of the country are dismissed annually by the municipal law centres, while the industry is looking at the effects of further budget cuts on already overloaded transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people – mostly older persons, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who have no means of unjust eviction and the like – are already dismissed in their application for free legal advice and legal assistance.
Legal services of the municipality, which are already over-utilized, are ready for further cuts.
From June next year, it is foreseen that these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds.
The director of the Gemeindrechtszentren of Queesland James Farrell said that the last survey of the National Association of Community Law Centers revealed that thousands of people are already dismissed every year.
Farrell said the situation would only get worse without a resolution of the federal government.
"Queensland's Community law centers are chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people are dismissed from important services they need," he said.
People who leave violent relationships people with unmanageable and oppressive debts, families going through separations, workers who have been unfairly dismissed--all these people have legal problems and this survey shows that they can't get the help they need.
The federal government will cut the funds by 30 percent from June 2017, which means that thousands of hilsbedürftigeren people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the general attorney and federal designated, as well as senators from Queensland George Brandis, to lift these funds immediately, so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems.
Last year, the state Government fulfilled its pledge to raise funds for legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of Community law centres and their customer communities, and that the government of Palaszczuk invests in this important work.
