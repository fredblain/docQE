Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by battle with the cancer of the trainer to Rudersieg
There will be no emotinaleres gold than these games, and that will mean something.
From the first stroke to the last, 220 hard Hieve that go into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though there were only the two who were seated at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. The echo of coach Robin Williams, was present as they rowed to the second Olympic gold in the two without a tax-woman in a row, the first women in the history of British sports, who laid such a yardstick.
Their dominance was absolute, after all, their 39th undefeated commitment, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes gliding across the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not completely reflect the nature of the triumph.
Behind every gold in rowing is a battalion of willing helpers, that contribute to the incremental progress that makes the difference and there was no one more helpful than the coach who did not know 30 months ago if he would survive that day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
Like he said he was risky.
I had bladder cancer, which is inoperable, and they did.
If they don't, it spreads everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes a little the outlook.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was lucky that he could start treatment in early 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if that is the right term in such circumstances.
I needed money, so I had to get better soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and ran around the station-20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice.
That's how it starts.
Rowing in itself is a challenge, but that makes it even bigger.
In the immediacy of victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve-wracking morning talking a little more than usual, trying to process his own fears.
Stanning, who was a captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment in a mission in Afghanistan, said, "I was an emotional wreck this week. That may be something extreme, but it means so much. "
It only repeats how much this means to me how much I and Helen and also Robin have worked.
There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin we would be nobody, so a massive thank you to him. He's the best coach in the world.
I could not have wanted a better person to train or a better coach.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.
The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to unlock, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very caught at the moment.
Helen cried "Stay in the process, stay in the process".
It's really important not to be swept away.
We had a good start and at the same time we were not prepared to do something great.
We didn't want fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, which we did.
The couple will take a time out for a year before it will make decisions about their future.
Glover must appear next week at a wedding, her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backwill.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say this was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion.
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed out.
It took about four minutes.
That feels so much better, "she said.
