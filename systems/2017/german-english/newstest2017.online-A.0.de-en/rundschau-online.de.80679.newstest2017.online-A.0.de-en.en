Witnesses wanted: Beverage market in Waldbröl invaded
A robbery was perpetrated on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Rewe XXL on the Waldbröler Gerber Road.
Under a firearm, three darkly clad persons who had masked their faces demanded the release of cash from the employee of the beverage market and then fled first on foot and then presumably with a silver-coloured VW Golf.
How much money has been looted, the police do not share.
The perpetrators should have been between 1.60 and 1.70 meters in size, so relatively small.
The beverage market is directly accessible and poorly visible from the parking deck of the Rewe market.
The perpetrators must have run after the robbery in the direction of Gerber Strasse, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg and have fled from the gravel car park in front of the car park entrance with the silver car, possibly in the direction of B 256 (Schladernring).
Those who have made observations about the time (against 19.45), who are in connection with the robbery, should urgently report to the police.
