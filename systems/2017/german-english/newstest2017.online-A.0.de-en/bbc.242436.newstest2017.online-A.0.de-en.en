Russia's Putin fires chief of staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was a part of Putin's closest circle of trust for many years.
The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for environmental and transport matters.
In an opinion of the Kremlin, it is that Putin, without giving any reason, "ordered the dismissal of Ivanov from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration".
Anton Vaino, who has been Ivanov's deputy since 2012, has been appointed as his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he graduated from the prestigious state Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the embassy in Tokyo.
On the Kremlin's website it is said (in Russian) that he was later the chief of staff and head of government.
He said about his appointment to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I think it is the government's most important task to support its work as head of State regarding draft laws and controls to implement its instructions.
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Are the smiling faces convincing?
This step has made Moscow secret shrouded.
Sergei Ivanov was one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidants for a long time and works like him for the Soviet Secret Service, the KGB.
As chief of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was aired on television, both men claimed that the chief of staff was resigned at his own request.
But despite the smiles for the cameras, few are convinced-especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of a kind of power struggle?
Nobody knows that at the moment.
But the official claim-that a man who was once touted as a potential president would like to lead the Russian environmental policy at once-was very sceptical.
In his remarks to Putin quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said, "It is true that I asked her in a conversation in early 2012 to entrust me with this very complicated post-one could almost say-arduous post for four years.
As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential Administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov accepted the post in December 2011.
Previously, he was deputy Prime Minister and Secretary of Defense.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was the chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.
When Putin reached power, he named Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted most.
It was once believed that after Putin's second term, Ivanov could become president of Russia, as a third term Putin would have violated the constitution.
But this post was taken by another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before returning to the presidency three and a half years later.
