Military leadership distorts ISIS Secret Service information, Committee of Congress notes
Military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the actual conditions on the ground would have allowed, a congressional committee of Inquiry reported in a report on Thursday.
The preliminary report, created by a task force of the Republican members of the Streitkr√§ftekommitees, Geheimdienstkommitees and the Wehrbudgetkommites, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.
The Central Command, abbreviated Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Intelligence information, which were typically nod by high-ranking CENTCOM commanders, regularly drew a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism than the actual conditions on the ground had allowed and were consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence services," a newspaper article quoted the report.
"What happened in the CENTCOM is unacceptable-our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The leadership errors in the Centcom range to the top of the organization.
The ten-page report shows in detail persistent problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi armed forces.
Although there is no direct evidence that government leaders under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts have faced pressure from their superiors to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first six months of 2015, many Central Command press releases, opinions and statements before the Congress were much more positive than the facts", the report noted.
For example, a CENTCOM member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could begin already in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, is so clear." said Mike Pompeo, Republican congressman from Kansas, in an opinion.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, Central Command leaders changed intelligence reports to downplay the threat of ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans launched the task force after they were told that analysts were concerned about manipulating reports on the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while the investigations will continue.
In addition, further investigations of the CENTCOM reports by the inspector General of the Ministry of Defence are underway.
Democratic members of the Nachrichtendienstekomittees published their own findings on Thursday, which coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"In the years 2014 and 2015, the Centcom created an overly limited process for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," the ranking Democrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, announced in an opinion.
This process, Mr. Schiff, "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," damaged morale among analysts and "gave excessively little room for divergent opinions."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats stated that they had not found any evidence of a White House's intervention in the CENTCOM analysts regarding a "certain political opinion".
The preliminary results of the congressional investigations were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast".
Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the General Inspector of the Pentagon, which were recorded after complaints from CENTCOM analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a press officer at the Pentagon, stated in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on congressional reports, while the investigations of the General inspector were still underway.
But he also stated that "experts sometimes have divergent opinions about the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence."
The investigations have repercussions beyond the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Defense Ministry).
However, the accusations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the central command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
The criticism regarding the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of disputes of more than ten years ago, as a CENTCOM analyst, Gregory Hooker, a document written about how the then government under George W. Bush, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, had only a small occupying force in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current coverage of the Islamic State.
Last year, the team of Mr. Hooker stated, according to government agencies, contrary to the Government's statements against the refiners held by the Islamic State, there would be no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these provisional refineries would have been put into operation to sell oil on the black market.
However, this knowledge was not published, The Times reported in September.
Centcoms then commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin was retired in April and was passed by the Central Command. Replaced Joseph L. Votel.
