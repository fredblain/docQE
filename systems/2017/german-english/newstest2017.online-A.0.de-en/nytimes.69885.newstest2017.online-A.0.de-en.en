Once displaced over the price of the market, café comes back in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby café in Williamsburg where you could only pay for a bar that had no Wi-Fi but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, was ousted by the prices from his Bedford Avenue storefront.
The business soap Cherie, which replaced the verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Locals mourned it as a last loss in a Gentrifizierenden city.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is changing, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is gutted and is now a soap shop."
But if New York is a change, it is also a reinvention.
A revived Verb cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the Old café, who is the owner and managing director of the New Café.
He started working at verbs in 2001 and remained there until the end.
When a customer offered him to provide funds for a new outpost, he was excited to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, maintained a lot of things.
Verb used the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are trimmings such as capers and sautéed onions.
There are natural rice bowls.
The café does not serve any beer, but there are fresh juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez said that he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.
"Many old customers were also ousted by prices from Williamsburg," he said.
Recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, lived earlier in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.
Even after she had moved to Greenpoint, she would take the road.
After the verb had closed, she gave up drinking coffee for a while, she said.
"I realized that there was coffee and culture in the verb that I liked," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, even if she ordered a blended chai tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee, which is another new addition.
Since the beginning of the verb in 2003, Tom Rosenthal has been a further longtime and loyal customer.
He went there before work and inevitably ordered the same thing.
"I came quarter after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my everything-bagel with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu.
Nowadays Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his everything-bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said that he had no grudge that the soap business had taken over the old business premises.
In fact, the owners of soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for verb with the coffee brewed in the café as an ingredient.
"I think we're going to go into your offer," said Rodriguez.
And the traditional Polish inhabitants of Greenpoints have also accepted the café.
A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said he intends to show them soon, so that his new neighbors will feel welcome.
The location also has other advantages.
A local Saftlokal wants to fill and sell the cold brewed coffee.
There is a chance that the café will expand to a neighboring building.
For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said that he was devastated when the café closed.
When the new café opened, Whitt said that entering the premises and ordering a new coffee felt like a homecoming.
"I had to smell that," he said.
