Police put tear gas & rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students met with the police on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo when they gathered to demonstrate against government reforms to the public education system.
The police put tear gas and rubber bullets against the demonstrators.
The difficulties began when police officers tried to disperse the students, which caused the police to put on rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students attended the demonstrations to express their dismay at the plans.
According to the proposals of the Governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, a little less than 100 public schools are closed, while 300,000 students are implemented to save money.
Some of the protest participants saw graffitits against the provisional President Michel Temer spraying on walls.
The most recent protests took place a few days after demonstrators went to Mass on the streets to support the suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been dismissed from office by a vote of the Senate.
