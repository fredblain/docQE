More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September edition of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner clan Kris is on the cover of the coveted September edition of US Vogue.
Kendall, who is the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran at fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on her Instagram account.
"In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry," wrote Kendall.
The unveiling of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians similar?), scripted reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (with the exception of the problem cases rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the most popular showbiz uncle and producer of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as she forgets the cover of her sister and ends with a classic twist: they have all planned a surprise party.
This is the clich√©d plot of almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we'd forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit on a square at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to somehow let her other girls take part in this publicity.
With regard to the September issue of Vogue has certainly begun a new Era of Kardashians.
Kendall's big sister Kim likes to have beaten her as far as the Vogue cover is concerned (she and her husband Kanye West were to see it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league by itself.
The September edition is the most sold edition of the Year for Vogue.
With a volume that is more like a picture-set than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (according to the fashionista were from the 832 pages of the Tome 615 page advertising).
The revelation of his cover star is so eagerly anticipated that in the last two years images of the magazine were leaking before the official announcement.
Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years were clearly more "celebrities who model" than "models who are celebrities" on the cover.
Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover, a year after Lady Gaga had the honor.
But even at the slight chance that Mrs Jenner-who is described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation-falls under the former category, she is in good company.
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers of today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even if it all applies to Jenner).
They are truly talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had with the release of lemonade one of the most successful years of her career.
Of course, Jenner's success doesn't appeal to everyone.
With her reality TV story, Jenner's position in the fashion world was always somewhat tense.
In June, the former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized her and called her "the pieces of the moment."
These feelings boiled up again when the news came out with the release of Jenners on the Vogue cover.
But riding around on the moroseness seems to pass by the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of Vogue.
It is in the truest sense of the word a supermodel.
She's running for Marc Jacobs.
She's advertising her primer, Estee Lauder.
You and all your sisters sell you pictures of yourself on their respective paywall apps.
She sells her pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to Love magazine.
And in her free time she is in reality TV. Presumably only to see her sister Kourtney and their children.
