Social family destroyed in front of Delogierung social housing in Saltash, Cornwall
A social family left their social housing after a Delogierung with a damage of £50,000 because they had terrorized their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her estate in Saltash, Cornwall.
After being forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an irreparable state.
The walls showed gaping holes, wooden planks were torn open, rubbish was scattered on the floor and graffiti was smeared on the walls.
The family has been relocated and it is assumed that she is now living in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for the House administration at Cornwall Housing, said that she was afraid that the apartment would no longer be repaired.
She said, "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here, and I think people don't have to live that way.
There are many things to consider, as this property will probably be considered as not so beautiful part of Cornwall.
The family is notorious and their reputation is also.
The couple had three sons, who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflicted included street fights with baseball bats, intimidating residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking, and excessive shouting, arguing, and swearing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, was given an order for anti-social behaviour in June.
In some rooms of the house, which may be demolished, old rubbish was found
The wooden planks were torn up in the estate where drugs were traded in the past.
Neighbors said they saw them fighting on the street and had to be called regularly by the police
Cornwall Housing Delogierte You and your partner forcibly this week from the property after giving you an extended period of 11 weeks to undress voluntarily.
The Delogierung were cheered by relieved neighbors who said that their lives were turned into hell.
One of them said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad.
The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.
"We couldn't sleep this morning."
We stood up because it was so quiet here-we are not used to it!
Now that you are finally gone, it will be nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, neighbourhood enforcement manager of Cornwall Housing, said that the failed family would have to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house to which the police were summoned on a regular basis for 20 years
On the overgrown side of the municipal house, trash and old toys were thrown down
He added: "It is a shame that the tenant neglected to accept any responsibility for their behavior and that of their family, since a Delogierung is always the last step that Cornwall housing considers.
This was a very difficult case, because the behavior was extreme and their actions had to be terribly brother for their neighbors.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the community who have been courageously approaching us and who have provided us with the information, have done so.
I hope that this development will give consolation to some neighbours and convey the message that anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.

Workers of the House administration will now have to mountains to clear out the house surrounding
In 2014, the police conducted a raid in the house and found about 70g cannabis as well as scales, Paraphernalien and cash in the amount of £1,700.
Skeldon received a fine after being guilty of the possession of a class B drug in commercial intent.
She claimed that the money was for a gravestone of her son Lee Skeldon, who was killed in a car accident in 2013.
After they were without shelter, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many room walls of the house were smeared with graffiti.
The police say that they will be tenants who do not abide by the House Rules
Angela Crow of the police of Devon and Cornwall said that the Delogierung was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not abide by the House rules.
"This goes to those who think that they can behave without self-reproaches as well as those who have been harmed by such behaviour," she said.
The Devon and Cornwall Police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behavior that will continue to cooperate with partners to protect our communities.
