Seriously injured-man stabs on his ex-girlfriend
A man attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and severely injured.
As the police told yesterday, the 50-year-old had the key to the apartment to get his personal things.
Instead, the alcohol offender cut the clothes of his ex-girlfriend.
When she came to the apartment, he stabbed her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured by the hand and the body.
The police have been able to take the perpetrator.
While the 50-year-old destroyed his ex-girlfriend's clothes, he called his mother.
The latter then alarmed his sister.
Together with her partner, the 45-year-old wanted to soothe her brother.
But she could not persuade him to leave the apartment.
That's why she went out of the house with her partner.
On the street they met the man's ex-partner.
When the two women entered the apartment again, the 50-year-old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
