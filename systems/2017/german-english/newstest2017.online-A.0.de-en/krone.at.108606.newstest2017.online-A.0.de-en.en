Bomb terror in Thailand-Austrian injured-several deaths
The Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, said the spokesman of the Foreign Ministry, Thomas Schnöll, Friday morning.
She had suffered cuts and had been treated in the hospital, but had already been able to leave.
Her journey home was planned for the beginning of September.
Whether the further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon are also affected by Austrian citizens, is still unclear for the time being.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities, says Schnöll.
The Hua Hin, located approximately 200 km south of Bangkok's capital, was first exploded on Thursday evening in an nightlife quarter.
According to the police, a Thai was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
On Friday morning, two explosives were raised again, and another person was killed according to the authorities.
Phuket also reported a bomb explosion in the morning.
At the detonation near the beach Patong, popular with holidaymakers, a taxi driver was injured according to police information.
In Surat Thani, on the southeast coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing an urban employee.
According to the authorities, the explosives were blown up in a flower bed in front of the coastal police station.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwest coast and Chumphon on the southeast coast demanded several injured.
You go from a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it was said.
"The bomb attacks bear the same handwriting," said Army general Danai Kritmethavee Friday morning to journalists.
"We assume that this is a coordinated attack."
It is too early to comment on possible motives, but it is probably the deeds of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern in the attacks that is typical of the bomb attacks of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
The Thai police, on the other hand, stated that the attacks were not linked to the Islamist insurgency or international terrorism.
"This is only local sabotage, which is limited to limited areas and provinces," said a spokesman in Bangkok.
Rather, it is assumed that the bombs were placed by opponents of the ruling military junta.
In recent days, the authorities would have received intelligence on impending attacks in the south of the country-but they were not informed about the exact time and places.
It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.
The police instructed their officials throughout the country to reinforce security around important government buildings as well as airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.
In Thailand there are always smaller bombings, but they are usually not directed against tourists.
In Hua Hin is a palace used for years by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
After the present bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its homepage that the instructions of the Thai security authorities must be guaranteed.
High security risk (Security Level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and environs.
After clashes between the security forces and Muslim populations, it is not advisable to travel to these provinces.
Increased security risk (Security Level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution prepared by the military junta.
This also gives the military great influence in the years to come.
Junta chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-Cha said the bombs were an attempt to wreak havoc, while the country was moving towards stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.
The Militärunta, which had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, is self-sufficient to have brought the kingdom back to stability and order.
However, the military has not managed to get hold of the rebellion of Muslim rebels, which has been simmering in the extreme south of the country for many years.
More than 6500 people have already been killed in the conflict.
Just under a year ago in Bangkok, 20 people were killed in an attack on a popular Hindu shrine-most of them foreign tourists.
It was the bloodiest attack of the country's recent history.
