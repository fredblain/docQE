The USA wins fourth match in the field of women's hockey, a showdown with Britain is imminent
One day after shooting three goals during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3-0.
Five goals in two games were supposed to be a memorable achievement, but BAM (27) said she couldn't remember ever doing that.
"I have no idea." she said.
I don't belong to the people who keep their goals in mind.
She knows, however: the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are in their group with the British women in the first place, who remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan.
Great Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals, the game will decide which of the two within their group of six teams will win the first and second place respectively.
The first-placed will take a little longer to the strong Dutch in the direction of the other group.
However the game may go out on Saturday, the Americans have caused a startling whirl through their success story, four years after they landed at the last of the 12 seats in the last London Games.
BAM was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years of playing a hockey bat in her hands (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), at age 16 she became national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.
She missed the Olympics in 2008 because she could not qualify for the squad.
Then came the year 2012, in which everything went wrong for you and your team.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the national team, began to turn things up for the better.
"A change of culture, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.
We did not have the workload in London, which we now have.
We have been able to pull the rudder completely around.
On Thursday evening, BAM opened the Torreigen in the first half of the game with a backhand from the close range.
India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until BAM took the game into their hands.
She performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and lupfte the ball into the gate to give the American in a 2-0 leadership.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.
The shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the goalkeeper of the United States, Jackie Briggs, who had previously booked a goal in each of the previous games.
She's got a run.
Just like Bam.
"We are in a good position" said Parnham, but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday.
