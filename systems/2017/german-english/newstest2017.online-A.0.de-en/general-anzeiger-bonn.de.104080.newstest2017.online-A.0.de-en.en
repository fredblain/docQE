In the name of the fight against terrorism, laws are constantly being screwed.
After the recent attacks, Interior Minister de Maizière now presents a thick security package.
But what has a tolerance status to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say to all this?
Thomas de Maizière gives the reconciler.
All his proposals are "politically reasonable" to the coalition partner, says the federal minister at the presentation of his new security package.
They don't overwhelm anyone.
Other, more advanced points would initially be discussed within the parties.
I also participate in this.
As Minister of the Interior, however, he was given results and a "recoverable consensus" within the coalition.
After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, de Maizière has had a little time to pass before presenting his conclusions for security in the Republic.
But they are now all the more extensive.
Some is already known, announced, targeted: that a new security authority should look after the cracking of encrypted communication is not new.
Nor is the fact that Germany has to implement several EU regulations on passenger data and weapons law.
The call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is also not surprising.
In part, de Maizière launches a second start for proposals that were not to be made with the SPD so far: he wants to punish sympathy advertising for terrorist groups and jihadists the German passport with dual citizenship.
"These will be difficult points for the SPD", admits the CDU man.
Nevertheless, he deems this to be reasonable and does not demand anything that the coalition partner has no chances anyway.
A few new ideas presented de Maizière also.
They have it in part: He is planning quick procedures for deportation and more possibilities for detention of people before deportation.
Refugees who are specifically brought into the country should first have their smartphones checked and social media accounts disclosed for a security review.
In tolerating rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse than hitherto, such as those who commit crimes or deliberately discard their papers in order to conceal their identity.
Some of them are politically and legally sensitive.
Some things are also baked and leaves questions open.
And on some points-in the unequal treatment of tolerated, for example-the question arises: what does this have to do with security and terror?
Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror.
But it is not possible to deny that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people were concerned about security in the face of the high numbers of refugees.
And things that people profoundly employed were not even allowed to be excluded in election campaign times.
Internal security has been a huge focus.
First the attacks in the neighbourhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The uncertainty is great.
And yes, there are election fights.
The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly putting themselves on the subject of internal security.
In the past few days, the two parties were high.
It was only a nasty dispute over the equipping of the federal Police, then a collection of security policy ideas of some union interior ministers, in which the heads of the ministries also demand a burka ban and a departure from dual citizenship.
De Maizière strives is also here for conciliatory tones.
He has nothing to do with a departure from the double pass.
We have pacified the discussion in Germany.
It is not sensible to reopen it.
And in a burka ban, he has constitutional concerns.
Whether his own package at all corners is constitutional and whether it is actually "reasonable" for the coalition partner, has yet to show itself.
There are a lot of things that could cause controversy.
But the SPD is also trying to profile itself in the topic of internal security.
Party chief Sigmar Gabriel first of all tentatively signals willingness to talk and says: "The SPD is ready to speak about everything, which helps to increase security further".
