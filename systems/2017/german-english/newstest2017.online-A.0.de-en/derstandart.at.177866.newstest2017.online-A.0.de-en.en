Ma Long in his own league to table tennis gold
Rio de JANEIRO-The Chinese Ma Long is the new table Tennis Olympic champion.
The 27-year-old defeated his compatriot and "defending champion" Zhang Jike 4:0 (12, 5, 4, 4) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro in a one-sided final.
This brought the world rankings-first the golden Grand slam with successes at world championships, World Cup, world Tour final tournament and even Olympia.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
The two Chinese have made it into the final as expected and made the title among themselves.
This made it clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would bring the single title in the Sign of the five rings.
The last non-Chinese on the top Olympic podium was the former SVS-nope-Legionnaire Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left on the record alone, between the sentences and at time-outs they had no coaches.
They had withdrawn to the grandstand and left their protégés alone in a fair competition.
"I've played the matches to this place for my country."
"In the finals I play for myself," Zhang had said correctly.
After the match, gold and silver medalists posed with the China flag.
The match itself was unexpectedly unilateral.
Ma had to fight with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first movement really.
He then determined the tempo on the plate and left Zhang with only 13 points.
The superiority of Ma did not develop the expected rousing match.
Nevertheless, there were plenty of breathtaking changes to the ball.
Mizutani won the bronze game against the 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4:1.
In his quarterfinals against the German European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov, the Byelorussian had suffered a rib injury, afterwards in medical treatment, had to "ultimately" be content with tin.
The Swedes Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008), by the way, were in similar high table tennis age Olympia-fourth.
