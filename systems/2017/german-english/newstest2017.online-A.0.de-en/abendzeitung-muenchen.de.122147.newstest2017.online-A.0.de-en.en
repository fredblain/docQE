Jennifer Aniston: I'm always stuck in drawers
Jennifer Aniston doesn't always have to be perfect or successful.
This is what the Hollywood star made clear in an interview now.
"I am always stuck in drawers or I get stuck by the outside label, which have little to do with me and the reality."
"I myself have no desire to be always perfect and successful."
"Honestly, these things are more like me."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh at the fact that she is considered "Miss Perfect" as she explains in the current "cosmopolitan".
The actress prefers to spend her time at home, in front of the TV with loose Dutt and Mexican food, it is said in the magazine.
To White, she asked the question about the desire for children: "We women do not have to be married or have children to be perfect", says the Hollywood star.
In her new film "Mother's Day-love is not a child's play", Aniston is seen as a single mother of two sons.
The film runs with us from August 25th.
