"One generation protests" in Ethiopia, long an ally of the USA
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators calling for political change in Ethiopia came up against the government's violent resistance.
Witnesses say that tens of protesters were killed during the clashes with the police in the event of gunshots.
Is Ethiopia just collapsing?
In the last ten years, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the west with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months, protests against the government shook the country and expanded into more and more areas.
Last week, thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.
According to human rights organizations, the Government's response was ruthless.
Witnesses stated that policemen shot and killed tens of unarmed demonstrators.
Circulating videos about the protests, which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security people beat young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a hand-held against a wall.
The head of the UN Human Rights authority now demands an in-depth investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is appreciated by the West.
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats beyond the region, particularly in Somalia. Only a few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western aid.
Ethiopia's economy expanded at a remarkable pace.
Its infrastructure has improved drastically-there is a new commuter in the capital city of Addis Ababa.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy-human rights organizations have continually led the oppression of the government-the opposition in the country has been curtailed, with dissidents effectively silenced.
Many were sent to exile or to prison, killed or driven into the vast expanse of the desert.
But that could change.
"If you suppress people and have no other options other than protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia.
The entire youth protested.
One generation protests.
There are numerous complaints covering everything from land use to stranglehold on power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea; A struggle for this jagged, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, who have been more or less vanquished in recent years, can exploit the turbulence and re-arm themselves.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of pre-Hinköchelnsing under the surface now explode.
The first seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years have many Ethiopians been able to communicate through the social media, since cheaper smartphones have become more frequent and the Internet services have improved.
Even if the government is blocking access to Facebook and Twitter, which it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies that hide where they are staying.
Several young Ethiopians stated that they were thus gathered to protest.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
For eons, prospered Amharas, which come from Äthopiens predominantly Christian Highlands, in politics and economy, while they yielded the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in lowland lands.
But that also changes right now.
"We are about to coordinate under one umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The biggest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group who make up about 6 percent of the population and who are dominant in the military, secret services, trade and politics.
The third reason for the riots is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was the Prime Minister of Ethiopia until his death in an unpublicized disease in 2012 17 years.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.
Analysts say he was particularly adept at perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special envoys to deal with opponents and make them harmless.
"The current regime lacks this basic skill," said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively opaque reasons to take on the position of Mr Meles.
Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he does not enjoy the confidence of the Tigray controlled security services.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time that Ethiopia experienced such a riot was in 2005, after thousands of counter-elections were protested, according to analysts, apparently botched by the government and subsequently stolen.
During the ensuing raids, many protesters were killed, even though it was less than in the last few months and this time of unrest was passing relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter, and for their measurable progress in combating poverty.
But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the Ethiopian Government's internal grudge.
And it takes on a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters attacked in Gondar, a Amharic city, from Tigray-led businesses and the hatred towards the Tigray is becoming more common in social media.
Analysts say the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.
The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflüge over neighboring Somalia, even though she recently said that it has closed this base.
While the West is clearly willing to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile area.
"This," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin tightrope hike."
