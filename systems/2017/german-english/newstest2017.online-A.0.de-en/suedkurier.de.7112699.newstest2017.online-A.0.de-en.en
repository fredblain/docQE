Berlin/Schwerin: poll before country elections: SPD and CDU lose
In the forthcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (September 4) and Berlin (September 18), significant losses for the SPD and CDU government parties are looming.
This resulted in representative surveys of the research Institut INSA for the "Bild" newspaper (Friday).
While the red-black government coalition could continue to rule in the north, this is not possible according to the survey values in Berlin.
In both federal states, the SPD would be the strongest party and would have a good chance of continuing to be the head of government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD fell from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
According to the survey, the party would be just barely in front of the CDU, which could come back to 23 percent.
The third place is controversial between the left and the AfD.
The left would be 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the Landtag.
Despite slight losses of 6 percent (previously 8.7 percent), the green would returned to the Schwerin Landtag.
NPD and FDP would not be represented in the Landtag with 3 percent each.
According to the poll, the SPD of the Berlin House of Deputies would only be 23 percent (election 2011:28.3 percent).
The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
It was still behind the Greens with 19 percent (2011:17.6 percent), but ahead of the left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented in the House of Deputies for the first time at 14 percent.
With 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, but the Pirates would miss the entry in 2011.
