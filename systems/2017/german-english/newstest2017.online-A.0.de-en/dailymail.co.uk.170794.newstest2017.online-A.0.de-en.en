Traveler Ian Wright scrapes his tongue at the dirtiest places in Europe for a guide
A British traveller underwent a serious test of his immune system and gag reflex by licking some of Europe's dirtiest and most disgusting places.
The presenter and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk scraped his course on a euro bill, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a flush of a toilet, and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he was going to get into.
But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner strength", brought some surprising results to daylight.
The idea of licking the flush of a toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the development of intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Luckily, nothing left him licking more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.
Mr. Wright was known to test the resilience of his bowels by travelling through the world and eating peculiar and wonderful things.
From public railings at railway stations to washing-up knobs of toilets, the task was to definitely put his immune system under a sample
In the film he said: "As a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."
In the film he was able to live up to his reputation.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public restroom in Russia.
His trial smear showed a Luminometerzahl of over 4000 units.
In comparison, the Luminometerzahl of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to lick after their Luminometerzahl over 4000 units of fraud, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60
Mr Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom.
In the film he says: "This comes close to the worst I have smelt in a toilet."
There's nothing more filthy than that!
I'm not going to lick anything here because it's disgusting inside.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio gefilus containing lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the development of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
Valios senior Venice president for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We really wanted to offer the consumer something new.
Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.
We conducted crazy brainstorming that ended up saying, "Let's call Ian."
They claim that the interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context â€“ the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we have been able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.
I also think that the movie shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added, "Let me say so--I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I had instructed him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the movie."
Of course, there were things that made it easier to get Ian to lick her and others where it was quite difficult.
I'm glad we've taken some of these filthy treats on film. "
In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 percent of all interviewed lactic acid bacteria, in particular with the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58 percent said that they at least occasionally use products containing lactic acid bacteria.
