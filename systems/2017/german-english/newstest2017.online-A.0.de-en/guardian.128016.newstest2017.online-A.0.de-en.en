French court rejects offer about demolition of stores in the Jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an offer of the authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live, barriers.
At a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that that the state should be empowered to dismantle 72 provisional transactions in which persons within the camp were, from cigarettes to energy, sell, offer hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in makeshift restaurants.
The Calais prefecture argued that these places should be demolished, because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would entail a fire and sanitation risk.
Humanitarian groups shared with the court that the shops and restaurants were important because the free meals offered by the state-sponsored association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the warehouse.
They also stated that the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people carrying out the 72 provisional transactions, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were "absolutely comprehensible."
The judge Jean-François Molla said that the grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than just feed people who "live in extremely precarious conditions."
He said that the areas provide quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by low-tearing, was the camp's Jungle Book Kids ' Café, which is run by Gemeinnnützig and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the warehouse.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to uphold the kids ' café.
In a letter to the Guardian it was said that the closure "for these children would be a catastrophe of which the youngest are eight years old."
The two aid organizations help refugees and l'auberge of the migrant estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp had risen to over 9,000 men-the highest number to date-after a steep increase of newcomers during the summer.
