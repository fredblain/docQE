Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, a warrant has been issued against the former football star Hakan Sükür.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time after the coup attempt, an important football match will take place in Turkey.
Before the duel of the arch between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul around the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: "Business as usual" is announced.
Even when the state of emergency was imposed after the overthrow in July, the Government affirmed that the everyday life of ordinary citizens should not be affected.
But this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, which is blamed for the coup attempt.
It does not stop there before football.
Against the former star kicker Hakan Sükür, the prosecutor made a warrant.
Thus, the Sükür now living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
Sükür is to be followers of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is blamed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup attempt.
Although the state of emergency, which was initially imposed for 90 days, still applies until October, in fact it has almost no effect on the lives of most Turks.
The nightly "Democracy guards" in public places across the country have declared Erdogan to be finished on Wednesday.
The sport is-like the whole country-divided into followers and opponents of Erdogan.
Especially fans of the workers club Besiktas do not traditionally count among the friends of the President.
What unites the majority of Turks, however, in the face of dramatic experiences in history, is the strict rejection of military coups.
Even the fans agree-no matter if your heart beats for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
At the Cup Winner "Gala" it will be especially on Lukas Podolski arrive again.
The Cologne proved its sporting value in the past season: with 17 goals and nine originals in all competitions, the 31-year-old finished his first season as top of his club.
In the final against Fenerbahce he scored the 1:0 victory.
The newspaper "Fanatik" cheered him: "He was the best on the pitch."
He completed the season in an excellent way and secured the trophy for his team.
Thanks to "Poldi", the disappointing season for the record Master was a conciliatory conclusion.
After the preliminary round-K. O In the Champions League, the "Lions" also distinguished in the European League early.
In the Süper League, it was only enough to rank six.
The season was not good.
The trophy was the only way to win something.
"We have done that and that is the most important thing," said Podolski.
For master Besiktas the year was better.
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who, with 26 season hits as Süper-Lig top scorer, laid the basis for the 14th title.
That is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31-year-old.
In the process, the one contracted by the AC Florence and rented to Besiktas only Gomez after the coup attempt announced that he would not return due to the political situation in the country after his em-holiday.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he only has to say it", the magazine "kicker" quoted Clubchef Fikret Orman.
However, the striker would have to be willing to forgo about one third of his annual salary estimated at 7.5 million euros, Orman clarified: "We cannot pay his salary at Florence".
