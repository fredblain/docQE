Case of sickness: when does the organizer pay
Sick holidaymakers will only get money back after their trip if the cause of the disease is undoubtedly found in the hotel.
This is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have proven to exhibit the same symptoms.
In the negotiated case, a family on the second day of their TÃ¼rkeiurlaubs was severely affected by diarrhea and vomiting.
She spent almost the entire holiday in the room.
Their illness caused the holidaymaker to return to a defective sewage treatment plant, which supposedly polluted the sea water.
The family felt that the trip had been deficient-and complained to the organizer.
The plaintiffs had no success in court.
The sewage treatment plant was indeed defective.
But the organizer only learned about it shortly before the plaintiff's departure.
Until then, he had to assume that the sea water was in order.
He did not violate his information duties, he said.
Since no impurities have been found in the samples of the water.
The disease of several hotel guests-possibly due to contagion among themselves-belong to the general life risk.
Of 691 guests were only 38 ill.
