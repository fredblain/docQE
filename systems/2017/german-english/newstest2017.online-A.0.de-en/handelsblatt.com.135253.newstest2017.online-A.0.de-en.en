Despite Olympic disappointment: Martin remains fighting
Despite his disappointing appearance at the Olympic time trial, professional Tony Martin does not want to be caught.
"I keep a look at the World Cup, remain confident and fight further," wrote the 31-year-old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook.
He did not have an explanation for his miserable twelfth place at the sugar.
"I honestly find it hard to comment on yesterday's time trial," said Martin.
He had to analyse in peace the reasons for the debacle.
At the world Championship in October in Qatar, Martin was really trying to fight for the title.
"I will look at everything that we have changed in recent times."
"This is also my position", wrote the three-time world champion, who lost on Wednesday on the 54.5 km more than three minutes to the Olympic champion Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland).
