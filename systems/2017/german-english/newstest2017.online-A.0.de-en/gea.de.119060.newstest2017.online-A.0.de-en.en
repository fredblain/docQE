B27-Rehabilitation: restaurants suffering from blocking
There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is being rehabilitated.
For those responsible for the construction work, which starts at 5.30 a.m. and ends at around 8pm, there is praise everywhere.
"They made it all pretty smart," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the Jet gas station.
This is a superteam.
There is no delay either.
The construction site was scheduled to be moved south at the beginning of the week, until the end of October everything should be ready.
It is also praised for the people who are responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to setting up makeshift driveways.
Since the construction site has migrated to the south on Monday and also the blocking of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen has been lifted and thus the connection to Rottenburg again exists, the traffic situation within the village has relaxed.
The citizens can now travel from Ofterdingen from the B 27 again on both sides.
The Dodge traffic through the place seems to go back.
"There were sometimes considerable complaints", says the deputy chief executive officer Florian King, who was responsible for the transport management of the renovation.
The residents of Bach's street, Stone Laughing Street, Hafnerstraße and pond rain had to contend with more traffic noise, because many creeping paths were searching and more familiar to their navi than the signposting.
Which resulted in some trucks being frayed in residential areas.
Since the speed limits were not adhered to, the municipality also urged the measuring vehicle of Mössingen.
"There were considerable transgressions," said King, who made himself aware of the situation on the spot.
Two to three per minute have been flashed.
The fastest was 77 hours in the speed 30 zone.
Since the construction site has moved on, it has become quieter.
For the business people at the B 27, it is only a small consolation that the street is now open to customers from Rottenburg.
Business people don't like to look into the cards.
But that the B 27 remediation has led to sales slumps, everyone who is asked can be looked through.
However, some are more and some are less affected.
Those who have less to do with the "end customer", i.e. produced for other companies, for whom the renovation has hardly followed.
Thomas Sulz also speaks of a "maximum slight decline" at the Maier dealership, but also admits that "the running clientele is missing".
The most heavily battered are the local along the road.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steak House, formerly crown, finds clear words.
This is already threatening existence.
Not only him, but all the restaurants have hit it "hard".
Customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.
We must be happy about every euro turnover.
He quantifies the sales losses to "well over 50 percent".
The rehabilitation of the roads had "thrown back" by two years.
He had to dismiss half of his employees.
If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, the policy would have reacted differently.
Instead, government president Jörg Schmidt responded to a request from Göhner, whether there could be a financial compensation, with the hint replied, the restaurant will benefit from the benefits of the location on the B 27. Now, it must also bear the disadvantages that arise from the renovation.
Göhner knows of other counties, where such a thing was handled more generously.
In all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.
After all, the family business has been located here since 1715, he refers to the long history.
He can understand that other regulars are now less likely to stop by because of the complicated traffic management.
If you can't go here, it's nice to be somewhere else.
Göhner has no doubts that his regular clientele will come back after the end of the renovation work.
Despite the crises with BSE and avian flu, Göhner considers the impact of the B 27 construction work on its clientele for the biggest crisis that its restaurant has experienced in its long history.
Six months of construction work, that's already brutal.
