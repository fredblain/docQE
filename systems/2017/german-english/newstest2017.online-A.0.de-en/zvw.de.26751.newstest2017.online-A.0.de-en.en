Schorndorf: Burglar with helicopter wanted
The police helicopter flew different areas for about an hour-unsuccessful.
Two unknown men were forcibly invaded in an apartment in a multi-family house in the Lime tree on Friday morning at 8:50 a.m.
The occupant surprised the two and struck the fiends in flight.
The two men were about 1.65 to 1.70 meters tall, well masked, wore both jeans and black hooded sweaters.
They fled towards the city centre.
The police set up several patrol crews and a police helicopter for the manhunt.
The manhunt went without success.
Perhaps the unknown fell before the deed near the apartment or in their flight.
