Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and proclaim an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gilded Hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot resist the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most.
There was a handshake, yes.
But Putin's smile worked-and he barely radiated warmth, even for his restrained relationships.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "dear friend" Putin-according to a report, whole five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old levels before the crisis, but would even improve.
The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have acted as if something bad had never happened.
His enthusiasm seemed rather to suggest the opposite.
But a sustainable coolness that Putin radiated showed that the head of state of Russia had forgotten nothing.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: The launch of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border by Turkey.
Moscow's reaction at the time was furiously.
Putin shared and accused Ankara of having fallen into Russia's back.
The offense was even greater, as it was committed by a supposed friend.
Rebuilding the trust will be difficult, if not impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media conducted a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.
Most seriously, the accusations of senior officials were that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from the illicit trade in Syria in areas controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He vehemently denied this.
But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan, whom he wanted to hear.
Russia could be a kind of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a truce are clearly obvious.
Erdogan needs first and foremost all the friends he can get after he has been removed from his office in a failed coup last month.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard-in particular the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has decreased by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.
They count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean.
This week, the state television forecasts cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish imports are allowed again.
A report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows: "Tourists there long, tomatoes here long."
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West as it considers its reaction to the attempted takeover as a weak answer.
In addition, there is the continuing resentment of the snail speed of the EU accession negotiations and Putin-eager to benefit from the cool atmosphere and to reduce Turkey's relationship with the west.
The Russian head of state, in Ankara, certainly won a bonus that he demanded support for the elected authorities after the attempted coup d'Ã©tat.
This is a matter of course for Moscow, which has itself a deep-seated fear of regime change.
The summit in this splendid palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portray, as an analyst once described, "Alliance of Outsiders": two countries that are in violation of the West and feel badly treated and now ally.
Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It might be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks both presidents said at the press conference that they had not even touched the subject.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize it.
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.
But after months of open hostilities-and given the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey fired the Russian fighter jet-it is certainly better that the two heads of state will at least talk again.
