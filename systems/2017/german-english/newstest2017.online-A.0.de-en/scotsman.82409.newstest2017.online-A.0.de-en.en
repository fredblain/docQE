Scot Callum Skinner storms home when Brits get gold for cycling
Scotland's Callum Skinner raced to fame last night in the men's team sprint at the velodrome in Rio, when the British team defended the title of London 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took on the anchor role that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made his own. The young made the legend proud when he stormed home to win a victory from the favourites of New Zealand.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy clinched the fifth of six Olympic gold.
They repeated the trick after they took a modest sixth place in March at the rail World Championships in London despite the resignation of Hoys.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie staff.
They did this in time as Hindes showed up.
Hoys Retirement created a gap that Kian 'emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man they stayed in when they saw potential in the Scots that has now unfolded.
Hindes, Kenny-who won with Hoy four years ago and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
Hindes was barely back after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner kept it.
A change of strategy made a large part of the transformation, in which Hindes drove in a higher gear to slow him down and to allow Kenny and, above all, Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy watched from his position as BBC expert and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they stepped on the podium.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the finals and defeated the world champions.
It was just amazing.
There is no better way to win this.
After the triumph of 2012 on the side of Kenny and Hoys, Hindes admitted that he deliberately fell on the track after a weak start.
He later withdrew this statement and there was no opposition from England's rivals.
With such an outstanding victory, there was no such problem this time.
Hindes said: "It feels with all the GB flags in the grandstand like London."
We've been together as a team in the last three months.
We have come so badly from so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win again at the Olympics.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation that won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London.
If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days in the velodrome.
With the form Kennys it is in the realm of possible that he reiterates Hoys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.
That would be for Kenny-who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, which was also born on 23 March (an apparently holy date for British sport; The day also included Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister)-a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.
That would be the same for Hoy.
Kenny is next in the sprint, which starts today and will go on for three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I just enjoy this for the moment."
The team event is always best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels a little lonely to win alone.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."
It was the only medal contest of the day, but there was more good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified for the fastest performance in the four-kilometer race.
They arrived at the destination in 3:51,942.
The world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was at 3:51,659.
The first and final round (22.42) are held today on the second day of the Wettbewers, where Wiggins will certainly be in the spotlight.
He had argued with the Commissioner before the qualification yesterday, when he called him officials to measure his body size.
In the corresponding women's competition, which will be continued and finished tomorrow, advanced Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in Weltrekordszeit in 4:13,260.
The GB team relies on its strong track team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to bring a bevy of medals.
After a truly exceptional portrayal of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down.
Dramas played out in the background, according to the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid sexism and bullying accusations as well as retiring from greats such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, if you look at the first evening of the competition in the velodrome, it looks as if the now legendary call GBS, which has reached its climax at the perfect moment, can be repeated again.
