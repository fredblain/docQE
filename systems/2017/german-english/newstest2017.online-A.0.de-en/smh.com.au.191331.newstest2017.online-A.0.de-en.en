Donald Trump election campaign accused after employees allegedly pulled gun
NEW York: Donald Trump's campaign has been accused of alleged inaction after it was told that its campaign leader for North Carolina in February had a firearm on an employee while they were on a jeep in February.
The incident is described in a indictment filed on Wednesday in the Charlotte court by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in this state.
Bordini stated that he had waited for months for the matter to be settled internally before realizing that "this would not happen."
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, "pulled a pistol, put his right forefinger on the trigger, and rammed the barrel into Vincent's knee," Bordini in his indictment.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign management, Bordini noted that at least four other people had already made the same experience with Phillip, he stated in the indictment.
"Weapons don't have to be fired to inflict damage," Bordini said.
The indictment comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate triggered a riot, when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment people" firearms owners and gun friends should take action in case his rival Hillary Clinton should be elected and appoint judges.
Trump's campaign made it clear that the media had torn his words out of context and that he would not incite violence.
Bordinis complaint requires compensation from the campaign for the violation of the duty of care and Philip for bodily injury and permanent psychological damage.
Trump's press spokeswoman Hope Hicks was unable to reach for an opinion.
Attempts to contact Philip failed as well.
WCCB, a local news channel in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer a campaign member.
He did not respond to calls from his consulting firm, innovative consulting services.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has so far led a controversial campaign.
The procedure is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump for President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
