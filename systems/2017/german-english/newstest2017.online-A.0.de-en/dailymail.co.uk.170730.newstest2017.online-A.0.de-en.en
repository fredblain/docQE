Buyer in Primark outraged about woman who tried in the middle of the business shamelessly underwear
The shoppers didn't know where to look when a woman took her clothes out in the middle of a Primark to try out her underwear.
To aggravate the situation, she patterned how she looked in it, pulled it out and put it back on the shelf.
She continued to rummage and tried four pairs of underpants in a shop at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone.

A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear, "she relocated and left the shop without buying anything."
She said, "People couldn't believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the sales area she took a pair of underpants from the delivery, pulled out her own pantyhose and trousers and tried them.
"She didn't even try to find a more discreet place to do it-she just stood there, naughty like Oskar."
"Everyone stared when they took off the underpants, which they obviously didn't like, since they put them back on the shelves."
She repeated the same with three more underpants, before finally decided that she liked nothing, again attracted herself and outed.
"She didn't seem to mind that she was watching someone--or thinking about the person who might be buying the underpants she had tried."
Ms. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said, "how disgusting to think that someone would take home underwear with another person and who were not washed."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added, "As I have heard, the employees have tried to pull the garments out of the sale after they went-which is just as good."
"I'd hate to go home with a new pair of underpants and find out that another woman was wearing them and took them out again and they weren't washed."
A spokesman for Primark said: "Primark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday, August 9th in our branch in Folkestone."
All eligible products were drawn from the sale.
