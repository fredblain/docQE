Police: 3 victims in serial killer case when listening to music in the car shot
According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot, killed in one of the deadliest attacks in a decade in the first serial killer case of Phoenix, while chatting in the car and listening to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on June 12, while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said.
The perpetrator fired eight shots from a handgun while he was standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle that is read in the report.
The police said that the triple homicide did not seem to be the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900, which were owned by one of the adult victims.
The police spokesman for Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shootout led the investigators to take a closer look at whether she was connected with four previous attacks.
In total, in Hispanic residential areas, seven people were killed and two injured in nine attacks within four months.
"It happens in a residential area in front of a house," Howard shared the KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, at the beginning of the month.
It is believed that the suspect used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to reveal the evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were linked and committed by the same murderer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to her injuries and died later.
Liner, 31, and Ellis ' daughter Maleah died on site.
A witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shootout, which aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial killer.
Investigators found cartridge sleeves and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment.
