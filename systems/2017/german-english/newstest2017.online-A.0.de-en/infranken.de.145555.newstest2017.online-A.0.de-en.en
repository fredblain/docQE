The association is considered to be "Bavaria's most exemplary".
A small Franconian drinking water Association as a model for the large water producers.
So it was said some time ago in the original sound in a contribution of the Bavarian Broadcasting.
Shortly thereafter, the Water Forum of the Government of under Franconia acknowledged the purpose of the association.
The work of the Veitensteingruppe is considered to be exemplary.
Behind all this stands Rupert Göller, who was 31 years in the purpose of association staff, 28 years as managing director.

The Drinking Water Association The Veitensteingruppe, based in Kottendorf, municipality of Brunn, annually promotes about 150000 cubic meters of water and supplies 32 places and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants.
Member municipalities are the municipalities of Kirch Lauter, Breitkopf, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the town.
For other towns and municipalities there are water supply.
The current chairman, Mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was hired as a water warden in 1985 and was appointed managing Director of the Purpose Association in 1988.
"His tasks have been very diverse and they ranged from Wasserleitungsbau and maintenance work to office and organisational activities, the preparation of budgets, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations at weekends," said the chairman.
As outstanding events, she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new Wells (1994), land purchases in the area of the new Wells (1998) and compensation for farmers, the refurbishment of the High Reservoirs (1999), the repurchase of a central computer control (2004) and the partial renewal of water pipes.
There has been no standstill and there have always been new additions, because water is life and drinking water is the most important foodstuff.
In her eulogy she praised Göllers loyal, reliable and correct service for over 31 years.
He has used his passion for his water association and he has lived the water association as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of Veitensteingruppe for nitrate reduction in front of the water Forum of the District under Franconia.
He received a great deal of recognition and praise for this.
Rupert Göller, on his part, praised Water wart Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.
He's the best water wart and he was a loyal squire.
Together we were an unbeatable team.
As a high point from his point of view he described the well-being and the restructuring of the purpose Association.
The biggest challenge and the most difficult bet were the pipe at the high reservoir at Kirch Lauter on a 3rd January.
Here, at minus 17 degrees, the whole night had to work, so that the localities could be supplied with water.
It was also possible to maintain the supply of the Brunn only, because the high tank of Pettstadt was filled with hoses.
The management of the drinking water zweckverbandes was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauterbrunnen, who succeeded Rupert Göller.
