Nagold: Fun and games at summer time
Eight beautiful and joyful days spent the children and adolescents of the Social Pedagogical Day Group/social group work of the Child Protection Federation Nagold with their carers on their summer leisure in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
In the quietly located leisure home of Hardtwäldle, the cheerful group was quartered during the first school Ferienwoche.
Several full-day excursions were on the agenda.
On the one, it went after boards with the visit of the petting zoo.
On the other to Maulbronn, where there was a special children's Guide in the world famous monastery.
The third excursion led to Pforzheim.
In the Celtic Museum in Hochdorf, the group learned a lot about the daily life and food of the Celts.
On the hot days the group amused themselves at the Tiefensee in Maulbronn, which invited to jump, swim and splash.
Culinary treats were provided to children and carers with their own prepared body foods such as the sour noodles, the AU, Iselshauser-Bloff, the English breakfast and the Tübingen bolognese.
In workshops was batiked, beautiful jewels made of beads and stones created or made of wood a Roman-mill game.
Other highlights of leisure were fishing in a nearby pond, the evenings by the fire and the final "colorful evening".
On the day of homeward The Sun laughed and the children and adolescents returned home happily.
