Turkey: Kurdish community expects mass exodus
"Who does not adapt and praises Erdogan, sits on packed suitcases," says the chairman of the G端len-near foundation dialogue and World, Edwin Karakoyun.
The Kurdish community of Germany expects in the short term with tens of thousands of protection seekers fleeing from Turkey to Germany.
In the medium term, it could even become "a few hundred thousand", believes the association chairman Ali Toprak.
Due to the harsh approach of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass exodus to Germany.
"In the short term, I reckon with tens of thousands, in the medium term, with a few hundred thousand protection seekers from Turkey in Germany, when the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," says the association chairman Ali Toprak of the "world" of Friday.
Because the government had already covered Kurdish strongholds with punitive actions months ago, 500,000 Kurds were fleeing within Turkey.
After the thwarted coup, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks would still be added.
Many will want to start anew in Europe if they are further suppressed in Turkey.
"It cannot be that a state that is self-absorbing refugees produces refugees in their own country," said Toprak.
The head of the association lamented the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in Alevi cities.
This is what Erdogan wants to increase the pressure on the remaining Kurds to leave.
"They are the last large minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been exterminated or expelled in the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member.
The head of the association called for the Federal government to "position itself as sharply as Austria against Erdogan and its followers".
A "witch hunt" against Erdogan critics is also taking place in Germany.
I am not feeling safe in Germany for the first time in recent months.
The German branch of the G端len movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and opposition.
The branding as a G端len pendant destroys the professional existence of teachers and other academics.
"Who does not adapt and praises Erdogan, sits on packed suitcases, by the way also the kemaists and secular," said Edwin Karakoyun, chairman of the G端len-near foundation dialogue and education, the "world".
As reported by the newspaper citing figures from the Federal Ministry, the Turks, before the coup, presented the largest group of asylum-seekers recognised in Germany for political persecution.
By the deadline of 30 June, this was 11,386 people and thus almost 29 per cent of all recognised as entitled to Asylum (39,625).
In this survey, there is no escaping from war, poverty or hopelessness.
The right to asylum according to the Basic Law is exclusively political, i.e. from the state side, individually persecuted.
