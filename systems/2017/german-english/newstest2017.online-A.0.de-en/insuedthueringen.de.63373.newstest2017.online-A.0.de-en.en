The soprano Anna Netrebko goes openly with the autism of her son Tiago-and turns to other affected parents: "You must have the courage to talk about it."
"Medicine has made great strides," said the 44-year-old of the Italian newspaper "Corriere della Sera".
When the disease was discovered by her son, she believed she must die.
However, the eight-year-old Tiago has come forward and is now learning privately in New York, where the best therapists are.
"To give an example: if I ask him something that is two years back when I sang at the Scala in Milan, he remembers nothing," said Netrebko.
But he is the happiest man on Earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebkos connection with the bass baritone Erwin Scrap.
She is now married to the tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
