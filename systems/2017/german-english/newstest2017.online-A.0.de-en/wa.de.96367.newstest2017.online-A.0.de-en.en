Olympia 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
Caught: Due to a positive doping test, weightlifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland in Rio can not start.
Rio DE JANEIRO-The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.
A caught athlete almost won a medal.
Before the seventh day of the competition, the first official doping cases became known as the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-metre obstacle runner Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were positively tested and excluded in Brazil-immediately before the start of the already critically eyed athletics competitions, these news come to the untimely.
At Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, which was used as a masking agent for doping substances, had already been proven last Sunday.
The International sports Court CAs confirmed their exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon.
On Sunday the 18-year-old had occupied fourth place in the final over 100 m butterfly, only by 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.
On Friday, Chen would have participated in the rounds over 50 m freestyle.
Chen has requested the opening of the B-probe and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
The National Association takes the matter "very seriously and demands full cooperation in the investigations", Xinhua quoted from a communication: "We will cooperate with the International Sports Court CAs and will accept the verdict".
For the first time in history, the IOC is no longer responsible for sanctioning athletes with positive cases.
Also the night of Rio leaked the news about the positive sample at Danekowa, the 33-year-old went into the offensive.
"I had three Tests, all negative, and my fourth Test was positive", this was "an incredible shock," she told the Bulgarian TV channel BNT.
She was innocent, "the only explanation could be dietary supplements," explained the athlete.
According to the report, the banned substance should be the blood doping agent EPO.
Danekowa was temporarily suspended, according to BNT, the B-sample should have been positive as well.
Bulgaria's Prime Minister, Boyko Borisov, immediately spoke to the athlete with criticism.
"I do not understand why the sportsmen do not draw the right conclusions," he said: "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded".
For example, all weightlifters from the chronically doping nation must not participate in Rio.
On Friday the case "Adrian Zielinski" was also known, the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested like his brother Tomasz three days previously positive on the anabolic steroid nandrolone.
Both deny the intake, but both are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg.
Before the start of the light athletes, the case of Danekowa is another serious blow to the reputation of the entire sport.
The IAAF World Association had banned the entire Russian team from launching, except for one exception due to systematic doping, even the runner nation Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio.
In the sport of swimming, the earlier mispasses in China had also caused fierce clashes between the athletes.
The Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang harshly.
"Sun Yang pees purple."
"When I see the podium over 200 m freestyle, I want to surrender," said Lacourt on the French radio.
Sun was also at the heart of an engagement with Australian Mack Horton.
"I have no time and no respect for doping fraudsters," said this.
Sun had been tested positively for the stimulant Trimetazidin at the Chinese championships in 2014, but only had to sit for a three-month ban.
