City Council decides unanimously: no new kiosk on St. Goarer Rhine
Normally, the St. Goarer investment projects by traders with kiss-the retail trade in the centre of the city is considered to be significantly expanded.
However, the city council now unanimously rejected the request for the new construction of a kiosk on the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine balcony under construction.
"Basically we welcome new traders, but at this location in an exposed position on the Rhine, this kiosk does not fit", explained Michael Hubrath for the CDU group.
