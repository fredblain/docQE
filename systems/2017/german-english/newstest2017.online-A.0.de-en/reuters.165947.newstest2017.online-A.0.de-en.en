Troops supported by the United States say they have recaptured full control of Manbij from the Islamic State.
Troops supported by the US have recaptured complete control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border, after the last is-fighter in the city left this, said a group spokesman on Friday.
The Democratic forces of Syria (DKS) are combing the city after the exodus of the remaining group of combatants who have buried themselves within the city.
They have liberated over 2000 civilians who were held hostage by the combatants, Sharfan Darwish of the DKs Allied MANBIJ Military council, Reuters.
"The city is now under perfect control, but we are doing cleanup," he told Reuters.
