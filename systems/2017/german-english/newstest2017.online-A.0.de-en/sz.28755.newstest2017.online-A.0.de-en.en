Nokia 9000 Communicator: the first smartphone
E-mail and Internet in slow motion: The Nokia Communicator came to market 20 years ago.
The successors dominate the world today-its manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed nearly half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iphone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it was not good in the hand either.
On the contrary, it was quite clunky.
The built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which would be enough today for about two high resolution selfies.
An iphone is now delivered at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" arrived exactly 20 years ago, on August 15th, 1996, in the shops-and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the equipment on the Internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the internet age.
Twenty years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair CeBIT in Hanover as "office in the West pocket-sized".
In fact, the new mobile phone could be used for then standards a lot: SMS and emails could be sent and received, even by fax the Communicator was reachable.
Even access to Web pages was possible via HTML browser, albeit excruciatingly slow.
A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the phone could be opened up similar to a laptop.
Then found a small keyboard and a black and white screen.
The price was quite proud: 2700 D-mark, i.e. about 1400 euros.
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.
No one could have guessed in August 1996 that the Communicator would be the beginning of the smartphone era.
Everything has changed since then.
The smart phones are a success story, albeit not for Nokia.
The Finns ' cell phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster, was eventually sold to Microsoft and settled.
Today the market is dominated by vendors who all came much later than Nokia.
Be online anytime and anywhere, this is today for a lot of people everyday.
In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.
About 1.4 billion units were sold, with Samsung and Apple alone 555 million.
Worldwide sales of the equipment are around 400 billion euros.
In addition, there are the well-running businesses of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies.
A whole industry has been created around the smartphone.
The decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only in early 2007, then Apple boss Steve Jobs announced on the Mac world the introduction of the iphone.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an internet communicator, all by touch screen easy to use.
The triumph of Apple began, even today, the iphone is the group's most important product.
Nokia, Motorola and BlackBerry, who dominated the market, had a look.
They eventually disappeared, BlackBerry has to fight.
The saying now have Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung.
The smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention.
On average, every German now looks to his mobile phone 88 times a day.
"We all have to learn how to put the smartphone to the point," said Janina Ball, who is in charge of the Siemens Board of Management for personnel.
Permanent accessibility is now regarded as a curse and a blessing.
