Community, mind, health: singing does seniors well
The singing has accompanied Ursel tipping her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in the teaching studies she took the music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.
"Singing moves me--emotionally and physically," she describes.
After a rehearsal she feels balanced, cheerful and overall more lively, she says.
By the way she does something good for her health and her mind.
After all, singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Field of the German senior League.
Most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describes field.
Through regular co-existence, seniors can establish and maintain social contacts.
Social and family structures often dissolve in old age, and a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
This experience has also made Ursel tilt in her chorus: "To speak out and organize, to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other-a chorus is a very special form of being together".
Singing can be strenuous in a positive sense, says field.
For this, seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.
Those who regularly demand their lungs will not be able to get out of breath in everyday life.
Even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an ideal hobby.
For older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Association of the senior organizations.
In the older generations, joint singing had a much higher importance, it was part of everyday life, both in school and in leisure, she explains.
Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people arouses many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.
Through lyrics and especially melodies, even dementia-stricken people are reminding themselves of long-standing events.
When singing, the head is also required to perform a special performance, explains Lenz.
At the same time focus on one's own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers-this is a great cognitive challenge.
Especially older people who live alone are practicing not only to concentrate on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition you learn from singing in the choir, says field.
An enthusiastic audience is a great compliment.
Self-esteem is also growing as a result of singing in the choir.
To show oneself: if I practice for a long time, I will be better and grow beyond myself-this experience strengthens.
Good reasons to start singing are enough.
If you want to try out a new hobby, you should not hesitate-even if he thinks you have little talent, Lenz advises.
You do not sing alone-with 50 singing people, who hears when a sound goes wrong?
In search of the right offer, seniors have different options, says field.
If someone from the known Circle sings in a senior choir, you can simply join.
Many cities also offer views of the choirs in the surrounding area.
Anyone wishing to sing in a church choir can directly contact the church or the church's head.
Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.
Those who do not have access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbors for help with internet research.
If you want to sing, be sure to join a choir, advise field.
Singing is good for the soul and has something liberating-that applies to all ages.
