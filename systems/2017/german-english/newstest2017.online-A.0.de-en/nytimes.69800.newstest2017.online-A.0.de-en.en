In the midst of the rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline
Wherever you are, whatever the time, it's the Olympic Games.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constantly and inevitably, a frenzied relay race between competition and aspirations.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is handed from the crossbow to the swimmer to the gymnast to the triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the coffee queue, without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the quarrel between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who for the first time in the Olympic Games and a swarm of women with dimples, could well have been among these well known names sent to prime time, built by sponsors and well-being TV advertising, if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even fencer.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic trampoline gymnastics.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event.
Further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally accepted: Aerial pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always have the breast swimming and may it reign for a long time.
But if I could humbly make arguments for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it debuted in Sydney, it has been so sparsely perceived for the last 16 years that many who, I had questioned, did not know that it is an Olympic sport at all.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the USA sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping and had an athlete who made it to the finals by 2012.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
The trampoline jumping has a certain outsider charm, partly because it sounds more fitting for the unenlightened ear for a clown school than the one for the Olympic Games.
At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a earthbound enthusiast.
It has humorous potential-the kartoonhafte tremor of its never-ending lingers impact-but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that it essentially unites.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as "springboard."
Aspiring winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a series of falling movements (turning, pikes and somersaults) before they land on their feet.
According to the official Olympia programme, they are rated according to their execution, difficulty and "flight time".
Thirty athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.
Medal hopefuls must go further in their pursuit of gold, faster, upward and over, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground.
They not only hunt the finish line or the exit wall, but also a further scornful goal in television broadcasting: those of the world or the Olympic record.
The purposeful pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical-and it is enough to even stir a spectator to tears.
But it is also what I perceive as a bit tiring even when watching these games.
The trampoline offers a respite.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is above.
Moving forward is not the goal.
He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless as an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.
Here too there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, no bulging in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.
It is as Zen as the competition in the Olympic Games can only be.
The qualification and final round of women will be held on Friday afternoon, streaming at 13.00 Eastern time; The men on Saturday, also at 13.00.
NBC will broadcast the finals as part of a Nachmittagblocks on both days from 14.00.
In the midst of the Olympia mania you promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in the general turmoil.
If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the Angaffen and the objectification of male athletes-as the male US gymnasts have recently suggested according to the Wall Street Journal-then Mr. Dooley expects his air-ringing, new fan base.
