Destination plates: Who actually buys vinyl records?
Lonely men of Middle Ages love plates.
Before you rush to the commentary to sow it under the pseudonym NichtAlleEinsamenMÃ¤nnerMittlerenAlters with harsh insults, this statement derives from current data.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed Wiederaufstehung of vinyl records is not due to a boom in millennials, which wants to welcome the news of physical objects, but rather to the mid-life nostalgia.
Those who recently bought a record are most likely to be aged between 45 and 54.
In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group.
It is also not a horde of hobby collectors-it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers tend to keep their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).
But do the results of YouGov agree?
If this blog were a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I was walking in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest grey suit and gestuliereing wildly before I stood, holding my hands and saying something decisive like, "So, let's take a closer look at it."
So, let's take a look at it.
Even though the heart of Soho is slowly filling up with its charm losing hotels, restaurants and offices now the buildings in which once independent sellers were established-there is still a handful of fantastic record shops.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, in which I am in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind through observation.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I from sister Ray (data count: Two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckles Records (data number: Eight middle-aged men, a woman, presumably around 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
"I guess so," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.
These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by email, I did not follow him home), dress the walls of his living room.
The reason he owns such a significant number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy plates that he could not afford when they appeared and again buy items he sold when he was young and broke.
"Many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. Things I was probably a little too young to buy, "he says.
He agrees that those who buy plates are rather introverted and happy to spend time alone, adding: "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.
That's my truck.
GMT, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets will apply to the YouGov profile.
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people affected by the MEDIENHPE, people who have heard about the comeback and are forced to buy back their old records.
Of the conversations I led, people usually got rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again, "he says.
This would explain the boom of followers of the record revival of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional importance of plates?
It only takes a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that record shops provide a soothing community of minded people.
According to GMT, some of the older customers took offense to the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record covers, from objects that evoke happy youth memories.
"I think sometimes it may be filling a void or owning material possessions as a kind of consolation," says GMT.
It's like a collector and I think it's like that for a lot of people.
It's an easy way to deal mentally.
"We are like your social workers!" an employee flutes from a stack of plates.
A survey by the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not have a turntable.
At this point in the news report, I would probably look very anxious as I leaf through a pile of bossa nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the universe (data number: Three middle-aged men), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revival.
"Someone just came in here recently and said," I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead record so I can put it on the shelf, "he says.
This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.
More produktlastig, less musiklastig.
We have people who say, "I don't have a turntable."
These are younger people, not elders, who come in slowly.
Fopp, which has devoted almost a whole floor to the records, has a more colourful audience than I go.
There are couples around the 70, tourists who take photos, Teenagejungs and middle-aged women.
Even though the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops-Wild Beast's newest synthesizer and sexbepackter pop instead of experimental jazz roars out of the loudspeakers-it is good to see such diversity among the customers.
None of them looks very lonely, but nagging mental trauma is hard to detect if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been running around for a few minutes and is looking at the variety of plates for sale.
It's more of a window shopping than a big shopping.
She doesn't deserve much, so collecting records is not a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It is easy to listen to music from a computer or other way, but the beauty of plates is... "She drives with a loving sigh.
I don't know how to explain it-it's really unique.
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I seem to be patterning the jeans hot pants, I'm watching a group of young teenage girls who are grouping around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter think about buying a Crosley turntable.
To the left is a staircase, a wall full of plates by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: A mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.
No one looks at them-perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far up that it is impossible to touch them.
It is pure "record art".
But considering that any attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and some customers could send into the deep sohos for more, there is nothing to complain about.
It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one who spends most on luxury items such as slabs.
Even though my research has shown that the results of YouGov are correct, they, at least in record stores in Soho, do not take into account the large number of female collectors and record lovers who exist in reality, record shops and online forums.
These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.
They certainly do not spend their Thursday morning strolling through the record shops of Berwick Street and leafing through slabs, while avoiding the glaring gaze of an uncanny, 30-year-old false moderator who rises above the shoulders of middle-aged men.
