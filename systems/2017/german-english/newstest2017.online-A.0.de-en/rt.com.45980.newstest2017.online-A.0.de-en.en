Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $158 million.
The trade boom was achieved through deliveries of machinery, land vehicles and weapons, "said the ambassador.
Dzhagaryan goes out for this year from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia.
Last year, the Russian foreign representation issued around 35,000 visas, primarily travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
Iran also reached the top 20 of the countries, as regards the number of tourists in Russia.
