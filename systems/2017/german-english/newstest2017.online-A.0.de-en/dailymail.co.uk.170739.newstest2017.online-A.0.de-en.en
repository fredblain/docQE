How to protect yourself from weapon attacks with Krav Maga
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to use armed robbers to close the distance.
Regardless of whether you are approaching them from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the Spit for your robber.
If you approach them from behind, you should turn around first so that you can see your assailant and "go out of the line of fire," says Mizrachi.
Then grasp the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder before hitting the face with your free elbow.
Then strike him with his knee in the groin and twist her, while the attacker curvess with pain, the weapon from his hands. Hit him with the barrel in the face and move backwards while you point the gun at him.
In the case of attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar-move your body out of the firing line, grab the gun and twist it so the attacker can't shoot.
At the same time, shift the weight to the weapon and hit the attacker's chest, then twist the weapon out of its grip before moving backward and aligning the weapon.
Sounds difficult?
Watch the video to see exactly how it mizrachis.
But remember, when you're robbed, it's safest to hand over your money-unless you are a Krav Maga Grandmaster.
