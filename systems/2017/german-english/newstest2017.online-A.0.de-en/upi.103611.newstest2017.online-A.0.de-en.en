Nordesee√∂larbeiter take up talks again, put strike out
The labour disputes regarding remuneration for oil workers are being suspended, while all parties to the conflict are at the table for a new round of talks, said negotiators.
Strikes against the oil field Service provider Wood Group were sporadically carried out on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group as well as the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to relaunch the settlement process of the current dispute," it says in a common statement.
We will be holding a few full-day sessions in the next few weeks that will start early next year to tackle the problems anew.
The unions said that their last strike, which is the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group has cut the rates of its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent this year due to negative market pressure.
The company's rate reduction follows a 10 percent drop for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said that additional cutbacks give the company the space needed to get through the market downturn.
Shell has released for its part thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its business activities as a result of its Megazusammenschlusses with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure as a result of lower crude oil prices, an economic situation that has intensified as a result of the British decision to leave the European Union in June.
The Scottish Member of Parliament Dave Anderson met with workers ' leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes that have taken place in the North Sea since a generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and throughout the country, we need an economy that works for many and not just for a few," he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion in expenditure on new projects in the North Sea is expected to average around $7 billion in the last five years.
