This was the moment when frightened tourists started to panic after a jet flying down a full beach.
Dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft flew almost close to the sun worshippers on the beach section in Aveiro in the north of Portugal.
The holidaymakers jumped in when they understandably began to worry about the noise of jet engines without first seeing what was going on in the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many holidaymakers who posted videos about the dramatic fly-by in the social media, said: "It really flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it was crashing."
Nuno Arroja added, "I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was falling down on me."

The Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot of the P-3c Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to fly so deep that this was the only way to recognize them.
The spokesman said that the jet flew a little deeper than usual due to the poor visibility of the nearby area fires, but the air forces insisted that safety was at no time at risk.
Land fires have destroyed these summer parts of the Portuguese mainland, where four people also died on the island of Madeira.
