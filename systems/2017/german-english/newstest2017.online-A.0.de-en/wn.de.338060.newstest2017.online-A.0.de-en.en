De Maizière said that after the violence perpetrated by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were worried about further attacks.
The State must act prudently and resolutely at the same time to respond to terrorist threats.
Surely, our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
We will not grant this triumph to the terrorists.
However, if offenders had to leave the country sooner, the security and strength also increased the public's consent to the refugee policy.
De Maizière wants to achieve the implementation of the proposals until the federal election of 2017.
He also announced a further personnel strengthening of the security forces, namely "in a medium four-digit order over several years".
Sympathy advertising for terrorism must again be punished.
Video surveillance is to be improved, the gun law is amended so that, above all, the purchase of weapons on the internet is complicated.
The last much discussed silence obligation for doctors is to be maintained according to de maizières words.
However, in a dialogue with the medical profession, he wants to find solutions to how to reduce the vulnerability of citizens, he said with regard to psychic abnormalities.

SPD chief Gabriel said: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything, which helps to increase security further".
It is important that the interior Minister clearly spoke out against Actionism.
"That was a slap for the sharpeners in the CDU/CSU," said Gabriel to the newspapers of the Funk Media Group (Friday).
De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the union after a burka ban and the abolition of dual nationality.
A general ban on full obfuscation is problematic for constitutional law.
You cannot forbid everything you reject, and I reject wearing the burqa.
We can talk about rules, for example, in road traffic or for witnesses in court.
Green boss Simone Peter accused the minister of trying to simulate energy and ability to act with ever-new anti-terrorist packages.
Left-party chief Bernd Riexinger said: "Fleet Proverbs and a tightening of the right of residence do not bring more security to people in this country".
