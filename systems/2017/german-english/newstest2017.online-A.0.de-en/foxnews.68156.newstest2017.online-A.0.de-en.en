Reid says that in the case of a victory at Garland, Clinton will remain as a candidate for the Supreme Court
Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, will nominate the judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
The Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland's endorsement since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
The majority leader in the Senate Mitch McConnell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the deceased judge at the Supreme Court of Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on Thursday during a conference call that he expected from Clinton to select Garland "with a certain degree of certainty".
A spokeswoman for Reid later said that he had not yet talked to Clinton whether she would nominate Garland and he speculate.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team would not worry about a new candidate.
Garland is the supreme judge for the US court for the District of Columbia.
RAID said Republicans were blocking the Garland's nomination, being lackeys and assistants of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also noted that Donald Trump was unfit for president.
