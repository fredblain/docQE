Assistant doctors strike: demands for new industrial action
Assistant doctors have called on their union to approve new industrial action in their disputes regarding a new contract.
The Junior doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has asked its entire council to approve more industrial action from the beginning of September.
The JDC said that minister failed would have to deal with the concerns about the treaty.
In July, assistant doctors and medical students voted on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to the members who was published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the chairman of JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government would have remained "persistently calm" to problems, which led to the treaty being rejected.
She said: "In view of this, the JDC board has voted to reject the proposed new contract completely and to request official renegotiation of all your worries."
In response to the silence of the government, the JDC board has today submitted a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA council to approve an ongoing programme of escalating industrial action that begins at the beginning of September.
The disputes led to the fact that assistant doctors were striking six times this year, the first overall failure in the history of the NHS.
The head of BMA assistant physicians Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed contractual terms that had been recommended by the BMA.
He shared BMA members during the meetings, which took place before the vote by 54,000 assistant doctors and medical students, that the contract was beneficial and should be accepted.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for doctors in England would be forcibly introduced.
