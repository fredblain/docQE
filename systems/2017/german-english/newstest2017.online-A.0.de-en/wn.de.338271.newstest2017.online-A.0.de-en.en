Better traffic flow on the highway feeder
It regularly jams on the ring road-here is a picture of November.
But this should change: the legal lane should be extended.
This is good news for all drivers who are in traffic jams on the road every night when they drive through the motorway feeder (a 43).
The state-run road construction extends on the next Tuesday and Wednesday (16/17 August) in the area between the hammer road and the exit Wesel Straße the right turn lane by 700 meters.
Drivers can then directly thread right from the hammer road.
The big advantage: the traffic is divided more early, which improves the overall flow on the busy section of the federal Road 51.
The idea with the extended exit was the CDU group in the district representation Münster-West.
The road narrowing on the feeder annoys the drivers especially between 17 and 19 o'clock.
On weekdays, the backlog reaches the bridge over the Albersloher path and sometimes beyond.
Reason is the needle on the B 51 just before the exit Wesel Straße.
From here the traffic is only single via the motorway bridge.
The second track had to be built back well three years ago.
The reason: Static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer possesses the required load capacity, in particular to take two lanes of heavy traffic.
How long this bottleneck and the associated work will last a daily congestion can not be said by the competent State company.
However, it is to be reckoned with years: because the bridge has an official residual useful life until the year 2034.
For the extension of the legal Lane, the national company deliberately chose the less favourable time during the school holidays because of the difficulties with disabilities.
The traffic is passed on Tuesday and Wednesday single at the construction site.
