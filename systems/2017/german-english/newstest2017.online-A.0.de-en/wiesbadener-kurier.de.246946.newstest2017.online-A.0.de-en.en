Airline is not liable: crash on passenger bridge
An airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger in the passenger bridge.
Because a liability is only possible for dangers that are typical for air transport, the higher Regional Court of DÃ¼sseldorf (AZ.: 18 u 124/14) argued.
The plaintiff had broken a kneecap at the fall.
However, the accident could have happened everywhere-it was a general risk of life, the court said.
The airline did not have to pay the man any damages.
