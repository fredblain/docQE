Steal: So perfidious blackmailing hackers their ransom
Programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeting companies-and are doing so successfully.
According to a recent survey of malware-defense specialists Malware bytes under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of companies surveyed in the past twelve months have been at least once, sometimes multiple victims of an attack with Blackmailer software.
In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already aiming for ransomware blackmail.
40 percent of the victims readily paid the ransoms required by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the attacked systems and data again.
The perpetrators specialize their blackmail software according to the observations of malware bytes on attacks in corporate networks.
If they are successful there, the potentially blackmailing ransom will be significantly higher than for private users.
"We are currently witnessing a terrifying rapid evolution of malware," explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski talking to the "world".
In 2008 most malware programs were still designed to send advertisements.
Then the offenders discovered blackmail software for themselves.
Only private users were the target, but the change to company attacks took place in recent months frighteningly fast.
Ransomware works on a simple pattern: once active on a victim's computer, it searches for recently modified files such as Word, Excel or database files, as well as archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the ransomware and permanently delete the originals.
The software then presents the demands of the blackmailers.
To get the Endschlüsselungs code to the files, the victims have to transfer money-usually in the form of Cryptowährung bitcoin.
However, where the personal photo database is at stake for private users, companies are sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production stands still.
Accordingly, the damage is higher if a ransomware strikes.
22 percent of the German companies concerned reported sales losses by ransomware, 13 percent even had to interrupt the business altogether, in one case people were in danger of life.
In Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks, whose patients may be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.
"We always tell the victims: Don't pay, you only promote the problem," explains Kleczynski.
But 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay will get their data back.
It is difficult for managers to reject the claim of the perpetrators in the face of standstill in the company.
The hackers, in turn, know this and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a recent study, F-Secure's security researchers examined the user interfaces and contact with the blackmailers and came to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.
They explain to their victims via chat how they can pay via Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support sites or decrypt free sample files.
And if private individuals are redeemed for a few hundred euros, companies will have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data back unencrypted.
With potentially high and relatively risk-free gains from ransomware blackmail, hackers are becoming more professional and sharing the work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski from antivirus vendor Sophos: "A single person can write a ransomware circa within a week."
It is more probable, however, that these are three or four persons.
The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software kit to the actual blackmailers.
The previous malware kits were created by buying the malware itself, consulting and additional tools for a one-time, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.
"Included is a customization tool so that smaller configurations, appearance, and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.
The blackmailers then seek out other hackers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So one logs into one of the forums underground, buys the set from a criminal and commissions another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
Payment is made per infected computer.
"The criminals usually commission spammers with the spread," explains Wisniewski.
The risk of ransomware is now known to many companies who are better at securing their data.
More than 50 percent of corporate IT executives in the malware bytes survey rely on the ability to defend ransomware with file back-ups and scanner software.
Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.
"If encrypting data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful Erpessung, the perpetrators will instead threaten to release sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing," explains malware byte boss Marcin Kleczynski.
This means that the damage potential is much higher than before, depending on the type of data.
In future, the perpetrators could also take completely new targets on the internet of things.
At the hacker conference DEFCON, security researchers demonstrated how to get control of a thermostat connected to the Internet.
In the middle of winter, the activation of such a blocked heater could well be worth a ransom for many victims.
If, instead of heating, the perpetrators block an entire production line in a factory in the future, ransomware could also become an issue in Industry 4.0.
