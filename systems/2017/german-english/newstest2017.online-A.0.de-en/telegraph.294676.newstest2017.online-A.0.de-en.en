England must steer the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was the biggest attraction in Heathrow, just as it was in London in 2012, when we were doing a great effort to make sure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympics brought great benefits for Stratford and the East End.
And that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities, we will already have 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs, and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.
Just as you were ahead of us in London in 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of expanding Heathrow is too great.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be embarrassed on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be mistaken at Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers each question asked.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project.
Expansion is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in witschaftlichem growth and a legacy of skills and employment both to leave the airport as well as all over the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment programme in time and budget, from the T5, which was voted the world's best airport terminal for five consecutive years, to the T2 built in the midst of the world's two busiest catwalks.
Now you are ready to deliver a third catwalk, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment.
The London Games of 2012 were a great success for UK and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.
It is time for us to steer this Olympic spirit and to expand Heathrow, thereby securing our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.
