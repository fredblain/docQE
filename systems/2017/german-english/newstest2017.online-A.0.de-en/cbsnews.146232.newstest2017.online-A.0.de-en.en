Simone Biles creates gold in women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamic on the leaping horse.
Effortlessly on the bar.
Breathtaking on the ground.
Brilliant all over the place.
And now finally also Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast climbed on Thursday to the more combat title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.
Their overall result of 62.198 was clearly ahead of the silver medallist and "final five" teammate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.

Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a more battle title and totals the fifth as she consolidates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.
She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey came to an end at that moment.
This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who have brought their sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated the last three years of its sport, 15 World Cup medals-including 10 gold medals-won with such amazing exercises, which include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Retton of hers said that she is "the best gymnast I have ever seen."
She expected a final test in Brazil, a competition that did not go so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.
Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in spring, Texas would be considered disappointment.

Biles took the first medal on Tuesday, while at the farewell party of the retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi served as an exclamation mark.
Although Biles insisted that, during their long journey to the top, never planned to have the future, this is not really true.
Part of your ground exercises-which include your typical tumbling pass-is tuned to Latin American music that would fit on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
This girl, who was adopted by her grandparents as a small child and was discovered by coach Aimee Boormans mother during a school excursion to the gym in which Boorman trained, became a force.
Since the summer of 2013, it has lost no more fighting competition, a series of winnings that will last as long as Biles wishes.
Even if Mustafina led by two turns easily, the picture deceived.
Hovering beams and ground gymnastics-in which Biles holds the world Championship title-lurked.
She picked up again with 15.433 on the levitation beam again-and put a 15.933 on the floor another on it.
Raisman hugged her gently as she expected her Endergbnis--a mere formality--and tears poured on Biles gleaming red, white, and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her scrapbook became reality.
The performance Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place, but the bronze medal in a Tiebrake went to Mustafina.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain named "Grandma" by the Americans had a head start.
After her ground exercise, she threw Kussh√§nde at the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed dubious.
As far as Biles is concerned, the fast-spreading tweet of the 19-year-olds from the beginning of this week has a whole new meaning:
