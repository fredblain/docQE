Donald Trump explains his claim Obama had been founded ISIS was "sarcasm"
On Friday, Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign by stating that his repeated assertion that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the terrorist group of the Islamic State was not meant to be serious.
This clarification raised new questions about the communication capabilities of the Republican presidential candidate on whether he was able to communicate clearly and with the American public.
It also brings his comrades, who seek to protect him during an eventful phase, in the peculiar position of having to explain statements that he could not have meant at all.
After making the hint at a campaign event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump rowed back in relation to the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to imply that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just being sarcastic.
The tweet was the contrast to the previous day that Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he meant the accusation completely serious.
When the conservative radio presenter Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know about it.
The last storm of criticism patters down on Mr. Trump while he was trying to focus his campaign on the economic situation due to falling survey values.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton kept talking about the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this topic again.
Reporting on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he had found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.
At the end of July he drew strong criticism when he said the Russians were to hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he explained, "Of course I meant that sarcastically."
This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then rowing back as needed.
"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans, how they arrive, and then, if necessary," clarify "depending on how the reaction fails." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates.
But I also believe that he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways.
Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more caustic tone, as his poll values have declined further.
A new survey by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, released on Friday, showed a leadership with great prominence in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to apologize for his provocative remarks, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humor.
But while he is increasingly focusing attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's jokes have brought his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable situation of having to stand by him, regardless of how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent advocates, gave himself great effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview from Thursday.
"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," said Mr. Giuliani, so he was questioned about the veracity of Mr. Trump's statements as to whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
It is true in this sense that before Obama was ISIS an almost unknown, small organization, he called it backbench, completely wrong and that's why it happened because he pulled the troops from Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as secretary of state, allowed ISIS to spread out by leaving the situation in the Middle East aggressively under control.
Before the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media, accusing them of riding around on each of his words and being biased against him.
He mocked the "poor, pathetic" television pundits who try to understand him and said, "You can't do it!".
Some of the Democrats mocked Mr. Trump's apology as just another proof that he was unfit for president.
