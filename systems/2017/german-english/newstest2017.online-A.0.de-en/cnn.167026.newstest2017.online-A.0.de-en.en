Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I imagine under the women's olympiamannschaft in gymnastics, and that's for more than a reason.
Firstly, I have been with each Summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.
And second, this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who worked inspiring for many young girls of other skin color.
The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, who is Jewish and Madison Kocian, who is a Catholic, rounds off, makes everyone proud.
This team is finally reflecting the United States.
It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
In the last four years, the number one among female gymnasts was an Afro-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.
That shows strength.
At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion and America cheered.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they provided unexpected but masterful Gymastikroutinen.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth heterosexual American to win gold at an individual multi-fight event for women.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We are experiencing the top of this sport, but this is not the way to see turn classes throughout the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all hit the same path as Aly and Madison to make it to the Olympic team.
They are the "last five" because the next Olympic team will have only four gymnasts in the team. Moreover, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport and Turner is primarily in private gymnastics, which are maintained by parents who are responsible for training, furnishing, travel clothing, competition and hotel expenses (for trainers and their gymnasts and families). The list can be continued in any way.
The majority of these gymnastic clubs are located in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.
In these, the gymnasts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We must allow the communities of Aun, many young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, to have a leistbareres and more accessible Turntrainung.
I founded my Turn foundation of 20 years.
At my events, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban teenagers (mainly black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determinedness for the mind.
This combination offers life-long benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.
It is the inspiration of this team that will make thousands of young girls interested in gymnastics and that's great.
It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.
It's such an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real portrayal of "girl power" by bringing the Olympic team gold and thank you, you are motivating so many young girls with different backgrounds to begin their journey, to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
