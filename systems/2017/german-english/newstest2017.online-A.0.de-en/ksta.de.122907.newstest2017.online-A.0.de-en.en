The right "identitary movement" is in the sights of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution.
According to several provincial offices, the constitutional activists in the Confederation have also put the group under observation.
"We see the ' Identitarian movement ' as evidence of aspirations against the Liberal Democratic fundamental order," said the head of the German press agency, Hans-Georg Maaßen, of the Deutsche Presse-office in Berlin.
Thus, immigrants of Islamic faith or the Middle East are defamed in extremist ways.
That is why we are observing the movement now.
The "Identitary movement" is a group with French roots which has been active in Germany since 2012.
It is opposed to "multicultural delusion", "uncontrolled mass immigration" and the "loss of one's own identity through alienation".
Constitutionalists in nine federal states-Bremen, Bavaria, Hesse, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia-are already observing the "Identitarian".
Maaßen said his authority was in close coordination with the provincial offices in the decision.
"Groups like the ' identitary movement ' are trying to pick up their target group where it stands," said the chief of the Constitution.
In general, extremists try to address them with youth-just language, often with pop music.
This is what Islamists and right-wing extremists do.
This is not cooperative advertising for one's own cause.
The propaganda is supposed to appeal to people emotionally.
Young people are particularly susceptible to this.
That's dangerous.
Lastly, there had been reports from several federal states on contacts of the "Identitarian" to AfD politicians.
Maaßen said he had no knowledge of this.
For the protection of the Constitution, possible contacts of this kind are only relevant at some point.
It depends on whether the respective party-in this case the AfD-by certain persons who are extremist, changes their target direction and becomes so extremist.
The decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party.
This is not recognizable.
In view of the significant increase in right-wing crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelters, Maaßen said he would not yet speak of new Right-wing terrorism in this context.
But we have noticed in recent years that there can be terrorist structures on the right.
There was the group ' Old School Society ' or the ' distal group '.
It may well be the case that further legal terrorist groups or microgroups are formed, which plan attacks against asylum seekers, against refugee homes or attacks from other right-wing extremist motives.
However, a nationwide or Europe-wide control of legal terrorism is not recognizable.
The previous groups were created at the regional level or in social networks.
Maaßen expressed concern about the fact that many attacks were made on the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right scene.
That is the worrying.
Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum seekers have not previously been known as criminals, politically motivated offenders or supporters of the right-wing scene.
"So many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists who might have been politically indifferent or, for example, elected CDU, SPD or leftist, who have radicalizeded by right-wing extremist sentiment."
