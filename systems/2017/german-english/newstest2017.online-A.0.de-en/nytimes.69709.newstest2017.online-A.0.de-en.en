Snapchat "anime" effect criticized as Asian cartoon
Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say that it is insensitive to breeds.
With its filtering tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that borders on the absurd.
You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that might be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The filters are blunt, feature twisting tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All missteps reach the public.
Snapchat filters have in the past been criticized in which they were accused that the app would promote blackface or white skin as a beauty ideal.
When this week some users suggested a filter that gave them slit eyes, false teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians-"yellow face".
They wondered whether these repeated controversies pointed to a bigger problem that the company has diversity.
The news and outrage were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from the Verge and motherboard, one day after Snapchat informed that it would have disabled the feature.
The company offered an apology: the filter was intended as a tribute to anime characters and not as a caricature of Asians.
But outsiders who have experienced racism reminded the filter of infringing clich√©s.
Others rejected the anime comparison decidedly.
In an email, Grace Sparapani wrote, a Korean-American art student whose tweet was widely spread over the photos that the filter was "offensive and mildly uncomfortable."
She added that "it was difficult to argue with the contrast of a very disgusting Asian caricature and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not gelbgesichtig, but that the yellow face was dragged into the devaluation extremity.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stumbling wires.
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in our hands.
And Snapchats large audiences of young people-who are more diverse than their older counterparts in terms of race-could be more likely to expect sensitivity.
When one of Snapchats filters creates an image that is offensive to a user, "it is much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed when it was previously the case," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.
In an essay for medium and in a telephone interview she said that they believe that racial controversy reflects a lack of diversity in recruitment practices at Snapchat.
Zhu criticized the large part of white, only male leadership, and finished her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.
"Either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors who work there but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say something about it."
Others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat largely left unanswered.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and indicates its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural background of his employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a personnel manager who focuses on underrepresented population groups and on internal integration efforts.
Zhu said that she will leave her Snapchat account closed and added, "I wonder if you need more users like us to be able to say that this is not OK."
