Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal tax
Hillary Clinton published her tax return for 2015 on Friday, which resulted in an income of USD 10.75 million for the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband, and an effective federal VAT rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons donated USD 1 million for charitable purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; Former President Bill Clinton generated nearly USD 5.3 million in speech fees; The former foreign minister issued an income of USD 3 million from the publisher Simon & Schuster for her book about her term of office in the Foreign Ministry.
Clinton's candidate for the vice presidency, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, has published his tax returns for the last ten years together with his wife Anne Holton.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency," announced Clinton's campaign helper Jennifer Palmieri in an opinion.
In stark contrast, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and retracts in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax returns.
It is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, although they are not obliged to do so by law.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have stated as a reason for his refusal a tax audit by the tax authorities.
"You are on the train," wrote Clinton's campaign helper Ian Sams on Twitter, regarding the publication of the Democratic presidential candidate.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's special adviser, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish anything before the tax audits are not completed.
Trump's critics, including the Republican presidential candidate of the year 2012 Mitt Romney, have already announce that his refusal raises issues relating to wealth, his donations to charities, his business and various other links, especially with Russia.
Clinton has already crashed on the subject and published on Friday a video on the internet, in which highly Albanian Republicans Trump invite his tax return.
On Thursday, she also addressed the topic during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and publish his tax returns." She said to the crowd.
Politico reported that Trump paid no or very little taxes for two years during the 1990s, and a New York Times business journalist quoted a number of Steueranw√§ltenn and tax advisors on Friday, saying that this could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign.
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett who would make sure that individuals who earn more than USD 1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama is also supporting the proposal.
During an election campaign for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate has his seat here, urged Trump to a meeting to exchange their tax returns.
Buffett said he was also subjected to a tax audit by the IRS and Trump did "fear" before the voters and not before the tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has published tax returns by the year 2007.
The Clintons who now live in Chappaqua, New York, on average paid an effective federal tax rate of about 32% between the years 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined rate of about 40.5%.
The Clinton tax return of 2015 showed that these were only USD 100 of their income as a wage, unlike the bulk of all Americans.
Their main financial investment was a cost-effective index fund, from which the Clintons taxed dividends and revenues of USD 109,000.
