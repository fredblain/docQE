Trump sees the looming electoral defeat not so tight
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a campaign event in Florida.
If there is nothing wrong with the US president's election, Donald Trump already has an alternative idea.
He's going on holiday.
If Donald Trump loses the US presidential election in November, it would be relatively irrelevant: "Ultimately it will either work or I have a very, very nice, long holiday," said the Republican candidate in a telephone interview with the US television station CNBC.
If for him in the end it is not enough for reasons of political correctness, that is all right, Trump said.
He called US President Barack Obama and the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton, as the founder of the Islamic State's terrorist militia (IS).
Within his party, more and more resistance was formed.
