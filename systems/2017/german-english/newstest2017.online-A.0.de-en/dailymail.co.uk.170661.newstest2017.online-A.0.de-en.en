Assistant doctors want to organize further strikes after they have rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal
The ministers had hoped to be able to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the British Medical Association's officials, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistant doctors who voted at an election refused him.
In July, Hunt had unveiled plans to forcibly introduce the treaty and said that the NHS would be in a "No Man's Land" and any further delay would be detrimental to the employees and patients.
The first interns are to receive a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend work to improve the care of inhospitable times.
Dr Ellen McCourt, the chairman of the BMA committee for assistant doctors informed last night in a communication saying: "Assistant doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will fuel the current staff crisis and fail to treat all doctors fairly."
With only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress must be made and time is running out.
Efforts on the part of the BMA to resolve disputes through talks came at the government's reluctance to participate and sometimes on deafening silence.
This happened to a promise that Jeremy Hunt had just made last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt must now act, repeal the enforcement and address the concerns of the assistant doctors."
If he does not do so, the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further industrial action.
The last strike at the end of April saw a postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and medical specialists were involved to provide coverage to doctors on the picket line.
The ministers had hoped to be able to end the dispute over the changes by adopting the reformed Treaty with the British Medical Association officials.
The BMA wants a better Wochendentlohnung for the 54,000 assistant doctors who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, director-General of the NHS staff, called on the assistant doctors to end the strike.
Mortimer said: "Work-related action does not achieve anything of the least, but burdens already overloaded teams and service providers, and they only provide care, distress and interruption to patients, carers and their families".
In the last two months, we have spoken to the committee of Assistant doctors and have responded positively to the concerns about guardianship and Whistleblowings with the Ministry of Health and other ministries.
Employers hoped that continued positive engagement with other important issues-such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a professional time-out Schulungsksten, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training leave and the gender pay gap in medicine-a sign of how serious it was for employers, the health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the BMA in November , February and May.
