London school girl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join the IS, was reported to have died in Syria.
The lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said that her family learned a few weeks ago of her death in Raqqah, Syria.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air raid in Raqqah, the stronghold of the group in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and died according to her family shortly after she had decided to leave the war-stricken country and return to England.
"One can only hope that this is the only good thing-as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war zone-to prevent people from ever taking this decision," said Akunjee.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London stepped into a plane to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told that she married an Isis fighter in Syria, and became a widow within a few months.
