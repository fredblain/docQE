Raiffeisen Bank Gmund at Tegernsee is asking for wealthy savers in future punitive interest rates-as the second Institute in Germany.
Bank chief Josef Paul said on Thursday: "It's only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on Giro or daily money accounts".
The Federal Association of German Banks speaks of an individual case and does not see a signal in it: normal savers would not have to worry about paying a rate for their savings.
If banks deposit money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they must pay their 0.4 percent penalty rate.
From September onwards, Raiffeisen Bank Gmund will demand this fee from private and corporate customers for deposits of over 100,000 euros on Giro or daily money accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
"The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year in the future," said Paul.
For quite some time he has been herding 40 million euros, which could be lifted from one day to the other and which he could not revalue.
"They lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent cost," said the chief.
"I can't lie down for every million 4000 euros."
The costs are now passed on to the polluter-pays principle.
Simply leaving the cash in the safes of the Raiffeisen bank would be far too dangerous: "I have already experienced four raids, I do not like the fifth!" said the bank's board.
Most customers would have understood and switched to other forms of investment.
Only a few migrated to other banks.
The Bavarian Cooperative Association declared: "The ECB's extreme monetary policy stance is causing significant costs for all banks."
To bear them alone is "not economically feasible".
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for accounting, credit cards or bank transfers.
With penalty interest for deposits of EUR 3 million, the Thuringian people's and Raiffeisen bank Altenburger Land had made headlines with their Skatbank branch in 2014.
Michael Kemmer, chief executive officer of the Banking Association, said: "We do not expect private customers to have to pay nationwide for deposits, so competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is far too strong".
A banker said that at Tegernsee there was "a clientele endowed with wealth more luxuriant".
"This can be a small bank to the problem" if you have free money hats.
The Cooperative bank Gmund, founded in 1911, has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
Famous actors, sportsmen and entrepreneurs live in the region.
At present, no other banks are known to the Cooperative Association of Bavaria, which charge a reimbursement for deposits from private customers, "said spokesman Ernst.
The President of the Federal Association of German People's banks and Raiffeisen Banks (BVR), Uwe Fr√∂hlich, had declared at the end of June: "The threshold of going into negatives towards the private customer is very, very high".
The competition is fierce and there is a threat of the emigration of investors to competition.
Customers in Germany will not be able to enjoy this in the broadest possible range.
