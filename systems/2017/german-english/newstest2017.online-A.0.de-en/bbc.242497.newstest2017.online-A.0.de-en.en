Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The £1.35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the Norddeck of the Queensferry Crossing to the viaduct-which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four closures of the "deck blowers" that approach the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 inclined ropes.
The £1.35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017.
Economics minister Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to cross the bridge from the country.
He said: "This is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry crossings.
We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic dimension in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for the fit.
In total, almost 79% of the total bridge decks are in their place and the final section of the deck today gets a betonguess for the deck in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, project leader of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "The first closure represents a significant milestone for every bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the shutter is a pioneering building and civil engineering.
After installing the last section of the road and connecting it to the North Tower deck in the expansion, we had to close the remaining gap on the north or the side of the site.
This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.
Massive, since the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled upward at an incline of about 3%.
Tricky, because the tolerances that the team worked on were tiny--on each side they were only a few millimeters.
Luckily, everything went very well.
