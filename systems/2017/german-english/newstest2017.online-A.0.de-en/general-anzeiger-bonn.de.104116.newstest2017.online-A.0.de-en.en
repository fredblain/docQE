The Volkswagen lightly is still coming through.
Despite diesel scandals, the delivery figures are rising worldwide.
But not all markets are running around.
The recall action has a swirl around a term.
Volkswagen starts in the second half of the year in the deliveries.
Despite the diesel affair, Europe's largest carmaker can continue to present a positive trend in spite of its many brands and some well-running markets.
However, in July Brody the VW brand was mainly in Western Europe and again burdened the total sales, as the company quoted in the Dax.
Worldwide, the VW brand sold 449100 cars to 1.8 percent fewer vehicles in July than in the same month of the previous year.
In Western Europe alone, the second most important market after China, sales were 14 percent below the previous year.
In the domestic market of Germany, the deliveries slumped by almost one-sixth.
Brand Sales manager JÃ¼rgen Stackmann introduced the weaker figures from July mainly to two sales days less in Europe.
In addition, there has been a reluctance to buy in some core markets by changing economic conditions.
In addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey, the British vote on the withdrawal from the EU also had a negative impact, explained a spokeswoman.
In the US, where the exhaust affair first escalated, there is also a minus to be booked.
Great support for VW is the Chinese market.
Overall, the mainly affected home brand of Lower Saxony is still lightly by the diesel scandal: After the first seven months, only a delivery minus of 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles is to be booked.
Group Sales manager Fred Kappler continued to have a sales plus from January to July.
1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen at this time, worldwide 5.904 million.
Volkswagen had been manipulating a software exhaust test.
In Germany alone, VW is calling for around 2.5 million cars to be retrofitted to the workshops.
In the course of the changeover, VW reiterated that the conversion of the cars did not have any negative effects.
After retrofitting the vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance.
After retrofitting, the car manufacturer shall issue a "guarantee-like" certificate to the customer, but do not speak of a "guarantee" as it was called on Friday in company circles.
The reason is legal subtleties.
The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen now guarantees its German customers a guarantee for converted diesel models.
This was confirmed last Monday by VW representative at the Federal Ministry of Transport.
The Ministry of Transport confirmed that there was this meeting.
"VW has to fully comply with the requirements of my investigative commission and KBA."
"Deviations from this will not be accepted," declared federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to the ministry.
VW has assumed the guarantee that no deterioration will take place in the case of fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power after conversion and that all vehicle values of type approval are unchanged.
Volkswagen itself does not use the term "guarantee", however, as it was called in business circles.
In the broad term "guarantee", Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers, for example, will be able to come to a workshop with a motor damage half a year after retrofitting-and this could result in the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
It is also important in the customer's interest to avoid the fact that any other damage, which has nothing to do with the exhaust gas scandal, comes to uncertainty about possible warranty regulations, as was said.
That is why VW does not use the term "guarantee".
