RESTful night: Tips for sleeping disorders
In the evening you roll around forever, at night you are awake for hours, and in the morning it is already far before the then to think of sleep.
This is anything but restful.
After all, one is with such problems in good company: According to the Robert Koch Institute has about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing.
How do sleep problems or sleep disorders manifest?
There are several forms of sleep disorders, and they can be based on a variety of causes, stresses Hans-Günter Weeß, board member of the German Society for Sleep Research and sleep medicine.
What one understands by land, however, is the insomnia, i.e. a sleep disorder.
In particular, many people feel that sleep is unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagonman, member of the Board of the German House association with practice in the Lower Saxon Varel.
What is behind insomnia?
The causes of sleep disturbances are complex.
This may include organic, psychological or behavioral factors, but also medications.
Often the sleep disorder is the expression of another disorder.
"Waking up very early is particularly common in a depression," says Weeß.
And it may be that different factors cause each other.
Those who have a herniated disc, for example, can lie badly, wake up every two to three hours, and may start brooding over everyday problems and worries, Weeß gives an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
When should you go to a doctor with insomnia?
Those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and are impaired during the day should go to the doctor, advises Weeß.
The impairment can look quite different: one is beaten, tired, tired, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is slightly irritable, has mood swings or physical discomfort such as stomach or headache.
To alleviate the sleep disorder, it is important to find out their causes.
Treatment options include, among other things, behavioural changes, cognitive behavioral therapy or even medications-classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks.
In Germany, there are hardly any sleep physicians in the country, stresses Prof. Ingo Fan, head of the Interdisciplinary Sleep Medical Center of the Charité University medicine Berlin.
Therefore, in case of sleep problems you should first contact the family doctor, advises Weeß.
This can be investigated to determine whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should go to the sleep lab, and what happens?
For examination in the Sleep laboratory, for example, doctors advise on snoring with breathing dropouts, in case of morbid daytime fatigue, in sleep transformers or if one does not find the cause of a sleep disorder, explains fan.
You don't really have to prepare for the investigation.
You should spend your day normally.
"Only please don't make a nap," says fan.
After wiring, you go to bed at its normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body, you wear a pair of nose glasses, a chest strap and a finger sensor.
In addition, a camera on the ceiling draws the sleeping end.
How can affected people handle the problems?
There are quite a few set screws on which you can fix for a better sleep.
Weeß counts on: regular sleep and rise times, not too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, do not watch TV to fall asleep, avoid alcohol and do not watch at night-then you start to expect immediately, and that is not conducive at all.
