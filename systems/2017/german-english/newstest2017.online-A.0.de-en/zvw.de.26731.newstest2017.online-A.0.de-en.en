Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee commissioner
Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organizer.
She is also a social worker on the spot.
Since July, Annika Deuschle has been the refugee commissioner for Urbach.
The social pedagogue supports the team of the administration around Achim Grockenberger.
She sees herself as a contact person for all actors: refugees, the Working Group refugee Assistance, administration, authorities and who else is involved.
Regine's client from the Working Group suggests that the volunteers are more than thankful that Deuschle is now there, the egg legend woolly trades, which has above all a problem.
For example, some-less taunting than the multitude of desired areas of activity-meant that the administration wanted to write out the job.
An administrative assistant was sought with a talent for languages and people, coupled with many years of experience in the field of social work, just a egg legend wool trades.
But administrative work is not her central area, says Annika Deuschle.
Above all, it is about organizing, working with the local people and also behind the scenes as well as networking.
The 31-year-old has been around for six weeks.
It has a 50-percent position on a three-year term.
"It was high time," says Regine customer, that Annika Deuschle supports honorary and major players.
There are big and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems.
Soon new containers will be in Wasen Street
A serious problem has been for some time now to find housing for the Port refugees who have been recognized.
Local authorities are responsible for connecting accommodation.
They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living spaces.
The costs of building, renting or renovating these accommodations must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
The responsibility changes from the District council to the municipality and job.
Problem: There are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been very difficult for some time.
In fact, the administration does not find private apartments.
So far, it is not functioning, but it is dependent on private housing, according to Deuschle.
Therefore, municipal apartments have to be strengthened, as it is so beautiful.
So new containers are soon set up in Wasen Street.
But only with apartments it is not done.
Perspective is the keyword, Regine's customer and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to a firm stay, there are internships, training places, school places, one-euro jobs and temporary work for refugees and migrants who need to be found or established.
"More places would be good," reports Regine customer.
Many work in the yard or help janitors, do charitable work-and that is motivated and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports.
It hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external impact.
That is "no employment therapy".
Activity does not mean only work.
The day need a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer.
People would have to develop a sense of belonging.
So you need offers like sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
So here, too, administration and volunteering.
It is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcomed in Germany.
The long duration of the proceedings is a problem.
They need to explain to the refugees that it is just taking time and that they can make a meaningful bridge, for example with language courses.
Anyone who eventually develops the feeling that he cannot help anyone in Urbach should not work and be useless, he will never integrate.
The clear majority is motivated.
But there are also problem cases, says customer honestly, "people who don't do anything". The work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always also to motivate others.
All this is already a mammoth task.
A difficult question: have the two after the recent occurrences fear of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?
"No," says Regine's customer quite clearly, "what some may call na√Øve". However, a residual risk could not be excluded.
But the helpers are already sensitized.
These incidents are also a matter for the refugees.
They have the fear that the assassins will completely discredit them.
"They want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine customer.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
In other words, the local and local volunteers need to look for activities.
In the background, you will always have a new surge of refugees and migrants coming to Urbach.
Does Germany need a ceiling?
To answer this question clearly, politics is shy.
In fact, it is unfair to provide helpers on the ground.
"In Urbach we have not yet arrived where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would relax the situation.
Regine's customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher are already busy integrating the existing people in a sensible sense.
These are currently around 100 people, mostly young men.
But if people are in need, they must be helped, both women agree.
The political world is so complicated because there are no easy answers.
