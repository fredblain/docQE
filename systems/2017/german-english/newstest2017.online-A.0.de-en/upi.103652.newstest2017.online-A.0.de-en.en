Kepler measures rotation rate of stars in the cluster of Pleiades
The latest mission with the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates under the stars of the Pleiades cluster.
The new data helps astronomers understand why stars revolve in the cluster at different rates and in which context the rotation periods are related to the formation of planets.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other clusters of stars, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his age, and even the history of his solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The cluster of stars of the Pleiades is 445 light years away from Earth.
Many stars in this cluster of stars, which arose about 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.
They're turning out the fastest.
At peak rotation rates, these ripening stars emit large amounts of stellar winds.
As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.
When a star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot--such as sun spots.
The latest catalogue of rotation rates suggests that more massive stars turn slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with larger stars turning slower pirouettes than smaller ones.
"In the" ballet "of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said.
As the cluster of stars of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates.
"The cluster of stars of the Pleiades provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.
There is still much ahead of us about what we would like to know more about, how, when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and, so to speak, hang their "dance shoes".
And their colleagues have reported in detail in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Pleiades, which will soon appear in the Astronomical journal.
