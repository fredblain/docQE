Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson fired after he hit producers
Gibson was involved in a physical altercation on the set of the series in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced in a joint statement its denunciation.
Gibson, who played the special agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before announcing his denunciation publicly.
On the set, there was an artistic difference and a disagreement.
I regret the incident, "he said in a message.
Details on how Gibson's character from the series, which follows a team of FBI agents, will be published, according to the opinion of ABC Studios and CBS Television studios, are expected to be released at a later date.
The 54-year-old, who previously played in the sitcom Dharma & Greg, has been with him since the first season of the series in 2005.
"I love criminal Minds and have put my whole heart into the last twelve years," said Gibson in a communication published on Friday.
I was hoping to be there until the end, but that won't be possible now.
I would simply like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and especially the best fans who can only wish for a series.
The planned airing of the twelfth season is scheduled for September 28th.
