Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Go where it Hurts"
Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The locals do not get anything from the summer election campaign-and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia may not choose the Landtag.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern you have understood.
In 2021, the Landtag election will not be held again directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
It's no more stupid than it is: summer holidays, heat and Landtag election campaign-this is biting.
The locals who are to be persuaded by the election campaigners are on vacation.
The majority of holidaymakers in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so they must not choose the Landtag.
In addition, there are practical problems: during the holidays, helpers hanging posters, blowing up balloons, distributing flyers and counting votes in the end are only laboriously encouraged.
Until September 4, 2016, the election and last day of the holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, once again, has to pass a election campaign close to the people.
The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.
And it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Celery, leader of an SPD/CDU coalition, must fear for his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls.
Exciting is how much newcomer AfD cuts off and what is left in the end of a coalition fit.
Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, makes an almost inconspicuous campaign, one sees from his large posters.
He travels through the country, spreads roses and chats a little with the people, just as his legendary word-sparse predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.
Otherwise, Seelering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame for blooming the AfD.
Their refugee policy, their "we create this" has accelerated the rise of right-wing populists, which is now presumably going to cost him the beautiful office.
The CDU with its top candidate, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it is like to make a campaign at the wrong time in the right place.
She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to major rallies; Merkel's Bundestag constituency is located in the northeast.
But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony there than Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.
"There was probably the majority in other federal states," Vincent Kokert, general secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently denounced the NDR.
But it is also too bad for anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel.
Otherwise, the northeast CDU largely renounces the usual electoral stands on market squares and in front of shopping malls with parasols and balloons.
This, says Kokert, only plays a "subordinate role".
The Union also noticed that in the country you wegbröselt the base, that it must exert itself very hard to find another wire to the people.
It is like the left, the SPD, the Greens: scarcely present in the vastness of the country.
The Council of the CDU campaigner Kokert to his comrades, however, is also self-revealing: "You must go where it hurts, namely where people are: festivals, golden Weddings, every birthday party must be used".
Because much is at stake, selling his SPD has now called for a particularly committed election campaign.
In polls, the Social Democrats were last 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and only just before the AfD (19).
In the 2011 election, the SPD had still clearly won 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).
The Greens, small party with seven percent in the polls, are likely to make the leap into the Landtag.
They make a modern virtue out of the holiday-not and set their election campaign largely on the internet.
"Online election campaign", calls it the country's chairman Claudia Müller.
Otherwise, green election fighters are looking for local voters to search for the locals.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, curves just with a houseboat through the Mecklenburg Lakes and still finds it beautiful.
Her impression: "Election holidays in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment".
