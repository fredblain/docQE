Puzzles for fish that landed in garden in Banff
A resident of Banff asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that the 75 fish could be sand by a fountain spewed.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, published on Periscope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two-inch-long fish.
