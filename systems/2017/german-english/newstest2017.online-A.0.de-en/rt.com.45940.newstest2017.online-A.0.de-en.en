Jewish director smashes Berlin hotel because Israeli prefix was removed after "Arab" call-RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media riot after he had betrayed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list an Israeli area code, since it had "requested" Arab guests according to an employee.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah", left his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper Faz.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the country code list of the hotel.
However, the country was not listed between the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted in the year 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany?
Wrote Lanzmann.
Instead, the Kempinksi Bristol offers a way to select Israel via its own call center.
Looking for an explanation, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received there, "shocked him," as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel clerk said that the measure was an "intentional decision of the management of Kempinski hotels."
The reason behind it was even more anger in the director.
"Most of our guests are Arabs and they have requested that the area code be deleted," the employee of Lanzmann was quoted.
The Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great shame", reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
We were horrified and dismayed by this event.
This is really shameful.
The fact that this has taken place in Germany in this very hotel chain is even more of a disgrace.
That does not require explanation.
We expect the hotel to "draw the right conclusions," said the official.
The incident triggered a rather large response on the Internet, where people called it a scandal.
Some told the Kempinski hotel that it had "given up" the alleged calls of Arab guests.
"Be ashamed," it was said in another article, in which it was pointed out that the hotel, located on the noble Kurfürstendamm, is near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly dismissed all accusations and called the incident an "oversight" and "apologized" at Lanzmann, reported the mirror.
"There was never a direct instruction" not to include Israel in the Quick list, "the Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman for the Kempinski hotel.
It adds that the country code has now been added.
