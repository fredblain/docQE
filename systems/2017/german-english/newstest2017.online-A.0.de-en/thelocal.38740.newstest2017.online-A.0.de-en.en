Woman in presumed suicide on Swiss highway run over
The victim was in the middle of the night on the highway.
The police call witnesses after a woman was run over in the early hours of the morning on Thursday in a presumed suicide of several vehicles on a highway.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.
A woman put herself in the dark "in an act of despair" on the street and were hit by several cars, the police said in Vaud.
It is obvious that a Swiss, at the age of 49 years, who was run over by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill herself.
She died on the ground.
Several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, said the police, who ask them and any witness of the incident to report.
A preliminary investigation was opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, shared Gilles Hofstetter with the Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed.
Was a collision avoidable?
This is something the prosecutor must decide, "said Hofstetter.
Two similar cases over the last five years show that drivers are not being held accountable.
In each of the two cases-in which a person ran in the dark on the highway-it was decided that the motorists would not have to assume that a pedestrian in the middle of the night runs on the highway, as was said in the newspaper.
Last year, a police officer of the negligent killing was acquitted after she had run over and killed a man who was in August 2014 one night on the A1 near Payerne.
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and became unconscious on the street, heard the court.
The court found that the policeman--who had responded to an emergency--drove in a justifiable way, and that the presence of a man on the street was a "perfectly extraordinary and unpredictable situation," said the judge.
Anyone who has further information on the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under the number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
