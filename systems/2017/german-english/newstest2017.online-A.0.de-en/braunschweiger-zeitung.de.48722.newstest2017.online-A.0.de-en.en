Who is building Brunswick's cheap apartments?
The SPD and Greens believe that investors will be much more involved in the future.
How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years?
The SPD is proposing a "living concept of action" at the next Council meeting.
But strife is programmed.
First and foremost, the question is: who is supposed to build the cheap apartments?
A regulation is missing so far.
SPD Bundestag Group chairman Christoph Bratmann says: "We are in agreement with the Greens: if you want to build urban areas, you have to have 20 percent of all apartments as social housing."
However, the cheap apartments can also be created in the stock.
The big point of controversy in the city hall, however, is Bratmann: "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private land?"
"We want investors to build at least 10 percent on such land, but as much as 20 percent of the flats as social housing."
A new urban housing Support programme, which will cost millions and still needs to be financed, should provide incentives.
The problem, according to Bratmann: "There is currently no agreement between the political groups."
The CDU wants to make as few regulations as possible for investors.
The left wants still hardships for investors.
Despite this, according to Bratmann, there is a worsening of the situation in the housing market.
If the concept of action is implemented, this will provide additional tasks in the management of the administration.
More staff is needed.
It is unclear whether we will get the professionals.
But the programme is still not complete: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.
But how does one balance the loss of another approximately 1300 cheap flats, the funding of which will expire in the next few years?
By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.
To prevent this, according to the planning spokesperson Nicole Palm, should now be buying expiring ties from the city.
It would also have to be thought about bringing apartments back into the price fixing.
This is possible in the West.
In one shot, the problem could be solved.
In the west, deadlines expire at the end of the year.
Around 1800 apartments could be put back in the price fixing for cheap apartments.
Only: The owners, the housing companies do not want that.
Because the number of social housing in the West is again drastically increased, one removes itself from the goal of the so-called mixing.
There will no longer be a concentration of socially weak in only a few parts of the city.
The Greens reckon that there will still be movement in the discussion.
Bundestag Group chairman Holger Herlitschke says: "For a broad majority, the CDU must be in the boat."
It has concentrated on more sites for single-family homes.
But this does not mean that a compromise cannot yet be found.
