Culture of political correctness makes electoral fraud flourish in Muslim areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed last year at the instigation of a government report due to corruption from office
A culture of political correctness has led to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities being deliberately ignored as a devastating government report today revealed.
The former Cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police, election observers and halls to have ignored evidence of election abuse due to "over-sensibilities regarding ethnicity and religion".
The former Minister of Integration and local government, who is now a Antkorruptionsk√∂nig, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up shut-off tapes outside of election booths to protect intimidated voters.
He recommends that voters should carry a passport to prove their identity in elections.
At the moment, a voter only has to name and address.
The report proposes to apply non-removable ink to a person's finger when they make their vote to prevent someone from dialing twice.
Whistleblowers should get more protection, says Sir Eric.
It calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions by non-official committees or working groups.
"This serves not only to counter electoral fraud, but also to protect the local government from the wider corruption and financial fraud culture that accompanies it," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the tower Hamlet's electoral scandal in east London.
Last year, a Sonderwahlgericht decided that the incumbent mayor Lutfur Rahman should be removed from his office after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman would have perverted the religious sentiments of his Muslim community "in a cynical way" and that he would have silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobienanschuldigungen.
Rahman is said to have "led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to elect him."
Up to 300 votes were either dubious or the result of an imitation in which a person chooses as someone else.
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud across the country.
He expressed himself in particular alarmingly to fraudulent absentee ballot-in which older members of the Muslim community would have made pressure on people to elect a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including leading identification, to prove the identity
In his report it states: ' It was established that pressure was exerted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, in particular women and young people, in order to vote in accordance with the will of the elderly, in particular communities with a Pakistani or Bangladeschischem background.
"There were concerns that... State institutions would knowingly ignored such behavior due to" politically correct "oversensibilities regarding ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including banning political activists from editing letter-dial documents to stop "picking".
The report, which is being considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher registry checks to prevent the electoral directory from being used for immigration and social fraud.
Consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID card.
Use non-removable ink on a person's finger once she has given her voice to prevent someone from dialing twice.
Carry out systematic checks on the nationality of a person in order to ensure that they are entitled to vote.
A three-year limit on requests for automatic absentee ballot.
Prohibiting political activists from working on complete mail options and envelopes of letter elections.
Give the police the power to set up barricades around electoral stations.
A change of law that facilitates an indictment of intimidation in accordance with the representation of the People Act 1983 (the 1983 Act of Representation).
Ban in electoral stations.
Requirement that only English may be used in the electoral stations (except Wales).
Intensifying the training to ensure that the employees enforce the rule that voters go alone in the voting booth.
Sir Eric Falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that after the Tower Hamlets case no criminal complaint was made.
"The electoral court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy unfit for use due to a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.
It has been pleaded guilty for a number of reasons, in accordance with the high requirements in criminal proceedings.
He also criticizes the ineffective "checkbox controls" of the election registration departments of the halls.
Sir Eric said, "the court ruling in Tower Hamlets from last year was a warning signal.
Our country is a proud heir to Parliament's mother, but the worrying and concealed spread of electoral fraud and denial by some authorities threaten this good reputation.
