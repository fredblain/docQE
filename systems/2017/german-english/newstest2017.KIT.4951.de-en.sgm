28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco mall
</seg>
<seg id="2">
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping center.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The victim's brother said he cannot imagine anyone who would want to harm him,"Finally, it went uphill again at him."
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The corpse, found Wednesday morning in the Westfield Mall, was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, the Justice Department said in San Francisco.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was classified as murder and the investigation is on the running.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told the ABS broadcaster KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who formerly worked as a cook in Boston, had his dream job as a cook at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
A spokesman for the Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and destroyed on the ground" over his death.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
"We are a small team that works like a close family and we are going to miss him painfully," said the spokesman.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Our thoughts and condolences are in this difficult time at Franks's family and friends.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Louis Galicia admitted that Frank initially lived in hostels, but that "things for him finally went uphill."
</seg>
<seg id="11">
"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend," shared Louis Garcia KGO.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Louis Galicia said he could not imagine anyone who would want to hurt his younger brother.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
He was a friendly person with a big heart.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
His way to connect with his family was to always give us something to cook, prepare us dinner," said Louis Galicia.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
He never wanted to take part in any kind of controversy.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
He was the brother who swam with the electricity.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
"In everything that goes wrong in the world, he was this unvarnished diamond that brightened bright every day," he said.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Anyone with information on the case will be asked to call the SFPD's execution phone under the number 415-575-4444.

Jennifer Aniston: I am always put in drawers
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Jennifer Aniston does not always have to be perfect or successful.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
That is what the Hollywood star clearly made clear in an interview now.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
"I will always be plugged into drawers or glued from outside labels, which with me and reality usually have little to do with it."
</seg>
<seg id="5">
"I do not have the desire to always be perfect and successful."
</seg>
<seg id="6">
"To be honest, these things are rather snuff to me."
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh that she is considered "miss Perfect" as she explains in the current "cosmopolitan."
</seg>
<seg id="8">
After all, the actress spends her time at home, TV with loose Dutt and Mexican food, the magazine says.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
To the white glut, she raises the question of the child's wish: "we women do not have to be married or have children to be perfect," according to the Hollywood star.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
In her new film,"Mother's Day - Love is Not a Children's Game", Aniston is seen as a single mother of two sons.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
The film runs with us from the 25th of August.

Golfer Langer gets the sports pyramid
</seg>
<seg id="2">
His experience on the horse is manageable.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer was looking for a bit of variation on the beach with some colleagues.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
It was a premiere for the 58-year-old.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
CHIO: "golden sports pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
</seg>
<seg id="6">
After a few minutes, the horses remembered their holiday, they hunted in the fast gallop home to the fodder troughs.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
One kilometer at this pace, I was scared.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
"It was not a good experience," Langer says.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
And so the riding career ended up again.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament victories - was again close to horses.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
He left with his family over the plant of the ALRV, on a horse he did not even bother for photo purposes.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Langer was the first time in Aachen and also with the CHIO.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
The reason was quite convincing.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
The German sports aid was given to the man from Anhausen as part of a small gala the Golden Sports pyramid.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
At awards, the likeable athlete is not lacking.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Federal Cross of Merit, Silver's laurel, Champions Tour Player of the year...
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Even the British Queen has already adored him.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Langer is the 18th winner of the sports pyramid.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
In Aachen, he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
"This award means a lot to me," says Langer,"because it is awarded not only for sporting successes, but also for social engagement."
</seg>
<seg id="21">
For decades, Langer has been promoting the young.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
And so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time U.S. Masters champion was inducted into the "Hall of Fame of German Sports" on Saturday.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
The performances include the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the Fechter Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the rowers Peter-Michael Kolbe, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumping rider Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumously the handballer Erhard Wunderlich.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
Many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
After the official part, the illustrious society wandered into the Springstadion, where the Lavazza Prize was running.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
Bernhard Langer kept distance from the big animals.

Clinton's and Trump's economic policies in comparison: it's all about the money
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Investing in infrastructure and preventing the trade agreement TTP - that is what both Clinton and Trump want.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
However, the two US presidential candidates are divided on fiscal and energy policy, as well as on a fundamental issue.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, more philosophical difference.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The, about the role of the state.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns of how the state can hurt the economy - with taxes and regulations.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
He himself would be very different, claims Trump.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
He will drive back regulation massively, and he is pushing for far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for businesses.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Clinton, however, says the state has certain tasks to perform, it has disadvantaged opportunities and needs money for it.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
That is why taxes would be increased for the rich, she says.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Interestingly, both are very close to the subject of infrastructure.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
It must be invested in, say, Trump and Clinton almost word-for-word.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
The Democratic candidate even announces the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Government investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies, and are strongly opposed by Republicans ' state-critical teaparty-wing.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
So there could be partisan discussions on Trump.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
The differences in energy and climate policy are clearer.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and boost coal production in the US.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Oil production is also expected to be possible in areas protected so far, and the Paris climate agreement is to be terminated.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Clinton, on the other hand, wants to explicitly expand renewable energy with her investment program, and demands that "a country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs."
</seg>
<seg id="21">
"It will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be."
</seg>
<seg id="22">
But not only in terms of infrastructure, but also in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
TPP, the trans-Pacific trade agreement, both do not want to sign.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
At the same time, both do not want to isolate the US from international trade, but simply to better protect American jobs.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
They are also supposed to be paid better, asking for Clinton.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a starvation wage.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
It wants to raise it to $15 an hour.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
What Trump wants to do on this issue is not entirely clear: once, he says, the minimum wage must be up, then he says he should not be changed.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
But the big debate in the coming months is likely to be more about the fiscal policy of the two camps.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
On the one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens in order to boost growth.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
His critics believe that this would only increase the budget deficit.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
On the other hand, Clinton, who at least wants to ask the wealthy to pay more tax, and whose critics say more taxes are not the solution, either.

Escape: "any fleeing woman has experience of sexual violence"
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Sexual violence is part of everyday life for women who flee on their own.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
A house offers refuge.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
In a large kitchen, there are four women.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Each has a baby, which is no more than a year old.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
One has put her little son in the arm.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
He looks with big eyes curious in the room.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
His mother stares at the table plate.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Until she realizes she is being watched.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
She smiles short and kisses the little one.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
The scene looks normal.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
She is a division manager of Condrobs, a carrier for social assistance in Bavaria, and deals with, among other things, women on the run.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
The four women in the kitchen are fleeing.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralized accommodation for women and their children in Bavaria.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
In January, Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
It has recently been officially opened.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Men do not exist - even as a visitor.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
The exception is a guard at the door.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
"It is not an exaggeration to say that any woman who arrives here has made on her escape experiences with sexual violence," Bahr says.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
"Men are fleeing because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they are threatening torture or death or because their families send them as hopefuls to Europe," she tells.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
In women, there are other reasons for the escape: "many are stealing from it because they see no other way out."
</seg>
<seg id="25">
In their homeland, they have experience of sexual violence, forced marriages, honour killings, slavery or forced prostitution.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
That is what drives them.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
On the run, that goes on.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
"That smugglers, for example, demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a rarity," says Bahr.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
Anyone who thinks that the end as soon as they arrive in Germany is mistaken, tells Bahr.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
Here, too, single women in refugee camps would often be regarded as inferior and, at worst, abused.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
That means that about 90 percent of the women who live in the accommodation in the Munich North are traumatized, she estimated.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
"Some of the children certainly did not come up voluntarily."
</seg>
<seg id="34">
Many women are so used to saying nothing.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
"Or they do not dare to speak openly about the experience because the shame is too big."
</seg>
<seg id="36">
As they often do not know how to help, there is a need for more accommodation only for them, Bahr asks.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for accommodating refugees.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
On the question of whether they knew of a project similar to that in Munich in their area of responsibility, some answer no.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
In Oberpfalz and Oberfranken, for example, there is no such thing in government accommodation.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
Even in Swabia, abandoned women are not being accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press officer of the government.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
In Oberbayern, Unter- und Mittelfranken, there are only for single women and their children in some dormitories or their own houses.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
The exception is Lower Bavaria, where there are two central accommodation exclusively for women.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
The European Parliament's Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality also calls for women to be separated from men.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
In a study published for the committee, it said: "it is very important for men and women to be accommodated separately."
</seg>
<seg id="45">
"Lacking the privacy, or getting men and women together, it can turn into - perpetual - violence against women."
</seg>
<seg id="46">
In particular, the laundry rooms should be separated and easily accessible to women, the study says.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
The way in which women feel this need for protection can be seen at the arrival of the house in Munich.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
"Since it has been around, that there is us, we have a long waiting list," Bahr says.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
You could easily set up a second house.

Assistant doctors strike: calls for new industrial action
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Deputy Assistant doctors have called on their union to approve new labor action in their disputes over a new contract.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called on its entire council to approve more industrial action from early September.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The JDC said that ministers had failed to address concerns about the treaty.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Assistant doctors and medical students voted in July on the rejection of a contract that was agreed with the BMA.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
It was rejected by 58 percent of its members who voted in the elections.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday evening, JDC's chairwoman Ellen McCourt said the government had remained "persistently calm" on problems, adding that the treaty was rejected.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
She said: "in view of this, the JDC board voted to reject the proposed new treaty in full and called for official renegotiation to all your concerns."
</seg>
<seg id="9">
In response to the government's silence, the JDC board today submitted a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing program of escalating labor action, which begins in early September.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
The disputes caused assistant doctors to strike six times this year, the first total outages in the history of the NHS.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
The head of the BMA assistant physician Dr Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed terms of the contract, which had been recommended by the BMA.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
He told BMA members during the meetings, which took place before the vote by 54,000 assistant doctors and medical students, that the treaty was beneficial and should be adopted.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
After the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the contract for doctors in England would be forcibly introduced.

Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?
</seg>
<seg id="2">
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Leaders of Russia and Turkey met Tuesday to give up their hands and declare an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gold-plated hall of St Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
There was the handshake, yes.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
But Putin's smile acted narrowly, and he barely radiated warmth, even for his restrained conditions.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report full five times.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
I could not count it any more.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old pre-crisis levels, but will even improve.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had behaved as if something bad had never happened.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
To me, his enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
But a sustainable coolness, broadcast by Putin, showed that Russia's head of state had forgotten nothing.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory remarks: the downing of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border by Turkey.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Moscow's reaction at the time was wrecked.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Putin split out and accused Ankara of having fallen behind Russia.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
The offense was even greater as it was committed by an alleged friend.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Rebuilding the veto will be difficult, if not impossible.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Public opinion in Russia has changed since Nov.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
For months, state-controlled media conducted a fierce, full attack on Ankara.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
At one time, it seemed the Turks were to blame for everything.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
Most serious were allegations by senior officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited from the illegal trade in oil in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
He vehemently denied this.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
But in St.Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
After all, that meeting took place only because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan, which he wanted to hear.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
Russia was a kind of victory.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are clear.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
Erdogan primarily needs all the friends he can get after being unveiled almost by his office last month in a failed coup.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
But there are also economic motives.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - particularly the ban on charter flights, which typically bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
The number has fallen by almost 90%.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights resume.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
They are counting on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
This week, state television forecast cheaper fruit and vegetables once Turkish farm imports are allowed again.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
As a report in Vedemosti put it: "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."
</seg>
<seg id="36">
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
Ankara is angry at the West as it considers its response to the attempted takeover as a weak response.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
To this end, the ongoing resentment comes at the snail's pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - eager to take advantage of the cool mood and reduce Turkey's relationship with the West.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
The Russian leader certainly won a bonus in Ankara for calling for support for the elected authorities after the attempted coup.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
This is, of course, a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
The summit in this glamorous palace on the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey to depict, as an analyst once told me, the "alliance of outsiders": two countries that feel wronged by the West and feel badly treated and are now allied.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
However, despite public reconciliation, there are still major differences between the two.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave itself the role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
It could be significant that after nearly three hours of initial talks, both presidents said at the press conference that they had not even jumped the issue.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
Turkey's president deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin chose to emphasize them.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
There is no clear consensus on where to find a common denominator on Syria.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
But after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a complete disaster, when NATO member Turkey shot down the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state at least talk to each other again.

Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland no longer available
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The RBS brand is about to be reduced to a back-office role, according to the bank's CEO.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The bank has since distanced itself when it almost collapsed and had to be rescued eight years ago.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
During that time, brand strategist RBS has used "RBS" to protect other end-consumer financial brands.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
She supported international sport with millions of pounds in sponsorship, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
But now it has decided to put more national brands in focus.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralised headquarters and the stock exchange listing will change to NatWest.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
There are other, smaller brands for retail banking that will be given more prominence - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
McEwan was interviewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
He told BBC Scotland: "the RSB brand will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our staff will be busy as we become more a bank of brands now."
</seg>
<seg id="15">
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
I am now saying that we are not pursuing global objectives, but local objectives.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work with the customers under these brands.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
RBS has already said it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the perceptibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
"It is time for us to develop into the bank of brands, because how do we focus on inside (we have asked) to make this a better bank for customers?" said the CEO.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and have launched these brands.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think we will see many changes.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
We can launch these brands again, so I think the time has come.

Frankie Dettori reaches on Predilection his 3.000th win at Newmarket
</seg>

Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket that brings him 3.000th win
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
He set a milestone on Predilection, which is trained by John Gosden, on his local circuit with his second win of the night.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in the flat race.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The three-time winner Dettori, who won before Ghayyar, said: "it is something special."
</seg>
<seg id="8">
I am very emotional because my family is here too
</seg>
<seg id="9">
I am very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
It is not a big meeting, it is not Royal Ascot - it is a banal Friday night with 20,000 people.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
I am relieved and very humble.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Dettori takes the jubilation as he takes on preaching the victory
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in the impeachment race - jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who scored more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Lester Piggott, the nine-time Derby winner, had 4.493 career victories
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Frankie is one of the best jockey of modernity and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that few have achieved before him.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
He is a fantastic ambassador for race, his enthusiasm and charisma has excited fans for years for this sport.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
I told Frankie a couple of weeks ago at Epsom that he had already picked up 6000 profits if he was not just a weekend and big-tournament jockey!
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Frankie has already won almost 30 years of winners in GB, which is great.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
He has a lively personality, which is good for a British race, but beyond that, he is an incredible jockey.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
</seg>
<seg id="22">
From Flying finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
It was nerve-wracking.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
A whole series of major tournament wins, including his famous "glorious Seven" in 1996 in Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
Three years ago, he initially had trouble returning from his six-month lock, but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to defy his doubles and return to his best form.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
And he is still far from the end - Dettori once said he wants to continue in competitions until his at least 50.th.

Russia's Putin fires chief of staff Sergei Ivanov
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff, Sergei Ivanov.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Ivanov has been part of Putin's closest confidant for many years.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The 63-year-old has been appointed Special Envoy for Environmental and Transportation Affairs.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
In an opinion from the Kremlin, it is that, without giving reasons, Putin "ordered the dismissal of Ivanovs from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration."
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Anton Vaino, who has been Ivanov's deputy since 2012, has been appointed to his successor.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the embassy in Tokyo.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
The Kremlin's website says (in Russian) that he was later the chief executive and chief executive of the government staff.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
On his appointment, he said to Putin: "thank you for your confidence."
</seg>
<seg id="11">
I think that it is the government's most important task to support your activity as head of state on draft legislation and controls to implement your instructions.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and advised Vaino as his successor.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Do you see the smiling faces?
</seg>
<seg id="14">
This move has kept Moscow shrouded in mystery.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidants and works like he did for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
As chief of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigned at his own request.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
But despite the smiles for the cameras, few are convinced here - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
So is this the result of a kind of power struggle?
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Nobody knows that at the moment.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
But the official claim - that a man once touted as a potential president would want to head Russian environmental policy at once - met with great skepticism.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
In his remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said " it is true that I asked you in a conversation in early 2012 to entrust me with this very complicated post - you could almost say - arduous posts for four years.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
As it turns out, I have been the chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
Ivanov took the post in December 2011.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
Previously, he was deputy prime minister and defense minister.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB State Security Service.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov as one of five people he trusted most.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
It was once thought that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin's second term, as a third term of Putin would have violated the constitution.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
But this post was taken by another, close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
Putin became prime minister before he became president again three and a half years later.

Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson fired after he beat producers
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Gibson was involved in a physical battle on the set of the series in Los Angeles last month.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced their dismissal in a joint statement.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized publicly on Thursday before announcing his dismissal.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
On the set, there were artistic differences and a difference of opinion.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
I regret the incident," he said in a statement.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Details of how Gibson's character from the series, which follows a team of FBI agents, will be released, according to the opinion of the ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, likely to be released at a later date.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The 54-year-old, who previously played in the sitcom dharma & Greg, has been with it since the first season of the series in 2005.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
"I love Criminal Minds and have plugged my whole cardiac arrest for the last 12 years," Gibson said in a message released Friday.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
I had hoped to be there until the end, but that will not be possible now.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
I would just like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and, above all, the best fans you can only wish for a series.

Queensferry Crossing: bridge now linked to Fife
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The £ 1.35 billion project is due to be completed by May 2017
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Engineers have linked the north deck of the Queensferry crossings with the viaduct - meaning the bridge is now linked to Fife.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
It is the first of four closures of the "cover blower," which is nearing completion around each of the bridge's three towers.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 swirls.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The £ 1.35 billion project is due to be completed by May 2017.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Economy Minister Keith Brown visited the building site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
He said: "this is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry crossings.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
We are all witnesses to an engineering of a truly epic degree in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used for this part of the bridge alone.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for fit.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Overall, nearly 79% of the total bridge checks are in their place and the final section of the deck gets a betting ring for the deck today in Rosyth, which means the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge constructors said: "the first closure represents a significant milestone in each bridge project.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
In this fantastic project, the shutter represents forward-looking high and deep construction.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the northern tower deck, we had to close the remaining gap on the north or land side.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
This was achieved by dragging the northern accessory bridge 700 millimeters south.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
This was a massive and, at the same time, very delicate activity.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Massive, as the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and has had to be pulled up at a slope of about 3%.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Delicate, as the tolerances to which the team was working were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimetres away.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Fortunately, everything went very well.

Rescue at Moelfre Bay: three men ' lucky still alive '
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Three men are "lucky still alive" after being thrown from their fishing boat in front of Anglesey.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station struck at 13: 20 BST on Friday after a crew watched the event in Moelfre Bay.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The three men had difficulty swimming in safety while their boat moved out of their own.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
"We saw how the boat turned around in its vicinity and presented us with the worst," said the head of the rescue station of Moelfre Vince Jones.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
"Fortunately, the strong winds have already blown the boat out of their reach until we left to water," he added.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a Boje hanging without a lifeguard.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
They all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were taken back to the rescue station
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Mr Jones said: "the three men who were thrown into the water are lucky to be unhurt and still alive.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
The boat engine had an emergency stopover, but the boat was pulled out by the person who headed the boat.

Seriously injured - man stabbed to his ex-girlfriend
</seg>
<seg id="2">
A man has attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and seriously injured.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
As police said yesterday, the 50-year-old had been given the key to the apartment to pick up his personal things.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Instead, the alcohol-fueled offense cut his ex-girlfriend's clothes.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
When she came into the apartment, he stayed on it twice.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The 44-year-old was injured in the hand and on the body.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The police could arrest the perpetrator.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
While the 50-year-old destroyed his ex-girlfriend's clothes, he called his mother.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
She then alerted his sister.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Together with her partner, the 45-year-old wanted to reassure her brother.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
She could not get him to leave the apartment, though.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
That is why she went out of the house with her partner.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
On the street, they met the man's ex-life companion.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
When the two women entered the apartment again, the 50-year-old stabbed his sister to the side and attacked his ex-girlfriend.

Who is building Braunschweig's cheap homes?
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The SPD and the Greens believe that investors should be made much more accountable in the future.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap homes in the next few years?
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The SPD proposes a "living concept" for the next Council meeting.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
But dispute is programmed.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
First of all, the question is: who is supposed to build the cheap housing?
</seg>
<seg id="7">
There is no regulation so far.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
SPD group chairman Christoph Bratmann said: "we agree with the Greens: anyone who wants to build on urban areas will have to designate 20 percent of all homes as social housing in the future."
</seg>
<seg id="9">
However, the cheap apartments can also be created in the stock.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
However, the big point of contention in the town hall, Bratmann said, is "how do you deal with investors who want to build on private land?"
</seg>
<seg id="11">
"We want investors on such land to build at least 10 percent, but as much as 20 percent of homes as social housing."
</seg>
<seg id="12">
A new urban housing support programme, which will cost millions and still needs to be funded, is designed to provide incentives.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
The problem, Bratmann said, is "there is still no agreement between the groups at the moment."
</seg>
<seg id="14">
The CDU wants investors to make as few rules as possible.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
The left still wants tough conditions for investors.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Despite this, Bratmann said, the situation in the housing market is deteriorating.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
If the concept of action is implemented, it will provide additional tasks in the construction administration.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
More staff is needed.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
But the programme is not yet complete: the approximately 1260 new homes, which should be built anyway.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
But how do you compensate for the loss of some 1300 cheap homes, the promotion of which will expire in the next few years?
</seg>
<seg id="22">
By 2020 alone, it will be 500 homes.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
To prevent that, according to planning policy spokeswoman Nicole Palm, running ties should now be purchased from the city.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
Consideration should also be given to getting housing back into price-fixing.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
This is possible in the western city.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
At one stroke, the problem could be solved.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
Because in the western city, deadlines expire at the end of the year.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
Around 1800 homes could be put back into price-fixing for cheap housing.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
Only: that is what the owners want, the housing companies do not want.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
There will be a drastic increase in the number of social housing in the western part of the city, away from the objective of the so-called mixing.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
There should be no more concentration of socially weak in just a few parts of the city.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
The Greens expect there to be some movement in the debate.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
Group chairman Holger Herlitschke says: "for a broad majority, the CDU needs to go on board."
</seg>
<seg id="34">
That has focused on more building sites for single-family homes.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
But this does not mean that a compromise cannot be found.

Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worth
</seg>
<seg id="2">
It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The fact that teenagers and children do not go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time on screens, has been lamented by many over the last decade.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Pokemon Go is about getting people off the sofa and getting more active.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The time on screen was initially confined to the TV, then to video games and, most recently, to smartphones.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
It is therefore great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
I am referring, of course, to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters created initially for the video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Like many phenomena of pop culture, interest decreased before the release of the game in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
The market launch in other countries was delayed by the massive demand that the servers overloaded.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
How does it work?
</seg>
<seg id="12">
In short, players with their smartphones go out and look for Pokémons, which is tracked with a GPS and, once found, can be "photographed" (via a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "captured".
</seg>
<seg id="13">
A generation that played the game when she was younger joined the madness and jumped for the search from the sofa.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
In the US, the game led to a significant increase in steps that put the "average" person back every day.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, told the Washington Post recently that within two days of the game's launch, the number of folks who train for 30 minutes each day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data to improve performance.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Many public health education campaigns that want to get people to "take 30 minutes of time to come" "from the sofa" and "to be active every day" came on deaf ears because many public messages to health are boring and come from people who look elder.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
However, the importance of sport cannot be overstated.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Whoever drives sports regularly reduces his chances of suffering from cancer or depression.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Some people even find new friendships on the hunt.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
As always, there are also mammoth gamblers who always have to complain about something.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
And yes, someone could run against a door.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
What is to be done?
</seg>
<seg id="27">
There has been a breakthrough.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to play sports as this game does.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
The new will lose its charm and the use will ease with time.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
However, because of Pokemon's success, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with the real world, helping many people in the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Biles creates gold in Damenturnen

The 19-year-old American Turner drove to the multi-match title on Thursday and widened the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympics.

American women Simone Biles Turnt on the beam during the women's singles tournament at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro in 2016, Brazil, Thursday.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American woman to win a multiple-fight title and, overall, the fifth, while retaining her reputation for being the best of her generation, or even at all.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
She broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey came to an end at that moment.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who have brought their sports to new heights:
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Biles has dominated her sport for the last three years, winning 15 World Cup medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a mix of ambition and precision that the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou bailout of her said she is "the best turner I have ever seen."
</seg>
<seg id="17">
It was expecting a final test in Brazil, a contest that was not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be seen as a disappointment.

<seg id="21">
Although Biles insisted, during her long road to the top, never planned the future, that is not really true.

Police: 3 victims in serial murder case at music hearing in car shot
</seg>
<seg id="2">
According to police reports released Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot dead in one of the deadliest attacks in a decade in Phoenix's first serial murder case while they were staying in the car and listening to music.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis's daughter Maleah were shot dead June 12 while the car was parked in an entrance, authorities said.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The perpetrator fired eight shots from a handgun while he was on the front passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, the report said.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Police said that the triple murder did not seem to have been the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2.900 that was owned by one of the adult victims.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard's police spokesman said the shooting caused investigators to take a closer look at whether it was linked to four previous attacks.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
A total of seven people were killed and two others injured, mostly in Hispanic residential areas within four months.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
"It is happening in a residential neighborhood in front of a house," said Howard of the KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, earlier this month.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
It is believed the suspect used several vehicles, including a brown Nissans from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Investigators refused to reveal the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same killer.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized because of her injuries and died later.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Liner, 31, and Ellis's daughter Maleah still died on the spot.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
A witness told police that it was not unusual for her to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Authorities also released a police report on the shooting, which was aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and is believed to have been the work of the serial killer.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Investigators found cartridges and secured a bullet from the seat as well as bullet fragments from the engine room.

Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: "it is getting better"
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves the singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
But like the least of his contemporaries, Edmund has microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing about during her pregnancy.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
When he first came home, my first thought was, I do not get that.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
I do not do that.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
I did not get into it.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
What is not right at all -- of course, you got into it," she said.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Her husband Vincent and her have been told that Edmund may never recognize them, and that he may not even survive.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Some doctors even went so far as to suggest that they institutionalize it.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
"My first response to this was ' I did not know that people still do, '" declared Picciuto.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Edmund can run with the help of a walker.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Edmund could not sit and crawl until his third year of life, and he still cannot speak.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
But he is making slow progress.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
He can run with support and cycling.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund for " Please sing me something before ". "
</seg>
<seg id="17">
"We are bringing him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
But it is not a typical sign language -- she says Edmund has invented some characters on his own.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Microcephaly has a variety of causes: genetic as well as Edmund infections, as well as infections with viruses such as measles or the Zikavirus during pregnancy.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
The symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
It is too early to say how it will affect the lives of those infected with the Zikavirus.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
Picciuto remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
I constantly asked, what will happen?
</seg>
<seg id="24">
What will happen?
</seg>
<seg id="25">
And she still does not really know.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
I have not been asking for the prognosis for a long time, because I do not expect them to really tell me anyone.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of babies with birth defects caused by the Zikavirus.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
It is getting better.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
You know it will be better for you.

Heavy rain, flooding give rise to rescue in Louisiana, Mississippi
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Heavy rain and large-scale flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with more rain expected throughout Saturday.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippis flooded their shores and threatened with large-scale flooding after extreme rains, the National Weather Service reported.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on the way to help affected communities.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said that requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags were multiplying.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Steele said that only the municipality of Tangipahoa had requested tens of thousands of sandbags.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
A flood warning system will be deployed across much of southern Louisiana until Saturday.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The weather service indicated that an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
A tsunami warning system was set up in the south of Alabamas on Friday, while it continued to rain in the Mobile area.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
The River Comite near baton Rouges and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both of which are located in Louisiana, are all likely to reach record levels over the weekend.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
The metereologist Alek Krautmann says both rivers could flood many homes into the suburbs near baton Rouge.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
He also said that a stroke-down exuberance in Ascension Parish poses a danger, as these are going to flow slowly into Lake Maurepas across the river.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
The Tickfaw River, south of the Mississippi State border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded at 09.00 on Friday.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Rescue teams still trapped people from the floodwaters in the Amite district and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued Friday near Gloster.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Hansford, 62, says water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet away from his home, rose sharply overnight.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
He said another stepson, who lives nearby, had been warned.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
"We woke up and the water flowed and poured in," said Hansford.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
It reached my waist.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
His wife told Hansford that in the 48 years in which she lived there, she had never seen such a high tide of the river.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
Hansford said he and his family members all had disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
Hansford said that Nothelfer had rescued all three in a large military truck and brought them to the nearest fire station in Gloster, where they were staying until Friday.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Krautmann said the flooding had "spread quickly" as there continued to be heavy rains and that the authorities were considering evacuation orders.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
According to Krautmann, an observer arrived near Livingstone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.75 inches of rain.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
Krautmann said the ground had been considerably swollen by the rains since Wednesday.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Authorities said heavy rains and street flooding caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and tuition failure in five school districts.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that a subordinate in Tangipahoa gave up 200 flooded homes.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
Residents were evacuated in two churches, which were now both flooded.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
The suburb of the municipality of Robby Miller said authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets that were strapped from the floods.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
In the cities of Amite and Hammond, emergency shelters were set up to house the evacuees.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
"Once the water starts to go back, they will be able to go back to their homes," he said.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
In the town of Hammond of the municipality of Tangipahoa, nearly two dozens of roads were closed due to the flooding and provided sandbags to residents who hope to keep the water out of their homes and shops.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
"The last major flooding we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum of the city government.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
This seems to be a similar incident.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
In Mississipp, emergency manager Rupert Lacy of the Harrison Countys said it continued to rain on the Gulf Coast.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
According to his figures, a handful of homes were to have been reported flooded Thursday, but none were reported on Friday.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
Keith Townson, manager at shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
"I have seen water in places I have never seen before," said Townson,"and it is still coming."

Mahaj Brown, 6,"riddled with bullets," survives shooting in Philadelphia
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Police say the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week already the second time a 6-year-old child is being shot.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The boy's grandparents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The grandparents said Brown suffered several stab injuries, including in the lender, leg, arm and belly, but that he was hospitalized when he was transported to the hospital.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
"He has gone through a lot, his little body was riddled with bullets," shared his grandmother Delores Melendez told the station.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
I simply cannot believe that.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The boy's condition was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several surgeries.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The boy's family told the station that he is expected to recover.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
He should have started the first class at a local primary school.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Brown was one of four people shot at Germantown.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Also shot down were three men: two at the age of 29 and a 32-year-old.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
The boy was found on the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old, who is in a critical condition, the station reported.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
The other two victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether one of the injured men could be among the injured men.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that there appeared to be a crossfire between several shooters.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Cartridges for storm guns, traced to various storm guns, overturned the scene.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
It seems that this has clearly been an ongoing struggle.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
On the street, on both sides of the trail, there were hugs.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
So there seems to have been several armed fighters who were very actively involved," shared police chief Anthony Ginaldi of police in Philadelphia told the station.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
No arrests have been made and police are currently reportedly reviewing the surveillance video.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
On Tuesday, another 6-year-old girl was hit by a transcript at the arm when she played in front of her home in the residential area of West Oak Lane.

Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
</seg>
<seg id="2">
That is what I imagine under the women's Olympic team in the tournament, and that for more than one reason.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
First, I have been at every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
And second, this team has three turners, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have been inspiring for many young girls of other skin color.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The structure of this crew, the Aly Raisman, who is Jewish and Madison Kocian, who is a Catholic, makes everyone proud.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
This team finally reflects the US.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
In the last four years, the number one female Turner has been an Afro-American.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Last year, Simone and Gabby were _SHARP_ 1 and _SHARP_ 2.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
That shows strength.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America cheered.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Now the world has been able to witness the incredible performance of the three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected but masterful gym routines.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American who won gold at an individual multifight event for women.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
We are seeing the top of this sport, but so tournament classes across the country do not look out.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all hit the same road as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
They are the "last five" because the next Olympic team will have only four tournaments in the team, and this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
But the reality is that Turns is an expensive sport and Turner is primarily in private gyms, which are maintained by parents who pay for the training, deployment, travel, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their Turner and families).
</seg>
<seg id="19">
The majority of these tournament clubs are in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
In these clubs, Turner receives all her training and that is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, both have trained their athletes since they started the tournament.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
We need to allow the communities of Aun countless young girls, inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, to have a more affordable and accessible gym.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
I founded my tournament of 20 years.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
At my events, we have offered free and affordable tournament in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high quality tournaments to the youth who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
It develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
This combination offers lifetime benefits for health and school and professional success.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
It is the inspiration of this team that will make thousands of young girls interested in the tournament and that is great.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
This is such an exciting time.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real portrayal of "girl Power" by the Holen of Olympic team golds and thanks, Fass motivated her so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.

Assistant doctors want to organize further strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunts proposal
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistant doctors who voted in an election rejected it.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
In July, Hunt had revealed plans to introduce the contract forced and said the NHS would be in a "no-man's land" and any further delay would be harmful to staff and patients.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The first assistant doctors are to receive a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend work in order to improve care at uncomfortable times.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Dr Ellen McCourt, the BMA's chairman for assistant physicians told a news conference last night: "assistant physicians still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and fail to treat all doctors fairly."
</seg>
<seg id="6">
With only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors are under the new contract, progress must be made and time is running out.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Efforts by the BMA to resolve the disputes through talks resonated with the government's reluctance to take part, and sometimes to deafening silence.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
That was the one promise that Jeremy Hunt had made only last month that his door would always be open.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
"Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, lift the imposition and address the concerns of assistant doctors."
</seg>
<seg id="10">
If he fails to do so, the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further industrial action.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
The latest strike in late April saw an upswing of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 schedules, as nurses and specialist doctors were involved to provide cover to doctors on the strike mail chain.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting the reformed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
The BMA wants a better weekend reward for the 54,000 assistant doctors who will be subject to the contract.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Daniel Mortimer, director-general of the NHS staff, urged the assistant doctors to stop the strike.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Mortimer said: "labor action measures do not achieve anything of the little, but already strain teams and service providers and prepare the patients, carers and their families only for concern, distress and disruption."
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Over the last two months, we have spoken to the committee of assistant doctors and responded positively to the concerns about the guardianship and whistleblowing with the Ministry of Health and other ministries.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Employers hoped that the continued positive engagement on other important issues - such as posting, flexibility in training, training leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - was a sign of how seriously employers, the Health Education England and the Department of Health were about to comply with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.

The £ 2-a-day drug that can reduce heart attack risk
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 per day drug after being advised by the authorities to administer this more people for a longer period of time.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The grinning drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The drug is administered for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The regulator NICE of the NHS has recommended a four-year enrollment to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.

<seg id="6">
The regulator NICE of the NHS has recommended a four-year enrollment to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Some 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by collections of fatty materials in the artery walls that form the siege.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
If the bag breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot that clogs the blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
When the blood clot dissolves, it can flow through the bloodstream and clog the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
People who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Ticagrelor, which is manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and distributed under the trade name Brilique, reduces that risk by making the formation of blood clots less likely.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
NICE's bond proposal, published today, recommends a 12-month enrollment of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice-daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Center said: "despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences."
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Fear of another heart attack may have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Experience shows that Ticagrelor, in combination with aspirin, is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Through a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
The information about the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years.

Culture of political correctness allows electoral fraud to flourish in Muslim areas
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Former mayor of Tower hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed last year at the instigation of a government report for corruption
</seg>
<seg id="3">
A culture of political correctness has meant that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is knowingly ignored, as a damning government report revealed today.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally blames police, election observers and town halls for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse due to "over-sensitivities regarding Ethnie and Religion."
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The former minister of integration and municipal government, who is now an anti-corruption royal, said intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that police should be allowed to set up roadblocks outside polling booths to protect intimidated voters.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
He recommends that voters should have an identity card to prove their identity in elections.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
At the moment, a voter only has to name his name and address.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The report suggests not wearing removable ink on a person's finger when they cast their ballot to prevent someone from voting twice.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Whistleblower should get more protection, says Sir Eric
</seg>
<seg id="10">
He calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions from non-official committees or working groups.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
"That is not just against electoral fraud, but is also intended to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that goes with it," he said.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower hamlets campaign scandal in east London.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Last year, a special election court ruled that incumbent Mayor Lutfur Rahman should be removed from his office after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
The court found that Rahman had "cynically perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community" and that he had silenced his critics with racissism and Islamophobia.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Rahman is said to have "led his campaign on the basis that it is the religous duty of Muslims to choose him."
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the consequence of an imitation in which one person chooses someone else.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.

Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including driving out identity cards to prove identity

"There were concerns that... state institutions had knowingly ignored such behaviour because of" politically correct "over-sensitivities regarding Ethnie and Religion."

Sir Eric said 50 recommendations had been made to clean up the system, including the ban that political activists are editing letter papers to stop "polling."

Crazy after Kates cycling doubleheader and other famous doppelgers of Olympic athletes in Rio
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio are out of touch this week about French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot except Rand and Band, who has proved to be an impressive doubleheader of the Duchess of Cambridge.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
But the 24-year-old Olympionicist this summer is far from the only one to have gold struggling athlete, who has his own famous doppelganger - at least not if you are allowed to believe social media.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
In honor of the Rio Olympics and all the famous faces that currently flicker on our screens, FEMAIL has drawn up a list of Olympics that have more than a certain resemblance to Hollywood famous.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The hunter and the wolf: team member of the US team in the archery Brady Ellison, left, has been compared since his childhood with Leonardo DiCaprio
</seg>
<seg id="6">
In addition to Kate's doubleheader on the racetrack, many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain archery could be the twin of A-Promi Leonardo DiCaprio.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The team member of the US team in the archery Brady Ellison caused a onslaught on Twitter after images on which he looked uncannily similar to the Wolf of Wall Street star.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
In fact, the boyfriend got the madness in social media and admitted that he has already been told since his childhood that he looks like Leo.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
"I myself do not see any great similarity, except for facial hair," shared Brady told the Huffington Post.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
"He is a gut-wrenching guy, so I take that as a compliment."
</seg>
<seg id="11">
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly become more central this year: the alluring resemblance between British wide leader Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina, with her big, expressive eyes, is supposed to go through as a doubleheader for the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
And in the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
One gear higher: this user believes that Nathan is the "athletic version" of the inception actor

<seg id="15">
Another persistent comparison was drawn between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similarly severe eyebrows and lips.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Russian silver medallist Yulia Efimova points out more than just the sun-baked skin and blonde hair like actress Annalynne McCord, while American Nathan Adrian was attested by fans, a "athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt."
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Strong women: football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar facial form and eyes
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Not the only one: a Twitter user was very happy that others noticed the similarities as well
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Theory put into space: according to this user, there may be a reason for the couple's similarity
</seg>
<seg id="20">
One Twitter user explained her satisfaction that "the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical."
</seg>
<seg id="21">
Indeed, US football star Hope Solo and the Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar facial shape and eyes.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is nearly identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as the gold medal winner in the Turte Gabby Douglas, which features its own beautiful, broad smile, similar to that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.

CBC commentator for the Olympics apologizes for his statement that Chinese swimmers "died like a pig"
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Byron MacDonald's analysis of fourth-place 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at Dr 4x200m freestyle squadron outraged viewers of the CBC live broadcast of the Olmypian Games on Wednesday
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Canadian broadcaster CBC had to apologise after one of its commentators said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer went "like Mief" and died during the race like "a pig."
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Commentator Byron MacDonalds thought his microphone was off when he made his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m freestyle squad.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
MacDONALD, who had been summoned to the CBS commentary team on board to give more "color," could be heard saying,"this little 14-year-old Chinesin has lost the connection, baby."
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Too excited, went off like Mief, died like a pig.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Thank you for that.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swept the second leg of the swimming squad 1: 57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to close the gap with China.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly online after being shocked by the tone and language
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted," Hat the CBC commentator just said that the 14-year-old swimmer from China " like a pig has died "????
</seg>
<seg id="11">
The idiot did not capitalize that they were still on broadcast. "
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Ai Yanhan of China was described in the final 4 x 200m freestyle swimming squad for women: "this little 14-year-old Chinesin has lost the connection, baby."
</seg>
<seg id="13">
The criticism against Byron MacDonald on Twitter came fast and hard, at which many asked him to speak
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Twitter users did not hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: "wow, _SHARP_ ByronMacDonald.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
You represent the CBC and Canada and let us all look like racists.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
A short time later, Scott Russel, who moderated the CBC broadcast, apologised live for MacDonald's comment and said: "we apologize that the comment was broadcast on a swimming performance."
</seg>
<seg id="18">
It was an unhappily chosen phrase, we are sorry it happened. "
</seg>
<seg id="19">
CBC apologized at the end over 90 times at the people who responded to the note on Twitter
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Fellow commentator Scott Russel had to apologise on behalf of MacDonald
</seg>
<seg id="21">
CBC copied and added his apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about MacDonald's comments
</seg>
<seg id="22">
The network also apologized quickly and issued a notice.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that it was possible for them to be broadcast.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
Last night we quickly apologised to our viewers on broadcast and our followers on social media.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
To make one clear, Byron's comments related to the swimmer's performance and not to her as a person.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Yet they were inadequate and an unhappily chosen phrase. Byron does what he has said, very sorry.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized in the broadcast and tried to justify his comment, saying it was not his intention to be interpreted as a personal attack.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
"I would love to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women's swimming squad in the CBC Olympics," he said.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
"I was referring to the performance of the swimmers and not to them as a person."
</seg>
<seg id="30">
Of course, no disrespect was intended and I am very sorry. "

Shoppers in Primark outrage over woman who tried shamelessly underwear amid business
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The buyers did not know where to look when a woman pulled out her clothes in the middle of a primark to try underhoses.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
To aggravate the situation, she mustered how she looked, pulled her out and put her back on the shelf.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
She stumbled further and tried four pairs of underhoses in a shop at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The Primark store at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone where the woman tried the underdogs before putting them back on the shelf
</seg>
<seg id="6">
A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear,"she grabbed her again and left the store without buying anything."
</seg>
<seg id="7">
She said: "people could not believe what they saw."
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Standing in the middle of the sales floor, she took a pair of underhoses out of the exposition, pulled her own tights and trousers and tried them.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
"She did not even try to find a slightly more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, cheeky like Oskar."
</seg>
<seg id="10">
"Everybody stared when she pulled out the underhoses that obviously did not like her as she put her back on the shelf."
</seg>
<seg id="11">
She repeated the same thing with three other underdogs before she finally decided that she liked nothing, moved back and forth.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
"She did not seem to bother that she was watching someone - or thinking about the person who might be buying the underhoses she had tried."
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Ms Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: "how disgusting to think that someone would take shelter with someone who had a different person and who was not washed."
</seg>
<seg id="14">
The incident occurred Tuesday afternoon.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Ms Davidson added: "as I have been told, the staff have tried to pull the garments out of the sale after it went - which is just as good."
</seg>
<seg id="16">
"I would hate to go home with a new pair of underhoses and find out that another woman had them and pulled out again and they did not wash."
</seg>
<seg id="17">
A Primark spokesman said: "Primark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday, August 9 at our store in Folkstone."
</seg>
<seg id="18">
All eligible products were pulled out of the sale.

How to protect yourself with krav Maga from gun attacks
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The world out there is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a bit safer for you.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a grandmaster of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Regardless of whether you are approaching you from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the tables for your robber.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
If you approach you from behind, you should first turn around so you can see your attacker and "get out of the firing line," Mizrachi says.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Then take the gun between your suburb and your shoulder before you hit him in the face with your free elbow.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Then beat him with his knee in the bar and twist, while the attacker crumbles in pain, hands the gun out of his hands, beat him with the run and move backwards while they turn the gun on him.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
With attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the firing line, seize the gun and twist it, so the attacker can 't shoot.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
At the same time, shift the weight to the gun and beat the attacker to the chest, then twist the gun out of his grip before moving backwards and put the gun on it.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Does it sound difficult?
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Watch the video to see exactly how it prefers Mizrachi.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
But remember that, in a robbery, it is safest to hand over your money - unless you are a krav Maga grandmaster.

Traveler Ian Wright slams for a travel guide his tongue at Europe's dirtiest places
</seg>
<seg id="2">
A British traveller underwent his immune system and Würgereflex of a serious examination - leaving some of the dirtiest and most eclectic places in Europe.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The presenter and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shouted his course on a euro note, a railing at the Piccadilly Circus, a sprinkling of a train toilet as well as a public phone in Russia to demonstrate the resilience of his immune system.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Before leaving each object, he used a luminometer to show up and show us what he is going to get into.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results to light.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The idea of leaking the wrinkles of a train toilette, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
On his trip through Europe, Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Fortunately, nothing left him, more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Mr Wright became known for testing the resilience of his intestine by traveling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
From public purses at stations to spot-buttons of toilets, the task put his immune system definitively under a sample
</seg>
<seg id="11">
In the film, he told reporters: "as a child, I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."
</seg>
<seg id="12">
In the film, he lived up to his reputation in any case.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
The only thing he opposed was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
His trial stroke showed a luminous number of over 4000 units.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
In comparison, the luminous number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to lick after their luminous number was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands one of less than 60
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Mr Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
In the film, he says,"that comes close to the worst I have got in a toilet."
</seg>
<seg id="19">
There is nothing more dirty than that!
</seg>
<seg id="20">
I am not going to spot anything here because it is ecclesiastical here.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
The company equips Mr Wright with Valio's freezer, which includes both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Valios senior Venice president for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we really wanted to offer consumers something new.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
We led crazy brainstormings that ended that we said "Let us call Ian."
</seg>
<seg id="26">
They claim that the interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon
</seg>
<seg id="27">
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a wider context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and, with the documentary, we have been able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
I also think the movie shows we have a great sense of humour!
</seg>
<seg id="30">
Tom HAKALA, who led the film's directing, added: "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had leaked some of the things I have instructed him to lick, like the eclectic Russian toilet shown in the film."
</seg>
<seg id="31">
Of course there were things where it was easier to get Ian to lick them and others where this was quite difficult.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
I am glad we have taken some of these dirty treats on film. "
</seg>
<seg id="33">
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of all respondents surveyed milk-acid bacteria in particular, with the well-being of stomach and intestine, and 58 percent said they at least occasionally use products containing attached lactic acid bacteria.

Asocial family destroys pre-delocation social housing in Saltash, Cornwall
</seg>
<seg id="2">
An asocial family left their social housing after a deluge with damage of £ 50,000 because it had terrorised their neighbours.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown out after a long list of complaints from their estate in Saltash, Cornwall.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
After being forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an irreparable state.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The walls had gaping holes, wooden diapers were ripped up, rubbish was scattered on the floor and graffiti was tasted to the walls.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The family have been resettled and it is thought she now lives in a private accommodation
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Donna McEvoy, who works for home administration at Cornwall Housing, said she feared the apartment was no longer to be repaired.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
She said: "it has been an absolute nightmare for people here and I am of the view that people do not have to live this way.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
There are many things to consider, as this property is likely to be considered as not so beautiful part of Cornwall.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
The family is notorious and their reputation is also.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime, and police said the terror that the family had inflicted had included street battles with baseball sleepers, intimidating residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive cries, strife and flukes.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, got an arrangement for anti-social behavior in June.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
In some rooms of the house that may be demolished, old garbage was found
</seg>
<seg id="14">
In the property in which drugs were traded in the past, the wooden diapers were ripped up
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Neighbors said they saw them fighting on the street and regularly called the police
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Cornwall Housing deluded her and her partner this week violently from the estate after giving them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to voluntarily pull out.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
The delogization was cheered by relieved neighbors who said their lives were made to hell.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
One said: "they did not care about anybody."
</seg>
<seg id="19">
We lived for 20 years next to them and it was always bad.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
"This morning we could not sleep."
</seg>
<seg id="22">
We stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it!
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Now where they are finally gone, it will be nice.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said the family had failed to cooperate with the local authorities.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
The family lived in the house, to which the police were called at regular intervals, for 20 years
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Rubbish and old toys were dumped on the overgrown side of the townhouse
</seg>
<seg id="27">
He added: "it is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and that of their family, as a delusion is always the last step that Cornwall Housing is considering.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
This was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be horrible for their neighbours.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
I appreciate all the work that has been done by my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and who have provided us with the information.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
I hope that this development will give some comfort to some neighbours and conveys the message that anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
FITZPATRICK said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
A dirty mattress left in one of the house's bedrooms after dehydration on the floor
</seg>
<seg id="33">
Home management workers will now have to clean up rubbish mountains that surround the house
</seg>
<seg id="34">
In 2014, the police carried out a raid in the house and found over 70g of cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash of £ 1,700.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
Skeldon received a fine after she pleaded guilty to possession of a class B drug in trading terms.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
She claimed the money was for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
After they were without shelter, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner now live in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
Many room walls of the house were smeared with graffiti.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
Police say they will delve tenants who do not adhere to house order
</seg>
<seg id="40">
Angela Crow of the Devon and Cornwall Police said that the delotion was a clear warning to the other tenants who do not abide by the house order.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
"This goes to those who think they can behave without self-accusation, as well as to those who have been harmed by such behavior," she said.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
The Devon and Cornwall Police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.

Tourists in Portugal panic after a tippling military jet beach overflies
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Sunseekers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
</seg>
<seg id="3">
A portuguese P-3C Orion plane of the Air Force set off an incredible fall flight
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The Air Force said it was on a training flight but insisted there was no safety risk
</seg>
<seg id="5">
This was the moment when frightened tourists begin to panic after a tipical jet crashed over a full beach.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Dramatic video footage showed how the military plane flew almost in tangible proximity over the sunbathers on the beach section in Aveiro in northern Portugal.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The holidaymakers jumped on when they understandably began to worry about the noise of the jet engines without first seeing what was coming through the clouds on them.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many holidaymakers who posted videos about the dramatic fly-By in social media, said: "it flew twice really deep and there was a moment when it looked like it was going to crash."
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Nuno Arroja added: "I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was down to me."
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were panicked when the plane came out of the darkness and went incredibly deep
</seg>
<seg id="12">
The Portuguese air force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to fly so deeply that this was the only way to detect them.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
The spokesman said that due to poor visibility conditions, the jet flew slightly deeper than usual due to poor visibility, but the air force insisted that security was at no time at risk.

Supercup: Barca with worries against Sevilla
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Sevilla - FC Barcelona struggles on Sunday to take the first step to the first title win in the new football season.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The Catalans are competing in the duel around the Spanish Supercup against FC Seville, the replay rising three days later at Camp Nou.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The Doublegewinner must dispense with the inferior cupfinalist and reigning Europa League champion, among others, on Neymar, who is contesting the Olympic soccer tournament with Brazil.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Also missing is Goalie Marc-Andre ter Stegen.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The German suffered a change in the knee in the course of the training, thus settling the question at Barca at least for the time being in favour of Claudio Bravo.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The Chilean International and Ter Stegen have been competing for status as number one in Barcelona for two years.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Coach Luis Enrique has thus far waived a clear decision in this regard, leaving Bravo in the league but Ter Stegen in most of the rest of the competitions.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Before the first game of the new season, there are doubts about the fitness status of the team, which was humiliated on Saturday in a test match of Liverpool with 0: 4.

<seg id="10">
Also at 3: 2 in the Probegalopp against Sampdoria on Wednesday, Lionel Messi and Co. did not really know yet.

Sevilla, in turn, has to digest the 2: 3 defeat after extension in the European Supercup against Real Madrid and is aiming for the second triumph at the "Supercopa de Espana".

Ma Long in a separate league to table tennis gold
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The 27-year-old defeated his countryman and "title defender" Zhang Jike 4: 0 (12.5.4.4) on Thursday in a one-sided final in Rio de Janeiro.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
That brings the world ranking first to the Golden Grand Slam with success at WM, World Cup, World Tour Finals tournament and Olympia.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The two Chinese made it into the final game as expected and made up the title with each other.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
It was clear that for the third time in succession a Chinese would pick up the single title in the sign of the five rings.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Last non-Chinese on the top Olympic staircase was former SVS-NÖ-legionnaire Ryu Seung-min of South Korea.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Ma and Zhang were left alone at the plate, between the sentences and on time-outs they had no coaches at all.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Those had retired to the gallery and left their butts in fair competition on their own.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
"The matches so far I have played for my country."
</seg>
<seg id="12">
"In the final I am playing for me," Zhang said folly.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
After the match, gold and silver medal winners with the China flag.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
The match itself was unexpectedly one-sided.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Ma had really struggled with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first set.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
After that, he set the pace at the plate and left Zhang with a total of 13 points.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
By the superiority of Ma, it did not develop the expected matching match.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
But there were still enough breathtaking balls to see.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Mizutani won the match for bronze against 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4: 1.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
The white rusher had suffered a rib injury in his quarter-final against German champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov, who was then in medical treatment, had to settle "ultimately" with Blech.

Donald Trump admits ″ huge problems ″ in election campaign
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The US Republican leadership is plagued by massive worries about losing its majority even in traditionally conservative states.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Presidential candidate Donald Trump has now admitted weaknesses of his election campaign in the former Republican stronghold of Utah.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
A rare moment in which the multi-millionaire and self-reliant multimillionaire said something like concerns, correspondents reported.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
After throwing 16 rivals within his own Republican camp out of the race, doubts are now growing about his success in the battle for the White House.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
"We have huge problems in Utah," said Trump before evangelical Christians he asked for support in key states such as Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Blaming false reports about his candidacy, he again picked up his familiar media credentials.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Republican strongholds wraps up
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Utah is usually a safe bank for the Republicans.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
According to a SurveyUSA survey in June, Trump and his rival, Hillary Clinton, were on an equal footing.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Other institutions see Trump ahead, but not by the distance that is common for Republican candidates in the state.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Arizona and Georgia are also considered at risk.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
In an interview broadcast by Sen. CNBC, Trump responded to the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton's march again: "just as I have done so far."
</seg>
<seg id="14">
And afterwards: this will be "either successful, or I will make a very nice, long holiday".
</seg>
<seg id="15">
He is doing nothing other than "telling the truth."
</seg>
<seg id="16">
If it was not rich for him in the end, for reasons of political correctness, that is fine, Trump said.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Then I return to a very good way of life.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
According to press reports, Trump's party should have threatened to withdraw funds to support his campaign, should he not be able to present better poll numbers.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Instead, the Republican Party's candidates for Congress should be given more support.

Olympics: triple fraud in doping test
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary commission on the case.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Kenya's athlete is in danger after the second doping affair at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
After a fraud attempt at a doping control in the Olympic village, Kenya sent a trainer home.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The International Olympic Committee said it would immediately set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
A Kenyan official had announced that the former sprinter and current coach, John Anzrah, had made a urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
This was reported to the team management of Kenya by the doping controllers.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The World Association of IAAF has asked the IOC for information on the case to appeal its own investigations, an IAAF spokesman said.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent actions of the IOC, the IAAF will make an assessment," it said in an IAAF statement.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
"He (Anzrah) has gone to the doping control station and has spent himself as Ferguson Rotich, the sample surrendered and signed," said Kenya's chief of mission Stephan Arap SOI.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
He was in possession of the athlete's accreditation, which was on the list for training inspections of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Ferguson Rotich was in Beijing World Cup fourth over 800 meters in 2015.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Four days earlier, Kenyan athletics delegation chief Michael Rotich had been stripped of the Rio Games.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
He is alleged to have informed his country's money payments athletes about upcoming doping tests.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Media reports said he was arrested on his return at Nairobi airport.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Kenya has been under special observation at the IOC after numerous doping offences.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
In announcing the more than 2000 doping target checks issued by the IOC before the Rio Games, it was unusually pointed out that particularly athletes from Kenya and Russia are being targeted.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
The World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
The law was passed a few weeks before the Olympics began.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
As a result, WADA took Kenya from the list of countries whose doping control is in line with WADA rules.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
Kenya is considered a major runner nation.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
The country's athletics won the most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
In a series of ARD television reports, there have been repeated accusations that doping funds are easily accessible in Kenya and that there should be a significant mentality of sports fraud.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
IOC member Richard Pound last called for a similar investigation into Kenya as he had employed them in Russian athletics.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
It has been demonstrated that there has been a systematic and systematic approach to this sport.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Russia's athletics were subsequently ruled out of the Summer Games.

Salzburg "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
</seg>
<seg id="2">
In the Shakespeare year, the Salzburg Festival presents the "West Side Story" with Tony and Mary as a tragic love pair, similar to Romeo and Julia.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
A musical conquered Salzburg: the "West Side Story", Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical to the Temple of Classic and performed a youth dream with the role of Mary.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
In the orchestra, the Simón Bolívar Orchestra led by the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "this music is full of rhythm," he joked.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
We always say that it is very Latin American.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
There are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
It is a wonderful blend, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
I would say that we have Bernstein's music really in our blood!
</seg>
<seg id="11">
In this staging, Bartoli plays an older Mary.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
She remembers with sorrow at her favourite with Tony, while the younger Mary plays and dances.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
First, because it is musically exceptional!
</seg>
<seg id="15">
And then there would be Marias personality.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
She says it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright."
</seg>
<seg id="17">
So she is wise, of course, also naive, and very passionate.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
"She is very similar to me, my Italian character, which I have as a Roman," laughs Bartoli.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
</seg>
<seg id="20">
It is such an honour for us to work with her.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
She is an immensely generous person.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an exceptional artist and very passionate!"
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Conducting is a necessity for him.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
You see it in any of his movements, in his eyes, it is his life!
</seg>
<seg id="25">
It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a cheerful approach to life, which is very important at all!
</seg>
<seg id="27">
For American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the "West Side Story" is highly topical: "this piece is about prejudice and fanaticism."
</seg>
<seg id="28">
Today we have the refugees, then the Puerto Ricans went to New York, and the New York residents did not want them.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
These are the same issues, and they are as meaningful today as they were then.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
59 years later, the piece is still relevant.

London schoolgirl who joined IS was killed in Syria
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Kadiza sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, reportedly died in Syria.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said her family learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
It was believed to have been killed by a Russian airstrike in Raqqa, the group's bulwark in the country, ITV News reported Thursday.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died shortly after she pretended to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
"One can only hope that the only good thing is - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - stopping people from ever making that decision," said Akunjee.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London climbed into a plane heading towards Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Sultana's family has been told that she has married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and, within a few months, became the widow.

Reid says Clinton will remain in the case of an election victory at Garland as a candidate for the Supreme Court
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell believes the next president will appoint the successor to the late judge at the Antonin Scalia Supreme Court.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Reid said Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects Clinton to select Garland "with some degree of certainty."
</seg>
<seg id="6">
A Reid spokeswoman later said he had not yet spoken to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland and he speculated.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team would not provide for unrest with a new candidate.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Garland is the top judge for the U.S. appeals court for the District of Columbia.
</seg>

Raid said Republicans blocked the Garland nomination, were lackeys and aides of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.

Treats wants Nacktkalendar for "women and for men"

The Treats magazine is working with photographer David Bellemere to bring out a 1970s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.

But instead of famous naked people, they would like to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muses Calendar for 2017.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Treats editor-in-chief Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude magazine differs from Oldschool-Playboys because "Playboy is for men."

I am doing this for women.

"We need to return to the depiction of timeless and classical nudity, in which both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body," Shaw said in a press release on the release of the calendars.

Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art.

Turkey: Kurdish community expects mass exodus
</seg>
<seg id="2">
"Anyone who does not adapt and praises Erdogan sits on packed suitcases," says the chairman of the Gülen-close foundation dialogue and world, Ercan Karakoyun.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
In the short term, the Kurdish community of Germany expects tens of thousands of asylum-seekers to flee from Turkey to Germany.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
In the medium term, it could even become "some hundreds of thousands", believes association chairman Ali Toprak.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Following the coup attempt by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan following the attempted coup, the Kurdish community is expecting a mass exodus to Germany.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
"In the short term, I expect tens of thousands, in the medium term, with a few hundred thousand asylum-seekers from Turkey in Germany, if the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," says association chairman Ali Toprak of the "world" of Friday.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Because the government overran Kurdish strongholds with punitive actions months ago, 500,000 Kurds inside Turkey were on the run.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
After the sworn coup, secular and opposition ethnic Turks would be added.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Many will want to start again in Europe if they continue to be oppressed in Turkey.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
"It cannot be that a state that takes even refugees is producing refugees in their own country," Toprak said.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
The association's leader lamented the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in ancient towns.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
As a result, Erdogan wants to increase exit pressure on the remaining Kurds.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
"They are the last large minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been eradicated or driven out in the last hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
The association chief demanded that the federal government "position itself as strongly as Austria against Erdogan and his supporters."
</seg>
<seg id="15">
In Germany, too, there is a "witch hunt" against Erdogan critics.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
I do not feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and opposition figures.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
The branding as a Gülen supporter destroys teachers and other academics.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
"Who does not adapt and praises Erdogan, sits on packed suitcases, by the way, the Kemalists and secularists," said Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen-near foundation dialogue and education, the "world".
</seg>
<seg id="21">
As the newspaper reported on the basis of figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Turks, even before the coup, represented the largest group of asylum seekers recognised for political persecution in Germany.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
At the date of 30 June, this was 11,386 people, representing almost 29% of the total eligible for asylum (39.625).
</seg>
<seg id="23">
This survey is not based on war, poverty or lack of prospects.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
According to the Basic Law, asylum is only justified politically, in other words by the state, individually persecuted.

Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania: "go where it hurts"
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals do not get anything from the summer election campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country day.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, they understood.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
In 2021, the election will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays, and the Schweriner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Because blighter than it has been so far, it is not: summer vacation, heat and land election campaign - that bites.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The locals, who are to be persuaded by the pollsters, are on vacation.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The vast majority of holidaymakers travelling in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so they are not allowed to choose the country day.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
In addition to this, there are practical problems: during the holidays, helpers hanging up posters, blowing up balloons, distributing flyers and counting votes at the end of the day are difficult to find.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Until September 4, 2016, the last day of the election, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania has yet to campaign.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
And it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD/CDU coalition, must fear for his office.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Exciting is how much novice AfD cuts off and what is left coalition dust.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Sellering, 66 years old and has been head of government since 2008, is making an almost unobtrusive campaign, seen by his granddaughters.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
He travels through the country, distributes roses and chats a little with the people, just as his legendary predecessor, Harald Ringstorff, did.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Otherwise, Seelering has got cold feet and is blaming Chancellor Merkel on the inheritance of the AfD.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Her refugee policy, her "We create that" has accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists, which is likely to cost him the nice job now.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
The CDU, with its top candidate, the Home Secretary Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it is like to campaign at the wrong time in the right place.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
She has invited twice chancellor Angela Merkel to major rallies; Merkel's federal election circle is in the northeast.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
But the target group did not vote, it was more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony than Mecklenburger and Vorpommern.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
"There was probably the majority from other states," said Vincent Kokert, general secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently in the NDR.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
But it is also a pity to anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Otherwise, the Northeast CDU largely abandons the usual campaign stalls on marketplaces and in front of shopping centers with umbrellas and air balloons.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
That, Kokert says, is just playing a "minor role."
</seg>
<seg id="25">
The Union, too, has noticed that it is basing itself on the land, that it has to make an effort to find a wire to the people.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
It is like the left, the SPD, the Greens: there is little in the way of the country.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
However, the CDU campaigner Kokert's advice to his fellow activists is also self-defeating: "you have to go where it hurts, that is where the people are: Dorffeste, golden weddings, every birthday party must be used".
</seg>
<seg id="28">
Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called his SPD for a particularly dedicated campaign.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
In surveys, the Social Democrats were last with 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just before the AfD (19).
</seg>
<seg id="30">
In the 2011 election, the SPD had still clearly won 35.6 percent ahead of the CDU (22).
</seg>
<seg id="31">
The Greens, small party with seven percent in the polls, are likely to make the leap into the country day.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
They make a modern virtue out of holiday hardship and largely put their campaign on the Internet.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
"Online campaigning", it calls the country's president Claudia Müller.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
Otherwise, green campaigners are embarking on track searches for local voters among holidaymakers.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, winds straight up with a houseboat through the mecklenburgic lakes and still finds it beautiful.

</seg>
<seg id="5">
That is a super team.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
There is also no delay.
</seg>

The construction site could be moved to the south at half-time by the end of October, and everything will be ready by the end of October.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Praise will also be given to those responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to setting up temporary vehicles.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Since the construction site migrated to the south on Monday, and the closure of the Aspergstrasse in Ofterdingen has been lifted and the connection to ROTTENBURG has been restored, the traffic situation within the village has been relaxed.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Citizens can now move from Ofterdingen from the B 27.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
The alternative traffic through the place seems to go back.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
"There were some significant complaints there," says the deputy chief executive, Florian King, who is responsible for the transport management of the remediation.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
The residents of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstrasse, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to contend with more traffic noise, because many trails were searched and more familiar to their Navi than the signage.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Which resulted in some lorries being frantic in residential areas.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
As the speed limits were also not observed, the municipality increased the measurement vehicle from Mössingen.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
"There were significant overruns," says King, who turned himself in on the location on the spot.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Two to three per minute have already been blown away.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
The quickest was traveling at 77 kilometers in the Tempo-30 zone.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Since the construction site has moved on, however, it has become calmer.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
For the business people at the B 27, it is only a small consolation that for customers from ROTTENBURG the road is now open again.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
Business people do not like to look in the cards.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
But the fact that the B 27-refurbishment has led to revenue collapses leaves everyone who is asked to look through.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
However, some are more and some less affected.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
Who has less to do with the "end customer", that is to say, for other companies, for which the restoration has little impact.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
Even in the case of the car company MAIER, Thomas Sulz speaks of a "slight decrease", but also admits that of course "the runner-up is missing".
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Most battered are the locals along the road.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the steakhouse, formerly crown, finds clear words.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
This is already a threat.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
Not just him, but all the restaurants have hit it "hard."
</seg>
<seg id="30">
Customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
We have to be happy about every euro sales.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
The revenue losses put it at "well over 50 percent."
</seg>
<seg id="33">
Road renovation has "thrown back its farm" by two years.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
Half of his staff have made him redundant.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been made redundant, the policy would have reacted differently.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
Instead, the President of the Government, Mr Jörg Schmidt, responded to a request from Göhner on whether there could be financial compensation, with the reference that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the benefits of the situation at the B 27. now, it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the refurbishment.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
Göhner knows from other counties where such a thing has been more generous.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
For all the complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
After all, the family business has been here since 1715, he points to the long history.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
He can understand that other regular guests are now less frequent because of the complicated traffic management.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
If you can 't drive, it is nice somewhere else.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
Göhner has no doubt that his regular clientele will come back after the end of the restoration work.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
Despite the crises with BSE and bird flu, Göhner is keeping the impact of the B 27 building on its clientele for the biggest crisis its restaurant has experienced in its long-running history.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
Six months of construction work, that is brutal.

It is constantly being screened in the name of the fight against terrorism.
</seg>
<seg id="2">
After the recent attacks, Interior Minister de Maizière is now presenting a thick security package.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
But what has a tolerance status to do with terror?
</seg>
<seg id="4">
And what does the coalition partner say to all this?
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Thomas de Maizière gives the reconciler.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
All his proposals are "politically reasonable" to the coalition partner, says the federal interior minister at the presentation of his new security package.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
They do not overdo anyone.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Other, more far-reaching points would first be discussed within the parties.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
I am also involved in this.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
As interior minister, however, he is interested in results and in a "achievable consensus" within the coalition.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Following the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, de Maizière has missed a little time before presenting his conclusions on security in the Republic.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
However, these are all the more extensive.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Something is already known, announced: that a new security authority should take care of the cracking of encrypted communication is not new.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Nor is the fact that Germany has to implement several EU requirements on passenger data and weapons law.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
The call for more video surveillance and personnel for security agencies is not surprising.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
In part, de Maizière is launching a second attempt at proposals that have not been made with the SPD: he wants to criminalize sympathy for terrorist groups and strip jihadists with dual citizenship the German passport.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
"That will be difficult points for the SPD," admits the CDU man.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
He still thinks that this is reasonable and I do not ask for anything, which is not a chance for the coalition partner anyway.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
A few new ideas also presents de Maizière.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
They have it in part: it plans fast-track procedures for deportation and more opportunities to incarcerate people from deportation.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
Refugees targeted in the country should first check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a security review.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
In the case of refuges for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse than before - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to conceal their identity.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Some of it is politically and legally sensitive.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
Some also do not work out and leave questions unanswered.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
And on a number of points, where there is unequal treatment, the question arises: what does this actually have to do with security and terror?
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Yes, de Maizière says it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
But it cannot be denied that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
Moreover, many people were worried about safety, given the high numbers of refugees.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
And things that people deeply employed could not be left out in election campaigns.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
Internal security has been very much in the spotlight.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
First the attacks in the neighbourhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
There is a great deal of uncertainty.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
And yes, there are election campaigns.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly in position on the subject of internal security.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
Over the past few days, it has been high between the two parties.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
Only a gardening dispute over equipping the federal police, then over a security policy collection of some Union interior ministers, in which the department chiefs also call for a burqa ban and a departure from dual citizenship.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
De Maizière is also looking for conciliatory tones.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
He does not think there is any departure from the double pass.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
We have been satisfied with the discussion in Germany.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
To reopen it does not make sense.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
And in a burqa ban, he has constitutional concerns.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
Whether his own package is constitutional on all corners, and whether it is actually "reasonable" for the coalition partner, has yet to show up.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
There is a lot in it that could cause a dispute.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
But the SPD, too, is currently trying to capitalise on the issue of internal security.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
Party leader Sigmar Gabriel has signalled a cautious willingness to talk and says: "the SPD is ready to talk about anything that helps to further increase security."

Volkswagen is still getting through.
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Despite diesel scandals, delivery figures rise worldwide
</seg>
<seg id="3">
But not all markets are running around.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
In the case of recall, there is a term.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Volkswagen will start deliveries in the second half of the year.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Despite diesel affidavits, Europe's largest car manufacturer has continued to show a plus in the past year, thanks to its many brands and some well-run markets.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
However, in July, the core brand VW weakened, especially in Western Europe, and thereby reaped the total sales, as notified by the company in the Dax.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Worldwide, the VW brand sold in July with 449100 cars 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous month.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
In Western Europe alone, after China the second most important market, sales were up 14 percent below the previous month.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
In Germany's home market, deliveries rose by almost one-sixth.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Brand sales chief Jürgen Stackmann led the weaker figures from July mainly to two sales days less in Europe.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
In addition, there has been a buying back in some core markets through "changing economic conditions".
</seg>
<seg id="13">
In addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey, the British voted to leave the EU, a spokeswoman said.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
In the US, where the exhaust affair escalated first, a minus is also on the way.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Great support for VW is the Chinese market.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Overall, the mainly affected domestic brand of Lower Saxony is still gagged by the diesel scandal: after the first seven months, it is only an extradition minus 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Group sales chief Fred Kappler continued to show a sales stream from January to July.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen in that time, worldwide 5.904 million.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Volkswagen had tampered with a software exhaust test.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
In Germany alone, VW is calling around 2.5 million cars for conversion to the workshops.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
In the course of the conversion, VW confirmed that the conversion of cars has no negative impact.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
After the conversion of the vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
The car manufacturer provides the customer with a "guaranteed" certificate after the conversion, but I am not talking about a "guarantee", as was stated in the company circles on Friday.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
The reason for this is legal niceties.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen now guarantees its German customers a guarantee for converted diesel models.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
This would have confirmed VW representatives in the Federal Transport Ministry last Monday.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
The Ministry of Transport confirmed that there was this meeting.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
"VW must fully comply with the conditions of my commission of inquiry and the KBA."
</seg>
<seg id="29">
"Deviations from them will not be accepted," said Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), according to the ministry.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
VW has taken over the guarantee that there will be no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power after the conversion and that all type-approval relevant vehicle values remain unchanged.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
Volkswagen itself uses the term "guarantee" but not, as it was said in corporate circles.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
With the broad term "guarantee", Volkswagen sees the possibility that, for example, customers will be able to come back to the new software half a year after conversion - and this could return to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
It is also important, in the interests of the customer, to avoid the possibility that any other damage that has nothing to do with the Abgassal scandal will lead to uncertainty regarding possible warranty arrangements, as has been said.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
That is why VW does not use the term ' guarantee '.

Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee demands punitive interest rates from wealthy savers - as the second institute in Germany.
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Bank chief Josef Paul said Thursday: "it is only about 139 customers who parked 40 million euros on giro or daytime bank accounts."
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The German Bundesverband Deutscher Banken speaks of an individual case and does not see it as a signal: normal savers would have to "not worry about paying for their Spartan penalty."
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Camp banks money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they have to pay their 0.4 percent penalty rate.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
As of September, Raiffeisenbank Gmund will require private and corporate customers to spend more than 100,000 euros on giro or daily money accounts.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
</seg>
<seg id="7">
"The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year," Paul said.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
He has been hitting EUR 40 million for some time, which could be lifted from one day to the next and which he could not use.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
"Those are with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent costs," the bank chief said.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
"I cannot lay down for every million 4000 euros."
</seg>
<seg id="11">
In accordance with the ' polluter pays ' principle, the cost is now continuing.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Leaving the cash simply in the Raiffeisenbank's coffers would be far too dangerous: "I have already experienced four assaults, I do not want to be the fifth!" said the bank board.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Most customers would have understood and switched to other forms of investment.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Only a few migrated to other banks.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
The Bavarian Cooperative Association said: "the ECB's extreme monetary policy is causing significant costs at all banks."
</seg>
<seg id="16">
To wear it on its own is ' not possible in the long term '.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or transfers.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
With punitive interest rates for deposits from three million euros, the Thuringian People and Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land had made headlines with its Skatbank branch in 2014.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Michael Kemmer, chief executive of the banking association, said: "we do not expect private customers to pay nationwide fees for deposits, the competition in Germany among banks and savings banks is far too strong."
</seg>
<seg id="20">
One banker said that at Tegernsee, there is "a clientele that is somewhat more exuberant from the assets."
</seg>
<seg id="21">
"That can become a problem for a small bank" if it hires free money.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
The cooperative bank Gmund, founded in 1911, has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Well-known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
The Bavarian Confederation "is currently not known to any other banks that charge an outlay for deposits from private customers," said spokesman Ernst.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
The President of the Bundesverband der deutschen Volksbanken und Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), Uwe fröhlich, declared at the end of June: "the threshold to go negative towards the private customer is very, very high".
</seg>
<seg id="26">
The competition is tough, and it drops the drain on investors.

Destination plates: who is actually buying records?
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Lonely middle-aged men love plates.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Before you rush to the commentary to sow it under the pseudonym of non-alleys with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
According to YouGov, the much-discussed resurgence of records is not due to a boom in millennials who want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Those who have recently bought a plate are most likely to be aged between 45 and 54.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
In fact, the 18-24 age group is the most unlikely buyer group.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
It is also not hordes by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers are more likely to keep their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).
</seg>
<seg id="8">
But do the results of YouGov vote?
</seg>
<seg id="9">
If this blog were a news report on television I would follow the camera while running in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest grey suit, wearing a modest gray suit before standing, holding my hands and saying something determinate like: "so let us take a closer look at it."
</seg>
<seg id="10">
So, let us take a look at it.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Even though the heart of Sohos is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were based - there are still a handful of fantastic record stores.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, in which I am in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to gauge their age and mind through observation.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I got from Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men of middle age) into Reckless Records (data number: eight men middle age, a woman, presumably around the 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Is he a collector, I ask?
</seg>
<seg id="15">
"I appreciate already," he says.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), dress up the walls of his living room.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
The reason he owns such a significant number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and again bought items he sold when he was young and plucked.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
"A lot of things I buy are from the late sixties, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12, things where I was probably a little too young to buy them," he says.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
He agrees that those who buy plates are more introverted and would like to spend time alone, adding: "I do not smoke and I do not drink very much.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
That is my truck.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many clients he meets will apply to the YouGov profile.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media pub, people who have heard about the comeback and are looking to buy back their old records.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
From the conversations I have had, people usually got rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records again," he says.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
That would explain the boom to supporters of the record reviewer of a certain age.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
But what about the supposed emotional importance of plates?
</seg>
<seg id="28">
It only takes a few seconds in a store like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a reassuring community of like-minded people.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
According to WEZ, some of the older customers took advantage of the contactless payment system.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record hulls, of objects that call for happy youth memories.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation," says WEZ.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
That is so with me as a collector and I think it is like that with a lot of people.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
It is an easy way to deal with mentally.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
"We are like their social workers!" flutes an employee from a record stack.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
An ICM poll in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who bought a plate last month had not heard it yet.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not own a record player.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
At this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried while blowing through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.

Jonny, 42, who works at sounds of the Universe (data number: three men of middle age), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revival.

"Someone just came here recently and said, ' I do not have a record player, but I would love to buy a Radiohead record so I can put it on the shelf, '" he says.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
More product-laser, less musical.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
We have people who say,"I do not have a record player."
</seg>
<seg id="43">
These are younger people, not older ones, who are slow to come out.

It is easy to hear music from a computer or other way, but the beauty of plates is... " she drives off with a loving sigh.

Nobody sees them - perhaps because they are merely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.
</seg>
<seg id="58">
It is pure "record art."
</seg>
<seg id="59">
But given that any attraction for these items means more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain about.
</seg>
<seg id="60">
It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends most on luxury items like plates.
</seg>
<seg id="61">
Even though my research revealed that YouGov's results are true, they, at least in record stores in Soho, do not take into account the large number of female collectors and record lovers who exist in reality, record shops and in online forums.
</seg>
<seg id="62">
These people probably work hard at school or in offices.
</seg>
<seg id="63">

French court rejects bid over demolition of shops in jungle refugee camp
</seg>
<seg id="2">
A French court has rejected an offer by authorities in Calais to crack down dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the jungles of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
At a court hearing this week, authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorized to tear down 72 provisional stores where people inside the camp are selling goods ranging from cigarettes to energy drinks, offering hairdressers, or selling tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in makeshift restaurants.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The Calais prefecture argued that these places should be torn down because they would be a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and that pose a fire and sanity risk.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important because the free meals offered by the government-backed association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
They also said that the makeshift shops and restaurants would often provide shelter and free meals for people in need.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of people running the 72 provisional shops, but admitted that the concerns of Calais prefecture were "absolutely understandable."
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The judge Jean-François Molla said the grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than merely feeding people who "live in extremely precarious conditions."
</seg>
<seg id="9">
He said the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
One of the places threatened by the rainfall was the Jungle Book Kids ' Café of the camp, which is commonly operated, and 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as advice on asylum matters for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
More than 170,000 people signed the petition to protect the kids ' cafe.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
In a letter to the Guardian, it said the closure would be "a disaster for these children, the youngest of whom is eight years old."
</seg>
<seg id="13">
The two aid agencies Help Refugees and L ' Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp had risen to over 9000 people - the highest number so far - after a sharp rise in newcomers over the summer.

Here comes the Enforcement trailer
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Germany's Raser must adapt to the next generation of speed knives: in various German states, including Hesse and Brandenburg, new flash devices are being tested, which are meant to be particularly effective.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The futuristic Enforcement trailer of the Vitronic company from Wiesbaden can be used, for example, at accident points where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
For example, at highway construction sites or rehabilitating bridges with temporary speed, there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that the speed limit is observed with a stationary flash.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
However, a permanent mobile structure can be too dangerous or costly.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The Enforcement trailer is self-sufficient: its battery holds five days for continuous measurement operation, and the case data is transmitted encrypted over a modem.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Laser measuring technology can also cover all vehicles across multiple tracks simultaneously.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Variable speed limits as well as transit bans after time, driving strips and vehicle class can also be monitored.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
In high condition you can move the trailer, according to the manufacturer, with each car with trailer clutch.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
In order for it not to be simply cloned, it is lowered in the measurement operation, so that the wheels disappear in the armored and, by the way, shot-proof external hull.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
In addition, a built-in alarm system is designed to protect the flash from vandalism.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Since 2015, according to Vitronic, the trailer has been tested in various federal states and is now also used.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Foreign authorities also flash the new technology: recently, France has recovered 100 pieces, following an order of 150 pieces last year.

Britain pick silver in 7-man rugby after Fiji Masterclass gold Holt
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Britain's impressive performance at 7-under rugby came in the final on Thursday night to an abrupt stop at the last hurdle in the form of the Fijis when they were beaten with a score of 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Fiji gave a master class in handling, side-Stepping, relegation, line runs and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The defeat was sweetened by the not-too-poor consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could well be proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The Boks ' clear defeat, 7-5 in the semifinals on the same day could fall back on them in the final.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
But regardless, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in the best form in this form.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
It could be a consolation for GB - but will probably not - that at least one Briton will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
GB had a difficult road behind.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Eight years ago, they lost under Ryan every game at the Adelaide sevens.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Here, they lost only one.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
This sleep will hurt, but the progress is amazing.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Fiji started wonderfully and let the attacks GBS out of fun.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
The World Series winners went 5-0 up when Osea Kolinisau rallied in the corner.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
With still four minutes of playing time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner he converted.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
A heaving run by Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa reaching a third gate, but it only stopped Fiji.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua put a touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Nakarawa added a new one since the rematch and there was still over a minute of playing time... in the first half.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Vatemo Ravouvou pressured through further weak Tacklings of the GB team and stormed to the line to make a gate.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
The conversion brought a 29-0 lead to the break.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
It is as if Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB still learns.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
That is how it is.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
GB led fundamental changes at half-time and closed the Fijian gap... for whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half, until Josua Tuisova went through after a brilliant midplay from Fiji.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
Dan Norton launched an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game had long been in favor of South Texans, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced in the grandstand.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
It was not hard to admire Fijis's playful approach.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Mata Viliame set the i-goaltender with another try in the final seconds.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
The Pfiff tweeted, the Fijis hugged themselves and GB kicked smashed in the lawn.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
Earlier in the day, Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi-finals with 20-5 defeats and Britain pushed South Africa in a tight semi-final match from the race - Britain's conversion of the difference.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
Kyle Brown brought the Boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate under the posts in the second half.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
A brilliant late Tackling of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.

Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by battle with trainer's cancer to rowing victory
</seg>
<seg id="2">
There will be no more emotive gold than in these games, and that is what they want.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
From the first rowing strike to the last, 220 hard Hieve that went into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an extra meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Even if it was only those who sat at the helm, there were three voices in the boat, the echo of the trainer Robin Williams, who was present at the second Olympics in succession without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British sport who set such a benchmark.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Their dominance was absolute, after all, their 39th unprotected use, which is also unprecedented.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
What we see are two brilliant athletes who glide over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the nature of triumph.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Behind every gold in the rowing is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental advances that make up the difference and no one was more helpful than the coach who, 30 months ago, did not know if he would survive that day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
As he said, he was risky.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
I had bladder cancer, which is operable and they did.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
If you do not, it is spreading everywhere.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
It changes a little bit of the outlook.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
The trio was lucky that he was able to start treatment in early 2014, outside the season, which kept the break to a minimum, in case that is the right term in such circumstances.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
I needed money, so I had to get better soon.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
It was an incentive.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would be enough.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
That is how it starts.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Rowing in itself is a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
In the immediacy of victory, her first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve-wracking morning talking a bit more than usual, trying to process his own fears.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
Stanning, who was a principal in the Royal Artillery Regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, said "I was an emotional wreck this week, which is perhaps something extreme, but it means so much."
</seg>
<seg id="22">
It just repeats how much I mean, how much I and Helen and Robin have worked.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
It has been three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
Without Robin we would be no one, so a massive thank you to him, he is the best coach in the world.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
I could not have a better person to train or want a better coach.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
The pair had a tough rhythm with which their opponents could not compete.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
Even in the last 500 meters, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to catch up, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
We were caught very much at the moment.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
Helen called "stay in the process, stay in the process."
</seg>
<seg id="31">
It is really important not to get carried away.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
We had a good start and at the same time we were not looking to make something Tolles.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
We did not want fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, which is what we did.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
The couple will take a time-out for a year before making any decisions about his future.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
Glover must appear next week at a wedding, her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
I did not want to say that was my last race.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
That would have meant too much pressure.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
In London, it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
It took about four minutes.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
That feels so much better," she said.

31 years of exemplary clarity
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The managing director of the water association "Veitensteingruppe", Ruppert Göller, is retiring.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The association is regarded as a "Bavarian model".
</seg>
<seg id="4">
A small Franconian drinking water association as a role model for the big water producers.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
That is how it was said some time ago in the original tone in a post by the Bavarian radio.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Little later, the Water Forum of the Government of Lower Franconia paid tribute to the association.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The work of the Veitensteingruppe yellow "bayernfar as exemplary".
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Behind all this is Rupert Göller, who has been a member of staff for 31 years, 28 years as managing director.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
He was now retired at the age of 65.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
The drinking water association of the Veitensteingruppe, based in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, promotes about 150000 cubic meters of water annually and provides 32 places and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
The municipalities are the municipalities of Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
There are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
The current chairman, Breitbrunns Mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was recruited as a water wart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Purpose Federation in 1988.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
"His duties have been very diverse and they ranged from water management and maintenance work to office and organizational activities, budgeting, calculating fees and contributions to emergency operations at weekends," the chairwoman said.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
As outstanding events it called the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells (1994), land acquisitions in the area of new wells (1998) and compensation for farmers, the rehabilitation of the reservoirs (1999), the acquisition of a central computer control (2004) and the partial renewal of water pipes.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
There has been no standstill, and there have been repeated innovations because water is living and drinking water is the most important food.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
In her Laudatio, she praised Göller's faithful, reliable and correct service over 31 years.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
He has worked with a great deal of heart for his water purifier, and he has lived up to the water purifier as if it were his own company.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
A few weeks ago, as a true practitioner, he was able to present the concept of success of the Veitensteingruppe to reduce nitrate before the Water Forum of the District of Lower Franconia.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
He has received a great deal of recognition and praise for this.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
Rupert Göller, for his part, praised water wart Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
He is the best water goalkeeper and he was a faithful crisp.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Together we were an unbeatable team.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
As highlights from his point of view, he described the Brunnenbau and the restructuring of the purpose association.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
The biggest challenge and the most difficult use, however, was the piping on the high container at Kirchlauter on a 3 January.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night so that the villages could be supplied with water.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
It was also possible to maintain the supply of Neubrunn, because it was filled with hoses.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
The management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who is the successor of Rupert Göller.

Steel - A ray of hope for the German steel industry
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The crisis-ridden and energy-intensive German steel industry has been spared millions of euros in additional costs.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Financial strains that have threatened the industry from eco-electricity extraction are off the table.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
It stands by the exemption from the renewable energy levy in the inventories of the German steel industry, said Federal Economics Minister Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition).
</seg>
<seg id="5">
"I am really pleased that we have finally been able to achieve this after two years of tough negotiations."

The European Commission had initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption.

The steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year, according to the German industry association.

Only when the generators are replaced in the steel works will there be an EEG surcharge of 20%.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
But this, too, is not being raised in the steel industry.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the EU Commission on its own production.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
This will largely establish the status quo of the previous regime.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Gabriel's successful effort for the steel industry was particularly important.

"In terms of our ' steel ' campaign, this is a first step."
</seg>
<seg id="15">
"Others have to follow."

<seg id="16">
"Even in the reform of the emissions trading trade, climate and employment targets are to be weighed up," said IG Metall chief Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
The steel industry in Europe has been suffering from overcapacity and a significant price pressure since the 2008 financial crisis.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Last year, the situation continued to deteriorate as the world's largest producer country threw massive steel onto the world market in the face of weakening domestic demand.

European manufacturers throw out Chinese steel group price dumping
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Over the course of this spring, the situation has been somewhat relaxed.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
On the one hand, import duties imposed on imported steel have an effect; on the other, the economic outlook in China has brightened.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.

German industry primus Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
Most recently, prices would have been more stagnant.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
The industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Last but not least, ThyssenKrupp did not want to rule out closures of individual works.

<seg id="27">
Some 86000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015.

In July, German steel manufacturers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
They produced, with 3.4 million tons, well six percent less crude steel than in the previous month, the economic association Stahl said on Friday.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
After a brief increase in May, the manufactured crowd now went back the second month in a row.

Community, mind, health: singing does seniors well
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, she studied music and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
"Singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
After a sample, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall alive, she says.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
By the way, she is doing something good for her health and her mind.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Because singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the German Senior League.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded the joy of music, describing Hackler.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Through regular meetings, seniors can establish and maintain social contacts.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Because social and family structures are often solved in old age, a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "to speak out and organize, to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of interaction".
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Singing can be exhausting in the positive sense, says Hackler.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Because of this, seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
If you ask for your lungs regularly, you will not be able to get out of the pste as quickly as possible.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Even when it comes to getting the sound of voice in age, singing is an ideal hobby.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
To older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz of the federal labor community of senior civil organizations.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
In the older generations, the common singing had a much higher priority, it belonged to everyday life, both at school and in leisure, she explained.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Lenz frequently observed that singing or listening to songs in older people raises many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their teenage years.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Through lyrics and especially melodies, even dementia sufferers remember long past events.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
When singing, the head is also required to perform a special performance, explains Lenz.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
To concentrate at the same time on your own voice and on a predetermined rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
Especially older people, who live on their own, do not just focus on themselves.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
Another positive aspect is the recognition of the singing in the choir, Hackler said.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
Also, self-esteem grows by singing in the choir.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
To show yourself: if I am long for something, I will get better and wake up beyond me - this experience strengthens.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Good reasons to start singing, so there is enough.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
Anyone who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he feels to have little talent, Lenz advises.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
You are not singing alone - at 50 singing people, who is listening when a sound goes next?
</seg>
<seg id="29">
In search of the appropriate offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
Singing someone from the acquaintance in a senior choir, you can easily join.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the surrounding area.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
If you want to sing in a church choir, you can go directly to the town or church.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
Many seniors can also be found on the Internet.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
Anyone who does not have access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbors to help with the Internet search.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
Anyone who wants to sing should definitely join a choir, advises Hackler.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that applies to any age.

Cats react more sensitively than hangover to cries of young animals
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Biologists have studied in Hanover what effect the rowing of cat babies has on adult animals.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
To her surprise, the males did not leave the males cold, but they were always the same as the females.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Female cats can recognize the degree of excitement of cat babies at the mixing of the little ones.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
They respond by 10 percent faster to sounds of kittens who choose in great distress, as scientists have found out from the animal medical college and the Medical University of Hanover (MHH).
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Hangovers also respond to the cries of kittens - but always the same.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
"Apparently, the acoustic differences between the inhibition of less and heavily drowned young animals for the males are either unperceivable or not of significance," said the biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
She is an author of the study, which was published this Friday in the trade magazine "BMC evolutionary Biology."
</seg>
<seg id="9">
In a previous investigation, the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the kitten cries differed with the urgency of their need for assistance.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
A total of nine adult cadres and eight females were observed from the MHH animal husbandry.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
They were played for three minutes from the sausage box and separated from the mother and siblings.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
On the other hand, they were confronted with cries of more excited kittens, which were raised in addition.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
The researchers hold their findings despite the low sample for meaningful.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
"All females, even those who had not yet had their own offspring, reacted differently to the cries," Konerding said.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
They turned faster to the loudspeaker when that call played out of the much more drowning kittens.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
This ability may be innate or develop with sexual maturity.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
"A surprise was that the males reacted at all," the biologist said.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
In the past, scientists have already examined the reactions of women and men to baby noise on a number of occasions.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Also, some studies showed that women were more sensitive to infants, whether they were mothers or not, the biologist Marina Scheumann reported.

Podolski attacks ' gala ' after Supercup
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
In Turkey, an arrest warrant has been issued against former football star Hakan Sükür.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
For the first time after the attempted coup, a major football match is taking place in Turkey.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Before the duel of the archrivals between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolski's Galatasaray Istanbul around the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: "business as usual".
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Even when the state of emergency was declared after the attempted coup in July, the government insisted that the daily lives of ordinary citizens should not be affected.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
This does not, however, apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is responsible for the attempted coup.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
This does not stop before football.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
The prosecution issued an arrest warrant against former strongman Hakan Sükür.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Thus, the South American now living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
South Africa is said to be supporters of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is blamed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup attempt.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
It is true that the state of emergency imposed for 90 days is still in force until October, but in fact it has virtually no effect on the lives of most Turks.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
The nightly "democracy guards" in public places across the country, Erdogan said Wednesday.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Sport - like the whole country - is divided into supporters and opponents of Erdogan.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Especially fans of the workers ' club Besiktas are traditionally not among the president's friends.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
What unites the majority of Turks, however, in the face of dramatic experiences in history, is the strict rejection of military coups.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
At Pokalwinner "Gala" it will come back to Lukas Podolski again.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
The Kölner in the past season proved his athletic value: with 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions, the 31-year-old finished his first season as the top scorer of his club.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
In the final game against Fenerbahce, he scored the 1: 0 victory.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
The newspaper "Fanatik" cheered him: "he was the best in the place."
</seg>
<seg id="23">
He finished the season in an excellent way and his team secured the Cup.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
Thanks to "Poldi," the disappointing season for the record champion was a conciliatory finish.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
After the pre-round K.o in the Champions League, the "lions" also dropped out in the Europa League early on.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
In the South Lig, it was only to rank six.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
The season was not good.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
The Cup was the only way to win something.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
"That is what we did and that is the most important thing," said Podolski.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
For Masters Besiktas, the game year ran better.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who, with 26 seasons as a South Florida goalkeeper, put the base to the 14th title.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
That is also the reason fans continue to hope for the 31-year-old's return.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
In the case of the AC Florence under contract and Besiktas only borrowed Gomez after the attempted coup, he announced that he had failed to return because of the political situation in the country after his EM holiday.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say it," said the trade magazine "Kicker" club chief Fikret Orman.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
To do this, however, the Stürmer would have to be prepared to renounce about a third of his annual salute estimated at 7.5 million euros, Orman said, adding: "his salary at Florence we cannot pay."

Despite doping: these athletes still have medal chances at Olympia in Rio
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The 34-year-old Justin Gatlin has already been jailed twice for doping (2001 and 2006).
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblowerin Julia Stepanowa is not allowed to start in Rio.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Other overturned athletics scorers can only laugh at this - they are fighting in Rio for medals.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The issue of doping remains the headlines at the Rio Olympics.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The Russian swimmer Julija Jefimowa, who complained about her starting right just before the Games after a doping ban, was mercilessly paused and booted out at her start (100 meters).
</seg>
<seg id="7">
It offered a bizarre scenery: with a raised smile, she was still stumped into the hall and had provoked with her appearance.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
When determined that she would not get gold, the audience broke into a jubilant storm.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
But there are many other athletes who go to the Olympic Games in Rio, despite the doping past.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Here is an overview:
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100-m-staple/USA): the 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
He had already been jailed two times for doping (in 2001 and 2006 to 2010).
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Since his spell, the 2004 Olympic champion and ex-world champion runs even faster than before, he is over 100 m in 9.80 seconds the number one in the world and is regarded as the biggest challenger by Usain Bolt.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100-m-Staffel/Jamaica): the two-time Olympic champion and seven-time world champion had to sit down a six-month lock in 2010 after it proved the intake of the painkiller Oxycodon.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
She had strong toothache after an operation, defending the 29-year-old.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Sandra Perkovic (Discus/Croatia): in 2011, the 2012 Olympic champion, world champion of 2013 and European champion from 2010 to 2016 tested positive for the banned stimulant medium methylhexanamine.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Perkovic denied the knowingly ingested and was jailed for six months.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
The four widest worshippers this year go to the account of the big gold favorites.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400-m-Staffel/USA): the Beijing Olympic champion and two-time world champion over 400 metres, was positively tested in 2010 and jailed for 21 months.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
One of the means of pencilling was responsible, Merritt said.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
This year, the 30-year-old is over 200 and 400 m the world's fastest man so far.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
Iwan Tichon (Hammerthrow, Belarus): hardly an athlete has been deprived of so many medals afterward.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
So Tichon lost his 2005 World Cup title nine years later after being identified with testosterone doping.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
The 40-year-old also had to surrender Olympic silver in 2004 because of steroid doping and the 2006 EM title because of testosterone abuse.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
He also received the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games because of a ruling by the International Sports Court of CAS.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
At 80.04 m, he is on rank two of the world rankings.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
Liu Hong (20 km walking, China): the world record holder and gold favorite was tested positive only in May, but may still start in Rio.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
The 29-year-old World Championship found evidence of the use of a banned dietary supplement, the blocking of the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA was mild and went off as early as July 13.

Bomb blast in Thailand - Austrians injured - multiple deaths
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The Austrian embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, said the Foreign Ministry spokesman, Thomas Schnöll, Friday morning.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
She suffered cutting wounds and was treated in hospital, but has already been able to leave.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Her home trip was scheduled for early September.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
It is still unclear whether the further explosions on the island of Phuket and the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang NGA, Trang and Chumphon also affect Austrian citizens.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The Foreign Ministry is in constant contact with local authorities in this regard, Schnöll said.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
In the approximately 200 kilometers (30 miles) south of the capital, Bangkok, Hua Hin was first seen exploding two bombs in a nightclub on Thursday night.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
According to police, a Thai woman was killed and some 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Friday morning, two explosive devices went up again, and another person was killed, according to the authorities.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Phuket also reported a bomb explosion in the morning.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
A taxi driver was injured in the detonation near the Badestrands Patong, which was popular with holidaymakers.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Another bomb exploded in Surat Thani on the country's southeast coast, killing an urban employee.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
The explosive device had gone into the air, according to authorities in a flower shelter in front of the site of the coastal police.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Finally, detonations in Phang NGA and Trang on the southwest coast, as well as in Chumphon, on the southeast coast, claimed several injured.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
One would go from a link to the explosions in Hua Hin, it said.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
"The bombings carry the same handwriting," said army general Danai Kritmethavee Friday morning before journalists.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
"We assume that this is a coordinated attack."
</seg>
<seg id="18">
It is too early to comment on possible motives, but it is probably the actions of Muslim rebels.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Thai media also wanted to identify a pattern in the attacks, typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
The Thai police, however, said the attacks were not related to the Islamist insurgency or with international terrorism.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
"That is just local sabotage, which is restricted to limited areas and provinces," said a spokesman in Bangkok.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
Rather, it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Authorities would have received intelligence evidence of imminent attacks in the south of the country in the past few days - though they had not been informed of the exact timing and location.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
Police instructed their officials across the country to step up security around key government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
There are always smaller bombings in Thailand, but they are mostly not against tourists.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
In Hua Hin is a palace used for years by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
After the current bomb explosions, the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends on its website to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
High security risk (level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla, as well as Preah Vihear and the surrounding area.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
There is no need to travel to these provinces after disputes between security forces and Muslim populations.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
Increased safety risk (Level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
The attacks on Thursday and Friday came a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
It also gives the military great influence in the years to come.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
Junta chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs had been an attempt to create chaos as the country moves toward stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
The military unta, which seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, is benefiting itself in bringing the kingdom back to stability and order.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
However, the military has also failed to rein in the insurgency of Muslim rebels, which has been languishing in the far south of the country for years.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
More than 6500 people have already been killed in the conflict.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
Just under a year ago, in Bangkok, 20 people were killed in an attack on a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
It was the bloodiest attack in the country's recent history.

The right-wing "identity movement" has been targeted by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection.
</seg>
<seg id="2">
According to several national offices, the constitutional protectors in the federation have also placed the group under observation.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
"We see in the ' identitarian movement ' evidence of aspirations against the liberal democratic basic order," said constitutional protection chief Hans-Georg Maaßen of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Thus, immigrants of Islamic faith or of the Middle East are being defamed in an extremist manner.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
That is why we are watching the movement.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The "identitarian movement" is a grouping with French roots, which has been active in Germany since 2012.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
It is opposed to "multiculturalism","uncontrolled mass immigration" and the "loss of its own identity by over-alienation".
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Constitutional protectors in nine states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hesse, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - are already watching the "identitarian".
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Maaßen said his authority had agreed closely with the national offices in the decision.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
"Groups like the ' identitarian movement ' are trying to pick up their target group where it stands," said the constitutional protection chief.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
In general, extremists try to raise them with youthful language, often with pop music.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Islamists as well as right-wing extremists.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
This is not an advertisement for your own cause.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
The propaganda is supposed to appeal to people emotionally.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Young people are particularly vulnerable.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
This is dangerous.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Most recently, there have been reports from several federal states about contacts of "identifiers" to AfD politicians.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Maaßen said he did not have any findings.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
For constitutional protection, possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point of view.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
It depends on whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - by certain individuals who are extremist, changes their target and becomes so extremist.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
The decisive factor, therefore, is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
This is not apparent.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
In view of the marked increase in the number of crimes committed and attacks on asylum seekers and refugees, he said that he would not speak of new right-wing terrorism in this context.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
In recent years, however, we have found that there can be right-wing terrorist structures.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
There was the Old School Society or the Freital Group.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
It may well be that there are other right-wing extremist groups or micro-groups who are planning attacks against asylum seekers, against refugees or attacks from other extremist motives.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
However, a Germany-wide or Europe-wide control of right-wing terrorism is not visible.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
The previous groups were created at the regional level or in social networks.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
Worried about the fact that there were many attacks on the account of people who had not previously appeared on the right scene.
</seg>

Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes Internethit
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The Olympic Games or world records do not always determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
This shows the courageous performance of Robel Kiros Habte at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
In the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia was so slow that he could not be seen in the TV pictures at times.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
He just disappeared - no matter how far the cutout was selected.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
In the social networks, Habte subsequently became a viral internethite.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
In fact, the 24-year-old finished his previous run with a back-to-back 48 seconds and clinched the 59th place of 59 starters.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
But it was rather his not exactly sporting figure that attracted the attention of the international media.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Why the 24-year-old still participates in the Olympics?
</seg>
<seg id="10">
The Ethiopian got a special start from the international swimming federation.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
This is distributed to make swimming in under-represented countries more known.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Since most athletes are running in aesopia, Habte simply wanted to do something else.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Preparation is all: Robel Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
The first nicknames quickly made the round.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Some media described him as "Robel the Wal."
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Following a "welfare bite", the English tabloid "The Sun" was funny with "Dad Bod".
</seg>
<seg id="17">
His time, he first struck with a minute and nearly five seconds left over the 100-meter freehand, played no role there.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
At the 2000 Sydney Olympics, the run of Eric Moussambani provided media attention.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to compete on his own in an advance over 100 metres.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
Frenetic, Moussambani was fired at the time.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
The then 22-year-old first learned to swim eight months before Olympia and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.

An electric delivery vehicle from Deutsche Post in action.

<seg id="4">
The Post is planning to sell its electric vehicle streetscooter as well.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Shortly, the Group intends to start trading with the transporter.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The Post wants to offer its electric transporters on the free car market as of next year.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
"We want to get into the sale to third parties," a Post spokesman said Friday.

The company has been checking for months whether to sell its self-developed streetscooter, with the letters and packs, to other establishments as well.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Post Board Chairman Jürgen Gerdes had said that there are always enquiries, for example from craftsmen.

GfK leader resigns after disappointing business figures
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The consumer research company GFK is replacing its boss Matthias Hartmann.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The resignations came suddenly - but not entirely surprising.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The difficult situation of the market research firm GFK allowed the chair of CEO Matthias Hartmann to be all the more insecure the longer the success he promised.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Turmoil at the head of the Nuremberg-based market research firm GFK: after once again disappointing business figures and the resignation of the company's management, the world's number five industry faces a human new start.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
GfK's board chief wants to leave the company at the end of the year.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board Arno Mahlert is already out of the supervisory body with effect from 12 September.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The management on the Board of Directors already acquired the previous member of the Executive Board, Gerhard Hausruckinger, on 1 September.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
He is to formally assume the role of a "CEO" until a successor is found for Hartmann.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
As a reason for the resignations, the company called "different views" on the long-term business orientation.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Details did not want to call a company spokesman Friday.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Anyone who will lead the market research company in the future is still unclear.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
In investors ' circles, it was said on Friday that the disappointment of the further lack of success of the restructuring launched years ago had been great for shareholders.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Mr Hartmann has been at the GfK top since 2011.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
"The fruits of the restructuring, however, are not yet visible after 5 years," it said.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Given the latest bad GfK business figures, each shareholder will eventually be restless.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
"If that were the case at BMW, that would also make the quandts like that," it said.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
The company had also failed to halt its loss in the second quarter of 2016 after setbacks in the previous quarter.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
At 361.2 million euros, sales were 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable prior-year quarter.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Related to the first half of the year, sales shrank by 3.4 percent to 721.2 million euros.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
The gain in the second quarter mainly weighed on the company's sunken value in the face of its difficult economic situation.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
The company's depreciation of EUR 139 million, which was necessary in the Consumer Experience business, gave the Group a loss of EUR 148.2 million.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
In the second quarter of 2015, GFK still generated a net profit of 19.7 million.

Accidents - bus slips into crumbling in ditch: eight injured

<seg id="2">
Eight people were injured in a bus accident involving 43 seniors as passengers were injured Thursday in Krummlistened (Landkreis Aurich).
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Two of the occupants suffered serious injuries, police said.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
According to her data, the 66-year-old driver of the bus of a travel company Eisenach had to avoid a load of debris that drove on the tram.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The bus came to the right from the street and slipped into a ditch, police spokeswoman Aurich/Wittmund reported.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
"Because of the location of the bus, people could not leave the bus independently," she said.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The fire department freed the occupants.
</seg>

Six rescuers and an emergency cart came to the accident site on the road 2.

The fee per cubic metre of waste water is from 1 October 2016 for the area of Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl 3.44 instead of 2.10 Euro; for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp 3.36 Euro (previously 2.26 Euro) and for Azendorf 3.64 euros (so far 2.18 euros).
</seg>
<seg id="2">
At the Azendorf plant, the waste water fee will increase again at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are needed.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
After an over-the-counter calculation, the wastewater price in Azendorf will then be at 4.37 euros per cubic metre.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, when the budget was approved by the Landratsamt Kulmbach, it was found that these waste water plants were going to be covered.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The Kasendorf market is obliged, on the basis of a legal basis, to operate the facilities in a cost-effective manner.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
From 1 October 2016, citizens and industrial and industrial enterprises from Welshkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to dig deeper into the purse.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
As the managing director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the panel, a new calculation of the charges for sewerage systems was necessary for the market community.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, overdrafts and undercoverings from the previous calculation period should also be compensated.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
The serious increase in fees is based on the fact that all three waste water plants are relatively small installations with very low waste water, which is between 6800 and 12000 cubic metres per year.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
For example, due to the low distribution base, for example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would be seriously affected.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
There is also a slight decline in the volume of waste water in all three plants.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Furthermore, in the last period of calculation, significant amounts of rehabilitation and repair expenses have been incurred in all three plants, not least because of their age.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
The plant in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the plants for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth, as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Schmidt pointed out that in the Azendorf sewage plant, the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced because of a damage.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
In the pumping plant of Welschenkahl, the nearly 20 year old conveyor systems had to be overtaken from scratch and, after almost 20 years of operation, the first sewage pond had to be used, the sewage sludge had to be disposed of and an additional ventilation facility had to be built in order to be able to comply with the water legislation in the future.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Schmidt: "to these extraordinary expenses came the updated maintenance and maintenance costs, which must be taken into account in the new calculation period."
</seg>
<seg id="18">
The same is true of electricity costs, which were well below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011/2012.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Stone houses made it clear that in the case of low waste water in the three plants, the cost of operation and maintenance was "fully beaten".
</seg>
<seg id="20">
In addition, Schmidt, the market community of large entertainment costs in the waste water plants, has been spared over the past 20 years.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
In the view of stone houses, the situation for these installations will remain precarious in the long term, especially as the supply area of the Friesenbachtal wastewater network in Friesenbachtal cannot be extended because of the lack of facilities.

Snapchat ' Anime ' effect as Asian cartoon criticised
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Snapchat says this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
With its filter tool, Snapchat allows around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that already borders on the absurd.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be out of a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The filters are blunt, self-twisting tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
All mistakes are made to the public.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Snapchat filters have drawn criticism in the past, accusing them that the app would promote Blackface or promote white skin as a beauty deal.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
When it suggested to some users this week a filter that gave them sledgehammers, false teeth and inflated cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - "yellowish."
</seg>
<seg id="9">
They wondered whether these repeated controversies pointed to a bigger problem that the company has with diversity.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
The news and outrage were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat told reporters that it had deactivated the feature.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
The company offered an apology: the filter was intended as a tribute to anime characters rather than a caricature of Asians.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
But outsiders who have experienced racism reminded the filter of offending cliches.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Others strongly rejected the anime comparison.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet was widely circulated about the photos, said the filter was "vulnerable and to say the least unpleasant."
</seg>
<seg id="15">
She added that " it is difficult to argue with the backlash of a very restive Asian cartoon and the filter effects.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
It shows that the filter is not yellow, but that the yellow face has been drawn to the abysmal extreme.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Snapchat is not the only company to cross this cultural stumbling wire.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in our hands.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
And Snapchat's large audience of young people - who are more diverse in terms of race than their older counterparts - might be more likely to expect sensitivity.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
When one of Snapchat's filters generates an image that is offensive to a user,"so it is much more difficult for such things to go unnoticed than it used to be," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview Thursday.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account urged others to do the same.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
In an essay for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believes that race-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the recruitment practices at Snapchat.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Zhu criticized the largely white, only male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: _SHARP_ DeleteSnapchat.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
"Either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce so they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu,"or they have people with other skin colors who work there but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say what is against."
</seg>
<seg id="25">
Others share her opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has left largely unanswered.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his staff, but, according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a personnel manager focused on under-represented population groups and on internal integration efforts.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
For her part, Zhu said she will leave her Snapchat account closed and added,"I wonder if they need more users like us to say that is not O.K."

Military leadership falsifies ISIS intelligence information, puts Committee of Congress firmly
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Military personnel from the United States Central Command changed intelligence to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than it would have allowed actual conditions on the ground, a congressional investigator said in a report Thursday.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The preliminary report, prepared by a task force of Republican members of the congressional committee, intelligence committees and the Wehrbudget budget committee, reports great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how presenters changed their assessments of U.S. efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The Central Command, briefly Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
"Intelligence information, typically sent by senior Centcom commanders, regularly marked a more positive picture of America's efforts against terrorism than it would have allowed actual conditions on the ground and were consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence services," a newspaper article quoted the report as saying.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our leaders," said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The leadership failures at Centcom extend to the top of the organization.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The 10-page report shows detailed persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in training Iraqi forces.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Although it does not provide direct evidence that government leaders have given instructions under Obama to change the reports, it shows how analysts faced pressure from their superiors to draw a more optimistic picture of the Islamic State's threat, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, opinions and statements before Congress were far more positive than the facts," the report noted.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
For example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could begin as early as April or May 2015.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
"After months of investigation, so much is clear," said Mike Pompeo, Republican congressman from Kansas, in an opinion.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the Central Command's spikes changed the intelligence reports to downplay the danger posed by ISIS in Iraq.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Republicans launched the task force after they conceded that analysts were worried about manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
The report released Thursday will be supplemented by more detailed findings while the investigation continues.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
In addition, further investigation of the Centcom reports is under way by the General Inspector General of the Ministry of Defence.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Democratic members of the News Service Committee released their own findings on Thursday, agreeing with some of the conclusions of the Republican task force.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
"In 2014 and 2015, the Centcom created an overly limited process for creating intelligence assessments to ISIL and the Iraqi security services," the highest-ranking Democrat in the committee, a member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, disclosed in an opinion.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
That process, according to Mr. Schiff,"delayed the release of intelligence reports," damaging the morale among analysts and "gave overly little room for dissent."
</seg>
<seg id="21">
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats vowed not to have any indication of White House intervention at the Centcom analysts in terms of a "certain political opinion."
</seg>
<seg id="22">
The preliminary results of the congressional investigation were published Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon's general inspector general, which was taken after complaints from Centcom analysts.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
LT. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon press officer, said in an opinion that the Defense Department would not comment on any reports by Congress, while the general inspector general's investigation was still under way.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
But he also admitted that "experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Department of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense."
</seg>
<seg id="26">
The investigation has repercussions beyond the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion now made by a growing number of Defense Department members).
</seg>
<seg id="27">
Last year's accusations, however, raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
Critique about intelligence about Islamic State reminiscences about the Islamic State more than a decade ago, when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document about how, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, George W. Bush envisioned only a small occupying force in Iraq, and had little time to worry about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.

Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current coverage of the Islamic State.

Last year, the team around Mr. Hooker noted, according to government sources, that contrary to the government's statements, airstrikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would have no significant effect on the terrorist group's financial position, since those temporary refineries would have been put into operation to sell oil on the black market.

U.S. win fourth match in women's field hockey, showdown with Britain
</seg>
<seg id="2">
A day after she scored three goals during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the women's American field hockey team in a match Thursday against India that the Americans won by 3-0.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Five goals in two games should actually be a memorable achievement, but Bam (27) said she could not remember having ever done that.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
"I have no idea." she said.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
I do not belong to the people who keep their doors in mind.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
However, she knows that: the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the Britons in the first place, who remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Britain and the United States will meet Saturday in the last game of the first round.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which of the two within their group from six teams will each gain the first and second place.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
The first place will go a little longer for the strong Dutch, who will lead the other group.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Whatever the game on Saturday, the American women have sparked a surprising upset by their success story, four years after they landed at the last of 12 places at the past London Games.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
BAM was part of this team.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey sleeper in hands (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), with 16 years she became national playwright, the youngest in the team's history.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
She missed the Olympics in 2008 as she failed to qualify for the caddie.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Then came 2012, in which for her and her team everything went wrong.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
The following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the national team, began to turn things around for the better.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
"A culture change, a mental change and a physical change," Bam said.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
We did not have the workload in London that we have now.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
We have been able to take the helm completely.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
On Thursday night, Bam opened the torch in the first half of the game with a rebound from close range.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
India had gone into the game without a win in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1-0 down into the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
She completed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved to the middle and lubricated the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the final quarter.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
The shutout was the first of the entire tournament for the US goalkeeper, Jackie Briggs, who has so far had to concede a gate in each of the previous games.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
She has a run.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
Same as Bam.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
"We are in a good position," said Parnham, but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday.

Amid the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen des Trampolins
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Wherever you are, how late it is, it is the Olympics.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inescapable, a racing staple between competition and aspiration.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning stomach, stretched from the armor to the swimmer to the turner to the triathlete.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
You cannot turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour's conversation in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the quarrel between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
And then there is Logan Dooley.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Dooley, who is here for the first time at the Olympics and a women's black with greats, could well have been among those familiar names sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising if he were a swimmer, Turner or even Fechter.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is battling gold in the Olympic trampoline.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
The Olympic flame does not illuminate each event the same.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports that are not universally recognised: air pistols shooting, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
We will always have the breast swim and may it be long.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
But if I can make modest arguments for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it was perceived the last 16 years so sparingly that many of the ones I had interviewed did not know it is an Olympian type at all.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
That could also be regional ignorance.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Although the U.S. sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in the trampoline jump and until 2012 had an athlete who made it to the final round.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
The Chinese and Russians tend to share the prices of the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
DONG Dong of China and Rosie MacLennan of Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
The trampoline jump has a certain outsider charm, in part because for the unenlightened ear it sounds more appropriate for a clowning school than that for the Olympic Games.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a naturalized enthusiast.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
It has humoristic potential - the cartoonish citation of his never-ending impact - but also the grace of the tournament and diving, the two sports that essentially unites it.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means as much as "springboard."
</seg>
<seg id="22">
Aspiring victors jump on a giant trampoline, shoot nearly up to 30 feet into the air and have to make a series of falling movements (turning, hitting and saltos) before they land on their feet.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
They are evaluated according to the official Olympic program after execution, difficulty and "flight time".
</seg>
<seg id="24">
Second-round athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Medal hopefuls have to go further in their pursuit of gold, faster, up and down, sometimes to the goal, sometimes back and forth, up and down the pitch.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
They hunt not only the finish line or the starting wall, but also, in television broadcasting, another cavalier goal: that of the world or the Olympiarecord.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
The purposeful pursuit is nobel, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to stir even a spectator to tears.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
But it is also what I find to be a bit tiring even when watching these games.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
Of this, the trampoline offers a breathing space.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
The vector of the trampoline jumper is up.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
A forward movement is not the goal.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
He or she jumps off, seemingly heavy-handed like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
Again there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, just the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
It is as Zen as the competition at the Olympics can only be.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
The women's qualification and final rounds will be held Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; that of the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
NBC will broadcast the Endrunden as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
In the midst of the Olympic mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in the general tumult.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
If consciousness can be achieved only by the angling and objectification of male athletes - as the male US Turner suggested recently, according to The Wall Street Journal - Mr Dooley awaits his fledgling, new fan base.

"A generation protested" in Ethiopia, Long a US ally
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Violent protests in Ethiopia
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Protesters demanding political changes in Ethiopia met with violent resistance from the government.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Witnesses say that tens of protesters were killed in shootings during clashes with police.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Is Ethiopia in the process of collapsing?
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Over the last decade, it has been one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a fast-growing economy.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
But in recent months, anti-government protests shook the country and expanded into more and more areas.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Last week, thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
The government's response was ruthless, according to human rights organizations.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Witnesses said police shot and killed scores of unarmed protesters.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Videos in circulation about the protests, presumably from the last or earlier this year, show how security people beat young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
The head of the UN Human Rights Agency is now asking for an in-depth investigation.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project manager of the Horn of Africa International Crisis Group, a research group.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
American military and intelligence agencies are working closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorist threats beyond the region, particularly in Somalia.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Although Ethiopia has been far from a model for democracy, human rights organisations have consistently led the government's repression - the opposition in the country has been restricted, with dissidents effectively silenced.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Many were sent into exile or in jail, killed or driven into the expanses of the desert.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
But that could change.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
"If you suppress people and these no other options have other options besides protesting, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
The whole youth protests.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
A generation is protesting.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to the stranglehold on power of the ruling coalition.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies were given the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
At the same time, tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea; a battle for this treacherous, controversial line claimed hundreds of lives in June.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
Analysts worry that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less defeated in recent years, could exploit the turmoil and rearm themselves.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness now explode beneath the surface after years of gestation.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
The first seems innocuous: smartphones.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
It is only in recent years that many Ethiopians have been able to communicate via social media, as cheaper smartphones have become increasingly common and Internet services improved.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are staying.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
Several young Ethiopians said they gathered to protest.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
Since eons, the Amharas, who come from the predominantly Christian highlands, have prospered in politics and economics while exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in lowland areas.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
But even that is changing.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
"We are in the process of coordinating under an umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of Oromos.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
The biggest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, who make up about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, the intelligence services, trade and politics.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
The third reason for the riots is the death of Meles Zenawi.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
Mr Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia's prime minister until his death on an undisclosed illness in 2012 for 17 years.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
He was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
Analysts say he was particularly savvy at seeing early signs of discontent and using special representatives to edit opponents and make them harmless.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
"The current regime lacks this fundamental skill," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected for relatively obscure reasons to take Mr Meles's position.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr Hailemariam comes from the south.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
Analysts say he does not have the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
Many worry that the result will be more bloodshed.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
The last time Ethiopia experienced such a revolt was in 2005, after thousands protested against elections, which, according to analysts, appears to have been sworn in by the government and then stolen.
</seg>
<seg id="51">
During the ensuing raids, many protesters were killed, even if they were less than in recent months, and this time of unrest passed relatively quickly.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in the fight against poverty.
</seg>
<seg id="53">
But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal disgust of the Ethiopian government.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
And it is taking a dangerous ethnic form.
</seg>
<seg id="55">
Last month, protesters in Gondar, an amharic city run by Tigray conducted deals and the hatred toward the Tigray is becoming more common on social media.
</seg>
<seg id="56">
Analysts say the protests put the U.S. and other Western allies in a strange position.
</seg>
<seg id="57">
The American government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, even though it recently announced it had closed that base.
</seg>
<seg id="58">
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile area.
</seg>
<seg id="59">
"This," said Mr Abdi,"is a very thin gratuity."

Donald Trump explains his claim Obama had founded ISIS was "sarcasm"
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Donald J. Trump tried on Friday to dispel the latest controversy surrounding his campaign, saying that his oft-repeated claim that President Obama and Hillary Clinton had been the "founders" of the terrorist group Islamic State was not serious.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
That clarification raised new questions about the communications skills of the Republican presidential nominee, whether he was able to communicate clearly and intelligently with the American public.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
It also brings his comrades, who seek to protect him during an eventful phase, into the peculiar position of having to explain statements he might not have meant at all.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
After making the suggestion at a campaign event Wednesday night, Mr. Trump rested on the claim Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to indicate that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
But in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was simply being sarcastic.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The tweet was the contrast to the previous day, when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews he meant the accusation was entirely serious.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
When conservative radio writer Hugh Hewitt sought to help Mr. Trump to soften the statement somewhat by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential nominee did not want to know anything about it.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
The last storm of criticism cracked down on Mr. Trump, while trying to steer the focus of his campaign because of falling poll numbers on the economic situation.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this issue again.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Speaking on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Mr. Trump has already raised sarcasm to his defense.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
At the end of July, he drew strong criticism when he suggested that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but he later declared,"Of course, I meant the sarcastic."
</seg>
<seg id="15">
This method allows Mr. Trump to shift the linguistic boundaries in politics and then back down as needed.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
"I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans, how they arrive, and then, if necessary," clarify "depending on how the reaction is out," said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who monitors the language of both candidates.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
But I also think he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Instead of defying the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more corrosive tone, as his poll ratings have continued to decline.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
A new poll by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, released Friday, showed a lead with a big lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
While Mr. Trump is generally trying not to apologize for his provocative remarks, he frequently accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misinterpreting his humor.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
But, while he has been the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's joke has put his loyal fellow Democrats in the uncomfortable position of having to stand up to him, no matter how provocative his statements may be.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent advocacy groups, made great efforts to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview from Thursday.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
"I think what he is saying are legitimate, political comments," said Mr. Giuliani, adding he was questioned about the accuracy of Mr. Trump's statements on whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
It is true in this sense that before Obama was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backbenchers, completely wrong, and that is why it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State, it allowed ISIS to spread out by failing to aggressively control the situation in the Middle East.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Before the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of spying on each of his words and being biased against him.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
He scorned the "poor, jolly" TV experts who try to understand him and said,"you can 't!"
</seg>
<seg id="28">
Some of the Democrats scoffed at Mr. Trump's apology as just one more proof that he was unfit for the presidency.

Once squeezed over price from the market, Café comes back in Greenpoint
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Verb Cafe was a shabby cafe in Williamsburg, where you could only pay cash that had no Wi-Fi but served good coffee for 15 years.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Of course, prices have been squeezed out of his Bedford Avenue store front.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The store soap Cherie, which replaced verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Locals cheered it as the last loss in a gentrified city.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter,"I know New York is changing, but I still cannot believe that CBGB dead, the Chelsea Hotel excepted and Verb is now a soap business."
</seg>
<seg id="7">
But if New York is changing, it is also reinvention.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
A revived Verb Cafe opened in Greenpoint last November, less than a mile north of its original location.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same employees and a similarly simple atmosphere.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
The coffee is still good, too.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old cafe who is the owner and managing director of the new cafe.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
When he offered a client to provide funds for a new outsider, he was excited to do it, he said.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Rodriguez, 36, blasted a lot.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Verb used the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
He introduced new ingredients.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnishes such as capers and sauced onions.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
There are natural bowls.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
The cafe no longer serves beer, there are fresh juices for it.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
After nine months, Rodriguez said he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
"Many old customers have also been displaced by prices from Williamsburg," he said.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
Recently, on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
OLIVEIRA, 34, previously lived in Williamsburg and visited the verb on a regular basis.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would take the road.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
After the verb closed, she gave up the coffee rink for a while, she said.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
"I became clear that it was in the coffee and the culture in the verb that I liked," she said.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
Now she is drinking coffee again, even if she ordered a blended Chai Tea instead of her usual iced coffee, which is another new addition.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
Tom Rosenthal is another longtime and loyal customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
He went there before the work and invariably ordered the same.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
"I came quarters after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they are preparing my Everything bagel with butter," he said.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
Nowadays, Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he switches his Everything bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
Rodriguez said he had no grudge about the soap business taking the old business room.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
In fact, the owners of the soap Cherie offered to produce a special soap for verb with the cafe's cold-blooded coffee as an ingredient.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
"I think we are still going to go down on their offer," said Rodriguez.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
And the traditional Polish inhabitants of Greenpoints have also accepted the cafe.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said he plans to issue it soon, so that his new neighbors feel welcome.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
The location also has other advantages.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
A local juice local wants to fill and sell the cold coffee.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
There is a chance that the cafe will expand to a nearby building.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the cafe closed.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
When the new cafe opened, Whitt said that entering the premises and ordering a new coffee was felt like a return home.
</seg>
<seg id="46">

The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a rich meal"
</seg>
<seg id="2">
In March 1933, shortly after his ascension to the president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch in the Oval Office.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt had a faible for refined delicacies of Fifth Avenue like pâte de foie gras and Maryland water-turtle soup.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
His menu on that day was slightly more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, potato pepper and as dessert a plum pudding.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Her husband Andrew CoE added,"it was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
CoE's latest book,"chop Suey," was about Chinese cuisine in the US, while Ziegelman was told about life in a home on the Lower East Side from the food perspective in her book "97 Orchard."
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Her latest collaboration,"a decent meal," which will appear in the Harper Verlag on Tuesday, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small snack snack in the Flatiron District, which has been in store since the 1929 stock market crash.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive groves, while CoE, 57, made turkeys with potato pepper and vegetable mixture.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
When the reporter ordered Hackbraten, this found the pair fit for a discussion about food in the era of the Great Depression.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
"Rich foods were very popular," Ziegelman said.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
There was peanut broth, liver cheese and bean bread.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
They were made from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinners.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Coe grinned.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
"It must have been in the stomach like lead," he said.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
In the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an All-You-Can-Eat-Buffet.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Teams of women cooked for male field workers and it was served freshly baked pastures for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
"It was a time when food for the Americans became a central, tense issue," CoE begged, why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Equally tense was the new budget diet: mysterious dishes such as broth and casserolls became staple foods, the casserole as "wonderful way to recycle food," noted Ziegelman, as cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dry fruit.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
Meat, which has been the center of American cuisine for years, became a rarely served luxury.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Strange mixtures were tried, as a calorie rich and nutritious satisfaction took precedence over taste or even healthy cuisine.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
During her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from that era, baked onions with peanut butter.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
"It was not a popular addition at lunch," says Coe.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
Ziegelmann continues: "it was surreal."
</seg>
<seg id="30">
Peanut butter and baked onions do not match each other.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
It was typical for many of the house economic recipes.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
As never before, or ever since, budget economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - were so keen on the country's eating habits.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "budget politicians" and meet the challenge of turning Pampe like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
"A Square Meal" is a celebration of historical delicacies.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
Especially tasty are the reports of the government's response to the starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's Lass-mich-cake-eating attitude.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen, he dined like the million-strong man of world to which he has become.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with Gurkensauce," said Coe.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
He ate in an almost gold-plated dining room and wore a Smoking.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
He was wonderfully unrealistic.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if not his wife Eleanor had asked him to set an example with his stomach.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
As described in the book, the hiring of a housekeeper with no interest in flavors by Ms. Roosevelt meant that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most dismal. "
</seg>
<seg id="42">
Many of the species from the Great Depression era to deal with food was discarded as soon as the country got back on its feet.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
The legacy is based on our continuing focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as how science was applied to food.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
The couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother-in-law when writing the book - for example, how they could not throw away food.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
"She had a real fear of wasting food," said CoE.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
Ziegelman recalled,"she made people really sick."
</seg>
<seg id="47">
There was the windbag incident.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg, they and CoE drew a dessert that they had prepared at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate at lunchtime.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
"It is called prune whip," said Ziegelman and added that it was a usual trick to miss modest recipes a send name.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
There were no battered cream, just plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
</seg>
<seg id="51">
Each appeared somewhat reluctant to have a spoon in the tough, brown glibber.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
Amazingly, it was not bad.
</seg>
<seg id="53">
CoE picked up an aftershock three times.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
Like a Can-Do buddy, he said to his wife,"A couple of chopped walnuts would help."

Killed in bomb attack: he was the hero of Aleppo
</seg>
<seg id="2">
He put his own life at risk to help others: Khaled Omar.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
He risked everything to save others ' lives.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Now the 30-year-old himself has died in a Fassbomb attack by the Assad regime.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Omar was a member of the White Helmets, a civil protection group that, according to the Bild newspaper, has saved nearly 60 000 lives so far.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
2900 volunteers put their own lives at risk to pull people out of bombed homes and to provide first aid in the war zone.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Omar was the face of the group: a video of the Civil Guard showing him in an 11-hour rescue of a baby from the rubble of a house went around the world in 2014.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
It made the Syrians a shining symbol in the horror of war.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
As a hero, however, he never saw himself, saying, according to the picture,"for me, that is the real jihad."
</seg>
<seg id="12">
"If I am dying to save lives, I think God sees in me a martyr."
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack, he had spoken in a video about the latest bombing in Syria.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Helicopters dropped four barrel bombs over the Alzadia district, one was filled with chlorine gas.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
A woman and two children died, seven people were suffering from breathing.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
"We are now eliminating the poisonous remains of the bomb, lest children play with it," the Bild quoted his last words before he died.

Greenland shark: the oldest vertebrate is nearly 400 years old
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Rare sight.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Greenland sharks usually only come to the surface in winter.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
This shark was allowed back into the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel Sanna.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
He was born in 1624 and swims with well a 1 km/h through the North Atlantic - to this day.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Greenland sharks only get young people with 150 years of age.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The Greenland shark boils down at the bottom of the North Atlantic, and in an hour, on average, it is just 1,220 metres far.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Only when it arrives, the five-metre long animal speeds up to a saturated 2.6 km/h - and is half as fast with this maximum speed as a seal.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
This lonely lifestyle, however, seems to be a patent recipe for a high age.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "science", in any case, from a Greenland shark that could be 392 years old.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
"Madness," said Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute of demographic research in Rostock, this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Of course, the evolutionary biologist has long suspected that Greenland sharks will be staged.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Just lacked the evidence.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Greenland sharks are hard to observe, after all they live in the ice sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they tend to dip on the surface only in winter.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Researchers know little about the lifestyle of the Greenland sharks.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
They were at a time when they had six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitsbergen.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Looters do this sharks anyway: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jaw of a young polar bear.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
They may hunt down sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice sea and look for carcasses that tore down from higher water layers.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now studied 28 Greenland sharks, which caught fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spitsbergen as a by-catch from the depths of the North Atlantic.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 centimeter measured.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lineage of the sharks using the carbon 14 method.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
This center of the eye lens is created even before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it are not renewed later.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
The two smallest sharks had striking a lot of carbon-14 in the linescore.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960 ' s, when nuclear weapons tests brought greater quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
On the other hand, in the 220 centimetres of the third smallest animal, the nucleus contained a small surplus of carbon 14 from the nuclear weapons tests, so it should have celebrated its 50th birthday during its investigation in 2012.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
In contrast, all the larger Greenland sharks had normal carbon-14 volumes in their lineage, resulting from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
In fact, the carbon 14-watch for a 493 centimeter long Greenland shark showed an age of 335, while the record shark with 502 centimeters is likely to be 392 years old.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
The fact that Greenland females only get young people when they are longer than four metres was well known.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
Now the researchers of the length have been able to assign an age.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres was probably on the brink of sexual maturity and their age was determined at 156 years of age, Greenland sharks are apparently allowed at least one and a half centuries.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
This, too, is likely to be the world record for vertebrates.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
It is no coincidence that such methusaleme is mainly living in icy waters.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
Also, the previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale, in whose bacon at the neck was a 120-year-old harpoon tip, was caught before Alaska.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
The low temperatures often include the organism of the animals living there.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
So they mature later - and aging more slowly.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are often particularly large.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
The heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much greater than with a gram of elephant.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
Another advantage: they have fewer enemies.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
"So a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many offspring as possible as early as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
A very large animal, on the other hand, should invest its resources in a long life.

Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
</seg>
<seg id="2">
So, in competition with Paris, Dublin, and Luxembourg, the city of Main has the best chance of attracting jobs and firms relocating from London.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
"It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit vote," says Michael Voigtländer, head of the IW's financial markets and real estate markets.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether money houses can continue to run from London to financial transactions across the EU.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
For the so-called EU passport, they have been granted authorisation in the United Kingdom.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
That is what large US banks are using.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Several banks have already announced to relocate jobs.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The lobbying association "Frankfurt Main Finance" anticipates 10000 new jobs in the Main within five years.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
For Frankfurt, IW, the headquarters of the European Central Bank (ECB), which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the eurozone's largest banks, as well as other key authorities such as the European insurance supervisor EIOPA and the ESRB risk council.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
In Paris, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has its headquarters, but it is less important for the financial industry than the ECB.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
"Proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with oversight," says IMF professor Voigtländer.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Luxembourg is a large fund industry, but, like Dublin, it is worse off in terms of infrastructure.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Furthermore, the city with easily available commercial real estate.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
"In Paris, it is not so easy to find free high-quality offices," says Voigtländer.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
At the Seine, rents for first-class commercial real estate are 50 percent higher than in the Main.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition, thanks to good medical care and infrastructure, as well as less crime.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
In a ranking of business consultancy Mercer, the city stands at No. seven, Luxembourg at No. 19, Dublin at No. 33 and Paris in 37th place.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Even if quality of life is a question of preferences: "with its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market, Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors," the IW concludes.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
But, despite Brexit's vote, London will remain the most important financial center in Europe, economic researchers say.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
This is also true of the balance of power: in London, according to the figures of Landesbank Helaba, around 144000 people worked in the banking industry at the end of 2015; in Frankfurt it was 62500.

Gilead receives legal costs from hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
</seg>
<seg id="2">
A US judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbursement of the legal costs it incurred from the Hepatits C litigation with pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
In June, Gilead was freed from a $200 million compensation payment for violating two patents of Merck and Harvoni of Gilead, after a U.S. judge discovered a pattern of misconduct by Mercks, including the Meineides and other unethical acts.

Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Hillary Clinton released her tax return for 2015 on Friday, delivering an income of $10.75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2% for the Democrats ' presidential candidacy and her husband.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million for charitable purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton earned nearly $5.3 million in Redehonorars; the former secretary of state gave an income of $3 million from publisher Simon & Schuster for her book about her tenure at the State Department.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Clinton's candidate for the vice presidency, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with his wife Anne Holton, published his tax returns of the past decade.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency," gave Clinton's campaign hero Jennifer Palmieri in an opinion.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
In a stark contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and backers on his previous promises to publish his tax returns.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
It is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, even though they are not obliged to do so by law.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have cited a tax audit by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
"They are on the train," Clinton campaign aide Ian SAMS wrote on Twitter, referring to the release of the Democrats ' presidential candidacy.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's special adviser, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish anything before the tax audits are not completed.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Trump's critics, including the 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, have already said that his refusal raises questions about wealth, his donations to charitable organizations, his business practices, and various other connections, especially with Russia.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Clinton has already cracked down on the issue and released a video on the Internet on Friday in which high-profile Republicans are urging Trump to release his tax return.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
On Thursday, she also addressed the issue during a speech to the economy in Michigan.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
"He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and publish his tax returns," she said to the crowd.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Politico has reported that Trump paid no or very little tax during the 1990s for two years, and a New York Times economics journalist quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advisors on Friday, saying that could still be the case.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Clinton supports a settlement named after the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, who would ensure that people earning more than $1 million pay a tax cut of at least 30%.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
President Obama also supports the proposal.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
During a campaign event for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska called for Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate has his seat here, to exchange Trump for a meeting on their tax returns.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
Buffett said he was also subjected to a tax audit of the IRS and Trump was "afraid" of the voters, not the tax authorities.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
Clinton's campaign has scaled back tax returns until 2007.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
Clinton's 2015 tax return showed that those only paid $100 of their income as a wage, unlike the bulk of all Americans.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund, from which Clinton's dividends and earnings of $109,000 were taxed.

Condoms with Chilipuder, fireworks promote Tanzanian elephant protection
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Nature conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to stop elephants from going into settlements inhabited by humans - they throw condoms at them filled with chilipuder.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The method has proven to be effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea to do so years ago, has intensified its promotion by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a nonviolent four-step method to protect their homes and crops without injuring animals.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Previously, many spears used to defend themselves.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Friday is world telephone day dedicated to animal welfare.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
"Since we developed the... toolkit, we have been able to observe a change in attitude within these communities, making them much more confident that they can keep the elephants from their fields without harming the elephant," said Honeyguide's managing director Damian Bell in a statement.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a torch and the blistering into a horn.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
If he is not deterred, a so-called "Chiliwolke" will be thrown.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Chilipuder mixed with earth is packed together with a fireworks body into a condom, the end of which is turned down to the ignition.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
When it is ignited, the condom bursts with a bang and sprints fine dust to Chilipuder into the air.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
A whiff quite usually already out to chase the elephant.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
One last possibility is an advertiser that shoots a golfing fireworks into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.

Jewish director crushed Berlin hotel because Israeli pre-election was removed after ' Arab ' call - RT News
</seg>
<seg id="2">
A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media revolt after he had betrayed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli pre-selection as it asked Arab guests, according to an employee. "
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah", left his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel's country selection list.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The country, however, was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and deleted?
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Wrote Lanzmann.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Instead, the Kempinksi Bristol offers a way to select Israel via its own call center.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
After a statement, the director turned to the hotel reception.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
The answer he received there,"shocked him," Lanzmann wrote.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
The hotel employee said the measure was a "deliberate decision by the management of the Kempinski hotels."
</seg>
<seg id="12">
The reason behind it sparked even more fury in the director.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
"The bulk of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the preselection be deleted," Lanzmann's employee was quoted as saying.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great shame," the Süddeutsche Zeitung reported.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
We were appalled and dismayed by this event.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
This is really very shameful.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
The fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even more shameful.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
That does not require any explanation.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
We expect the hotel "to draw the right conclusions," said the official.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
The incident caused quite a lot of resonance on the Internet, in which people called the whole thing a scandal.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
Some told the Kempinski Hotel that it had "succumbed to the alleged calls of Arab guests."
</seg>
<seg id="22">
"Shame on you," it said in another post, noting that the hotel, located at the noble Kurfürstendamm, is near a synagogue.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
The hotel quickly dismissed all allegations of itself and called the incident an "oversight" and "apologized" at Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reported.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
" There has never been a direct statement " not to include Israel in the Quick List," quoting the Süddeutsche Zeitung a spokesman for the Kempinski Hotel.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
It adds that the country selection has now been added.

Police deploy tear gas & rubber floors against protesting Brazilian students
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to demonstrate against the government's reforms for the public education system.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Police set up tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The trouble began when police officers tried to disperse the students, causing the police to use rubber bullets and tear gas.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their dismay over the plans.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
According to the proposals of the governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, slightly fewer than 100 public schools will be closed, while 300,000 students will be implemented to save money.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Some of the protest participants saw graffiti against interim President Michel Temer sprayed on walls.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The latest protests occurred a few days after demonstrators in crowds took to the streets to support the suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been removed from office by a Senate vote on her dismissal.

Trade between Russia & Iran suddenly rises to 71% - RT Business
</seg>
<seg id="2">
With the lifting of sanctions, according to the Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 percent year-on-year.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Since international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, interest on the part of Russian companies in shops in the country has grown sharply, the ambassador said.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Russian companies are taking on existing links with Iran, while new firms are willing to gain access to the market.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Of course, the further trade expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," said Dzhagaryan.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
He noted that trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent in the first five months of the year 2016 compared with the same period in 2015, and was $856 million.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
In particular, Russian imports into Iran jumped by 91.5 percent and totaled $697 million.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Russian imports from Iran rose 16 percent to $158 million.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
The trade recovery has been achieved by supplies of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," said the ambassador.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Dzhagaryan is out for this year from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Last year, Russian expatriate representatives issued some 35,000 visas, primarily travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Iran also reached the top 20 of the countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
You could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia from last year, will be broken," he said.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
At the same time, only relatively few Russians visit Iran, something the ambassador hopes will change.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
"I personally can recommend the visit of the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have preserved the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.

Witnesses sought: beverage market in forest oil surges
</seg>
<seg id="2">
A robbery was carried out Thursday evening on the drinks market of Rewe XXL on the forest fire Gerberstraße.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Under the guise of a firearm, three darkly dressed people who had their faces mummified were asked by the employee of the drink market to release cash and then flew first foot and then presumably with a silver VW golf.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
How much money has been collected does not involve the police.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The perpetrators should have been between 1.60 and 1.70 meters tall, so relatively small.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The beverage market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the Rewe market.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
After the raid in the direction of Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg, and from the gravel parking in front of the car park, it is possible to fly with the silver car, possibly in the direction of B 256.

Anyone who made observations at the time of the crime (at 7: 45.00 p.m.), in connection with the robbery, is to report to the police as a matter of urgency.

Nagold: game and fun at summer release
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and adolescents of the socio-educational day group/social group work of the child protection bishop Nagold with their carers on their summer vacation in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
In the quietly situated Freizeitheim Hardtramdle, the joyful group was hospitalized during the first school holiday week.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Several full-day trips were on the program.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
On the one hand, it went to bail with the visit of the string zoo.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Second to Maulbronn, where there was a special children's guide in the world-famous monastery.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The third excursion led to Pforzheim.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
In the Celtic Museum in Hochdorf, the group learned a lot about the daily life and the food of the Celts.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
On the hot days, the group gathered at the deep lake in Maulbronn, which invited you to jump, swim and plan.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Culinary delights have been pampered by children and caregivers with their self-prepared corpses such as the Sauren Spittle, the Seebronner Pfanznle, Iselshauser-Bloff, English-Breakfast and Tübinger Bolognese.

Haigerloch: pilgrims to the gates of mercy
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The ministrants from the peace group Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the move on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Together, four stages have been dealt with.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
In order to bridge the period up to the next romantic ride of all mini transmitters in probably two years, the Saint-Anna Oberministrantenround has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Various pilgrimage goals were examined and it was decided finally for the bishop's town of Freiburg, where this year on the occasion of the Holy Year of mercy with the open gates of mercy at the Freiburger Münster, a special pilgrimage destination was offered.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
16 Minis from Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Heiligenzimmern were on the way.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Earlier in the evening, Pfarrer Storost sent out the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrims and gave the pilgrims.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
From Horb it was driven by train to the starting point of Villingen, where there was also a Munster of Our Lady, and so the pilgrimage was taken by the Münster.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
The individual day tours were framed in the morning and in the evening by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and lyrics.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
On the other hand, the minis at field crossings, chapels or churches were also on the way to sing together a song from Pilger-Liedheft.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
For the overnight stays, parish heaters of the local parishes were available.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
At the milestones, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller cared for a tasty as well as strengthening dinner and breakfast.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
It went on for the second day on Furtwangen to Gütenbach.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
The day after St. Peter, which was the most strenuous stretch of road, had to first descend at around 500 meters of altitude and then come back again.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
The deserved reward was in the evenings a common barbecue on the beach.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
After the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, it went to the final stage to Freiburg.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Visibly relieved and happy, the Minis met in the later afternoon at the Freiburger Münster and went through the gates of mercy.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
With a little impulse, God was thanked here.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
At the evening fair in the Münster, the mini was greeted by collaborator Markus Obert on the pilgrimage.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
After the service, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
The next day was still time for the Breisgau metropolis.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
In the afternoon it went back to Horb by train.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
In the end, all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked.

Scots Callum Skinner stormed home as Briton wins gold for cycling
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Scotland's Callum Skinner raced last night in the men's team sprint at the Velodrom in Rio for glory when the British team defended the London 2012 title.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took on the anchor role that his compatriot Sir Chris hoy had embraced and made the legend proud when he stormed home to capture a victory from New Zealand's favourites.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while hoy picked up the fifth of six Olympics medals.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
They repeated the trick after they holed only a modest sixth place in March at the London World Championships in London despite the resignation of Hoys.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
They did so in good time as a hint.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Hoys's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Skinner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the Scot that has now unfolded.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Hindes, Kenny - who won with hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standings the New Zealanders won in the first round.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Hindes fell short after his round, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
A change of strategy made much of the transformation, in which Hindes drove in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenny and, above all, Skinner to keep the pace.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Hoy watched from his position as BBC expert and dropped Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they rose to the podium.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said: "it is a flattering comparison."
</seg>
<seg id="16">
I am just here to do my best and make a name for myself.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
We set an Olympic record in the final round and beat the world champions.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
It was just incredible.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
There is no better way to win this.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
After the 2012 triumph at Kennys and Hoys, Hindes admitted he deliberately fell on the train after a weak start.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
He later withdrew that statement and there was no objection from England's rivals.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
This time there was no such problem with such a surprising victory.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Hindes said: "it feels with all the GB flags in the gallery like London."
</seg>
<seg id="24">
We have come together as a team in the last three months.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
We have come away so badly in so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
That is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which has won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
If that is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days in the velodrome.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
With the form of Kennys, it is in the realm of the possible that he repeats Hoy's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
That would be for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than hoy, who was also born on March 23 (an apparently sacred date for British sport; on the day were also born Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
That would be the equivalent of hoy.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
Kenny is next in the sprint, which starts today and will go over three days.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I am enjoying this just for the moment."
</seg>
<seg id="33">
The team event is always best.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
You can win it with his colleagues.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
It feels a bit lonely to win alone.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
Hindes said: "if he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."
</seg>
<seg id="37">
It was the only medal contest of the day, but there was further good news for England.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-four-kilometer race.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
They came in at 3: 51.942 on goal.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
The world record holder, who won gold in London in 2012, was third at 3: 51.659.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the contest, where Wiggins will certainly be in focus.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
He had struggled with appointees before the qualification yesterday, when officials called him to measure his body size.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
In the corresponding women's competition, which will be continued and finished tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13.260.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
The GB team relies on its strong rail cycling team to dominate the middle period of the Olympics and pick up a bar of medals.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
After a truly extraordinary display of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio were lowered.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
It played out drama in the background, according to the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid sexism and bullying allegations, as well as the retirement of sizes such as hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
But if you look at the first evening of the competition at the velodrome, it looks like the now legendary reputation of GBS, which reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated again.

Future of Portland's melting plant due to repeal of energy contract
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The future of Portland's aluminum smelting in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs from workers - are at stake, as the plant operator will terminate the energy supply contract and thus lift all supply contracts, the energy company said.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
That move followed the government's decision in Victoria earlier this year not to grant any further subsidies to operate the plant.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
A subsidy set for 20 years expires in November.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Up to 2000 jobs at Alcoa's plant in Portland are at stake.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
No less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk when closing.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
In addition, there could be knock-on effects, as the melting plant consumes about 10 percent of Victoria's total power generation.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
In 2014, Alcoa completed the Point Henry melting plant, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Alcoa's melting plant in Portland is losing money and risking a closure.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
This move follows years of speculation about the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the electricity price for the plant.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
AGL, which supplies the large aluminum melting plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it expects three more owners to terminate their contracts.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
The plant is in the majority owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
"AGL assumes that the plant in Portland will continue to operate, which means further physical demand for electricity by the melting plant," the company said.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
AGL continued to say that the contracts are so-called "backup business", which should have come into effect from November 2016.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will end in 2017.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
"From that point of view, AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenue in fiscal year 17," said the electricity supplier.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
All potential effects on AGL revenues from FY18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
AGL announced that it had already written off the value of the contracts in its annual accounts of $187 million in "expectation of a termination."
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Alcoa said the decision to tender the contracts would not affect the "ability of Alcoas... to operate the melting plant or to ensure the power supply to the melting plant."
</seg>
<seg id="20">
The U.S. company said it completed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which should have come into effect from November this year, even if it still owes a statement as to why it resigned from the contract.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
Analysts are warning about the industry's poor economic conditions ahead of the possible closure of the Portland melting plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
Referring to analysts ' statements earlier in the week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said Portland had about 600 megawatts and Tomago consume about 900 megawatts of electricity annually.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Should both plants disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [electricity market].
</seg>
<seg id="24">
And for us as power producers, that would not be good," he said.

More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, KENDALL is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue
</seg>
<seg id="2">
KENDALL Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner clan Kris is on the cover of the coveted September edition of US Vogue.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
KENDALL, who is the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran to the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
"In a room full of people I love, brought me the sight of this cover to the cry," wrote KENDALL.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The unveiling of the covers followed a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians similar?), scripted reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (with the exception of problem cases Rob and Caitlyn, and in the presence of the most popular showbiz uncles and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest) as they forget the cover of their sister and that ends with a classic twist: they have all planned a surprise party.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
That represents the clichéd plot of almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence,"you would have forgotten that we had forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit on a sink at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to somehow let her other girls take part in this publicity.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
With a view to the September issue of Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians has certainly begun.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Kendall's big sister Kim may have beaten her on the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were to see it in April 2014), but the cover of the September edition of the magazine is a league for itself.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
The September issue is for Vogue the most sold edition of the year.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
With a scale that resembles an imagery rather than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista were advertising from the 832 pages of rolling 615 pages of advertising).
</seg>
<seg id="11">
The unveiling of his cover stars is so eagerly anticipated that images of the magazine leaked in the past two years even before the official announcement.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
In recent years, there have been clearly more "celebrities who are modelling" as "models who are celebrities" on the cover.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honor.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
But even with the low chance that Ms Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the previous category, she is in good company.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or youths from today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even if it is all about Jenner).
</seg>
<seg id="17">
They are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had with the release of Lemonade one of the most successful years of her career.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Of course, Jenner's success does not suit everyone.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
With her reality TV story, Jenner's position in the fashion world was always somewhat tense.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
In June, the former Victoria's Secret model criticized Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid and called it "the mist of the moment."
</seg>
<seg id="22">
Those feelings cooked up again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue cover.
</seg>
<seg id="23">

Community law centres have 160,000 people each year
</seg>
<seg id="2">
More than 160,000 of the country's aid needs are rejected annually by community law centres, while the industry is capitalizing on the impact of further cuts on already overloaded transactions.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly elderly people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who do not have funds for unjust delogies and the like - are already dismissed for seeking free legal advice and legal advice.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Legal services of the municipality, which are already over-stretched, are ready for further cuts.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
As of June next year, these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The director of community law centres of Queesland James Farrell said the latest survey of the National Association of Local Law Centres revealed that thousands of people are already being turned away each year.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Farrell said the situation would only get worse without a repeal of the federal government's decision.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
"Queensland's community law centres are chronically underfunded, which means thousands of people are being turned away from important services you need," he said.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
People who leave violent relationships, people with unmanageable and crushing debts, families who go through separations, workers who have been unfairly sacked - all these people have problems of a legal nature and this survey shows they cannot get the help they need.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
The federal government will cut funds by 30 percent from June 2017, which means that thousands of more vulnerable people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
We call on the Federal Attorney General and Federal Minister of Justice, as well as Senators of Queensland George Brandis, to immediately lift these budget cuts so that people can get the help they need in the event of legal problems.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Last year, the national government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to the national average.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
It is now time to look at the needs of community law centres and their customer communities and that the Palaszczuk Government is investing in this important work.

Donald Trump election campaign indicted after staff allegedly pulled gun
</seg>
<seg id="2">
New York: Donald Trump's campaign has been indicted for alleged inaction after she was told that her campaign manager for North Carolina turned a firearm to an employee in February while traveling in a jeep in February.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The incident is described in an indictment filed Wednesday in the District Court of Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in that state.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Bordini admitted for months that the matter would be settled internally before realising that "that would not happen."
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The campaign manager, Earl Philip,"drew a pistol, put his right index finger on the deduction, and rammed the run in Vincents Kniekehle," gave Bordini in his indictment.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
After complaining to the local and regional campaign manager, Bordini noted that at least four other people had already made the same experience with Phillip, he admitted in the indictment.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
"Guns do not have to be fired to cause damage," admitted Bordini.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The indictment comes just two days after the Republican presidential nominee sparked an uproar when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the "second Amendment people" - firearms owners and gun lovers - should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton is elected and judges should appoint.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Trump's campaign made it clear that the media had taken his words out of context and that he would not incite violence.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Bordini's complaint calls for damages from the campaign for due diligence and Philip for bodily injury and sustained psychological damage.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Trump's press secretary, Hope Hicks, was unable to reach an opinion.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Attempts to contact Philip also failed.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
WCCB, a local news station in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer employees of the campaign.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Calls at his consulting company, Innovative Consulting Services, did not respond.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has so far held a controversial campaign.

Berlin/Schwerin: poll ahead of country elections: SPD and CDU lose
</seg>
<seg id="2">
In the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (September 4) and Berlin (18 September), there are significant losses for the government parties SPD and CDU.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
This resulted in representative surveys of opinion research institute INSA for the "Bild" newspaper (Friday).
</seg>
<seg id="4">
While the red-black ruling coalition in the north could continue to govern narrowly, this is not possible, according to the survey figures in Berlin.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
In both states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would have a good chance of continuing to put the head of the government.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, the SPD plunged from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The party, according to the poll, was only slightly ahead of the CDU, which could come back to 23 percent.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The third place is controversial between the left and the AfD.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
The left would be 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented with 19 percent for the first time in the country Friday.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
The Greens, despite slight losses with 6 percent (previously 8.7 percent), were returning to the Schweriner Landtag.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
NPD and FDP would not be represented in the Landtag with 3 percent each.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
For the Berlin Chamber of Deputies, the SPD would be only 23% (2011: 28.3%).
</seg>
<seg id="13">
The CDU reached only 18 percent, after 23.4 percent.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
They would still be behind the Greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but before the left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).
</seg>
<seg id="15">
The AfD would be represented in the Chamber of Deputies for the first time, with 14%.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
With 5%, the FDP could hope to return, but the pirates would miss the move, unlike in 2011.

Nokia 9000 Communicator: the first smartphone
</seg>
<seg id="2">
E-mail and Internet in slow motion: 20 years ago, the Nokia Communicator came onto the market.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The successors dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The device weighed nearly half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
It was thicker and bigger, so it was not good either.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
On the contrary, it was pretty scary.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The built-in memory initially averaged eight megabytes, which would be enough today for about two Selfies with high resolution.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" came in exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, into the shops - and it was the first smartphone.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the equipment on the Internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
20 years ago, however, the Communicator was a sensation.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the CeBIT computer fair in Hannover, Germany.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
In fact, the new mobile phone could provide a lot for then-standards: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax was the Communicator to reach.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Even access to websites was possible via HTML browser, albeit agonizingly slow.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
There was a small antenna, and the cellphone could be folded up like a laptop.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Then there was a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Pretty proud was the price: 2700 D-mark, so about 1400 euros.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
No one was able to predict in August 1996 that the Communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
Since then, everything has been different.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
The smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
The mobile phone division of the Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster, was eventually sold to Microsoft and settled.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
The market now dominates suppliers, all of which came much later than Nokia.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
Always and everywhere online, this is everyday life for a lot of people.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
About 1.4 billion devices were sold, Samsung and Apple alone accounted for 555 million pieces.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
Global sales of equipment are around € 400 billion.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
In addition, there are the good business of the countless app providers and the telecommunications groups.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
Around the smartphone, an entire industry has now emerged.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
The crucial breakthrough to the mass market came only in early 2007, when Apple chief Steve Jobs announced the launch of the iPhone at the Mac World.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an Internet communicator, all easy to use by touch screen.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
Apple's winning streak began, and today the iPhone is the most important product of the group.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, which dominated the market, had the downside.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
They eventually disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
The sayings now have Apple and Asian suppliers such as Samsung.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
The smartphone is taken for granted 20 years after its invention.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
On average, every German now looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
"We all need to learn to put the smartphone away, too," said Janina Kugel, in the Siemens board of staff.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
Permanent accessibility is now a curse and a blessing.

England must guide the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
For me, that represented the biggest attraction of Heathrow, just as it did in London at the time in 2012, when we ran a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
And that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for locals and businesses near Heathrow.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
For our local communities, we alone will create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Just as they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of the expansion of Heathrow is too great.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
I was told that England will never be ready for the Games and that we will embarrass ourselves on the world stage.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at Heathrow.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
There are always obstacles to overcoming, but Heathrow answers every question put to him.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is for many, not individual, an infrastructure project.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Enlargement is a way of creating up to 180,000 new jobs, £ 211bn of sustainable growth and leaving a legacy of skills and employment both to the airport and to the whole of the GB.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
We have a great team at Heathrow that has implemented a £ 11bn expensive infrastructure investment programme in time and budget, from the T5 - which was chosen for five years in a row to the world's best airport terminal, to the T2, which was built amid the world's two most frequented runways.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Now they stand ready to deliver a third runway, which is backed by £ 16 billion of private investment.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
The 2012 London Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
It is time for us to steer this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, thereby securing our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.

Adblock Plus, Facebook in ' cat and mouse game ' on ad blocking
</seg>
<seg id="2">
For companies that make money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers, attempts to bypass ad blocking, a "cat and mouse game" are the same.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block ad blocking on its desktop site, Adblock Plus published a blogpost in which it said users could update their filters in the program to block advertising on the social network again.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the coding of its advertisements to make it more difficult to detect what part of the page is advertising.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to circumvent the new codes.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
In a blogpost, Adblock Ben Williams spokesman Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of hit-and-go battle between the notifying open source community and the bypass has already been underway since the invention of ad blockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The fact that the world's largest corporate social media company has entered the fray is a strong indication of how worrying ad blockers have become for the industry.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Worldwide, according to a study last year by Pagefair and Adobe, about 200 million people use ad blockers; nearly four times as much in 2013.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of advertising revenue Facebooks.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
The company has it on ad blockers on desktop PCs, as mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a spokesman said.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Advertising on desktop PCs accounts for a sufficient share of revenue, so Facebook seems to be worth the investment of such a step.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update its "ad preferences tool" to give people more control over advertising aimed at them.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters would be worrying because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
"For users, that is not a positive experience, so we plan to address the problem," said a spokesman for Facebook in an e-mail message.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Ad blockers are a blunt means, which is why we have focused instead on developer tools like Ad Preferences to put more control into people's hands.

Woman killed in suspected suicide on Swiss highway
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Police are calling witnesses after a woman was ousted in the early hours of Thursday amid a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a highway.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
A woman took to the streets in the Dark "in an act of desperation" and was hit by several cars, police said in Vaud.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
It is obvious that a Swiss woman aged 49, who was overrun by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill himself.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
She still died on the ground.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, said the police, who asked these as well as any witnesses of the incident to sign up.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
An investigation has been opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter told the Le Tribune de Geneve.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
However, it remains to be seen whether any of the drivers will be shown.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Was a collision preventable?
</seg>
<seg id="12">
That is something the prosecutor has to decide," said Hofstetter.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Two similar cases in the past five years show that drivers are not being held accountable.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
In each of the two cases - where a person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that motorists do not have to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the highway, the newspaper said.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Last year, a policewoman accused of negligent killing was acquitted after she overran and killed a man who was on the A1 near Payerne in August 2014.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and had become unconscious on the street, the court heard.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
The court found that the policewoman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- drove in a justified manner and that the presence of a man on the street was a "completely extraordinary and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Anyone who has any further information on the incident Thursday near Morges should contact police under the number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.

NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Venus was probably once habitable, according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The model was designed to determine whether Venus could have taken up similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and carbon-dense atmosphere.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Scientists have previously hinted that the slow turn of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus may have had a thin, earthquake-like atmosphere and yet slowly turned on.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The planet probably had more dry areas than Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to house life and protect it from rapid evaporation.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
"In the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exposed its day side of the sun for almost two months," explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heat.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of Earth today.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
The model produced a history of Venus similar to the evolution previously suspected of planetary researchers.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Although it was probably habitable, Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over the course of several billion years.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Their oceans evaporated and their water vapour was burned away by the ultraviolet light.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
As their Hydrogen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus as we know it today.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.

Patrick Roy resigns as coach of Avalanche
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Patrick Roy resigned Thursday as coach and Vice President Of Hockey Operations of the Colorado Avalanche and led to minor co-determination in the team's decision-making process.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Alternate President/General Manager of the Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately look for a new coach.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
"In the last three years, I have met my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Hockey Operations of the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," said the 50-year-old Roy in an opinion.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
I have been thinking long and a lot over the summer about how I could improve this team to give it more depth, it needs it and bring it to a higher level.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
To achieve this, the trainer's vision and Vice President Of Hockey Operations must be perfectly matched to that of the organization.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
He must also have a co-determination right in decisions that affect the team's performance.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
These conditions are not being met at the moment.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
"Patrick has informed me of this decision today," said Sakic.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Roy was honored during his debut season at the 2013-14 Avalanches as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards as the league's best coach.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
He led the club to 112 points and to first place in Central Vision, but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the playoffs by Minnesota and missed the postseason in each of the last two years.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 mark in the 2015-16 season and fell behind the Wild for a second wild card spot in the Western Conference by five points.
</seg>

As a Hall of Fame goalkeeper, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two plays with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.

North Sea oil workers resume talks, set off strike
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Labor disputes over pay for North Sea oil workers are suspended while all the contenders are set for a new round of talks, negotiators said.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group have been conducted sporadically on platforms in the North Sea, operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
"Wood Group as well as the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to reopen the settlement process of the current dispute," it said in a joint statement.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
We will hold some full-day sessions in the next few weeks, which will start early next year to address the issues.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The unions said their last strike, which is the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Wood Group this year cut rates to its contractor in the North Sea by about 9 percent due to negative market pressure.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The company's rate cut follows a 10-percent decline for onshore contractors in 2014.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
The company said additional cuts would give the company the space needed to come through the market downturn.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Shell has laid off thousands of people and announced plans to give up its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries as it rationalises its activities as a result of its mega-mergers with the British energy company BG Group.

Energy companies are under pressure because of lower crude oil prices, an economic situation that was heightened by the British decision in June to leave the European Union.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with Labor leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes that have taken place in the North Sea for a generation.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
The North Sea is important to the regional economy, he said.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
"In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for many and not just for a few," he said in a statement.

<seg id="15">
2016 is expected to be less than $1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $7 billion in the past five years.

The newest mission with the Kepler Space telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates under the stars of the Plejades ' star building.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The new data helps astronomers to understand why stars rotate at different rates in star clusters, as well as in what context the rotation periods are with the planetary structure.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The star cluster of the Plejades is 445 light years away from Earth.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Many stars in this cluster of stars, created about 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
They are now turning the fastest.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
At peak rotation rates, these mature stars produce large amounts of star winds.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
As these winds travel through the stars ' magnetic fields, they have a braking effect on the stars.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
When a star is aging, his rotation rate starts to slow down.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star flecks -- such as sunflecks --.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
The latest catalog of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars turn slower than less massive stars.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with bigger stars turning slower pirouettes than smaller ones.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
"In the" ballet "of the Plejades, we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," said Rebull.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
As the star of the Plejades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
"The star cluster of Plejades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
There is much in front of us that we would like to know more about how the How, When and Why Stars slow down their rotation rates and hang up their "dance shoes".
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Rebull and her colleagues have extensively reported in three newspaper reports on their latest analysis of the Pleijades ' rotation rates, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.

A controversial baseball star emerges
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The tears ran faster at Alex Rodriguez than the U.S. baseball star in best days from Base to Base.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
After his emotional resignation announcement, the 41-year-old professional will wear the jersey of his New York Yankees on August 12 against the Tampa Bay rays.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
"I love this game and this team."
</seg>
<seg id="5">
"I say ' Goodbye ' to both," explained the 14-time all-star game participant of Major League baseball (MLB).
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Rodriguez was voted the league's most valuable player three times, in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
His signature under a ten-year contract awarded him $27 million annually since 2007.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Until the end of the contract on December 31, 2017, he will serve as a consultant and youth coach - on full salary.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
As a player, it paid Rodriguez back with performance for a long time.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
With 696 homers, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("runs") for the Seattle mariners (1994-2000), the Texas Rangers (2001-2004) and the Yankees since 2005, he made some milestones.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
With Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie mays, only two other baseball players have similar values in the most important statistics.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
But in baseball's glory hall, the 41-year-old is not likely to be included.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Because so successful Rodriguez - nicknamed "A-Rod" - was on the field, so controversial is his appearance outside the square.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
As early as 2009, the superstar at "ESPN" admitted to having taken banned steroids between 2001 and 2003.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
In August 2013, it was closed for 211 lots due to involvement in the so-called Biogenesis scandal by the end of 2014.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Rodriguez is considered the prime suspect, for years, to have received performance-enhancing funds through an anti-aging clinic in South Florida.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
After a legal battle, the lock was reduced to 162 encounters.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
"The league might even have done me a favor for the year 2014, because I have been through 20 years without a break," Rodriguez told reporters at the time.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Even his farewell days do not go straight.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
While many baseball legends get the big stage again in their last games, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
"My job does not include a farewell tour."
</seg>
<seg id="22">
"My job involves trying to win every game," Yankees coach Joe Girardi said.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
After all, Rodriguez, who was married to actress Cameron Diaz and echoed relations with pop star Madonna and actress Kate Hudson, expressed sympathy for fans from the Yankee archrival Boston Red SOx.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
"We want A-Rod," sang the supporters at the 4: 9 defeat against the Rodriguez team.

Olympics 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Caught: due to a positive doping test, Adrian Zielinski is not allowed to start from Poland in Rio.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympics are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
A caught athlete would have almost won a medal.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Before the seventh race day, the first official doping cases became known as the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-meter obstacle runner Silwia Danekowa of Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski have been tested positive and ruled out in Brazil - just before the start of the already critically acclaimed athletics competitions, these messages come at the untime.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Last Sunday, Chen showed the diuretic hydrochlorothiazid, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The International Sports Court CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
On Sunday, the 18-year-old had finished fourth in the final over 100m butterfly, only by 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
On Friday, Chen should have taken part in the forerunners over 50 m free style.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Chen has requested the opening of the B sample and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
</seg>
<seg id="12">
The National Association takes the matter "very seriously and requires full cooperation in the investigations," Xinhua quoted a news release as saying: "we will cooperate with the International Sports Tribunal CAS and will accept the verdict."
</seg>
<seg id="13">
For the first time in history it is no longer the IOC, but the CAS responsible for sanctioning athletes with positive cases.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Also on the night of Rio, the news about the positive sample at Danekowa went through, the 33-year-old went into the offensive itself.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive", this was "an incredible shock," she told the Bulgarian TV channel BNT.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
She is innocent,"the only explanation could be dietary supplements," the athlete said.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
According to the report, the banned substance is the blood doping agent EPO.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Danekowa has been provisionally suspended, according to BNT, the B sample has already been positive.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Bulgaria's Prime Minister Bojko Borissov immediately spoke with criticism of the athlete.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
"I do not understand why the athletes do not draw the right conclusions," he said, adding: "we Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been ruled out."
</seg>
<seg id="21">
For example, all the weights from the chronically doping-impaired nation must not take part in Rio.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
On Friday, the case was also known as "Adrian Zielinski," the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg, as his brother Tomasz tested positive for the anabolic steroid Nandrolon three days earlier.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Both deny enrollment, but both are not allowed to start in class up to 94 kg.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
Before the start of the athletes, the Danekowa case is another major blow to the reputation of the whole sport.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
The International Federation of IAAF had banned the entire Russian team except for systematic doping, and Kenya also produced a lot of bad news in Rio.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
In swimming, the previous offense in China had also caused fierce clashes between athletes.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
So the Frenchman, Camille Lacourt, attacked Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang harshly.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
"Sun Yang pinkelt purple."
</seg>
<seg id="29">
"When I see the podium over 200 m free style, I want to hand over," Lacourt said on French radio.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
Sun was also at the centre of a dispute with the Australian Mack Horton.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
"I have no time and no respect for doping fraudsters," this one said.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
Sun had tested positive for the stimulant Trimetazidin at the Chinese championships in 2014, but had to sit down only a three-month lock.

Data clamp: so perfidious blacker hackers get their ransom
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeting companies - and they are successful.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
According to a recent survey of malware-defense specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Britain and Germany, 40 percent of companies surveyed over the past 12 months have been at least once, in part, victims of an attack with blackmailer software.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
In Germany, nearly 20 percent of firms were already targets of a ransomware blackout.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
40% of the victims willingly paid the ransom demanded by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the systems and data that were attacked.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
According to the observations of Malwarebytes, the perpetrators are specializing in attacks in corporate networks.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
If they are successful there, the potentially blackened ransom is significantly higher than for private users.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
"We are currently watching a frighteningly rapid evolution of the malware," explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski in talks with the "world".
</seg>
<seg id="9">
In 2008, most malware programs were designed to send advertising.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Then the perpetrators discovered extortion software for themselves.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Only private users were the target, but the switch to company attacks has been terribly fast over the last few months.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once active on a victim's computer, it searches for recently modified files such as Word, Excel or database files, as well as archives of images and videos.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
These files encrypt the ransomware and erase the originals in a sustainable way.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Then the software presents the demands of the blackmailers.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
In order to get the end keys code to the files, the victims must transfer money - usually in the form of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
However, where the personal photo database is at stake for private users, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production is closed.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
As a result, the damage occurs when a ransomware strikes.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
22% of the affected German firms reported revenue losses by Ransomware, 13% had to disrupt business altogether; in one case, people were in danger of life.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
In Germany, hospitals have already been victims of attacks, whose patients can be threatened by the loss of medical records.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
"We always tell the victims: do not pay, it only encourages the problem," explains Kleczynski.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
But 80 to 90 percent of firms that pay are getting their data back.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
It is difficult for managers to reject the perpetrators ' demand in the face of a standstill in operation.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
The hackers, in turn, know this and are trying everything to build a good reputation.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
In a recent study, F-Secure security researchers examined the user interfaces and contact with the blackmailers and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build some kind of customer service to take more money.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
They declare their victims by chat, how they can pay by Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites or decrypt sample files.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
And if private individuals are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros, companies will have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data back unencrypted.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
Given the potentially high and relatively risk-free profits from ransomware blackouts, the hackers are becoming more professional and sharing the work, explains security expert Chester WISNIEWSKI of the antivirus provider Sophos: "a single person can write a Ransomware about within a week."
</seg>
<seg id="28">
However, it is more likely that there are three or four people.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software module to the actual blackmailers.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
The previous malware kits were created by buying the malware itself, consulting and additional tools for a unique fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
"Included in the scope of delivery is an adaptation tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says WISNIEWSKI.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
The blackmailers then look for more hackers to spread the freshly bought software among the victims.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
We live in a service economy.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
So you log into one of the forums underground, buys the set of a criminal and instructs you to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
Payment is made per infected computer.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
"Usually the criminals charge spammers with the spread," explains WISNIEWSKI.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
The risk of Ransomware is now known to many companies that better secure their data.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
More than 50 percent of company IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey rely on the ability to repel Ransomware using file back-ups and scanner software.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
"If the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful performance, the perpetrators are threatening instead with the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
As a result, the potential for damage, depending on the type of data, is much higher than before.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
It would also be possible for the perpetrators to take completely new targets on the Internet in the future.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
At the hacker conference Defcon, security researchers showed how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
In the middle of winter, the release of such blocked heating could well be worth a ransom.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
If the perpetrators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in industry 4.0.

One for all cases

<seg id="2">
Honda HR-V is flexible and everyday
</seg>
<seg id="3">
In the small HR-V, Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivans.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Sounds pretty overloaded, but the HR-V, constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, turns out to be very flexible in everyday life.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Although only 1.60 m high HR-V looks small, the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear, it does not work at any point.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The materials of the interior are well processed and have a pleasant effect, only the cockpit upper side is there.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
There is not only a trunk of 453 litres at high and 1026 litres, but there are the "Magic Seats".
</seg>
<seg id="9">
This is less magical than it sounds: the rear seats of the rear seat can be folded up like cinemas and thus offer storage space, which is 1.24 metres high from the floor to the ceiling.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
The trunk can be loaded well, but the load height of 650 mm is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
The tested 1.6-l diesel with 88 kW/120 horsepower accelerates the HR V thanks to torque of up to 300 nm in wide speed ranges.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
However, he is likely to do his job somewhat quieter.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
The daily consumption of 4.7 l/100 km is pleasing.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
There is another motorization: a 1.5-lb petrol tank with 96 kW/130 horsepower.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
An all-wheel drive is not offered.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamism and comfort.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
But steering is likely to be a little more direct.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
The equipment in the tested top variant "Executive" leaves nothing to be desired.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
The security systems include the City emergency brake assistant (works up to speed 32), the collision warning system and the gauge assistant.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
The collision warner sometimes irritates, because he evaluates many obstacles as "approaching objects".
</seg>
<seg id="21">
The remote light assistant works very reliably.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
And the intelligent temporegler responds to the traffic sign detection and drops speed when needed.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
The full connectivity is available only for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, Navi, app integration and more.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
Two USB and one HDMI connectors are under the armrest and are therefore somewhat difficult to reach.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
The approximately 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are in order.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Those who do not want to invest so much will receive the petrol from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23000 euros.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
The engines meet the Euro 6 emissions standard.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
With the HR-V Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.

Illness: when the organiser pays
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Sick holidaymakers will only receive money after their journey, if the cause of the illness is undoubtedly found in the hotel.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
However, that is only the case when more than ten per cent of guests have been proven to show the same symptoms.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
In the negotiated case, a family was badly affected by diarrhoea and vomiting on the second day of their Turkish leave.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
She spent almost the entire holiday in the room.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Their illness led the holidaymakers back to a faulty sewage plant, which allegedly polled the seawater.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The family believed the trip was flawed - and sounded against the organizer.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
In court, the plaintiffs had no success.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
It is true that the water treatment plant was broken.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
But the organizer learned about it shortly before the departure of the plaintiffs.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
He had to assume until then that the sea water was in order.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
So he did not violate his information requirements, according to the ruling.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
No contamination has been found in the samples of the water.

Better flow of traffic on the motorway
</seg>
<seg id="2">
It regularly blew up on the bypass - here's a picture of Nov.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
But this is about to change: the legal trajectory is to be extended.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
This is good news for all car drivers who are standing in the traffic on the ambient road every evening when travelling via the motorway (A 43).
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Road construction is extended next Tuesday and Wednesday (16/17 August) in the area between Hammer Straße and the exit Weseler Straße.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Motorists can then walk directly from the hammer road to the right.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The great advantage: the traffic divides at an early stage, improving the overall flow on the very busy section of the Bundesstraße 51.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district agency of Münster-West.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
The road narrowing on the accessory nerves motorists, especially between 5 and 19 pm.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
On weekdays, the backlog extends to the bridge over the Albersloher route and sometimes beyond.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
The reason is the bottleneck on the B 51 just before the departure of Weseler Straße.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
From here, traffic will only be channelled across the motorway bridge.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
The second track had to be rebuilt well over three years ago.
</seg>

The reason: static calculations have shown that the bridge no longer has the required capacity to capture, in particular, heavy goods traffic.

It is not possible to say how long this bottleneck and the associated daily traffic jam will continue.

However, for years to come, the bridge has an official residual use up to 2034.

Intercultural journey: cultural offers for schools
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The international class of the forest school attended the play "The invisible House".
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The association Nima's and the boy theater are now planning a music project.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The association Nima's enables young people with migration and refugee backgrounds to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The "class International" of the Waldschule Kinderhaus has visited an idea of the award-winning piece "The invisible house" of the boy Theatre Münster.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
In the context of the "Intercultural journey" initiated by the association Nima's, 19 students between the ages of 11 and 15 attended the staging in the small house.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which aims at the cultural integration of young people with migrant and refugee backgrounds, offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster within the framework of this project.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Most of the young people in the class had come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016, including Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria, and spoke little German.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Thanks to the choreography, the scenic images and video animations, they were able to follow the course of action, according to the press release of the boy Theatre Münster.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
The association Nima's, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg of Sprakel, and the Young Theater will work together in the upcoming season as part of a musical theater project.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
From October to December, young people between the ages of 14 and 20 will be given the opportunity to attend professional courses in the fields of singing, dance, spectacle and music.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Offers for children and families in the area of theatre play and theatrical language placement are in the planning.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
The project "Intercultural journey" continues.

Rain instead of star snuff: hope for weather improvement
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The weather caused a stroke in southwest Germany on Friday night, but there is still hope.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The night was ill-suited for clouds and rain to watch the celestial spectacle, said the chairman of Sternwarte Welzheim, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.

Our hope lies on the night of Saturday.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The weather is supposed to be good, then we certainly see a lot of star snuff in the sky.

The stars are Perseids, which, at 216000 kilometers per hour, are among the fastest stars.

Relaxing night: tips against sleep disorders
</seg>
<seg id="2">
In the evenings you get around forever, at night you are awake and in the morning you can't think of sleep anymore.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
That is far from relaxing.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
After all, such problems are in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than 10% feel their sleep often or permanently as not recovering.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
How do sleep problems or sleep disorders occur?
</seg>
<seg id="6">
There are several forms of sleep disturbances, and they can cause a variety of causes, says Hans-Günter We<unk>, member of the board of the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Schlafforung und Schlafmedizin.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
What you mean by this is the insomnie, that is, an insomnia and sleep disorder.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
It is precisely the sleep that makes many people feel unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, a member of the Executive Board in the German Home Medical Association with practice in Lower Saxony.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
What is behind sleep disorders?
</seg>
<seg id="10">
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Behind this can be organic, mental or behavioral factors, but also drugs.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Not infrequently, sleep disorder is an expression of another disease.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
"Very early waking up is especially common in a depression," says We<unk>.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
And it may be that different factors require each other.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
For example, if you have a bandwagon, you can be bad, wake up every two to three hours, and perhaps begin to grapple with everyday problems and worries.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
That leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
When should you have sleep disturbances to the doctor?
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Anyone who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is impaired on the day should go to the doctor, advises weed.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
The impairment may look very different: one is off, tired, idle, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily appealing, has mood swings or physical ailments like stomach or headache.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
To ease the sleep disorder, it is important to find out their causes.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
Treatment options include behavioral changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or medication - classical sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
There are hardly any sleep doctors in Germany, says Prof. Ingo Fietze, director of the interdisciplinary dormitory center of the Charité University Medicine Berlin.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
That is why, when it comes to sleep problems, you should first contact the doctor.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
The can check with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
Who should go to the sleep lab, and what happens?
</seg>
<seg id="26">
For examinations in the sleep lab, medics advise, for example, on snoring with respirators, on sickle dayfatigue, sleep converters or if you do not find the cause of a sleep disorder, Fietze explains.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
You do not really have to prepare for the investigation.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
You should spend the day normally.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
"Just please do not make a luncheon," says Fietze.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
After the swirling, you go to bed at his normal time.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
In addition to the electrodes on the body, you wear a nasal glasses, a breast belt and a fan on your finger.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
There is also a camera on the ceiling.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
How can people get a grip on the problems?
</seg>
<seg id="34">
There are quite a lot of screws that can be used for a better sleep.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
Weaving counts: regular sleep and uplift times, not too long in bed, do not go to sleep on the day, do not watch TV to sleep, drink alcohol and do not look at the clock at night - then you start counting immediately and that is not conducive at all.

What the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Former German swimmer Markus Deibler has spoken on Facebook about the disappointing performance of the DSV team at Olympis.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
In December 2014, he first picked up gold at the short-track world championships in Doha, setting his first world record at the same time.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Now the former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has protected himself via Facebook against his ex-teammates in the critique.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
"In a country where an Olympic champion gets a € 20,000 premium and a jungle kingdom € 150,000, no one should be surprised about missing medals," the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The support system in swimming is bad, but the doping controls are very good.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
This means that we cannot compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look so closely at the issue of doping, or even do it.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
"I am not saying that the controls should be stopped here," he continued.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler would have to be reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti-Doping Agency, Germany (Nada).
</seg>
<seg id="10">
That is the way to keep it with countries.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
"Anyone who cannot be controlled for a certain period prior to WM/OS by independent controllers of WADA/FINA should not be allowed to participate," asks the pollster, who now runs an ice cream parlour.

Airport: gang of baggage thieves arrested
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Professional thieves at Düsseldorf airport
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Civil investigators from the Düsseldorf police on Thursday succeeded in arresting two women and two men aged 50 to 61.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The suspects had committed multiple pocket and baggage theft as a gang.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
At 9: 30.00 p.m., civilian officials in the Düsseldorf airport recognized a gang that was known to police from past theft offences.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The two women and two men had committed several offences since mid-July of this year, working together, collaboratively and professionally.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The specialists of the Crime Commissioner 34 will be able to demonstrate four actions to the thieves who were specifically responsible for committing crimes to Germany.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
They had taken a total of more than EUR 15,000.
</seg>
</p>

<doc sysid="KIT" docid="zeit.38290" genre="news" origlang="de">
<p>
<seg id="1">
Old buildings, some Lindenbäumchen, interspersed with the rest of the cobblestones: the Rigaer Strasse in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not look like this at first sight, but the police are one of the "dangerous places" of the city.
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Walk down the road from east to west, passing on playgrounds, a freshly coated kindergarten and a biolad.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
To the facade of a grey house someone has sprayed "ugly!"
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Compared to a Lidl, which is soon to be demolished, it is already being built: by 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments will be created.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Articles about this "trendy district", as the real estate company Friedrichshain called it, are, however, preferred in recent weeks with burning cars.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, now the residents have rental contracts, but on the ground floor are still occupied spaces and are used for events.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Especially the Berlin interior senator Henkel had argued several times since the beginning of the year for tough police action against the project, describing the area as a "no-go zone" for police officers and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
After being cleared on June 22, the rooms on the ground floor, the cadtery crews, with 300 police officers, patrolled the police for three weeks, with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on the ground, blocked parts of the road and kept visitors from entering the house with the number 94.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Meanwhile, construction workers renovated the premises on behalf of the unknown homeowners.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
On July 13, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the evacuation had been illegal, and a day later, police and construction workers withdrew amid the jubilation of sympathizers and residents.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
On this summer afternoon, the road is peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the pavement in front of the houses in the sun, others entertain Späti.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Left-wing violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in the Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who has three children here, are mainly generated by the police presence.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
With residents of the home projects, they share the concern about rising rents and gentrification.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
It does not sound like a Kiez, who mostly wanted police protection against vandalising leftists.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
The ditch of the Berlin interior senator and the police between house occupants and their neighbours does not seem to exist.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Friedrichshain, in the east of Berlin, was actually a traditional working-class district, which today also has a low average income and high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Home occupation and the resulting residential projects have long been part of the Kiez: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost all of Mainz Street near the rig.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
While the Mainzer had been cleared under great police escort in a veritable street battle, many of the projects in the Rigaer were legalized and are still inhabited by the people who occupied them 26 years ago.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
At the same time, in recent years, the district has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and polling liners from all over the world.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
That is also evident in the rents, which have risen by nearly 60 percent since 2009 in new rentals.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
Many of the new constructions in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: you can recognize them on wrapped slices or freshly coated facades that have been tossed with color bags.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
No other street has been mentioned so often this year along with the words "left-wing violence".
</seg>
<seg id="24">
One reason that not all neighbors see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as bodily injury are, according to statistics, almost exclusively against police officers.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
Most of the crimes are causing material damage, which tends to hit new buildings and newly renovated houses.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived for 17 years in a rental house next to the controversial 94, there can be no talk of insecurity.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
As far as violence is concerned, it is appeasement: the people in the 94 are their neighbours, who are certainly not.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
Even the famous burning cars no longer exist directly in the Rigaer.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "here you help each other, live together on the street and get more from each other than elsewhere".
</seg>
<seg id="30">
Neugebauer is deliberately drawn into the Rigaer street - and stayed.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
That is why it was so important for the residents to get their street back: the police, the politics and the media, all of whom suddenly claimed the sovereignty over the district in July.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: by faceless new buildings in former construction gaps that crowd out the old inhabitants.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
"These are, after all, condominiums that are not interesting to many here - they are more likely to be people who are not so good," she says.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
"I absolutely do not approve of violence and destruction."
</seg>
<seg id="35">
But what should you do if someone never listens?
</seg>
<seg id="36">
There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the inhabitants.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
Kerstin Neugebauer, who is annoyed by color bombs, has little understanding: the house projects and the left scene belonged to Kiez.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
Anyone who moves should be aware of this - just as someone who moves into a pub district can complain about noise there.

Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee commissioner
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organizer.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
She is also a social worker on the ground.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Since July, Annika Deuschle has been the refugee agency for Urbach.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The social pedagogy supports the management team around Achim Grockenberger.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
It sees itself as a contact person for all actors: refugees, refugee aid workers, administration, authorities and anyone else.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Regine's customer from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the ferocious wool mill, which has a particular problem.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
For example, some - less spotty than the multitude of desirable tasks - meant that when the administration wanted to put out the job.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
The search for an administrative force with a talent for languages and people, coupled with many years of experience in the field of social work, has just been searched.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
But administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deuschle.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Above all, it is about organization, work with people on the ground, and also behind the scenes, as well as network activity.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
The 31-year-old has been around for about six weeks.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
It has a 50 per cent stake in three years.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
"It was high time," says Regine's client, that supports Annika Deuschle's honorary and full-time actors.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
There are big and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
New containers will soon be found in Wasenstraße
</seg>
<seg id="17">
A serious problem has been for some time to find homes for the connecting refugees who have been recognised.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
The local authorities are responsible for the connection.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
They have to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented homes.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
The costs of building, renting or renovating these accommodations must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
The responsibility changes from the county office to the municipality and the Jobcentre.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer their apartment.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
The search has been very difficult for some time.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
De facto the administration does not find any private housing.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
So far, it is not working to rely on private housing, according to Deuschle.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Therefore, public housing needs to be stimulated, as it is so beautiful.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
So new containers will soon be set up in Wasenstraße.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
But only housing is not done.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
Perspective is the key word, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
In addition to a fixed lead, it is internships, training places, school places, one-euro jobs and aid activities for refugees and migrants that need to be funded or set up.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
"More places would be good," says Regine's customer.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
Many work in the building yard or help house masters, do nonprofit work - and that is motivated and very properly, as Annika Deuschle reports.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
It hopes that work for the community will lead to a positive external impact.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
That is ' no employment therapy '.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
But activity does not just mean work.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
The day needs a fixed structure, say Deuschle and customer.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
People would need to develop a sense of belonging.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
So there is a need for offers such as sports, contacts with locals and, above all, language courses.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
Professional courses are rare.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
So here, too, administration and honorary officials are jumping in.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
It is vital that the refugees feel that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
The long duration of the procedures is a problem.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
They must explain to refugees that it is taking time to bridge the gap, for example, with language courses.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
Anyone who eventually feels that he is unable to help anyone in Urbach should not be able to work and be useless, who will never integrate.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
The clear majority is motivated.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
However, there are also problems, says the customer,"people who have nothing at all", so the work of the Deuschle and the customer is always to motivate others.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
All of this is a "mammoth task".
</seg>
<seg id="48">
A difficult question: have the two, following recent events, been afraid of radicalisation, even in a small community like Urbach?
</seg>
<seg id="49">
"No," Regine tells customers quite clearly,"what some might call naive".
</seg>
<seg id="50">
The helpers, however, are already sensitized.
</seg>
<seg id="51">
These incidents are also a matter for the refugees.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
They would have the fear that the perpetrators would bring them completely into disrepute.
</seg>
<seg id="53">
"They want to show they have nothing to do with it," says Regine's customer.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
</seg>
<seg id="55">
So principal and honorary officials must look for activities on the ground and in the region.
</seg>
<seg id="56">
They always have in the background that a new surge of refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.
</seg>
<seg id="57">
Does Germany need a cap?
</seg>
<seg id="58">
To answer this question clearly is to shy away from politics.
</seg>
<seg id="59">
Actually, it is unfair to put them on the ground.
</seg>
<seg id="60">
"In Urbach we have not arrived yet where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.
</seg>
<seg id="61">
No new refugees, that would relax the situation.
</seg>
<seg id="62">
Regine's customer also makes it clear that the Urbachers are already busy integrating the existing people in a reasonable way.
</seg>
<seg id="63">
These are currently about 100 people, mostly young men.
</seg>
<seg id="64">
But if people are in need, they need help, both women agree.
</seg>
<seg id="65">
The political situation is so complicated, there are no easy answers.
