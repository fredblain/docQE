Donald Trump election campaign charges after staff allegedly drew gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign has been indicted for alleged inaction after it was told that her campaign leader for North Carolina in February put a gunshot on a staff while driving in February in a jeep.
The incident is described in an indictment filed Wednesday at Charlotte's national court by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in that state.
Bordini admitted to have waited months for the matter to be settled internally before reinventing that "that wouldn't happen."
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, "drew a pistol, put his right-hand finger on the withdrawal, and rammed the run in Vincents Knikehill," gave Bordini in his indictment.
Having complained to the local and regional campaign management, Bordini noted that at least four more people had already made the same experience with Phillip.
"Weapons don't have to be fired to cause damage," said Bordini.
The indictment comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate sparked a stir when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment people" - gungun owners and gun fans - should take measures if his rival Hillary Clinton were elected and judges appointed.
Trump's campaign made it clear that the media would have torn his words out of context and that he would not incite violence.
Monday's complaint claims damages caused by the campaign for breach of due diligence and from Philip for bodily harm and sustained psychological damage.
Trump's press spokesman Hope Hicks was unable to reach an opinion.
Try to contact Philip as well.
WCCB, a local news outlet in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer staff of the campaign.
Calls to his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, did not respond.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has so far led a controversial campaign.
The trial is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
