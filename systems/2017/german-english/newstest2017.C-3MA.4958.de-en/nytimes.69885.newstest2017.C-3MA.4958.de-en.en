Once squeezed over price from the market, comes cafe in Greenpoint
The staff were very friendly and helpful.
Of course, prices from his Bedford Avenue Ladies Front have been squeezed out.
The business Soap Cherie, the verb, invented in the summer of 2014, sold soap in the form of cupcakes.
Indigenous mourned it as the last loss in a gentrified city.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is changing, but I still cannot believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel except and Verb is now a soap business."
But if New York is changing, then it's also reinvention.
A revived verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north from its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly narrow atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old cafe, owner and manager of the new cafe.
He started working in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When he offered a client to provide money for a new outlet, he was excited to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, spared a great deal.
Verb used the same distributor for the badge bought the same espresso model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnings like captains and sauted onions.
There are nature-making.
The caf√© serves no more beer, there are fresh juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.
"Many old customers have also been driven by prices from Williamsburg," he said.
Recently on one Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, lived in Williamsburg earlier.
Even after she was pulled to Greenpoint, she would take the path.
After the verb had closed, they gave up the coffee rings a while, she said.
"I became clear that it was in the coffee and in the culture in the verb that I liked," she said.
Now she's drinking again coffee, even if she ordered a pencil Chai Tea on that day instead of her usual Iced Caffee.
Tom Rosenthal has been another longtime and loyal customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.
He went there before the job and always ordered him to die.
"I came out of quarter after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket clock and they prepare my Everything Bagel with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and include new ingredients in the menu.
Nowadays, Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his Everything Bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said he did not agree that the soap business has taken the old business room.
In fact, the owner of the Soap Cherie offered a special soap for verb with the coffee of coffee as a ingredient.
"I think we're going to go back to their offer," Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoints have also accepted the cafe.
A new customer has translated the menu into the Polish and Rodriguez said he had pretending to put it soon so that his new neighbours feel welcome.
The location also has further advantages.
A local juice locally wants to fill and sell cold-fried coffee.
There is a chance that the cafe will expand to a neighbouring building.
For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favourites.
Joseph Witt was tribal and said he was destroyed on the ground when the cafe closed.
When the new cafe opened, Whitt said that the subject of the locomotive and the bearer was feeling a new coffee as a home return.
"I had to smell that," he said.
