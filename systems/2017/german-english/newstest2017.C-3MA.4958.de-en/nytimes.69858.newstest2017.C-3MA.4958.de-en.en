Donald Trump explains his claim Obama had established ISIS was "sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump sought to dispel the last controversy on Friday that surrounds his campaign by admitting that his repeatedly repeated claim that President Obama and Hillary Clinton would be the "founder" of the Islamic State's terrorist group would not be taken seriously.
This clarification raised new questions about the communications capabilities of the Republican presidential candidate, whether he was able to communicate clearly and understand with the American public.
It also brings together his fellow combatants, who are trying to protect him during an eventful period, in the peculiar position of declaring statements that he could not mean.
Having made the suggestion at a campaign event on Wednesday night, Mr. Trump reversed in relation to the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest the president and Mrs. Clinton would have created ISIS.
But in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.
The tweet was the contrast to the previous day, at which Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews that he thought the accusation was entirely serious.
When the conservative Radomoderator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to help to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential nominee wanted nothing of it.
The last storm of criticism is based on Mr. Trump, while he tries to steer the focus of his campaign on the economic situation because of falling demand.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried again to return to this issue.
On Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already raised Sarkasmus to his defense.
At the end of July, he drew strong criticism when he thought the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but he later declared "Nat√ºrlich meant the sarcastic."
This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then return to change.
"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are taken by his fans as they arrive, and then, if necessary," said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who observes the language of both candidates.
However, I also believe that he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways.
Rather than defuse the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more senior tone, as his poll values have continued to decline.
A new poll by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, released Friday, showed a lead with great lead in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-in-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump is generally trying not to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accused his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstand his humour.
But while he is stepping up in the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's henchmen have brought his loyal fellow protesters into the uncomfortable situation to face him, regardless of how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent principals, gave a great deal of trouble to the candidate today in a CNN interview from Thursday.
"I believe in what he says legitimate, political comments" said Mr. Giuliani was questioned about the accuracy of Mr. Trump's statements, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had set up the Islamic State.
In this sense, it is true that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backbenches, utterly wrong and therefore it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as the Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread out by making it more aggressive in the Middle East.
Ahead of the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and threw them up on each of his words and being biased against him.
He exited the "poor, jemmerious" television experts who try to understand him and said, "You can't it!"
Some of the Democrats spotted Mr. Trump's apology as just another proof that he was unfit for the presidency.
