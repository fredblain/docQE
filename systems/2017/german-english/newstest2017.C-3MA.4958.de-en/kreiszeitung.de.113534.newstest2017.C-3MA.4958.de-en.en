Podolski attacks' Gala 'after Supercup
Hakan sweetness is a football legend in Turkey.
An arrest warrant has been issued in Turkey against the former football star Hakan Sükiss.
He is accused of being a terrorist group.
For the first time after the coup attempt, an important football game is taking place in Turkey.
Before the duel of the archrivals between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul to the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: "Business as usual" is said.
Even if the state of emergency was to be imposed after the crash in July, the government, which would not be affected by the everyday life of ordinary citizens.
However, this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to Fethullah Gülen, who is responsible for the coup attempt.
This is not the case before football.
Against former Starkiker Hakan Sükhr, prosecutors said a warrant was issued.
In the meantime, the South of America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
Sükär is to be a supporter of Predicer Fethullah Gülen, who is blamed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup attempt.
It is true that the state of emergency of 90 days is still in place until October, but it does not have any effect on the life of most Turks.
The night-time "democracy guards" on public places across the country said Erdogan has been declared an end on Wednesday.
Sport - like the whole country - is divided into supporters and opponents of Erdogan.
Especially fans of the Besiktas working club are traditionally not among the president's friends.
But, given the dramatic history of history, the Turks are strongly opposed to military purses.
Even even the fans agree - no matter whether their heart beats Galatasaray or Fenerbahce.
At the "Gala" Cup, it will be particularly important to arrive at Lukas Podolski.
In the past season, the Cologne has proved its sporting value: With 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions, the 31-year-old finished his first time as the top scorer of his association.
In the final game against Fenerbahce, he scored the 1: 0 victory.
The newspaper "Fanatics" complained to him: "He was the best on the pitch."
He finished the season superbly and secured the ball.
Thanks to "Poldi," the disappointing season for the record master was a conciliatory conclusion.
After the pre-season k.o in the Champions League, the "Löwen" also shoots in the Europa League early.
In the South Lig, it was only to rank six.
The season wasn't good.
The Postal was the only way to win something.
"That's what we've got and that's the most important thing," Podolski said.
For master Besiktas the match year went better.
Thanks in particular to Mario Gomez, who was the second title to the 14th title with 26 seasons as a South-Lig-Torprotective King.
That's also the reason fans continue to hope for the return of the 31-year-old.
In doing so, Gomez, who was under the agreement of the AC Florence, had only been informed of the coup attempt, because of the political situation in the country.
"If Mario wants to come to us," he must just say "Kicker" Kicker "Kicker" Club chef Fikret Orman.
However, to do so, the stuner would have to be prepared to dispense with approximately one-third of his year's estimate of EUR 7.5 million, Orman said: "We cannot pay his salary at Florence."
