Rain instead of star snow: Hope for weather improvement
The weather has made the star-snowing wickets in southwest Germany on the night to Friday a stranger through the bill - but there is still hope.
The night, because of clouds and rain, could have been ill-suited to observe the celestial sphere, said the President of the Sternwarte Welzheim, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.
Our hope lies on the night of Saturday.
The weather is supposed to be good, then we can see many star snows on the sky.
The asterisks are perseidae, which, with 216,000 kilometers per hour, belong to the fastest star.
Their names have them because they seem to come from the constellation of Perseus, which runs north-east.
