Culture of Political Correctness leaves voter fraud in Muslim neighborhoods
Former mayor of Tower Hamlets Luttum Rahman was arrested last year on trial of a government report on corruption
A culture of Political Correctness has caused widespread voter fraud in Muslim communities to knowingly ignore what a devastating government report has revealed today.
Former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles is attacking police, election observers, and council houses to have ignored evidence of voter abuse due to "obesity and religion."
The former Minister for Integration and Local Government, who is now an anti-corruption member, said intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that police should be allowed to set up landlords outside polling booths to protect intimidated voters.
He recommends that voters should hold a card to prove their identity in elections.
At the moment, a voter only needs to name his name and address.
The report proposes that non-removable ink on the finger of a person should be issued if they give their votes to prevent someone from choosing twice.
Whistleblowers should receive more protection, says Sir Eric.
It calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions by non-official Comoros or Working Groups.
"This is not just against voter fraud, but also seeks to protect the community government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that accompanies it," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlets election scandal in East London.
Last year, a special panel ruled that the incumbent mayor, Mr Lutfr Rahman, should be removed after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his duties.
The court found that Rahman would have had the religious feelings of its Muslim community "in a cynical manner" and that he had silenced his critics with racial and Islamophobia debt.
Rahman is supposed to have "conducted his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose it."
Up to 300 votes were either dubious or the result of an imitation, where one person as someone else chooses.
Sir Eric said there were evidence of fraud across the country.
He said, in particular, alarming about the fraudulent exchange of letters - the older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose a candidate for their choice.

His report states: "As evidence was appropriate, pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exercised, in particular women and young people to choose, in accordance with the will of the elderly, in particular communities with a Pakistani or non-Muslim background.
"There were concerns that... State institutions had knowingly ignored such behaviour as a result of" politically correct "over-sensitivity to the ethno and religion."
Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including the ban that political activists handle letter-voting documents to stop "whistleblowers."
The report, considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and social fraud.
Consider options to ask voters before the election.
Don't use removable ink on a person's finger as soon as she has delivered her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice.
Carry out systematic reviews of a person's nationality to ensure they are eligible.
A three-year limitation to applications for an automatic letter.
Ban that political activists process complete letter elections and envelopes of letter elections.
The police have the power to set up closures around polling stations.
A legislative amendment facilitating an indictment of intimidation pursuant to the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Shooting ban in polling stations.
Request that only English can be used in polling stations (except Wales).
Stepping up training to make sure employees enforce the rule that voters alone go to the polling booth.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that after the Tower Hamlets case was not put to a stranger.
"The Electoral Court has said Lutfor Rahman and his deputy for reasons of a litany of corrupt and illegal practices were deemed to be untapped," he said.
It has been found guilty by a number of reasons - in line with the high standards of criminal proceedings.
It also criticizes the ineffective "abortion checks" of voter registration departments.
Sir Eric said: "The court ruling in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.
Our country bears a proud legacy as the mother of the parliaments, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threatens this good reputation.
