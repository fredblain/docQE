Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness worth seeing
It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.
That teens and children are no longer to go outside, but rather prefer to spend their free time on screens, has been complained by many over the last decade.
At Pokemon Go, it's about getting people from the sofa to get more active.
The time at the screen was initially confined to the TV, then limited to video games and most recently on smartphones.
It is therefore great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.
I am, of course, referring to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were first created for video games in the 1990s (a cartoon series, game cards and other spin-offs).
Like many phenomena of pop culture, interest declined before the release of the game in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The launch of the market in other countries has been delayed by the massive demand that the servers overloaded.
Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, players go out with their smartphones and search for Pokémons, who are tracked with a GPS and, once found, "photographed" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "captured."
A generation playing the game, when she was even younger, joined the win and jumped for the sofa.
In the US, the game led to a significant rise in steps that the "average" person put back every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which tracked 35,000 users, told the Washington Post recently that within two days of the game's launch, the number of subsequent people, who train every day for 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn't know who is playing Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data for the performance increase.
A lot of public awareness-raising campaigns on health, who want to get people to "take 30 minutes," "from the sofa to come" and "active every day," because many public messages about health are boring and come from people who look elend.
Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overvalued.
Those who regularly drive sports reduce their chances of becoming sick of cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here.
But the Wonderful of Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.
Three pillars of health cover - movement, fresh air and sunshine and fun.
Some people close to hunting even new friendships.
As always, there are men's players who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could run against a door.
What?
A breakthrough occurred.
Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit had previously been able to follow our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to drive sports like this game.
The new one will lose its charm and use it with time.
However, thanks to Pokemon's success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the assets in the real world, helping many people to hunt, active, fitter and healthier.
