Despite Olympia disappointment: Martin remains struggling
Despite his disappointing appearance in Olympic timing, Radprofi Tony Martin doesn't want to leave.
"I continue to keep the World Cup in sight, remain confident and continue to fight," the 31-year-old wrote on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook.
He does not have a declaration for his masked 12-seat.
"Frankly, I find it difficult to comment on the time driving yesterday," said Martin.
He would have to analyse the reasons for the debacle.
At the time of the World Championships in October in Qatar, Martin was actually to fight the title.
"I will look at everything that we have changed in recent times."
"To this count also counts," wrote the three-time newspaper world champion who had lost on Wednesday's 54,5 km more than three minutes on Olympiasian Fabian Cancun (Switzerland).
