Golfer Langer gets the sports pyramid
His experiences on the horse are manageable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer was looking for a bit of variety with a passing on the beach.
For the 58-year-olds, it was a premiership.
Chio: 'Golden sports pyramid' for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses were reminded of their holiday, they were hunting at home to feed.
A kilometre at that pace, I was afraid.
"It wasn't a good experience," says Langer.
And so the riding career ended again.
On Saturday, Germany's best golfers of all time - 101 tournament victories - were once again close to horses.
He left with his family about the ALRV facility, on a horse he was not interested in photography.
Long was the first time in Aachen and the CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German sports support was handed over to the man from Anhausen in the frame of a small gala the Golden Sports pyramid.
There is no lack of awards for the sympathetic athlete.
Bundesverwaltkreuz, Silver Lorbeerblatt, Champions Tour player of the year...
Even the British Queen has already posted it.
Long is the 18th anniversary of the sport pyramid.
In Aachen, he met first winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
"This award means a great deal," says Langer, "she is awarded not only for sporting successes but also for social engagement."
For decades, Langer has been promoting aftergrowth.
And so he gave the prize money of 25,000 euros equally.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-fold US Masterwoman was added to the "Hall of Fame of the German Sports" on Saturday.
The recordings include the athletics of Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the Fechter Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Puch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob-driver Meinhard Nehmer, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the sprint of Alwin Schackemöle and postman of the craftsman Erhard Wunderlich.
Many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the Fidelity company emigrated to the Springstadium, where the Lavazza Prize was running.
Bernhard Langer kept distance to the big animals.
