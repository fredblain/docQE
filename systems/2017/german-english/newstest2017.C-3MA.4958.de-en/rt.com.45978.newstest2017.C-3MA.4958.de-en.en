Police set tear gas and rubber shock against Protestant Brazilian students
Students met with police on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo when they gathered to demonstrate against the government's reforms to the public education system.
Police set tear gas and rubber feet against the protesters.
The trouble began when police officers were trying to deal with the students, which resulted in the police firing rubber boots and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their concern about the plans.
According to the governor's proposals, Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, a little less than 100 public schools will be closed, while 300,000 students are being implemented to save money.
Some of the protesters saw graffiti on the ground against the interim President Michel Temer.
The latest protests occurred a few days after protesters walked into crowds on the streets to support the suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been removed from office by a Senate vote.
