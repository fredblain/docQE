Riddles around fish landed in garden in Banff
A population of Banff called for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that the 75 fish could be around Sandal, who were spilled by a fountain.
Mr Bain, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, posted a video of the spectacle on Periscope in the hope that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish.
