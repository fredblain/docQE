Salzburg 'West Side Story' with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare year, the Salzburg Festival presents the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic love, similar to Romeo and Julia.
With a surprise Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical captures Salzburg: The West Side Story, Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.
The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and met with the role of Maria a youth room.
In the orchestra, the Simón Bolívar Orchestra under the direction of the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm," he warmed.
We always say that it is very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody.
It's a wonderful mixture, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say that we have Bernstein's music really in our blood!
In this staging, Bartoli plays an older Maria.
She remembers her love with Tony while the younger Mary plays and dances.
The role of Maria has always fascinated me.
First of all because it is musically exceptional!
And then there would be Marias's personality.
She says it in her song: "I feel prethy, oh so prettty, I feel prethy and witty and bright."
So it is smart, of course naïve, and very passionate.
"It resembles me very, my Italian character I have as a Roman," laughs Bartoli.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It's so an honour for us to work with her.
It is an enormous generous person.
And Bartoli returns the compliments: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary performer and very passionate!"
Digging is a necessity for him.
One sees it in each of his movements, in his blacks, it's his life!
It's so a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a more southern temperament, a fire, a passion and a cheerful approach to life, which is very important!
For the American director Philip Wm. McKinley is the "West Side Story" highly topical: "This piece is about prejudice and fanaticism."
Today we have the refugees, at the time, the Puerta del Sol went to New York and the New Yorkers didn't want them.
These are the same issues and they are just as relevant today.
59 years later, the piece is still relevant.
