In the name of the fight against terrorism, laws are being broken down.
Following the recent attacks, the Minister for the Interior, Mr de Maizière, now faces a thick safety package.
But what is a tolerance status with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say to all this?
Thomas de Maizière gives the Veröhner.
All his proposals are "politically reasonable," the Federal Minister for the Interior says in the presentation of his new security package.
They don't overdemand anyone.
Others, further points would be discussed at first within the parties.
I am also involved in this.
However, as a Home Secretary, it is in favour of results and an "achievable consensus" within the Coalition.
De Maizière has left a little time after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach before presenting its conclusions on security in the Republic.
That is all the more important.
A lot has already been announced, heralded by the fact that a new security agency is to take care of using encrypted communications.
Nor does Germany have to implement several EU directives on passenger data and weapons legislation.
The call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is also not surprising.
In part, de Maizière is launching a second round of proposals for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD: He wants to criminalise recruitment for terrorist groups and, with dual citizenship, would push the German passport.
"That will be difficult points for the SPD," admits the CDU man.
However, he believes this is reasonable and I call for nothing to do with the coalition partner anyway.
A few new ideas are presented by de Maizière.
These have been partly in itself: It plans to make rapid deportation and more opportunities to arrest people before deportation.
Refugees who are targeted in the country should first check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a security review.
In cases of rejection for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to put aside some even worse than to date - such as committing crimes or deliberately throwing away their papers to conceal their identity.
Some of this is politically and legally delicate.
Manches also seem to be invisible and leaves questions open.
And on some points - in the case of unequal treatment for example - the question arises: What has it actually done with security and terrorism?
Yes, it is important to differentiate between refugees and terror.
But we cannot deny that the perpetrators of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people were concerned about security, given the high number of refugees.
And things that are deeply employed by the people have not yet been left out for election campaigns.
Internal security has been enormous.
Only the attacks in the neighbourhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
Uncertainty is great.
And yes, there are election battles.
The Union and the SPD have therefore become increasingly active in the field of internal security.
Over the past few days, the two parties have been high.
Only a garsting dispute over the equipping of federal police, then over a security-policy-thinking collection of some Unions Home Secretary, in which the portfolio chiefs are also calling for a Burka ban and a departure from dual citizenship.
De Maizière is also here to make sense.
There is nothing to do with the disappearance of the double.
We have satisfied the discussion in Germany.
To remake it is not meaningful.
And on a burka ban, he has constitutional concerns.
Whether his own package is constitutional and whether it is actually "reasonable" for the coalition partner, it is still necessary.
There are some things that could cause dispute.
But the SPD is also trying to take advantage of internal security.
Party leader Sigmar Gabriel signals his willingness to talk openly and says: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything, which helps to further increase security."
