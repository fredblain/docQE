Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by fight with the trainer's cancer to rudder victory
There will be no emotine gold than in those games, and that is what you want.
From the first slide to the last, 220 hard Hieve that came into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an extra significance in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
The Echo of the trainer Robin Williams was here as she was a second Olympiagold in the second without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British Sports, which laid such a benchmark.
Her dominance was absolutely, after all, its 39th unsuspecting bet, which is also unprecedented.
What we are seeing are two brilliant athletes who glide over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the nature of the triumphal.
Behind every gold in the rudder, a Batamillon is stuck to willing heroines that contribute to the incremental advances that make up the difference and it was no euthanising than the coach who did not know 30 months ago whether he would survive that day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer.
As he said, he was risky.
I had bladder cancer, which is operable and they did.
If you don't do that, he spreads everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes a little to the outlook.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, which kept the interruption to a minimum if that is the right term in such circumstances.
I needed money, so I had to go back again.
It was an incentive.
I was in hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.
That's how it starts.
It is already a challenge, but this makes it an even bigger one.
In the insufficiency of the victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerving morning doing something more than usual, trying to process his own fears.
Stanning, who was the main man in the Royal Artillery Regiment in an effort in Afghanistan, said "I was an emotional wreck this week, which is perhaps something extreme, but it means so much."
It just repeats how much I mean, how much I and Helen and Robin worked.
It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we would be no one, and therefore a massive thank him to him.
I would have no better person to train or better coach.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the past five years.
The couple had a tough rhythm, with which their opponents couldn't compete.
Even in the last 500 metres, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to finish, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were caught very at the moment.
Helen called "leaded in the process, sustained in the process."
It is really important not to let go.
We had a good start and at the same time we were not prepared to make something rabies.
We did not want a fireworks today, we simply wanted to achieve a good result, go beyond and win the race, which we did.
The couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about his future.
Glover will have to appear on a wedding next week, her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she simply wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say that was my last race.
That would have caused excessive pressure.
In London, it took about six months to realise that I am an Olympic champion.
It was all so new to me and I was so stressful.
Here it took about four minutes.
That feels so much better, "she said.
