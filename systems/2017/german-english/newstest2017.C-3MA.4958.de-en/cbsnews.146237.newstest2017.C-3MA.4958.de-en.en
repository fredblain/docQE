Police: 3 victim in serial killer incident at music hearing in car shot
According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot dead in one of the most deadly attacks since a decade in the first series mortar case of Phoenix, while they kept in the car and listened to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot dead on June 12 while the car was parked in an entrance, authorities said.
The perpetrator humbled eight shots from a handgun weapon while standing on the passenger's side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, is to read in the report.
Police said that the triple murder did not seem to have been the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 who was in possession of one of the adult victims.
Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said the shooting was giving investigators a closer look at whether they are linked to four previous attacks.
In total, in Hispanic residential areas, seven people were killed and two more injured in nine attacks within four months.
"It happens in a residential neighborhood in front of a house," shared Howard of the KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, earlier this month.
It is believed to have used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990 "s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators refused to disclose the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to her injuries and died later.
Liner, 31, and Ellis daughter Maleah still died on the ground.
One witness told police that it was not uncommon for them to sit in a parked car and hear music.
Authorities also released a police report on the shooting, which targeted an empty pickup truck a half-hour before the triple murder and assumed it was the work of the serial killer.
Investigators found patron enclosures and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine room.
