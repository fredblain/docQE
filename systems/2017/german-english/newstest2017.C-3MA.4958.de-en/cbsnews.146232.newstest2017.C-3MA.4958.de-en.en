Simone Biles creates gold in the dam
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is on all that immune.
Dynamically on the sprunken.
Effortlessly on the bar.
Stunning on the ground.
On whole line brilliant.
And now, at last, Olympic Champion.
The 19-year-old American Turner climbed to the multiplayer title on Thursday and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in the face of the Olympics.
Their overall result of 62.198 was clearly in front of the silver medal winner and "Final Five" team-mate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.
The American women's Simone Biles turnt on the Sweet during the men's section of the women in the arts tournaments at the Summer Olympics Games in Rio de Janeiro in 2016, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multi-match title and overall the fifth, while consolidating her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.
She broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey in that moment was ending.
This success puts them into the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who have brought their sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated her sport's last three years, winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that involve a mix of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou rescues of her said she was "the best turner I ever saw."
She expected a final exam in Brazil, a contest that went not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of over-dimensional expectations.
Not having a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas would be seen as disappointment.

Biles picked up the first medal on Tuesday while serving as an exclamation mark on the relegation ceremony of the team co-ordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles insisted on it, during her long way to the top, never planned the future, that's not really true.
Part of their floor exercises - which includes their typical Tumbling Pass - is aligned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
This is no accident.
This girl, who has been adoptioned by her grandparents as a small kid and was discovered by trainer Aimee Boormans's mother during a school outing, in which Boorman trained, became the force.
It has not lost any more competition since the summer of 2013, a set of victories that will continue as long as Biles wishes.
Even though Mustafina was slightly guided by two shoots, the picture sounded.
Swedes and Bodenburg - in which Biles holds the World Championship title.
She picked up again with 15,433 on the Sweet again - and still has a 15,933 on the ground.
Raisman breathed them gently when they expected their final wound - a pure formality - and tears flowing on Biles's glossy red, white and blue Eyeer than the vision she once described in her collection book.
The performance Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place but the bronze medal went to Mustafina.
This time, the 22-year-old number of teams, called "Oma," had a lead.
After her floor exercise, she threw the audience Kouswede, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes appeared dubious.
As far as Biles is concerned, the rapidly expanding tweet of the 19-year-old from the beginning of this week has a very new meaning:
