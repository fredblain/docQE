Here comes the Enforcing Trailer
Germany's grass must be adjusted to the next generation of speed meters: In various federal states, among other things in Hessen and Brandenburg, new flash devices will be tested, which should be particularly effective over the ground.
For example, the futuristic actuation trailer of the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used in case of accident areas, where it would be too dangerous to use a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, at highway construction sites or connecting bridges with temporary timing, there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that the speed limit is observed there.
However, a permanent mobile development can be too dangerous or complex.
The driver is self-sufficient: His battery holds five days on uninterrupted measurement operations, the case data being encrypted via a modem.
With laser measurement technology, all vehicles can be captured across multiple tracks simultaneously.
Variable speed limits, as well as traffic bans by time, track and vehicle class can also be monitored.
In the high-risk state, the trailer can be used by the manufacturer with a clutch.
In order not to simply clad it, it is lowered in the measuring operation, so the wheels are disappearing in the armored and also a smooth outer shell.
In addition, a built-in alarmist aims to protect the Blitzer against vandalism.
Since 2015, the trailer has been tested and used in various federal states, according to Vitronic.
Foreign authorities also blasted with the new technique: France has recently changed 100 pieces, following an order of 150 pieces last year.
