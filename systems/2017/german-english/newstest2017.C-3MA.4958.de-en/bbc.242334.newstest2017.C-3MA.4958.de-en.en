Russia and Turkey: An "Alliance of outsiders"?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and declare an official end of the eight-month-long war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin received his Turkish counterpart in the murdering Hall of St. Petersburg's Palace, I cannot deny that Ankara wants this reconciliation most.
There was the handshake, yes.
But Putin's smile had a meltdown, and he barely radiated heat, even for his restrained relationships.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke repeatedly of his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report all five times.
I couldn't count it any more.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.
The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have been as it would never have happened.
To me, his enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite.
But a sustained and sustainable cold demonstrated by Putin that Russia's leader had nothing to forget.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his words: The firing of a Russian fighter on the Syrian border with Turkey.
Moscow's reaction to the time was wuttering.
Putin shared out and accused Ankara of being back to Russia.
The offence was even bigger, as it was committed by a alleged friend.
Building the veto will be difficult, if not impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, state-controlled media conducted a fierce, full attack on Ankara.
Once it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.
The most serious were allegations by senior officials that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from the illegal oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He disputed that.
But in St Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward.
After all, this meeting was held only because Putin received the apologies of President Erdogan.
Russia had a kind of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are clear.
Erdogan first needs all the friends he can get after he was unravelled at a failed coup last month.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.
But there are economic motives too.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular, the ban on charter flights that typically bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has dropped by nearly 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights are resumed.
They count on a late-seasonal Anstorm to the Mediterranean.
This week, the state television forecast cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.
A report in Vedemosti put it: "Tourists there, tomatoes here long."
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West as it considers its response to the attempted takeover as a weak answer.
To this end, continued resentment of the EU's accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey's relationship with the West.
The Russian leader won in Ankara with security a bonus for calling for support for elected statehood following the attempted coup d'Ã©tat.
For Moscow, this is a matter of course, which itself has a deep fear of regime change.
The summit in this Gaulal palace on the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to portray a "alliance of outsiders," as one analyst once described to me: Two countries that are in breach of the West and feel poorly treated and are now behind.
Yet, despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently served as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It might be significant that, after nearly three hours of initial talks, both presidents said at the press conference that they would not even have had the issue.
The President of Turkey deliberately had to respond to a question about their differences, while Putin chose to emphasize it.
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found on Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey shuts off the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State should, at least again, talk again.
