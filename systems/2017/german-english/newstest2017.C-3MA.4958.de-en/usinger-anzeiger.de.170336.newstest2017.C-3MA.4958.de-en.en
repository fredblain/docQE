A controversial baseball star enters
The tears ran at Alex Rodriguez faster than the US baseball star in best days from Base to Base.
After his emotional resignation announcement, the 41-year-old professional on August 12 against the Tampa Bay Rays will be wearing a last-minute tribute to his New York Yankees.
"I love this game and this team."
"I say 'Goodbye'," explained Major League Baseball's 14-and-one All-Star Game contestants.
Three times, Rodriguez was elected to the league's most valuable player, in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees.
His signature under a ten-year contract awarded him $27 million a year since 2007.
Until the end of the contract on December 31, 2017, he will act as an advisor and youth coach - in full salary.
As players, Rodriguez paid back a long time with performance.
With 696 homerus, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("Runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and since 2005 the Yankees gave him some milestones.
With the Hall-of-Fame member Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two other baseball players in the main statistics show similar values.
However, the 41-year-old is not likely to be included in baseball's fame.
Because so successfully Rodriguez - nicknamed "A-Rod" - was on the field, so controversial is his appearance outside the place.
Already in 2009, the superstar was admitted to "ESPN" between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, he was blocked for 211 games due to a development in the so-called Biogenesis scandal.
Rodriguez is considered to be the main suspect to have received performance-enhancing funds for years over an anti-aging clinic in South Florida.
After a lawsuit, the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters.
"The league could even have done me a favor in 2014, because I've played through 20 years without a break," Rodriguez said at the time.
His absentee days did not go quiet too.
While many baseball legends were still getting the big stage in their final games, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench.
"My job does not include a goodbye tour."
"My job involves trying to win every game," said Yankees coach Joe Girardi.
After all, Rodriguez, who was married to actress Cameron Diaz, and who will follow the relationship with pop star Madonna and actress Kate Hudson, received sympathy from the fans of the Yankee archrival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod," sang supporters at the 4: 9 defeat against the Rodriguez team.
