Lonely men of middle ages love plates.
Before you go to the commentaries, to overshadow him under the pseudonym of non-alleyone-sex marriage, this statement is derived from current data.
According to YouGov, the much-talked resurgence of soundboards is not on a boom in Reuters that want to welcome the novelty of physical objects, but because of midlife nostalgia.
Those who recently bought a plate are forward-looking after age between 45 and 54.
In fact, the 18-24 age group is the most unlikely buyer group.
It is also not a horden by amateur collectors - it has an emotional meaning: Older platters retain their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it alone (69% vs. 66%).
But are YouGov's results?
If this blog would be a news report on television, I would follow the camera while, in the midst of a busy street in Soho, I am running a modest grey suit and looking wild before I stand, my hands feel and something to say like: "So, let us take a closer look at it."
So let us look at it.
Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings in which once independent sellers were established - there is still a handful of fantastic record shops.
I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I am in direct proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and vegetable through observation.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, to which I am from Sister Ray (data number: Two young women, three men middle ages) to Reckless Records (data number: Eight men of middle age, a woman, presumably around the 20) is a day long for a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
"I guess already," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.
These sound boards, above (he sent me the snapshot by email, I didn't go back home), dress up the walls of his caravan.
The reason he owns such a significant number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: He is now in a position to buy plates that he couldn't afford when she appeared and again bought items he sold when he was young.
"Many things I buy are out of the late sixties, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. Things where I was probably something too young to buy it," he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and would like to spend time alone, adding: "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.
That's my lust.
WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers who meet him meet on the YouGov profile.
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media pie, people who have heard about the comeback and who have been prompted to buy their old plates again.
From the conversations that I have conducted, people have usually escaped from their collection in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their plates to buy themselves CDs now sell their CDs to buy their plates again, "he says.
That would explain the boom to supporters of the record revision of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates?
It takes just a few seconds in a business like Phonica to recognize that record shops offer a reassuring community of equestrian.
According to Weiz, some of the older customers took an impetus to the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar silhouettes, of objects that wake up happy youth.
"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a liver or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," says Wez.
That's when I am a collector, and I think it is so.
It is an easy way to employ mentally.
"We are like their social workers!" We have a staff of a record pile.
A survey by the ICM in April revealed that nearly 50 per cent of people bought a plate last month, they haven't heard yet.
The poll also found that 41 per cent have a record player they never use, while 7 per cent of those buying a plate don't have a record player.
At this point in the news report, I would probably look very concerned, while I am pillaging by a stack of Bossa Nova complains.
Jonny, 42, who works with Sounds of the Universe (data: Three men of middle ages), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the Revvals.
"Someone just came here recently and said:" I don't have a record player, but I would like to buy a Radiohead record plate so that I can put them in the shelf, "he says.
This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.
More product load, less music load.
We have people saying: 'I don't have a record player.'
These are younger people, not older people, who are only beginning to clean up.
Fopp, which has devoted almost a whole floor to the sound boards, has a blower audience when I go down.
There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teens and middle ages.
Even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts's latest synonym and sexy-packed pop instead of experimental jazz rhymes out of the speakers - it's good to see such diversity among customers.
None of them looks particularly lonely, but naughty mental trauma is difficult to determine if one is standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been running around for a few minutes in the business and looked at the varietal of the plates for sale.
It is more like a shopping cart than a wholesale purchase.
She doesn't deserve much, therefore collecting plates no real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It's easy to hear music from a computer or in other ways, but the beauty of plates is... "she drives up with a loved Sefzer.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban outfitters.
While I would seem to muster the jeans hotties, I observe a group of young teenagers who are grouped for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter consider buying a Crosley record player.
To the left is a staircase house, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: A mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.
Nobody sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to take them.
It's pure "record art."
But given that any attraction for these items means more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of Sohos for more, there's nothing to complain about.
It's no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, is also the one that spends most on luxury items such as plates.
Even if my follow-up shows that the results of YouGov are voting, they, at least in record shops in Soho, leave out the large number of female collectors who exist in reality, record shops and online forums.
These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.
They certainly do not spend their Thursday morning with safety with the buck through record stores of Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while they are miles to the startling look of an unsuspecting, thirty-year-old false presenter who has left unsuspecting men of middle ages.
