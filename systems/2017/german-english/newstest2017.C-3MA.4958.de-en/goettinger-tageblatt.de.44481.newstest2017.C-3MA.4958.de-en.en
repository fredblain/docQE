The Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee is asking for wealthy savers in the future - as the second Institute in Germany.
Bank chief executive Josef Paul said on Thursday: "It's just about 139 customers, who park around EUR 40 million on giro- or daily cash accounts."
The Bundesverband German Banks speaks of an isolated case and does not send a signal: Ordinary savers should not fear to pay for their sparkles.
Camps banks money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they must pay their 0.4 percent penalty.
This fee is required by the Raiffeisenbank Gmund from September of private and corporate customers for deposits over EUR 100 000 to be paid on Giro- or daily cash accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
Said Paul.
He has had some EUR 40 million for some time, which could be raised from one day to another and which he cannot accept.
"They are up to me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 per cent costs," the bank chief said.
"I cannot put aside for every million EUR 4000."
After the 'polluter pays' principle, the costs are now continuing.
If the cash is to be left in the gates of the Raiffeisenbank, it would be far too dangerous to say: "I have already experienced four incidents, not even the fifth!"
Most customers would understand and changed to other forms of investment.
Few emigrated to other banks.
The Bavarian Cooperatives Association said: "The ECB's extreme monetary policy is causing significant costs on all banks."
To bear it alone is not "economically viable."
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or remittances.
With penalty interest rates for deposits from three million euros, the Thuringian Volks- and Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land had made headlines with its Skatbank branch in 2014.
Michael Kemmer, chief executive of the banking association, said: "We don't expect private customers to pay nationwide charges on deposits, to do so, competition in Germany is far too strong among banks and savings banks."
A banker said at the Tegernsee Lake there is "a clientele that is quite abundant in wealth."
"That can be a problem for a small bank," if she's free money.
The co-operative bank Gmund founded in 1911 has branches in Bad Wiesee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
In the region, there are known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs.
The Bavarian Cooperative Federation "is currently not aware of any further banks that charge an outlet for deposits of private customers," spokesperson Ernst said.
The president of the Federal Association of German People's Banks and Raiffeisen Banks (BVR), Uwe Fr√∂hlich, said at the end of June that the threshold to go into the negatives is very high.
The competition is tough, and it droit the emigration of investors to competition.
The customers in Germany will not be allowed to fall into the width.
