Haigerloch: Pilgrims to pray of mercy
The Ministry of Justice Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna was on the road on a four-day pilgrimage to Freiburg.
Together, four steps have been taken.
In order to keep the time until the next morning tour of all the ministries in question, the St. Anna Board of Governors decided to prepare and conduct a multi-day pilgrimage.
Various pilgrimage destinations were examined and one decided in the end to the bishops town of Freiburg, where in this year's Holy Year, a special pilgrimage goal was offered to the Holy Year of Mercience.
16 Minis from Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Heiligroom made their way on the road.
In the evening, pastor storeroed the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, segregated the pitchers and awarded the pilgrims.
From Horb it was driven by train to the starting point of Villingen, where there was a Munster of Unser Lieben, who was called the pilgrims' path.
In the morning and evening, the individual tapestries were surrounded by a short impulse with different prayers, songs and texts.
But also on the way, the Minis in field crosses, chapels, or churches repeatedly moved to sing a song from a specially assembled pitcher.
For the nights, the local parish churches were available.
At the stage goals, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller designed a tasty and enhanced dinner and breakfast.
On the second day, Haiger went to Gütenbach.
The road to St. Peter, which was the busiest route, had to be climbed by 500 meters of altitude.
The deserved reward was a common barbecue on the bathroom.
After the morning eruption on the fourth pilgrim day in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, it went to Freiburg.
Clearly relieved and happy, the Minis met at the Freiburger Münster in the later afternoon and went through the gates of mercy.
With a small impulse, God has thanked God.
In the evening show in the Munster, the Minis of Cooperator Markus Obert was welcomed.
After the worship, pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.
The next day was still time for the road map.
In the afternoon it went to Horb.
At the end, all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong Community experience were marked.
