City council decides unanimously: No kiosk building on St. Goarer's Rhine river
Normally, the St. Goarer projects investments by traders - only the retail sector in the core city is seen as being clearly cultivated.
However, the Council now unanimously rejected the request for the construction of a new sales kiosk on the Rhine river in the immediate vicinity of the Rheinballkons in the construction.
"In principle, we welcome new traders, but at this location in an exponential location on the Rhine, this kiosk does not fit in," said Michael Hubrath for the CDU Group.
