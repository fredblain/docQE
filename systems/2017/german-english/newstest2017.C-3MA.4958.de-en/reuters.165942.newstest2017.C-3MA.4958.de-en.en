Gilead receives legal expenses from hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A U.S. judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to a refund of the legal expenses arising from the hepatitis C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was freed from a compensation payment amounting to $200 million for the injury of two patents of Merck, which was related to the blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni by Gilead, after a U.S. judge revealed a pattern of wrongdoing on the part of Mercks, including the Meineides and other unethical acts.
When collecting the lawsuit on Thursday, U.S. President Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead was entitled to charge the cost that emerged during the case of the case.
Merck tries to equalise with Gilead, which dominates the market of a new generation of Hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case goes back to 2013 when Gilead and Merck signed up to each other and property on laboratory work, which was based on Sopsbuvir's underlying content, the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead.
