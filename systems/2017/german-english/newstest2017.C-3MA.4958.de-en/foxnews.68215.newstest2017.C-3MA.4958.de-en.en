Treats want Nacktkalendar for "women and for men"
The Treats magazine works with photographer David Bellemere to bring out a 1970s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famously naked people, they would like to find the next generation of top models for their NU Mines calendar for 2017.
The chief editor of Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his Nacky magazine differs from vintage cars, as "Playboy for men."
I make that for women.
Apparently he thinks it's the calender too.
"We need to return to the depiction of timeless and classic nudity, where both women and men feel and feel inspired by these pictures of a female body," Shaw said in a press release to release the calendar.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a wonderful artwork.
Models can submit their pictures online or personally at open casting call in Los Angeles and New York.
