Military leadership falsifies ISIS intelligence information, unveiling committee of Congress
Military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to mark a more optimistic image of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than it could have allowed the actual conditions on the ground, reported a committee of inquiry in a report on Thursday.
The preliminary report, created by a Task Force of the Republican members of the Armed Forces Committee, intelligence agencies, and military-related communications, reports from great discontent among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how preliminary their assessments of the American effort changed in the fight against Islamic State.
The Central Command, briefly Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Intelligence-based information, which was typically inspired by high-level CENTCOM commanders, regularly recorded a more positive image of the American efforts against terrorism than the actual conditions on the ground and were generally more positive than analyses of other intelligence services," a newspaper article quoted the report.
"What happened to CENTCOM is unacceptable - our soldiers are suffering when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, a Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The management errors in CENTCOM range up to the top of the organization.
The 10-page report reveals detailed problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in training Iraqi forces.
While there is no direct evidence that government posts under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts have faced pressure from their predisposition to draw a more optimistic picture of the Islamic State's threat, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, opinions and statements before Congress were significantly more positive than the facts" set out the report.
For example, a CENTCOM member publicly disclosed that a military reconquest of Mossuls could start in April or May 2015.
Mossul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigations, so much is clear." Said Mike Pompeo, Republican congressman from Kansas, in an opinion.
From the middle of 2014 to mid-2015, the Central Command's peaks changed the intelligence reports to downplay the danger through ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans called the Task Force into life after being attributed to analysts "concerns about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while the investigation will continue.
In addition, further investigations by the CENTCOM reports by the Ministry of Defence's Advocate General are under way.
Democratic members of the intelligence committee published their own findings on Thursday, which agreed with some of the Republican Task Force's conclusions.
"In the years of 2014 and 2015, CENTCOM created an overly limited process for the establishment of intelligence assessments to ISIL and Iraqi security services," said the highest-level democrat in the Chamber, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, in an opinion.
That process, Mr. Schiff, "delayed the release of intelligence reports," damaged the morality among analysts and "gave overly little room for dissent."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no indication of the White House's intervention in the CENTCOM analysts about a "certain political opinion."
Preliminary results of the congressional inquiry were published Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."
Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon's general inspector, which were taken after complaints from CENTCOM analysts.
Lt. Cmdr Patrick Evans, a spokesman for the Pentagon, admitted in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on congressional reports, while the Chief Inspector's investigation is still under way.
But he also admitted that "experts sometimes have different opinions about the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense."
The investigations have backlash over the issue of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an allegation that is now being made by a growing number of defence ministry members).
But last year's accusations have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and other crisis regions.
The criticism of obedience information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of disobedience of more than ten years ago, when a CENTCOM analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a piece of paper about how the then-government under George W. Bush, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, foreshadowed only a small occupying force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current coverage of the Islamic State.
Last year, the team set up Mr. Hooker, according to government agencies, that, contrary to the government's statements against the Islamic State-held refineries, no significant impact on the terrorist group's financial position would have been in place, as these tentative refineries would have taken place to sell oil on the black market.
That finding, however, was not published, reported the Times in September.
Centcoms, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin went to retirement in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
