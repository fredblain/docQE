Airport: Gang of baggage offences arrested
Professional thieves at Düsseldorf Airport
Police officers from the Düsseldorf police managed to arrest two women and two men aged 50 to 61.
The suspects had committed themselves as a gang of several purse seams.
At 21.30, civil officials in the area of the Düsseldorf airport recognised a gang which was known to the police officers from past theft.
The two women and two men had committed several offences since mid-July of this year and were in the process of being a common, working-minded and particularly professional.
The staff of the Crime Commissioner 34 can demonstrate four actions to the Dieben, who had submitted to Germany specifically to commit crimes.
In total, they have exploited more than 15,000 euros.
