Asocial family demolished before Deloging social apartment in Saltash, Cornwall
An asocial family left their social apartment after a delogising with a £50,000 damage because she had terrorised her neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her property in Saltash, Cornwall.
After being forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing community found the property in an irreparable condition.
The walls were clashing holes, wooden dikes were blown up, rubbish was scattered on the floor scattered and graffiti was sacked to the walls.
The family were relocated and it is believed to now live in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for the house administration at Cornwall Housing, said she feared the apartment could no longer be repaired.
She said: "It was an absolute nightmare for people here and I think people don't have to live in this way.
There are many things to take into account, as this property is likely to be seen as not so beautiful.
The family is notorious and their reputation is also.
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime, and the police said that the terror inflicted on the family, assaults with baseball sleepers, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking, and excessive blows, strikes and floods.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease contract, received an ordinance for antisocial behaviour in June.

Neighbours said they had to fight them on the road and regularly called to call police
Cornwall Housing delved her and her partner this week forcibly from the property after they gave them an extended period of 11 weeks to draw up voluntarily.
The delogisation was cheated by facilitated neighbors, who said their lives were made to hell.
One said: "They didn't hurt anyone."
We lived for 20 years alongside them and it was always bad.
The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.
"This morning we couldn't sleep."
We stood up because it was so quiet - we are not accustomed to it!
Now that they are finally going away, it will be beautiful.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it would have been the family administered to cooperate with local authorities.

On the overblown side of the community deal, rubbish and old toys were scrapped
He added: "It's a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for her behaviour and that of her family, as a Deloging is always the last step to consider Cornwall Housing.
This was a very difficult case, because the behaviour was extremely difficult and their actions for their neighbours had to be seen terribly.
I value all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the congregation who have been brave to us and have given us the information.
I hope that this development will donate to some neighbours and the message that anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.

Housekeeping workers will now have to remove waste mountains that surround the house
In 2014, police conducted a razor in the house and found about 70g cannabis as well as scales, paraphernates and cash worth £1,700.
Skeldon received a financial penalty after pleading guilty to the possession of a drug of class B in commercial abdication.
She claimed that the money was for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in 2013 in a car accident.
After they were without Oldach, Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
A lot of room walls were decorated with graffiti.
Police say they will delete tenants who don't stick to the house order
Angela Crow from the police of Devon and Cornwall shared that the Delogisation was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not comply with the house order.
"This goes to those who think they can behave without self-accusations as well as to those who were harmed by such behaviour," she said.
Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour, which will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
