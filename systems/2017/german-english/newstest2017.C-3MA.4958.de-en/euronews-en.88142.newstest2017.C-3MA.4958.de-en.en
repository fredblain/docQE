London schoolgirl headed to ISIS was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, reportedly died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said her family were getting off her death in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
It was believed to have been killed by a Russian air attack in Raqqa, the group's bullying, reported ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and died shortly after she had ordered her to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
"One can only hope that the only good is - as a reminder and warning to others that this is the risks associated with it, to go into a war zone - people from ever going to take that decision," said Akunjee.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from East London rose in a plane to Turkey and then entered a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultanas family has been told she has cured an ISIS fighter in Syria - and within a few months to widow.
