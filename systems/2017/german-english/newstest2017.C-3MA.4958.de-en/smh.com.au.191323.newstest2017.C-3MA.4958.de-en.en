More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the Vogue's September edition
Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of Kardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted september edition of the U.S. Vogue.
Kendall, who is the trademark ambassador of Estee Lauder, and ran at Fashion Week in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on their Instagram account on Thursday.
"In a room full of people I love, brought me the sight of this covers to the wine," Kendall wrote.
The cover of the Covers followed a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashian a similar?), scanned reality video that shows the whole Kardashian-Jenner family (except for the problems Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the most popular showbiz onkels and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as they forget the cover of their sister and ending it with a classic twist: They have all planned a surprise story.
This makes the bar-treated act almost every birthday episode of a children's release (Seacrest brought the sentence, "Du damit that we would forget you?" With the honesty of a cartoon chanting on a broadcast at 8 a.m. in the morning), but Kris had to somehow let her other girls take part in this publicity.
With regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of Kardashians has certainly begun.
Kendalls big sister Kim may have beaten her what the Vogue cover has been, (she and her husband Kanye West were to see it in April 2014), but the cover of the September edition of the magazine is a league for itself.
The September edition is the most sold edition of the year.
With a degree similar to a photo tape than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista were 615 pages of advertising).
The revelation of his co-star is eagerly awaited, that in the last two years, images of the journal are still under the official announcement.
Women already on the cover included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
Over the past few years, clearly, more were "celebrity queues, which mocks" as "Models that are celebrities" on the cover.
Oscar prize winner and Dior trademark ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honour.
But even at the low chance that Ms. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "muddle" of her generation - falls under the previous category, she is in good company.
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers of today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even if everything is right).
They are really talented women who are pictured in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had made the release of lemonade one of the most successful years of her career.
Of course, Jenner's success doesn't everyone.
With her reality TV story, Jenner's position in the fashion world has always been somewhat tense.
In June, the one-time Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticised them and called them "the lips of the moment."
Those feelings sounded again high when the news came out with the appearance of Jenner on the Vogue Cover.
But it seems to me that the point is to go on.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue.
She's in the truest sense of the word a supermodel.
She runs for Marc Jacobs.
She makes advertising for your Grande Estee Lauder.
They and all their sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.
She sold by her made pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to the journal LOVE.
And in her spare time she is in reality TV, presumably only to see her sister Kourtney and their children.
