Jewish director crushed Berlin hotel because Israeli pre-election was after "Arab" call was removed - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media review after he had betrayed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had not listed any Israeli pre-election, as Arab guests had "requested" according to an employee. "
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah," gave his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann sought to find Israel on the hotel's list of countries.
However, the country was not listed among the countries that could be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in the year 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and destroyed?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, the Kempinksi Bristol offers a way to choose Israel through its own Call Center.
According to a statement, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received there, "shock him," as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel worker said the measure was a "deliberate decision to manage the Kempinski Hotel's management."
The reason behind it was even more fury in the director.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre-election be deleted," said Lanzmann's employee.
The Israeli Ambassador to Germany Yakov Hades-Handelsman called this a "great shame," reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
We were horrified by this event and stunned.
That really is very shameful.
The fact that this has been borne in this hotel chain in Germany is even more disgraceful.
No explanation is needed.
We expect the hotel to "draw the right conclusions," the officer said.
The incident sparked a pretty great response on the Internet, where people called a scandal.
Some of them listed the Kempinski Hotel that it would have been "given" to the alleged requests of Arab guests.
"Ashamed you," it was said in another post that the hotel is located on the nobler Kurfürstendamm boulevard, near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly dismissed all the allegations of himself and called the incident a "understanding" and "apologized" to Lanzmann, reports The mirror.
"There was never a direct statement" to include Israel in the quick-selection list, "the Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman for the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the country preference has now been added.
