Berlin / Schwerin: Poll before countries elections: SPD and CDU lose
In the forthcoming elections in the Bundesl√§nder Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September), significant losses are recorded for the government parties SPD and CDU.
This gave representative surveys of opinion research institute INSA for the "Bild" Zeitung (Friday).
While the red-black government coalition could continue to rule in the North, this is not possible in Berlin.
In both federal states, the SPD would be the strongest party, and would thus have a good chance of continuing to hold the head of government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD crashed from 35.6 percent over five years to 24 percent.
The party, according to the survey, would only be close to the CDU, which could come back to 23 percent.
The third place is controversial between the Left and the AfD.
The Left would be down 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the country's day.
The Greens have been reluctant to return to the Schwerin farm day despite a slight loss of 6 percent (previously 8.7 percent).
NPD and FDP would not be represented with 3 percent in the land day.
According to the Berlin Chamber of Labour, the survey showed that only 23% (election 2011: 28.3%) would be the SPD of the poll.
The CDU only reached 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
They would still be behind the Greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6%), but before the left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the Chamber of Deputies.
By 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, but the Pirates would miss the move, unlike 2011.
