Witnesses sought: Drink market in forest crumble
A robbery occurred on Thursday night at the drinks market of Rewe XXL at the Waldbröler Gerberstraße.
Under the guidance of a gunfire, three dark-dressed people, who had suspected their faces, asked the employee of the beverage market the release of cash and then flee, and then probably with a silver VW Golf.
How much money has been saved does not share the police.
The perpetrators should have been between 1.60 and 1.70 metres tall, so relatively small.
The beverage market is directly accessible from the market deck of the Rewe market.
The perpetrators must be suspended following the attack in the direction of Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Way and from the gravel park in front of the car park entrance to the silver-colored car, possibly heading towards B 256 (Schadernring).
Anyone who has made observations about the robbery (at 7.45pm), who is in contact with the robbery, is urgently required to report to the police.
