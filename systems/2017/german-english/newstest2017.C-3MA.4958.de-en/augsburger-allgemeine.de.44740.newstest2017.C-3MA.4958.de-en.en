Escape: 'Every swept woman has experience of sexual violence'
Sexual violence is a part of everyday life for women fleeing their lives.
When they arrive in Germany they are often traumatized.
A house offers refuge.
In a large kitchen there are four women.
Each has a baby, which is not a year old.
One has put her little son in the arm.
He is guessing with great eyes curious in the room.
His mother startet on the table plate.
Until she notes that she is watching.
She smiled in short and kissed the little ones.
The scene looks normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is a business leader of Condrobs, a promoter of social assistance in Bavaria, and deals with women on the flight.
The four women in the kitchen were flashing.
They live in the north of the north in one of the few decentralised accommodation for isolated women and their children in Bavaria.
In January, Condrobs put the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Relief.
It has recently been officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
Men don't exist - even not as visitors.
The exception is a watchdog in front of the door.
"It's not overly to say: Every woman who arrives here has made her escape experience with sexual violence," says Bahr.
"Men are fleeing because of wars, because they are persecuted politically, because they are threatening torture or death or because their families send them to Europe," she tells.
Women overweigh other reasons for fleeing: "Many steal it because they don't see a different way out."
In their home, she has had experience of sexual violence, forced marriages, honour killings, slavery or forced prostitution.
That is what drives them.
The flight goes on.
"That Schleper, for example, for example for a bottle of water a sexual act is not a rare thing," says Bahr.
And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Those who believe that as soon as they arrived in Germany are mistaken.
Here, too, single women in refugee shelter are often regarded as inferior and, at worst, abused.
That leads to some 90 per cent of the women who live in the accommodation in the Munich North are traumatized.
"Some of the children are certainly not voluntary."
Many women are so accustomed to saying nothing.
"Or they don't dare to talk openly about the experience because the sham is too big."
As they often don't get to help, they need more accommodation only for them, asks Bahr.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.
Asked whether they knew about a similar project as in Munich in their area of responsibility, some replies No.
For example, there is no such thing in the upper Oberpfalz and Upper Franconia.
Even in the case of pigs, only women who have fled are not separated, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, the government's press spokesman.
In upper Bavaria, under- and middle-aged people, there are some community shelters or houses only for single women and their children.
The exception is Lower Bavaria, where there are two central accommodation exclusively for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommodated separately.
In a study published for the committee, it said: "It is very important that men and women are home separated."
"Lack of privacy, or will accommodate men and women together, can lead to violence against women."
In particular, the washrooms should be separated and easily accessible to women.
As the women feel about this protection, you can read the rang that is available at the house in Munich.
"Since we've been talking about it, we have a long waiting list," Bahr says.
It could easily be a second home.
