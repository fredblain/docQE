"A generation protest" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the US
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters calling for political change in Ethiopia were at odds with the government's violent resistance.
Witnesses say tens of protesters were killed during clashes with police at gunpoint.
Is Ethiopia breaking together?
Over the past decade, it has been one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.
But over the past few months, protests against the government rallied over the country and spread to more and more areas.
Last week thousands of people stormed onto the streets and demanded fundamental political change.
According to human rights organisations, the government's response has been unmerciless.
Witnesses said police had shot and killed on tens of unarmed demonstrators.
The videos that are circulating about the protests, which are probably the last or earlier this year, show how security people beat young people while they were forced to take a stand against a wall.
The head of the UN Department for Human Rights now calls for an in-depth investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.
American military and intelligence services are working closely with the Ethiopians to combat terror threats beyond the region, particularly in Somalia, and only a few countries in Africa, if all, receive so much Western aid.
Ethiopia's economy expanded at a remarkable pace.
Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
While Ethiopia was far from being a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continued to press the government's repression - the opposition in the country has been constrained, with dissidents effectively silenced.
Many were sent to exile or in jail, killed or driven to the walls of the desert.
But that could change.
"If you suppress people and those none other options have to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia.
The whole of the youth is protesting.
A generation is protesting.
There are numerous complaints that cover everything from ground use to the stranglehold of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100% of parliament.
At the same time, tensions along the border with Eritrea rise; a fight for this zacky, disputed line called for hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogades National Liberation Front, which in recent years have been forced more or less, would exploit the turmoil and could be armed again.
Several factors explain why feelings of seclusion are now exploding under the surface in the face of years.
The first seems harmless: Smartphones.
Only in the last few years have many Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones have become increasingly common, and improved Internet services.
Even if the government is blocking access to Facebook and Twitter, which she does at regular intervals, especially at protests, many people still can communicate about Internet proxies hiding where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said they gathered so to protests.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
Since Aronas, the amharas, which come from an ethnic majority of the Christian Highlands, in the politics and the economy, while exploiting the Oromos, many of which are Muslim and live in lowlands.
But that too is changing.
"We are here to coordinate under one umbrella," said Mulasu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The biggest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigridge, which account for about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, the intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr Meles, a former rebel leader, was until his death in an unpublicised disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiopia's prime minister.
He was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think corners.
Analysts say he was particularly averse to perceive early signs of dissatisfaction and use special agents to handle opponents and make them unharmed.
"The current regime lacks this fundamental skill," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively opaque reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.
Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr Hailemariam arrives south.
Analysts say he doesn't enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tigray.
Many fear the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time that Ethiopia experienced such a stir was in 2005, after thousands of elections protested, apparently concealed by the government and subsequently stolen.
During the ensuing razor, many protesters were killed, even if they were less than in the last few months, and that time the riots went relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as their measurable progress in fighting poverty.
But obviously this has not prevented the deepening of the Ethiopian Government's internal misfortunes.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, an amorphous city, from Tigray's run, and the hate to the Tigrray are becoming more common in social media.
Analysts say the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.
The American government used Ethiopia as a base for dronenflights over the neighbouring Somalia, even though it recently shared that it has closed this base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile area.
"This," Mr Abdi said, "is a very thin grass drain."
