What the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming
Former German swimmers Markus Deibler has commented on Facebook's disappointing cuts to the DSV team at Olympis.
In December of 2014, he was awarded gold for the first time in Doha.
Now the former DSV-athlete Markus Deibler via Facebook has put protection against his ex-team mates.
"In a country in which an Olympians get 20,000 €premium and a jungle king £150,000 shouldn't be surprised," said the 26-year-old in the night on Friday on his Facebook page.
The support system in swimming is bad, but the doping controls are very good.
In this way, we cannot compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not see or even pursue doping.
"I am not saying that the controls are to be stopped here," he added.
Wanted to launch a comeback would have to be Deibler had to be notified nine months before his first start of the National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA).
That is the way it should be with countries.
"Anyone who cannot be controlled at a time before WADA / FINA is not allowed to take part," asks the choice of Hamburg, which is now running an ice cream.
