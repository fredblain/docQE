Old buildings, a few lindenbakks, one of the rest of the cobblestones: The Riga Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not affect the first sight, but the police are one of the city's "dangerous places."
Walk from the east to the west, you will find playgrounds, a fresh nursery and a biolades.
The facade of a grey house has someone "ugly!" Sprayed.
It is already under construction: A house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be created by 2017.
Articles about this "trendy borough," as the real estate firm Friedrichshain calls, will be preferred in recent weeks with burning cars.
This is the home with the number 94: Once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have leased, but on the ground floor there are still spaces and are used for events.
The Berlin Innenenator Henkel, in particular, had repeatedly argued for a crackdown on the project since the beginning of the year, calling for the "no-go zone" for police officers and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.
After 22 June, the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadtersmiths, with 300 police officers were cleared, patrol the police for three weeks, according to official statements, with 30 to 40 officers and three teams on the ground, closed parts of the street and kept visitors from entering the house with the number 94.
Meanwhile renovated construction workers commissioned the premises on behalf of unknown homeowners.
On July 13, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that clearing was illegal, and a day later police and construction workers withdrew under the jubilee of sympathizers and residents.
On this summer afternoon, the street acts peacefully: Parents walk with children, people sit on the pavement in front of the houses in the sun, others entertain Vorm Späti.
A primary school and kindergarten are nearby.
Left-wing violence is not the main concern of many inhabitants: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in Kiev since 1999, and Jana *, who is here with three children here, are mainly from the police presence.
With the residents of the house projects, they share the concern of rising rents and genetic testing.
It doesn't sound like a jaw, which was a majority of police guard against vandaling Left.
The grass, which the Berliner Innensenator and police make up between the housekeepers and their neighbours, does not seem to exist.
In the East of Berlin, Friedrichshain was actually a traditional working district, which also has a low average income and high risk of poverty today compared to the rest of the city.
In 1990, many of the houses in the former GDR were occupied, including almost the entire Mainzer Strasse near Riga.
While the Mainzer was cleared under great police conditions in a veritable street slump, many of the projects were legalized in the Riga and are still being inhabited by the people they occupied 26 years ago.
At the same time, in recent years, the borough has become a magnet for tourists and voters from all over the world: They now share their Kiev-era residents and former housekeepers.
This is also apparent in rents, which have risen by nearly 60% since 2009.
Many of the reconstructions in the Riga are being attacked as symbols for this development: They can be recognized by the painted slices or freshly-pressed facades that have been thrown with color bags.
No other road has been mentioned this year, so often with the words of "leftist violence."
One reason that not all neighbours consider this to be a problem could be that crime is not necessarily affected: Crimes like body injury are, according to statistics, almost exclusively against police.
Most of the offences are being made up of property, which tend to hit the newly constructed and newly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rental house next to the contested 94 in a rental house for 17 years, there can be no mention of uncertainty.
As far as violence is concerned, it is patently obvious: People in the 94 are their neighbours who have not been appointed.
Even the famous burning cars no longer exist in Riga.
For the studied Architektin, her street is not a forensic burning point, on the contrary: "Here you can help each other, live along the street and get more from each other than elsewhere."
Neugebauer is deliberately drawn to the Riga street - and stayed.
For this reason, it was also so important that residents get their road back: From police, politics and the media, which in July all suddenly claimed sovereignty over the borough.
But in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer, the street continues to be removed: By careless new buildings in former building blocks that are pushing the old inhabitants.
"These are, in fact, property housing, which are not interesting for many here - rather people who are not so well-known," she says.
"I totally disagree with" violence and destruction. "
But what to do if you never hear someone?
There is frustration at all sides, including the police and the inhabitants.
For the sake of getting rid of color bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: The house projects and the left scene belonged to the jaw.
Those who draw up should be aware of this - just like someone who runs into a pub district, who can complain badly about noise there.
All persons presented with first-name names have asked not to be called with their right name
