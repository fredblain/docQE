The £2-per tag- drug that can reduce heart attack risk
Thousands of heart skin patients will benefit from a £2-per-day drug after advised by authorities to administer this more people for a longer period.
Ticagrelor's germination-inhibited drug reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is administered for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or a further heart attack.
Regulator NICE of the NHS has recommended a four-year-long take to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.

Some 140,000 people suffer from a heart attack each year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and stroke cases are caused by collections of fat material in the arteries.
When the Belag breaks out, it can cause a blood from the water to the heart, causing a heart attack.
When the blood is dissolved, it can flow through the blood flow and reduce the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by British company AstraZeneca and driven under the trademark Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood-bearing islands less likely.
NICE's draft, which was published today, recommends a 12-month-long take-up of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre, said: "Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all those who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or a stroke of stroke - often with dire consequences."
Fear of a renewed heart attack may have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
The experience shows that, in combination with aspirin, Ticagrelor is effectively reducing further heart attacks and stroke in people who have already had a heart attack.
With a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
The information on the effectiveness and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years.
