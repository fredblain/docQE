Clinton earns 10.75 million in 2015 and figures 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton released her tax returns for 2015 on Friday, which found a $10.75 million income of $10.75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, Clinton donated $1 million for charitable purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton generated nearly $5.3 million in redeonoraries; the former secretary of State gave an income of USD 3 million from the publisher Simon & Schuster for her book about her tenure at the Foreign Ministry.
Clinton's candidate for the vice-president, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, shared his tax returns over the past decade with his wife Anne Holton.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency," Clinton's campaign manager Jennifer Palmieri announced in an opinion.
In a stark contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and backbenchers on his previous promises to release his tax returns.
It is customary for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, even though they are not obliged to do so.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have indicated a tax check by tax authorities as a reason for refusing to do so.
"They're on the train," wrote Clinton's campaign heroine Ian Sams on Twitter, citing the Democratic nominee's release.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's special adviser, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish something before the tax exams were not completed.
Trump's critics, including the Republican presidential candidate in 2012 Mitt Romney, have already conceded that his refusal raises questions about assets, his donations for charitable organizations, his business and various other ties, particularly with Russia.
Clinton has already jumped on the subject and released a video on the internet on Friday, in the senior, in the senior, urging Trump to release his tax statement.
On Thursday, she also addressed the issue during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done over the last few decades and to publish his tax returns," she said to the crowd.
Politico has reported that Trump did not pay any or only very little taxes during the 1990 "s for two years, and an economic journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax earners and tax advisers on Friday, saying that might still be the case.
Federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign.
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that those more than $1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30 per cent.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During a campaign event for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska called Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate here has his seat here to exchange Trump for a meeting on their tax returns.
Buffett said he was also subjected to a tax review of the IRS and Trump had "fear" before voters and not before the tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has published tax returns until 2007.
The Clintons, who are now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid an effective federal tax rate of around 32 per cent between 2007-2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
The Clinton Tax Statement of 2015 showed that these only $100 of their income as a reward, unlike most Americans.
Its main success was a cost-effective index fund, from which the Clinton's dividend and yields were to $109,000.
