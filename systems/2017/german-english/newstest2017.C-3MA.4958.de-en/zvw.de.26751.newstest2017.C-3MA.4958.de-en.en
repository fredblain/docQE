Schorndorf: One-breaker with helicopters sought
The police helicopter flew over an hour to various areas - unsuccessful.
Two unknown men have been forcibly removed to an apartment in a multi-family house on Friday morning at 8.50 p.m.
The residents surprised the two and beat the unhold into the escape.
The two men were about 1.65 to 1.70 meters tall, arguably masked, wearing both bluejans and black hood pulls.
They moved towards downtown.
The police said that the police had been forced to strike a police helicopter.
It was not successful.
Perhaps the unknown were, in fact, close to the flat or escape.
