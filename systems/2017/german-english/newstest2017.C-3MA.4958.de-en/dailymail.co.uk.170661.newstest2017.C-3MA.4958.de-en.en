Assistant veterans want to organize further strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistants who voted in the election rejected him.
In July, Hunt unveiled plans to impose the contract forcibly, saying that the NHS would be in a "no man's land" and would be damaging any further delay for staff and patients.
The first assistants are to receive a new contract, which includes changes to night and weekend work to improve care for uneasiness.
Dr Ellen McCourt, the chair of the BMA Kommitee for assistant doctors, shared last night in a communication with: "Assistant doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and will treat all doctors fairly."
In just eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors falls under the new Treaty, progress must be made and time is running out.
Efforts on the part of the BMA to resolve the disputes through talks have led to the government's reluctance to participate and, at times, to silence.
That happened to the one that Jeremy Hunt had made only last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, lift the excitement and address the concerns of assistants."
Should he fail to do so, assistants have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further work.
The final strike at the end of April saw a postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and specialist doctors were involved to provide cover to doctors on the strike chain.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants a better weekly reward for the 54,000 assistant doctors who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, director of the NHS staff, urged assistant doctors to end the strike.
Mortimer said: "Work combat measures reach none of the little but are already burdened by overburdened teams and service providers and are causing concern, distress and interruption to patients, care workers and their families."
Over the last two months, we have spoken to the committee of assistants and have responded positively to the concerns about the status quo and whistleblowovers with the Ministry of Health and other ministries.
Employers hoped that the continued positive engagement on other important issues - such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a vocational training course, training kits, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was the employers, the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health concerning compliance with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.
