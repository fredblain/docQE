B27 remediation: Restaurants suffer as a result
At the speed with which the B will be cleaned, there is nothing to get around.
For those who are responsible for the construction work, starting at 5.30am, and ending up until 20 p.m., there will be full praise.
"Those have made everything quite zakenig," says Elvira Tetzlaff of the jet-gas station.
That's a superteam.
There is no delay.
The building site could be moved to the south at the beginning of the week, until the end of October.
It will also be commended for those who are responsible for the construction of the works, for example when it comes to the establishment of passenger tickets.
Since the construction site on Monday to the south and the closure of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen, and therefore the connection to Rottenburg again, the traffic situation in the village has been relaxed.
Citizens will now be able to move from Ofterdingen to the east.
The doorway through the place seems to go back.
"There are some significant complaints," says the deputy chief executive director of Florian King, responsible for transport technology management.
The inhabitants of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because a lot of dirt trails were sought after, and were more familiar with their navi than the relief.
What led to the fact that a number of lorries in residential areas were franked.
As the speed limits have not been met, the congregation called for the measurement vehicle from Mössingen.
"There have been significant transgressions," says King, who made himself aware of the situation.
Two to three per minute were used.
The quick-hitting was travelling with 77 stunts in the pace-30 zone.
Since the building was further moved, it has become more peaceful.
For businessmen on the B 27, it is only a small trost that the street is open again for customers from Rottenburg.
People don't like to look into the cards.
But the fact that the B-27 has led them to take up sales has led everyone to look through.
However, some more and some are less affected.
Those who have less to do with the "end-user" are produced for other companies, for which the recovery has little effect.
Thomas Sulz also speaks of a "not easy decrease," but also admits that "the maturity is obviously missing."
At the heart of the road there is a bus stop.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly a crown, finds clear words.
That is already existential.
Not only him, but all the restaurants have "hit it hard."
Customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil failed.
We have to be happy about every euro sales.
The cost of revenue is higher than 50%.
The road landing had "dropped back two years."
Half of his staff must have dismissed him.
If I had a company with a 4,000 staff and half would have been released, the policy would have reacted differently.
Instead, President Jörg Schmidt, on a request from Mr Göner, whether there could be financial compensation, with the indication that the host site benefited otherwise from the advantages of the situation on the 27th of the year, it also needs to bear the disadvantages caused by the rehabilitation.
Göhner knows from other lands where so much more generous was handled.
With all the lawsuits, Göhner is sure his host will continue.
Finally, the family business has been here since 1715, referring to the long history.
It is possible to understand that other regular guests are not looking at this time because of the complicated traffic management.
If you cannot drive, it's also nice.
Göhner has no doubts about the fact that he has returned to work after the end of the renovation work.
Despite the crises with BSE and avian influenza, Göner considers the impact of the B 27 building on its rally for the biggest crisis that has experienced its host in its longstanding history.
There are six months' work, which is already brutal.
