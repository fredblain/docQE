Russia's Putin fire chief executive Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his chief executive Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of Putin's closest trust circle for many years.
The 63-year-old was appointed as Special Representative for Environment and Transport Affairs.
In a Kremlin opinion, it is that Putin has ordered "the dismissal of Ivanovs of his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration."
Anton Vaino, who was Ivanov's deputy since 2012, was appointed to his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the renowned State Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo.
On the Kremlin's website, it is said (in Russian) that he was subsequently the chief executive of government staff.
On his appointment, he said to Putin: "Thank you for your trust."
I think it is the government's most important task to support your work as a Head of State with regard to draft laws and controls to implement your instructions.
Putin told Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Convincing the smiling faces?
This move has made Moscow mystery weeks.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidants, and works like him for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.
As a striker, he was one of the country's most powerful men.
At a meeting with President Putin, broadcast on television, both men claimed the stabbing would resign on their own request.
But despite the smile for the cameras, few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of a kind of power struggle?
Nobody currently knows.
But the official claim - that a man who was once prized as a potential president - would like to head to Russian environmental policy - came to great skepticism.
In his remarks to Putin, who are quoted on the Kremlin's website, said Ivanov, "it is true that in early 2012 I asked you in a conversation to give me this very complicated post - one could almost say - complaining for four years.
As it turns out, I have been chairman of the presidential administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took the post in December 2011.
Previously he was deputy prime minister and defense minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, former member of the KGB State Security Service.
In the late 1990 "s, when Putin was Chairman of the BHS, which replaced KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people he was most familiar with.
Once it was assumed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term, as a third term Putin had breached the Constitution.
But that post was taken by Putin's closest ally, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before becoming president three and a half years later.
