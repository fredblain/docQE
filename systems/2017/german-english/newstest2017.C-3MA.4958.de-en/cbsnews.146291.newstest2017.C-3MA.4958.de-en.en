Heavy rains, flooding gives rise to bailouts in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rains and large-scale flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to call the emergency on Friday, and it is expected to have more rain on Saturday.
Numerous rivers in south-east Louisiana and southern Mississippi flooded their shores and threatened with large-scale flooding after extreme rains, reported the National Weather Service.
The governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards shared that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on the road to help the communities affected.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said that requests for high-water vehicles, boats and sand sacks were multiple.
Steele said that alone the municipality of Tangipahoa had requested 10 thousand sand bags.
A flood alert system is used across vast parts in southern Louisiana until Saturday.
The weather service provided evidence that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area.
In the south of Alabama, a flight alert system was used on Friday, while it continued to rain in the Mobile.
The River Comite near Baton Rouge and the River Amite near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, are likely to reach record lows after over the weekend.
The Metereologist Alek Krautmann says both rivers could overshadow many houses in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a stream-driven flooding in Ascension Parish is a danger, as they will only slowly flow into the Lake Maurepas.
The River Tickshaw, south of the Mississippi State border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level on Friday, which was ever recorded.
Rescue teams still pleaded to people from the floodwaters in the district of Amite and Wilkinson in the Southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and his stepson were among those rescued near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 400 feet from his house, rose sharply overnight.
He said it would have warned him a further pen son who lives nearby.
"We are guarded and the water flowed and moved in," Hansford said.
It reached my waist.
His wife, Hansford, said that in the 48 years they lived there would never have seen such high levels of the river.
Hansford said he and his family members would have all disabilities and he would be the only person who can swim.
Hansford said emergency workers had rescued all three in a major military truck and brought them to the next fire guard in Gloster, where they were housed until Friday.
Krautmann said the flood "had spread quickly" as there were still heavy rains and that the authorities were considering evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, an observer reported near Livingstone from midnight to Friday morning from 13.75 inches of rain.
Krautmann said the ground had been substantially depleted by the rains since Wednesday.
Authorities said heavy rains and road flooding caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and school failures in five school districts.
The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that an ants in Tangipahoa had 200 flooded houses.
Residents were evacuated in two churches, which were now both flooded.
The forehead of the Municipality of Robby Miller said authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets that had been washed out of flooding.
Emergency shelters were set up in the cities of Amite and Hammond to house the evacuees.
"Once the water begins to go back, they will be able to return to their homes again," he said.
In the town of Hammond of the municipality of Tangipahoa, almost two dusty roads were closed down because of flooding and sandsacks for residents to be included, hoping to keep the water from their homes and shops.
"The last major flooding we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum of the City Administration.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississipp, the emergency manager Rupert Lacy of the Harrison County said it continued to rain on the Gulf Coast.
According to his claims, a handful of houses were to be reported as flooded on Thursday, but on Friday no one reported.
Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen before," Townson said, "and it's still coming."
