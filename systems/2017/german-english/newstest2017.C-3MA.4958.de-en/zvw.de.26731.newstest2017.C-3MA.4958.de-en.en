Urbach: Annika Deusle is new refugee officer
Annika Deusle is the contact person in the field of integration and organizer.
She is also a social worker on the ground.
Since July, Annika Deuschle has been the refugee officer for Urbach.
The social pedagogue supports the management team around Achim Grockenberger.
She sees herself as a contact person for all actors: Refugees, the Intervention of Refugee Assistance, the administration, the authorities and anyone else.
Regine's customer from the working circle suggests that the honorary official is more than grateful that Deasle is now there, the iron-grade wool mill, which is above all a problem.
Some - less spotless than in fact - meant that the number of requests had to be replaced when the administration wanted to write.
An administrative professional with a talent for languages and people has been sought, coupled with a long-term experience in the field of social work, which is an iron-milder.
But administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deusle.
Above all, it is about organizing, work with people on the ground and behind the scenes and network activities.
The 31-year-old has been in existence for about six weeks.
It has a 50 per cent point in three years.
"It was high time," says Regine Kunde, which supports Annika Deishle and principal actors.
There are large and small problems, organisational, human and communication problems.
Soon new containers in the Wasenstraße
A serious problem has been found for some time to find housing for the connecting refugees who have been recognised.
Local authorities are responsible for connecting them.
They must shelter the refugees in their own or rented homes.
The cost of building, rent or renovating these accommodation must bear the local authorities themselves.
The responsibility changes from the landing board to commune and job center.
Problem: There are free objects, but not every rental wants to offer its apartment.
The search has been proving very difficult for some time.
De facto, the administration does not find private housing.
It doesn't work so far, however, if you need to rely on private apartments, so Deasure.
Public housing must therefore be intimidated, as is so beautiful.
So soon new containers are placed in the Wasenstraße.
But only with housing is not done.
Perspective is the keyword, are Regine Kunde and Annika Deusle agreed.
In addition to a firm lead, there are traineeships, training centres, school grounds, Euro-euro jobs and assistance to refugees and migrants who have to be folded or established.
"More places would be good," says Regine customer.
Many work in the building house or help house master, perform charitable work - and the motivation and very well, as Annika Deusle reports.
She hopes that work for the community will lead to positive external action.
That is' not employment therapy '.
But activity doesn't just mean work.
The day needs a solid structure, say Deishle and customer.
People should develop a sense of belonging.
So there need to be offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.
Professional courses are rr.
This is also where administration and honorary official are jumping.
It is vital that refugees get the feeling that they are hoping and welcome in Germany.
The long duration of proceedings is a problem.
They need to explain to the refugees that it will take time and that they can make sense, for example with language courses.
Anyone who creates the feeling that he can't help in Urbach cannot work and is pointless.
The clear majority is motivated.
However, problems exist, says clients honestly, "people who do nothing at all."
All this is a "mammoth task."
A difficult question: Have the two people afraid of radicalization, also in a small community like Urbach?
"No," says Regine Kunde.
The aid workers are made aware.
These events are also about refugees.
Those would have been afraid that the perpetrators of the attacks would be completely discredited.
"They want to show that they have nothing to do with that," says Regine customer.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
It is therefore important to keep the local and the volunteers on the ground and in the region.
They always found that a new stop to refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.
Does Germany need a cap?
To answer this question clearly, politics is shy.
It is unfair to put them on the ground.
"In Urbach, we are not there yet," says Annika Deusle.
No new refugees, that would ease the situation.
Regine's customer also makes it clear that the former companies are already busy integrating the existing people.
This is currently around 100 people, mostly young men.
But if people are in need, they need to help, both women agree.
The political world is so complicated, there are no easy answers.
