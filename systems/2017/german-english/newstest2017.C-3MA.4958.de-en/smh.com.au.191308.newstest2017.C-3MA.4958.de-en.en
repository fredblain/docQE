Future of Portland smashed due to repeal of the Energy Treaty
The future of Portland's aluminium melts in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs from workers - are at stake, as the plant operator cancels the energy supply contract and will thus lift all the delivery contracts, as the energy company supplied.
This step followed the government's decision in Victoria earlier this year not to grant further subsidies to operate the facility.
A subsidy for 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.
Less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure.
Moreover, it could result in domino effects, as the meltdown consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity generation.
In 2014, Alcoa closed Point Henry, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power station last year.
The meltdown of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks closure.
This follows years of speculation about the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and, last but not least, the electricity price.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminium meltdown with its Loy Yang A Power Plant in Latrobe Valley, said that three other owners will terminate their contracts.
The facility is in the majority possession of a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp maintain smaller shares.
"AGL assumes that the port will continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity through the meltdown," the company shared.
AGL continued to say that the contracts were so-called "safeguards" to enter into force from November 2016.
The Treaties have a 12-month notice period, so they will end in 2017.
"Therefore, AGL assumes that the Treaties will contribute 17 to the revenue in fiscal year," the electricity supplier said.
All potential effects on the revenue to AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the projections of the strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL announced that it had already written off the value of the contracts in its $187 million contract in "expectation of a termination."
Alcoa said that the decision to book the contracts, the "ability of alcoas... to run the meltdown or to guarantee the power supply to the meltdown" does not affect it.
The US company said it had completed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, who should have entered into force from November this year, even though it is still guilty of why it resigned from the Treaty.
Analysts are warning about the poor economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Portland meltdown in Victoria and the Tomago facility near Newcastle.
Referring to the analysts' statements earlier this week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said Portland spends about 600 megawatts annually and Tomago consumes about 900 megawatts of electricity.
Should both plants disappear from the market, it would mean a significant reduction in demand for the [electricity market].
And for us as an electricity producer, that would not be good, "he said.
