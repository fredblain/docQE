Gfk leads after disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK is exchanging its chief executive Matthias Hartmann.
The returns came suddenly - but not quite surprisingly.
The difficult situation of the market research firm GfK gave the impression that the chair of frontbench Matthias Hartmann becomes even more uncertain the longer the successes he promised.
The global number five of the industry is facing a personal new start.
Gfk board chief wants to leave the company at the end of the year.
The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board of Arno Mahlert already has effect on 12 September from the supervisory board.
The Management Board already took over the previous board member Gerhard Hausruckinger on September 1.
He will officially assume the function of a "predator" until a successor to Hartmann was found.
As a reason for the recall, the company called "different views" on the long-term business orientation.
Details didn't want to call a corporate speaker on Friday.
It is still unclear to have the market research company in future.
In investor prices, it was said Friday that shareholders had been disappointed with the continued success of the restructuring launched years ago.
Mr Hartmann has been on the GfK tip since 2011.
"The fruits of the restructuring are not yet to be seen after 5 years," it said.
Given the last poor GfK business, each shareholder will eventually be unquiet.
"If BMW would be the case, that would also make the quandts," it said.
The company had not been able to stop his loss-taking in the previous quarter, even in the second quarter of 2016.
With €361.2 million, sales were up 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable prior year.
In the first half of the year, sales of €721.2 million fell by 3.4%.
The profit in the second quarter has, above all, been charged with the company's perceived value in the face of its difficult economic situation.
The corporate value depreciation of EUR 139 million, which was required in the Consumer Experience business area, was a loss of EUR 148.2 million.
In the second quarter of 2015, GfK had a group profit of 19.7 million.
