Save in Moelfre Bay: Three men have 'happiness still alive'
Three men have "lucky still to be alive" after they were thrown out of their fishing boat before Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station beat about 13: 20 BST alert on Friday after a crew watched the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had trouble swimming while their boat moved out of their own.
"We saw how the boat was going close to it and gave us the worst before," said the head of the rescue station of Moelfre Vince Jones.
"Thankfully, the strong winds already got the boat out of reach until we left to water," he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was spotted on a Boper hanging without a rescue.
They came all aboard the shore rescue boat and were brought back to rescue station
Mr Jones said: "The three men who were thrown into the water were lucky to be uninjured and still alive.
The boat driver had an emergency pad, but it was the victim of the boat.
Someone today washed up over these men.
