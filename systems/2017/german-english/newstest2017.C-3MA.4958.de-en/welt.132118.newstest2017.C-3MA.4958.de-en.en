Data clau: So perfide invents hackers her ransom
Programmers of extortion Malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful.
According to a recent survey by the malware prevention specialists, Malwareytes, among 540 companies in North America, the United Kingdom and Germany, 40 per cent of the companies surveyed have been in the past 12 months at least once, in part, many of them victims of an attack with blackmail software.
In Germany, just 20% of the companies were already committed to Ransomware blackmail.
40 per cent of the victims paid willingly the rangers demanded by the perpetrators to re-use the systems and data.
The perpetrators specifically specialise in their extortion software, according to the observations of Malwareyites, on attacks in company networks.
If they succeed there, the potentially far-reaching ranger is significantly higher than in private users.
"We are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of the malware," explains Malwareboy boss Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world."
In 2008, most Malwareprogrammes were still designed to send advertising.
Then the perpetrators discovered Erblackmail software for themselves.
Only private users were the target, but the change to company attacks has been appalling in recent months.
Ransomware works after a simple pattern: Once a victim's computer is active, it is looking for recently modified files such as Word-, Excel or database files, and archives for images and videos.
These files encrypt the Ransomware and delete the originals.
The software then presents the demands of the extenders.
To get the final encryption code to get the files, the victim needs money - usually in the form of the Cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
However, where private users use the personal photo database at stake, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production is closed.
Accordingly, the damage is higher when a Ransomware is added.
22 percent of German companies reported sales losses by Ransomware, 13 percent had even had to interrupt business completely, in one case people were in danger of life.
In Germany, many hospitals have been victims of attacks whose patients may be threatened by the loss of hospital records.
"We always tell the victims: Does not pay, it will only promote the problem," explained Kleczynski.
But 80 to 90 per cent of the firms who pay will get their data back again.
For managers, it is difficult to reject the perpetrators "demand, given the stalemate in the operation.
The hackers again know this and try to build a good reputation.
In a recent study, F-Secure's security researchers have been investigating the benefits of use and contact with the extenders, and come to the result: The perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.
They explain their victims by chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, sending freely accessible support websites or decrypt for example files.
And, as a result of payments from a few hundred euros, companies will have to negotiate and pay five-digit sums to get their data back unencrypted.
Given the potentially high and relatively risky gains from the Ransomware blackmail, the hackers will always be professional and share the job, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski from the Antivirus provider Sophos: "A single person can write a Ransomware about within a week."
However, it is more likely to be three or four people.
The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software component to the actual extenders.
The previous malware kits emerged, by purchasing the malware itself, advice and additional tools for a unique fixed price between 1,000 and $10,000.
"Included is an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.
The exters then seek further hackers to spread the freshly bought software among the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So, in one of the forums in the underground, you can buy the set of a criminal, and assign another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
The payment is made for a machine.
"Usually the criminals then ask for spammers," says Wisniewski.
The risk of Ransomware is now known to many companies that better secure their data.
More than 50 percent of the companies in the Malwareytes survey trust Ransomware to be able to escape from file bag-ups and scanner software.
As a result, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.
"If the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful performance, the perpetrators will instead threaten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski.
This means that the potential for damage is much higher than before.
In future, the perpetrators could, in future, have completely new objectives on the Internet.
At the Despacon conference Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the internet.
In the middle of winter, so many casualties could well be worth a ransom.
If the perpetrators were to block a whole production road in a factory, instead of the heating in the future, Ransomware could also become an issue in the industry 4.0.
