Police say the six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, this week already the second time a six-year-old child is shot.
The boys' grandparents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents said Brown suffered multiple gunshots, including in the leaning, leg, arm and belly, but that he was in the hospital at his transport.
"He went through a lot, his small body was extinguished by balls," shared his grandmother Delores Melendez to the station.
I simply cannot believe it.
The boy's condition was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo multiple operations.
The boy's family told the broadcaster he is expected to come back again.
He should have started the first class in a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
There were also three men: Two aged 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are in the stable condition according to CBS Philadelphia.
The boy was spotted on the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old who is in a critical condition, said the station.
The other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating whether they could be in one of the perpetrators' injured men.
Investigators shared CBS Philadelphia that apparently there was a cruise between multiple shooters.
Patrones for storm guns, which have been traced back to various storm guns, have been paralysed.
It seems that this is clearly an ongoing struggle.
On the road, on both sides of the secret, they were shakes.
So it seems that there have been several armed fighters who have been very actively involved, "shared police surgeon Anthony Ginaldi of the police in Philadelphia.
Several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area.
No arrests and police are currently reviewing the surveillance video.
On Tuesday, another 6-year-old girl was struck by a quake in the arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West Oak Lane.
She is recovering and police are still searching for a suspect.
