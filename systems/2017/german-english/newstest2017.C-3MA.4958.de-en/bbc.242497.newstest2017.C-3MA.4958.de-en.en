Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now linked to Fife
The £1.35-billion-expensive project is to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have linked the North deck of the Queensferry Crossings with the Viaduct - meaning the bridge is now linked to Fife.
It is the first of four decrees of the "cover zone," which approaches the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge.
Fife's bridge section is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete, as well as 46 wires.
The £1.35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017.
Business Minister Keith Brown issued a visit today and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossings.
We are all witnesses to engineering from a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for the passage.
Overall, almost 79% of the entire bridal deck is at their place and the last section of the deck is now getting a concrete cast for the deck in Rosyth, which means the entire deck is ready to be raised on the bridge.
Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "The first conclusion is a significant milestone in each bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the conclusion represents a pioneering high-end construction.
After the installation of the last road cover and its connection with the northern turmdeck, we had to close the existing gap on the North or Landside.
This was achieved by dragging the northern Zubragerbrücke bridge 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and, at the same time, very delicate activity.
Massive, as the viaduct is 222 meters long, it weighs about 6,000 tons and has to be pulled upwards of about 3%.
Delicate, as the tolerances to which the team is working, they were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimetres.
Thankfully, everything went very well.
