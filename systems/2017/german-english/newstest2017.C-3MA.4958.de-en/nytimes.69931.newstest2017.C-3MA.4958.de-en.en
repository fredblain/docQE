The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a plentiful meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his ascent to the president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch in the Oval Office.
As a gourmets, President Roosevelt had a facile for refined delicatessen of Fifth Avenue like PÃ¢te de fosie gras and Maryland Wassschlusdze.
His menu on that day was slightly more modest: Stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, potato peree and as dessert a plank pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with leaning people," Jane Ziegelman said.
Her husband Andrew Cue added, "It was also a message to Americans how they should eat."
The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coes last book "Tritate Suey" was made by Chinese cuisine in the US, while Ziegelman was told in her book "97 Orchard" about life in a residential house at the Lower East Side from the food perspective.
Her latest collaboration, "A decent meal," which will appear in the Harper publisher on Tuesday, illustrates the story of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter in the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, snowy-like snack at the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive beans, while Coe, 57, turtle with potato peel and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered Hackrates, this found the pair fit for a discussion about eating in the era of the Great Depression.
"Rich food was very popular," said Ziegelman.
There was groundbread, liver cheese and bread.
They were made of a ingredient and something cheaper that stretched the ingredient.
Imagine so many of the things they eat as dinners.
Cue grinste.
"It has to be in the stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an all-you-Can-eat buffet.
Teams of women cooks for male fellows and it was served freshly baked pasta for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
The Americans sent food to hungry Europeans during the first war.
"It was a time when eating for Americans became a central, tense theme," said Cue, why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The new budget diet was just as tense: Mysterious foods such as bread and caskerolen were made to be used as a staple ingredient, the caskeroles as a "wonderful way to recover," said Ziegelman, as chefs were able to hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry fruit.
Meat, which has been the focus of American cuisine for years, became a rare serving luxury.
Strange mixtures have been tried, as a calorie rich and nutritious satisfaction had priority over flavour or even healthy cuisine.
During her search for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a court dating from this era, baked onions with earthbuds.
"It wasn't a popular addition to lunch," says Coe.
Ziegelmann continues: "It was surreal."
Earthbuds and baked onions do not fit each other.
It was typical for many of the housekeeping recipes.
As never before or since then, fiscal economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 to 1943 - fueled the country's eating habits.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "budgetary politicians" and to respond to the challenge of turning pampes like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
"A Square Meal" is a festival of historic Lectures.
In particular, the reports on the government's response to starving citizens are tasty, as President Herbert Hoover's laughter-eating attitude.
While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse of his kitchen, he feeds like the millionaire man of the world to which he has become.
"He mocks Continental cuisine like fish with cucumber," Coe said.
He sat in an almost bursting dining room and wore a smoking.
He was wonderfully alien.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if not his wife Eleanor had asked him to declare an expel.
As described in the book, the Antheus of a housekeeper with no interest in flavours by Mrs Roosevelt said that the White House produced the most boring meal in Washington, but also one of the most expensive. "
Many of the species from the era of the Great Depression, dealing with eating, was discarded once the country came back to the legs.
The legacy lies on our continued focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as how science was applied to food.
The couple gave birth to the eating habits of Ziegelmans Sheriff's mother, for example as she couldn't throw away food.
"She had a real fear of wasting food," Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled: "You actually made people sick."
There was the windfall.
After the Teller was cleared at Eisenberg's disposal, she and Coe found a dessert that they had prepared at home: The plumber, the President Roosevelt took to lunch.
"It's going to be called Prune Whip," said Ziegelman and added that it was a usual trick to miss modest recipes.
There were no slaughtered cream, only plums, something flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone exchanged something reluctantly a spoon in the tweeted, brown Glibber.
Amazingly, it did not taste bad.
Coe caught up three times a night.
As a Can-Do budget keeper said to his wife, "A few hacked walnuts would help."
