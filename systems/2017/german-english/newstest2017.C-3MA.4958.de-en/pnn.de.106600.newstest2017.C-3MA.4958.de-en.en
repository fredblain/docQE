Greenland shark: The oldest cyclist is nearly 400 years old
Rare sight.
Greenland sharks mostly come to the surface in winter.
This shark was allowed back to the sea following an investigation aboard the Sanna research vessel.
He was born in 1624 and was floating a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day.
Greenland sharks only get back to 150 years.
In the middle of the North Atlantic, in an hour, it is only 1,220 meters long.
Only when it comes to speed, the five-metre-long animal speeds up to satch 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal.
However, this style of longevity seems to be a recipe for a high age.
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" in any case by a Greenland shark that could be 392 years old.
"Madness," commented Alexander Schemmelein from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock, which means a world record for vertebrate animals.
While the evolutionary biologist suspected that Greenland sharks become stealing.
Only the evidence failed.
Greenland sharks are hard to observe, after all, they live in the icesea above the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in winter.
Researchers know little about the lifestyle of the Greenland sharks.
Her pace of timing, when they announced six animals with a station before Spitsbergen-altitude peaks.
Prey to this sharks nonetheless: In the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had adorned the jaw bone of a young polar bear.
They may hunt sleeping animals or patrol on the grounds of the icemether and seek cadavers, which are down from higher water threats downwards.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now investigated 28 Greenland sharks, fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Spitsbergen as a lead from the depths of the North Atlantic.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long, while the biggest 502 centimetre was measured.
To identify the age of the animals, they analyzed the life of sharks with the carbon 14 method.
This center of the eye line already emerges before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein are not renewed later.
The two smallest sharks had fallen down a lot of carbon-14 in the lens.
Her birth should therefore be after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons were experimenting with larger quantities of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere.
In the third-smallest animal of 220 centimetres in length, the Linsect, on the other hand, included a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons trials, which is expected to celebrate its 50th anniversary in 2012.
All the larger Greenland sharks, by contrast, had normal carbon-14 volumes in their lens, resulting from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon-14-clock showed for a 493 centimeter long Greenland shark an age of 335, while the record shark with 502 centimetres was likely to be 392 years old.
That Greenland shark whites only get offspring when they are longer than four metres was known.
Now researchers were able to assign an age.
As one of the animals with 392 centimetres is arguably on the threshold of gender maturity, and its age was determined by 156 years, it is obvious that Greenland sharks, with the multiplication, are leaving at least one and a half centuries.
This is also likely to be world record for vertebrates.
That such meteoraleme is mostly living in icy waters is no accident.
Even the previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale, in whose bacon at Nocks a 120-year-old Harpunt tip, was caught in front of Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the animal's body often runs on a flat.
So they mature later - and ageing slower.
In order to stay warm in cold water, the animals are often particularly large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, by which the animal loses heat.
The heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much larger than a gram elephant.
Another advantage: They have fewer enemies.
"A smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many offspring as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist.
A very large animal should instead invest its resources in a long life.
