Amid the rise of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline
Wherever you are, as late as it is, it is the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inescapable, a place of pride between competition and ambition.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning stab, which is used by the bracing protection to the turner to the triathlon.
You can't switch to the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour's conversation in the caffeshop, without listening to Simone Biles, Katie Leckenny or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who, for the first time at the Olympics and a women's black girl, would have been able to be among those well-known names sent to the Prime Time, built by sponsors and charity TV advertising if he would be a swimsuit, Turner or even fiery.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forrest, California, is fighting for gold in the Olympic trampoline.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.
Further from the center, partly in the shadows are the sports that are not universally accepted: Air pist shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always have the breast swimming and will continue to be there for a long time.
But if I should modestly make arguments for my particular love, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline jump has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it was his debut in Sydney, the last 16 years have been so embarrassed that many people, I asked, did not know that it is an Olympic sport at all.
That could also be regional ignorance.
Although the US sent athletes to compete, it has never won a medal in the trampoline game and have had an athlete until 2012, who has won it to the final.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians people to share for the women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
The trampoline jump has a certain exterior charm, partly because it suits the unenlightened ear for a clown school than the one for the Olympics.
At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a born enthusiast.
It has humoristic potential - the cartoonist of his never-ending stir - but also the grace of the tournament and diving, the two sports that are essentially united.
The word "trampoin" comes from the Spanish El Trampolin, which means so much like "springboard."
Aspiring victors jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost to 30 feet in the air and have to face a number of falling movements (turning, hay and saltos) before landing on the feet.
They are assessed according to the official Olympic programme of execution, level of difficulty and "flight time."
Two-time athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight.
Medal hoping must continue in their quest for gold, faster, up to the top and down, sometimes to the goal, sometimes to and back, to the top and bottom of the playground.
They don't just hunt down the finishing line or the starting point, but also in the television broadcast, another hitch goal: The world or the Olympics.
The purposeful pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to even stir a spectator.
But it is also what I think of these games as something else.
The trampoline offers a breathing space.
The vector of the trampoline is above.
A forward movement is not the goal.
He or she prallt from, seemingly heavy as an astronaut, goes up, then downwards, then effortlessly again.
Here too, there is competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.
It is like competition in the Olympics.
The women's skills and endowments will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming around 13.00 Eastern Time; those of men on Saturday, also around 13.00.
NBC will broadcast the final hours as part of an afternoon block from 14.00.
Amid the Olympic mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in general tumbling.
If the raising of consciousness can only be achieved by the anxiety and the objectification of male athletes - as the male US Turner loudly suggested to the The Wall Street Journal - then Mr Dooley expects his new fan.
