Who builds Braunschweig's cheap apartments?
The SPD and the Greens mean that investors should be given a much stronger role in the future.
How to respond to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap homes in the next few years?
The SPD proposes a "approach to action" at the next Council meeting.
But dispute is programmed.
The first concerns the question of who is to build the cheap apartments?
A regulation has to date.
SPD we are agreed with the Greens: Who wants to build on urban land must in future designate 20% of all apartments as social housing. "
However, affordable apartments can also be built in stock.
However, the big dispute in the town hall is, however, Bratmann: "How do you talk about investing in private land?"
"We want investors to build on such land at least 10 percent, but as much as 20 percent of homes as social housing."
A new urban housing support programme, which will cost millions and will still be funded, will provide incentives.
The problem, Bratmann: "There is still no agreement between the groups."
The CDU wants investors to make as few rules as possible.
The left wants to go even harder for investors.
Despite this, Bratmann said, the situation in the housing market is worsening.
If the concept of action is implemented, it will provide additional tasks in the building management.
More staff are needed.
It is unclear whether we will get the professionals.
But the programme is not entirely: For the approximately 1260 new homes that should be built anyway.
But how does the loss of more than 1300 cheap apartments be phased out?
It will be 500 apartments by 2020 alone.
To prevent this, the planning spokesperson Nicole Palm should now be bought-up from the city.
In addition, consideration should be given to bringing homes back into price fixing.
This is possible in the western city.
The problem could be solved.
For in the West, the deadline is for the end of the year.
Around 1800 apartments could get back to price fixing for cheap apartments.
Only those who do not want housing companies.
The fact that the number of social housing in the West is dramatically increased again is the aim of the so-called mixture.
There should be no more of a concentration of social weakness in just a few neighbourhoods.
The Greens are counting on the fact that there will be some movement in the discussion.
Group Chairman Holger Herlitschke said: "For a broad majority, the CDU must be in the boat."
This has concentrated on more places for single-family homes.
But what does not mean that we cannot find a compromise.
