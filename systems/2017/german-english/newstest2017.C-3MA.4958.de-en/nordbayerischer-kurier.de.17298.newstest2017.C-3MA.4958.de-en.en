The charges per cubic metre of waste water from October 1, 2016 for the area of waste water treatment Neudorf / Reth / Welchenkahl.
At the airport in Azendorf, the waste water charge will increase once more, if appropriate.
After an oversleeved calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf will be at 4.37 Euro per cubic meter.
As Mayor Bernd Steinh√§user (CSU) reported, the Council's approval of the budget was determined by the Kulmbach County Council that undercover covers for these waste water plants.
The Kasendorf market is subject to legal basis for a cost-free operation.
As of 1 October 2016, citizens and industrial companies from Welchschahl, Neudorf, Reth, Azendorf, Lupp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to go deeper into the purse.
The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.
As administrative leader Herbert Schmidt revealed to the Body, a recalculation of the charges for the waste water systems of the market community was necessary.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, even overcover or undercover from the previous period of calculations should be compensated.
The serious redundancies made by Schmidt to ensure that there are relatively small facilities with a very low waste water treatment in all three wastewater treatment plants between 6800 and 12000 cubic metres per year.
Thus, due to the small basis of distribution, for example, expenses for the necessary repairs of thousands of euros would be serious.
In addition, waste water in all three plants is slightly decreasing.
Furthermore, in the declining period of time, all three installations have not been affected by a significant extent, not least due to their age of rehabilitation and repair.
The plant in Azendorf was nearly 30 years old, the plants for Welchschahl, Neudorf and Reth and Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lupp almost 20 years.
Schmidt pointed out that in the Azendorf sewage plant the mechanical ventilation system had to be exchanged due to a damage.
In the Pumpwerk Welschchenkahl, for nearly 20 years, the production facilities had to be overtaken by reason, and at the Lupp forest clearing house, after nearly 20 years of operation, the first treatment pond had to be spread, the sewage sludge was disposed of and an additional ventilation facility had to be used to keep the water legal requirements in place.
Schmidt: "On these extraordinary expenses, the advanced maintenance and maintenance costs came to be taken into account in the new calculation period."
The same is true of electricity costs, which were clearly below the current level in 2011 / 2012.
Stone houses made clear that in the small waste water case in the three plants, the expenses for operation and maintenance were "fully reflected."
Said Schmidt, the market community of large-scale entertainment in the waste water sector over the past 20 years.
The situation for these plants will continue to remain fragile in the view of stonehouses, especially given that it is not possible to expand the area of the Friesenbachtal treatment area for these plants, because they are deficient.
