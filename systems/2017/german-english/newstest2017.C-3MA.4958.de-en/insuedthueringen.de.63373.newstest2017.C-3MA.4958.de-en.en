The soprano Anna Netrebko goes openly with the autism of her son Tiago - and turns to other affected parents: "You have to have the courage to talk about it."
"Medicine has made great progress," the 44-year-old told the Italian newspaper "Corriere della Sera."
When the disease was detected in her son, she believed she had to die.
The Tiago, who has now been eight years old, is well-off and now has private in New York, where the best therapists are.
"To give an example: If I ask him something that's two years back when I sang at the Milan Scala, he remembers nothing," Netanyahu said.
But he is the happiest person on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebokos with the Bassbariton Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to Tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
