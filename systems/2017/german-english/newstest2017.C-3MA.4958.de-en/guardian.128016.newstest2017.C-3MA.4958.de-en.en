French court rejects bid over demolition of shops in jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live in.
At a court hearing this week, authorities in Calais argued that the state should be empowered to demolish 72 provisional transactions in which people inside the store sell goods, selling cigarettes to Energyrites, offer hairdressing, or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in PISG restaurants.
The Calais prefecture argued that these places should be demolished because they would be a parallel economy, from which no taxes would be paid and that would have a fire and sanitation risk.
Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state-backed union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They also said that temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille ruled that there would be no legal basis for the deportation of people running the 72 provisional deals, but admitted that the concerns of Calais's prefecture were "absolutely understandable."
Judge Jean-Fran√ßois Molla said food shops, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than merely feeding people who "live in extremely precarious conditions."
He said the areas offer quiet matches between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places under threat from the Netherlands was the Jungle Book Kids' cafe of the camp, which is commonly operated and consists of 200 meals on the day, English and French classes, and advice on asylum matters for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to keep the Kids' cafe.
In a letter to the Guardian, it was said that the closure would be "for these children of a disaster, of which the youngest eight years are old."
The two aid agencies Help Refugees and L'Auberge of the Migrants estimate on Friday that the number of those living in the jungle camp had risen to more than 9,000 people - the highest number until now - following a sharp rise in new arrivals over the summer.
