Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
E-mail and internet in timeline: 20 years ago, the Nokia Communicator came to the market.
The successors today dominate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device wog up nearly half kilograms and was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5.
It was thick and bigger, so it was not good enough.
On the contrary, it was quite patchy.
The built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which would be enough for roughly two selfires today.
An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" arrived exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, into the shops - and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet, but they are somehow out of the start of the internet age.
20 years ago, however, the Communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier on the computer fair Cebit in Hannover as a "office in the Western Enthusiasm."
In fact, the new mobile phone was able to send and receive SMS and e-mails, even by fax.
Even access to web pages was possible via HTML browser, albeit slowly.
A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the phone could be folded similar to a laptop.
Then there was a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.
It was quite proud of the price: 2700 D-Mark, about 1400 euros.
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.
No one could see in August 1996 that the Communicator would become the start of the smartphone era.
Since then, everything has changed.
The smart phones are a success story, if not for Nokia.
The Finns' cell phone sparse experienced an unprecedented disaster, eventually sold to Microsoft and managed.
The market is dominating today, all of which came a lot later than Nokia.
Always online, that is today for a lot of people.
In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.
Some 1.4 billion devices, Samsung and Apple account for 555 million.
The worldwide turnover of the equipment is around EUR 400 billion.
This includes the well-running shops of the countless app-provider and telecommunications companies.
Around the smartphone is now a whole industry.
The decisive breakthrough in the mass market came only in early 2007, at that time, Apple's chief executive Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhones on the Mac World.
He promised three devices in one: A music player, a phone and an internet communicator, all by touch screen easy to use.
Apple's victory, yet today the iPhone is the main product of the Group.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who dominated the market, had the afterthought.
She eventually disappeared, Blackberry got to fight.
The seed now has Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung.
The smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention.
Today, on average, every German now looks at his mobile phone 88 times a day.
"We must all learn to get the smartphone away," said Janina Kugel, in the Siemens Executive Board for Personal Information.
Permanent accessibility is now considered as a curse and a blessing.
