Condoms with chilipuder, fireworks promote Tanzanian elephant protection
Natural protectors in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from going into populated settlements - they throw condoms on them filled with Chiilipuder.
The method has proved to be effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had already had the idea of the idea years ago, has intensified its promotion by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-step method to protect their homes and crops without infringing animals.
Previously, many spears have used to defend themselves.
Friday is World Heritage Day dedicated to animal welfare.
"Since we have developed this... toolkit, we have been able to observe a change in their attitudes within these communities, and they are much more confident they can stop elephants from their fields without harming the elephants," the chief executive of Honeyguard Damian Bell said in a communication.
The first two steps include the elephant's lighting with a torch and the blaze in a horn.
If he is not deterred, a so-called "Chiliwolke."
Chilipuder mixed with earth is packed together with a fireworks into a condom, which is now being overturned to the spark.
When it is hooked, the condom burst with a bang and spray fine dust at Chilipuder in the air.
A smoke is usually already out of place to hunt elephants.
One last option is a driver who shoots a gold smoke plant in the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
