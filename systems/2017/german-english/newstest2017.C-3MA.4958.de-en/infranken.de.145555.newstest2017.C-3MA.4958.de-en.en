31 years for clarity
The Managing Director of the Water Funding Federation, Ruppert Göller, is retiring.
The association is regarded as "Bavarian."
A small frantic drinking water station as an example for the large water producers.
This was the name of the Bayerischer Rundfunk some time ago.
Little later, the Water Forum of the Government of Lower Frankonia was awarded the purpose board.
The work of the Veig group is "Bavarian as exemplary."
Behind all this is Rupert Göller, who was 31 years in the Zielband employee, 28 years as managing director.
Now he was retired at the age of 65.
The water-purpose Federation of the Veig group, based in Kottendorf, Municipality Breitbrunn, promotes approximately 150000 cubic metres of water every year and provides for 32 places and females with about 5500 inhabitants.
The municipalities are the municipalities of Kirchlouder, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.
For other cities and municipalities there are water supply contracts.
The current chairman, Breitbrunn Mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was hired as a water supplier in 1985 and was appointed as the Managing Director of the Zielverband in 1988.
"His tasks have been very diverse and they covered water pipeline construction and maintenance work through office and organization activities, budgeting, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations at weekends," the chairperson said.
As an outstanding event, she called the start-up and inauguration of the new wells (1994), plots of land in the area of the new wells (1998) and compensation of farmers, the rehabilitation of the high-container (1999), the new creation of a central computer control system (2004) and the re-introduction of water pipelines.
There has been no stalemate, and there have always been innovations because water is a means of life and drinking water is the most important food.
In her Laudatio, she praised Göller's faithful, reliable and correct service over 31 years.
He has worked with a lot of heart blood for his water base and he has always lived in the water-purpose association as if it were its own business.
A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he has been able to present the concept of success of the group to the water forum in the district of Lower Frankonia.
He received a great deal of recognition and praise.
Rupert Göller, for his part, praised Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.
He is the best Wasser and he was a faithful cone.
Together we were an unbeatable team.
As a highlight from his point of view, he referred to the cultivation of Brunnen and the restructure of the destination.
The biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the crash in the blast container at Kirchlouder on 3 January.
At minus 17 degrees the whole night will have to work, so that the towns could be cared for.
You can only maintain the supply of Neubrunn because you have been filled with hoses from Pettstadt.
The management of the Drinking Water Works Association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who took up the succession of Rupert Göller.
