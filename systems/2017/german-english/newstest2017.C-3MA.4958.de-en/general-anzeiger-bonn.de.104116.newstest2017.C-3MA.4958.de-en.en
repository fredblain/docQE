Volkswagen is still gliding through.
Despite diesel scandals, delivery figures are rising worldwide.
But it is not running in all markets.
In the case, there is confusion about a term.
Volkswagen will start the deliveries in the second half of the year.
In spite of its many brands and some well-running markets, Europe's largest car can continue to show its biggest car.
In July, however, the Volkswagen nuclear brand weakened mainly in Western Europe and thus again had a heavy burden of sales, as the company listed in the Dax listed company.
Worldwide, the VW brand sold 1,449100 cars in July, 1.8 percent less vehicles than the previous year.
In Western Europe alone, according to China, sales were 14 percent below the previous year.
In the home market of Germany, deliveries to almost one-sixth fell.
Markenverdidief JÃ¼rgen Stackmann reduced the weaker figures from July to two sales days less in Europe.
In addition, in some core markets, a "changing economic environment" has given a purchase order.
In addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey, the British vote to leave the EU has also been charged, a spokeswoman said.
In the United States, where the exhaust flashes first escalated, there is also a minus.
Great support for VW is the Chinese market.
In total, the largely affected domestic brand of the Lower Saxony is already with the diesel scandal: After the first seven months, only a 0.9 per cent increase to 3.37 million vehicles is to be found.
Group sales chief Fred Kappler continued to show a sales gap between January and July.
1.3 per cent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen at this time, worldwide 5.904 million.
Volkswagen had rigged with a software Aggery.
In Germany alone, VW is calling for approximately 2.5 million cars to upgrade to the workshops.
In the course of rearmament, VW confirmed that the conversion of the cars has no negative impact.
After the conversion of vehicles, fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power will not deteriorate.
The bus station offers customers a "guarantee" certificate, but not of a "guarantee," as was said on Friday in company trips.
The reason for this is legal immunity.
The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen would now guarantee its German customers a guarantee of equipped diesel models.
This would have been confirmed last Monday VW-Representative in the Federal Ministry of Transport.
The Department of Transport confirmed that there was this meeting.
"VW has met the obligations of my investigative commission and the KBA."
Said Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU).
VW has taken the guarantee that fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power will not deteriorate after upgrading, and all the type-approval-related vehicles remain unchanged.
Volkswagen itself uses the term "guarantee" but not how it was called in business trips.
The broad concept of "guarantee" makes Volkswagen the possibility that, for example, customers could come to a shop for six months after the conversion - and this could lead to the new software - even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
It is also important for us to avoid, in the interests of our clients, that any other damage, which has nothing to do with the Abgassandal, will lead to uncertainty as regards the possible guarantee arrangements, as stated.
For this reason, VW does not use the term "guarantee."
