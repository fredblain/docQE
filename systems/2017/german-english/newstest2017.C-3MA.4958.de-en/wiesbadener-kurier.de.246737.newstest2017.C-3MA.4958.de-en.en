One for all cases
Honda HR-V is flexible and everyday
In the small HR-V, Honda wants to pack everything: A little SUV, a little coupe and even the versatility of a minivan.
Sounds fairly overloaded, but the HR-V, constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, is actually proving to be very flexible in everyday life.
Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V is rather small, the passengers have plenty of space in both the first row and the Fond.
The materials of the interior are well-processed and have a pleasant impact, only the cockpit top is falling.
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles.
It is not only available in 453 litres of high and 1026 litres on the left hand side, but there are the Magic Seats.
This is less magical than it sounds: The seats of the backbench can be flushed up like chin-chairs and thus provide vacuum space, which is high from the ground to the ceiling of 1.24 metres.
The boot is well-ventilated, but it is a bit higher than the comparable Peugeot in 2008.
The tested 1.6-l-diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide rotation loads very powerful.
But he is expected to make his work a bit more leaner.
It is pleasant to see the everyday consumption of 4.7 litres / 100 km.
There is another motorization: A 1.5-l-petrol with 96 kW / 130 horsepower.
An all-wheel drive is not offered.
Driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamism and comfort.
However, steering is probably something more direct.
The equipment can no longer be desired in the "Executive" category.
The security systems include the City emergency brake (works by speed 32), the collision alert system and the spacing wizard.
The collision warning is sometimes irritated by assessing many obstacles as "approaching objects."
The distance assistant works very reliably.
And the smart Temporezer reacts to traffic character recognition and modifies the speed.
However, full connectivity is available only for top-up: 7-inch touchscreens, Navi, app integration and more.
Two USB and a HDMI book are under the armrest and are therefore easily accessible.
The around 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are in order.
Those who do not want to invest so much will get the petrol from 20000 Euro, the diesel from EUR 23000.
The engines meet the Euro-6 exhaust gas standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday-like car.
