Buyers in Primark outraged over woman probing in the midst of business shamelessly underwear
Buyers didn't know where to see them when a woman pulled her clothes off in the middle of a Primark to try underpants.
To aggravate the situation, she said, as she told it, she pulled out and put her back to the shelf.
They continued and tried four pairs of underpants in a business in the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone.

A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was at the same time in the business, said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear, "she stopped again and left the business without buying anything."
She said: "People couldn't believe what they saw."
In the middle of the sales area, she took a pair of underpants from the outlet, pulled her own stockings and pants and tried them.
"She didn't even try to find a slightly more discreet place to do it - she was quite simply there, eat like Oskar."
"Everyone kicked off when she pulled out the underpants that they apparently didn't like, as she put them back to the shelf."
She repeated the same with three other underpants before finally decided that her nothing liked, again and again.
"She didn't seem to bother anyone watching - or thinking about the person who might buy the underpants she had tried."
Ms Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: 'How disgusted you would think that someone would take underpants with them who had a different person and who were not washed up.'
The incident happened Tuesday afternoon.
Ms Davidson added: "As I have received, staff were trying to pull the garments out of sale after they went - which is just as good."
"I would hate to go back home with a new pair of underpants and find out that another woman had angling her and pulled her back and she wasn't washed up."
A spokesman for Primark said: "Primark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday, August 9 in our branch in Folkstone."
All products in question were drawn from sale.
