Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
The City of the Main, therefore, in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg, has the best chance of attracting from London's jobs and companies.
"It is very likely that Frankfurt is most likely to benefit from the Brexit vote," says Michael Voigtländer, head of the sphere of the financial markets and real estate markets of the IW.
After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether financial firms should continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU.
For the so-called EU passport, they are now available in Britain.
These are just large US banks.
Several banks have already announced to relocate jobs.
The "Frankfurt Main Finance" lobby covers the next five years with a total of 10000 new jobs.
For Frankfurt, the IW, it is the seat of the European Central Bank (ECB), which combines responsibility for monetary policy and oversight of the eurozone's largest banks, as well as other important authorities such as the EIOPA and the ESRB.
In Paris, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), although it has its headquarters, is less important for the financial industry than the ECB.
"Proximity to the central bank is important for banks, as they can communicate so directly with oversight," says IW professor Voigtländer.
Luxembourg is home to a large fund industry, but as well as Dublin infrastructure.
Frankfurt is easily accessible thanks to the large airport.
In addition, the city with easily available commercial properties.
"In Paris, it's not so easy to find free high-quality offices," says Voigtlaender.
In addition, in the Seine, rents for first-class commercial goods are 50% higher than on the Main.
Furthermore, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime.
In a ranking of the company's consultancy Mercer, the city is ranked seven, Luxembourg on Square 19, Dublin on Place 33 and Paris at 37.
Although quality of life is a matter of preferences: "With its already strong position as a financial base for the European internal market, Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors," says the IW.
But, despite Brexit's vote, London will remain the main financial centre in Europe, my economic researchers.
According to the figures of the Landesbank Helaba, around 144,000 people in the banking sector worked in London in late 2015.
