Clinton and Trump's economic policy compared: It's all about the money
Invest in infrastructure and prevent TTP - that is what both Clinton and Trump want.
However, the two US presidential candidates are opposed to tax and energy policy and to a fundamental question.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are fundamental, rather philosophical.
Of the state.
Trump wants to keep in doubt rather small and warns against how the state can hurt the economy - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to cut the economy to death and regulate to death, he says.
He himself would be quite different, Trump said.
He will have a massive return on regulations and he is strong for far-reaching tax reform with lower rates - for private and business.
Clinton, on the other hand, says that the State has certain tasks to do, opening up opportunities and spending money on it.
That is why taxes on the rich would be increased, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure.
To invest in it, Trump and Clinton say almost exactly.
The Democratic Applicant announces the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II.
Government investment programs in infrastructure are classical democratic policies, and are firmly rejected by Republicans, for example, by the government's government.
So, on Trump, there could still be bipartisan discussions.
The differences in energy and climate policy are clearer.
Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and restore coal mining in the US again.
Oil extraction should also be possible in protected areas, the Paris climate agreement will announce it.
Clinton, on the other hand, wants to expand its investment program explicitly to expand and call for "a country to become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs."
"It's probably going to be China, Germany or America - I want us to be."
But not only with the infrastructure - including international trade agreements - the two competitors are not too distant.
TPP, the transient trade deal, do not want to sign.
At the same time, both, however, do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply protect American jobs.
They are to be paid better, and for about Clinton.
The current minimum wage of $7.25 was a famine.
It wants to raise it to $15 per hour.
What Trump wants to do on this issue is not quite clear: Once he says, the minimum wage needs to be reversed, then he says he must not be changed.
But the big discussion of the next few months is likely to develop rather than the two camps.
On the one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens, is to boost growth.
His critics think he would only increase the budget deficit.
On the other hand, Clinton, who, at least, wants to ask the wealthy to pay more taxes, and whose critics say: More taxes are not the solution either.
