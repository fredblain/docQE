Olympia: Three scams on doping test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary commission on the case.
Kenya's athletics threats threaten after the second doping affair at the Olympics.
After a fraud attempt at a doping control in the Olympic village, Kenya sent a coach to her home.
The International Olympic Committee announced that it would immediately set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case.
A Kenyan officials had told the former sprinter and today's Coach, John Anzrah, in the Olympic village a Urgin sample under the name of the 800-meter-runner Ferguson Red.
This is what the Kenyan team has been reporting on.
The IAAF International Federation has asked the IOC of information about the case to impose its own investigations, and shared an IAAF spokesman.
"Depending on the findings of the investigation and the following measures by the IOC, the IAAF will evaluate it," it said in an IAAF statement.
"He (Anzrah) has gone to the doping control station and has spent as a Ferguson Red, the rehearsal and signed," said Kenya's chief executive of Mission Stephan Arap Soi.
He was in possession of the athlete's accreditation, who was on the list for training checks at the World Anti-Doping Agency.
Ferguson Red was in 2015 in Beijing World Championship over 800 metres.
Four days earlier, Kenyan athletics delegate chief Michael Roich had been deducted from the Rio Games.
He is expected to have informed of his country's anti-doping tests.
According to media reports he is said to have been arrested at his return at Nairobi airport.
Kenya has been under special surveillance for some time now, following numerous doping offences.
The announcement by the IOC of more than 2000 doping targets prior to the Rio Games was unusual to suggest that particularly athletes from Kenya and Russia are being notified.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had put much pressure on the African country before the summer play in Brazil, creating an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympic start.
As a result, WADA Kenya took Kenya from the list of countries whose anti-doping regime is in conformity with WADA rules.
Kenya is seen as a big runners-nation.
The country's athletics won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.
In a series of television reports, the ARD has repeatedly complained that doping funds are easily accessible in Kenya and that there should be a significant mentality of sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Charlotte last called for a similar investigation into Kenya, as he employed in the Russian athletics.
It has been demonstrated that this type of sport has been completely and systematically dashed.
Russia's athletics were subsequently ruled out of summer play.
