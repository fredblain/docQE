U.S. backed troops say they have regained full control over Manbij from Islamic State
The US-backed troops have taken full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border, after the last ISIS fighters in the city have left them, said a spokesman for the group on Friday.
The Democratic Forces Syria (DKS) rushed to the city after the outcry of the still remaining group of fighters buried within the city.
They have freed more than 2,000 civilians held hostage by fighters, shared by Sharfan Darwish of the Manbij military rat of Reuters, allied with the DKS.
"The city is now under perfect control, but we are currently carrying out insurrection work," he told Reuters.
