Reid says Clinton will remain in the case of an election victory at Garland as a candidate for the Supreme Court
Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate the judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
The majority leader in the Senate Mitch McConnell believes the next president will appoint the successor to the late judge at the Supreme Court Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on Thursday during a phone conference that he expected to select Garland "with a degree of certainty."
A spokeswoman of Reid later said he had yet to speak to Clinton if she would nominate Garland and he would speculate.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team wouldn't care for complacency with a new candidate.
Garland is the supreme judge for the US appeals court for the District of Columbia.
RAID said Republicans blocked the Garlands nomination, be Lakaien and heroics of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also noted that Donald Trump is unsuitable for the presidency.
