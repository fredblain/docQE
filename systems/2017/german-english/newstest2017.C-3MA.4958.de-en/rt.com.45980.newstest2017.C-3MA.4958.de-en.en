Trade between Russia & Iran suddenly rises to 71% - RT Business
With the lifting of the sanctions, according to the Russian Ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran in the annual comparison was 70.9 percent.
Since international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, interest on the part of Russian companies in shops in the country grew strongly, divided by the ambassador.
Russian companies have existing ties with Iran while new firms are willing to access the market.
Of course, further trade expansion is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran, "said Dzardayan.
He noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9% in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and $856 million.
In particular, Russia's imports to Iran increased by 91.5% and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose 16 percent to $158 million.
The trade recovery was achieved through deliveries of machines, land vehicles and weapons, "said the ambassador.
Dzhagaryan comes from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year.
Last year, Russia's foreign representation issued some 35,000 visas, primarily travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, Iran reached the top 20 countries, which affects the number of tourists in Russia.
One could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year, "he said.
At the same time, only a few Russians visit Iran, something that the ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, who have received monuments of ancient Persian civilization in a good state," he said.
