Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland no longer available
The RBS brand is supposed to be reduced to a backoffice role, according to the bank's default.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
The Bank has since distanced itself when she had almost collapsed and rescued eight years ago.
At this time, Markenstadists used "RBS" to protect other end-of-the-art retail trade marks.
She supported international sports with millions of pounds of sponsorships, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now it has decided to focus on more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralised headquarters and stock exchange will change to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller brands for the retail business that will receive more importance - Coutts Bank, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a tour of clients and staff in Inverness-shire.
He shared the BBC Scotland with: "The RSB brand will become our investor brand and the brand under which our employees will be employed, as we will now become more a bank of brands."
When the bank became a global brand, RBS became the global brand.
I am saying now that we are pursuing not global targets but local objectives.
Each of these brands will be completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers under these brands.
RBS has already announced that it will no longer continue its Six Nations Sponsoring and that it will increase the visibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship.
"It is time for us to develop into the bank of the brands, because how do we concentrate on the inside (we asked) to make this a better bank for customers?" Said the CEO.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we said that we would be a great bank for our customers and that these brands had been launched.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think we will see many changes.
We can launch these brands again, so I think the time has come.
