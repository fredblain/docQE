This was the moment when frightened tourists start to panic after a tipping jet crashed over a full beach.
Dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft almost flew over the sunk on the beach in Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers on, as they were understandably inclined, worried about the noise of the jet engines without first seeing what the clouds arrived.
The incident happened last afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many holidaymakers who posted videos about the dramatic fly-By in social media, said: "It flew twice really very deeply and there was a moment when it looked as though it would crash."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was just watching surfing and it felt like the plane would drop to me."

Portuguese air forces today said that the pilot of the P-3C Orion plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to fly so deep that this was the only way to identify them.
The spokesman said the jet flew slightly deeper than usual due to poor viewing conditions, but the air pressure forces insisted that safety was at no time at risk.
Area fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer, with four people being killed on the island of Madeira.
