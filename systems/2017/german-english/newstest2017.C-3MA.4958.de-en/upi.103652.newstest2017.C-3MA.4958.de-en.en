Kepler measures the rotation rate of stars in the star of the plejades
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers gather the most complete catalogue of rotation rates among the stars of the startling of the plejades.
The new data help astronomers understand why stars are rotated in the star clusters as well as in the context of rotation periods.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other starches, more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his age and even history of his solar system," said Luisa Rekull, a researcher at the Caltech's infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The star of the plejades lies 445 light years from Earth.
Many stars in this starry, which emerged about 125 million years ago, now reach the adult age.
They are now turning to the fastest.
At peak rotation rates, these mature stars emit large amounts of star winds.
As these winds travel through the star's magnetic fields, they have a brake effect on the stars.
When a star is ageing, its rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measured the rotational rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star dome -- such as sunglasses --.
The latest catalogue of rotation rates suggests that more massive stars are slower than less massive stars.
Rethull compares the stars with dancers, with larger stars slower pirouts turn up as smaller ones.
"In the" Ballet "of plejacks, we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, while more rapid rotors tend to be very bright stars," Reull said.
It is the ideal cosmopolitan laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates.
"The star shooting of the plejades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," Reull said.
There is still a lot of things we would like to know more about, how the How, When and Why Stars slow their rotation rates and hang their "dance shoes."
Rethull and her colleagues have extensively reported in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the plejades that will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
