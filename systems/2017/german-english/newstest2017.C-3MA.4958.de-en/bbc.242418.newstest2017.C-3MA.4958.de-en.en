The Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.
He set to predilection, trained by John Gosden, on his local race track with his second win of the night a milestone.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in the flat race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggod, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
The three-time winner Dettori, who won at Ghayyar, said: "It's something special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday evening with 20,000 people.
I'm relieved and very modest.
Dettori takes the jubilee when he picks up victory
Two jockeys reached the milestone in the impeachment race - Jockey Richard Johnson and the retired 20-painted winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who scored more than 4,300 wins in a rebound career.
Lester Piggod, the nine-member Derbywinner had 4,493 career talent
Frankie is one of the best jockey of the modern era and it is no surprise that he has achieved this milestone, which has reached just a few.
He has style and is strong, but it's his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.
He's a fantastic ambassador for race, his enthusiasm and charisma thrilled fans for years for this sport.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he had already picked 6,000 wins if he wouldn't just be a weekend and big tournament jockey!
Frankie already has nearly 30 years in GB, which is great.
He has a living personality, which is good for a British race, but beyond that he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From the Flying finisher to Flying Dismots, Frankie Dettori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades.
It was nervous.
A whole series of great turnovers, including his famous "Glorious Sieben" in Ascot in 1996, also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban.
Three years ago, he initially had trouble when he returned from his six-month-old lock, but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to defy his doubters and return to his bride.
And he's still far from the end - Dettori said earlier that he would want to carry on in competitions up to his minimum 50.th life year.
