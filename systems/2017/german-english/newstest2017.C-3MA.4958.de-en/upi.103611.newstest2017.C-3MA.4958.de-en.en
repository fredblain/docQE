North Sea oil workers take on talks again, set strike
Labor battles over pay for North Sea oil workers will be suspended, while all the armed forces are campaigning for a new round of talks, negotiators said.
Strikes against the oil field provider Wood Group have been conducted sporadically on platforms in the North Sea, operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group as well as the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of the current dispute," says a joint statement.
We will hold a few full-day sessions in the next few weeks, starting early next year to address the problems.
The unions said their last strike, which is the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible pay cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group has cut the rates to its counter-operations in the North Sea by about 9 percent this year due to negative market pressure.
The company's clearance rate follows a 10-result decrease for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said additional cuts will give the company the required space to get through the market downturn.
Shell has dismissed for its part of thousands of people and has announced plans to abandon its oil and gas activities in up to 10 countries, as it rationalises its business activities as a result of its mega-merger with the UK energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of lower crude oil prices, an economic situation that had intensified by the British decision in June to leave the European Union.
Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met with Labor leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest work disputes that have been taking place in the North Sea since a generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for many and not just for a few," he said in a statement.
2016 will be less than $1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of about $7 billion over the past five years.
