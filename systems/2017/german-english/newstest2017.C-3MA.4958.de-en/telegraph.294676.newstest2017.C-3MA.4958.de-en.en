England must steer the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring about renewal and prosperity in our local communities and in the whole of London.
For me, that represented the biggest attraction of Heathroads, just as in 2012 in London, when we operated a great deal to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympics brought great benefits for Stratford and the East End.
And that will happen again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities, we will already have 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.
Just as they were ahead of us in London in 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of the enlargement of Heathroads is too big.
I have been told that England will never be ready for the Games and that we will be blaming ourselves on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers each asked question.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is for many and not a infrastructure project.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211bn of good growth and a legacy of skills and employment both to the airport and to the whole of GB.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion infrastructure investment programme in the time and budget, from the T5 - which was chosen as the world's best airport terminal for five years - to the T2, which was built in the middle of the world's two most frequented career.
Now they are ready to deliver a third run, which is backed by £16 billion in private investment.
The 2012 London Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that Heathrow's enlargement will also be one.
It is time for us to steer this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, secure our future trade, and create a legacy of skills and employment to which England can be proud.
