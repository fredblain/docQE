Cats respond more sensitively than catcher on gunfire of juveniles
Biologists have studied in Hannover, which effect has caused cat babies on adult animals.
To her surprise, the mistress also didn't let the men go cold - but they always kept in touch with the females.
Female cats can recognize the erratic rate of cat babies on the small ones.
They respond to ten per cent faster on Lutte from kittens, who are in great distress, as scientists have found out of the Animal Veterinary School and Medical University Hannover (MHH).
Catchers also respond to the rufe of kittens - but always equal.
"Apparently, the acoustic differences between the mistress of less and sharply raised juveniles for the males are either not perceived or irrelevant," said the biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
She is the first author of the study published this Friday in the journal "BMC Evolutionary Biology."
In a previous investigation, the research team had already found that the duration and tone of the kittens is different from the urgency of their aid needs.
A total of nine adult catchers and eight patients were observed from the MBH.
They were first played for a rufe of little ones, taken for three minutes from the litter box and separated by mother and brothers.
On the other hand, they were faced with gunshots of more highly inflated kittens, which were added in addition.
The researchers hold their results despite the low sample for meaningful.
"All females, even those that had not yet had their own offspring, responded differently to the sheriff," said Konerding.
They turned faster to the speaker when this Rufe played off the very erased kittens.
This ability may be associated or develop with the gender maturity.
"A surprise was that the males reacted at all," the biologist said.
In the past, scientists have already investigated the reactions of women and men on baby noises in the past.
Also, some studies showed that women responded more sensitively to infants, whether they were mothers or not, reported biologist Marina Scheumann.
