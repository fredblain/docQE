Community centres show 160,000 people each year
More than 160,000 of the country's most vulnerable countries are being dismissed from community centres each year, while the industry is considering the impact of further reductions on already overburdened transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly elderly people, immigrants, refugees, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who have no means of unjust delogations and similar - will be dismissed when they seek free legal advice and legal advice.
Legal services of the community, which have already been overworked, are ready for further cuts.
As of June next year, these legal centres will lose another 30 per cent of their federal funding.
Queesland's chief executive of Queesland James Farrell said the latest survey by the National Association of Communities Centres found that thousands of people are already being dismissed every year.
Farrell said the situation would only be even worse without a repeal of the federal government decision.
"Queensland's community centres are chronically underfunded, meaning that thousands of people will be dismissed from key services you need," he said.
People who leave violent relations, people with inconspicuous and irrefutable debts, families who go through divisions, workers who were unfairly dismissed - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funds by 30 percent from June 2017, meaning that thousands of more vulnerable people from Queensland will be forced to deal with their legal problems without any help.
We are calling on the Attorney-General, Federal Justice and Defence Minister and Senators of Queensland George Brandis to lift these funds immediately, so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems.
Last year, the state government met its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance on the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of community centres and their customers, and to invest in this important work by the Palaszczuk government.
