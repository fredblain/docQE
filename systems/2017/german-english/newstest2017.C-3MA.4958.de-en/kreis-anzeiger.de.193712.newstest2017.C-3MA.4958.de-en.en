Community, spirit, health: Singing does seniors well
The Singen has already accompanied Ursel Kipp her whole life: As a young girl she was in the school choir, in the Lehtramt-studying she was the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old is singing in a seniors choir.
"Singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.
After a rehearsal she feels balanced, cheerful and overall more lively, she says.
By the way, she is doing something good for her health and spirit.
Singen is a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler from the German seniors league.
Most seniors sing in the choir and share with peers the joy of the music, describing Hackler.
Through regular meetings, seniors can build and maintain social contacts.
Social and family structures are often solved at age, and a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "Speak out and organize to leave on the other and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of association."
Singing can be exhausting in the positive sense, says Hackler.
This is because seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.
If you ask your lungs on a regular basis, you can't get it out of the pusts.
Even if it's about to get the sound of voice in the age, singing is an optimal hobby.
On older people, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Labour community of seniors organizations.
In older generations, the common singing had a much higher value, it belonged to everyday life, both at school and in leisure, she explained.
Lenz often observes that the singing or listening of songs to older people awakens many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.
Through song lyrics and especially melodies, even dementia-torn people are suffering from long-standing events.
In the case of singing, a special performance is also required.
At the same time, focusing on their own voice and on a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - that's a great cognitive challenge.
Even older people who live alone are not only focusing on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition given by the singing in the choir, says Hackler.
An enthusiastic audience is a great compliment.
Self-esteem is also growing by singing in the choir.
To show itself: If I'm long for something to eat, I'll be better and wake up beyond me - this experience strengthens.
There are enough reasons to start singing.
Who wants to try a new hobby shouldn't hesitate - even if he thinks little talent, advises Lenz.
You are not alone - at least 50 people - who are listening to them when they go out?
Looking for the matching offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.
If someone is out of the audience in a seniors choir, you can easily join.
Many cities also offer views over the choirs in the surrounding area.
If you want to sing in a church choir, you can go straight to the village or church.
Many seniors can be found via the internet.
If you do not have access to the Internet, you can ask the family, friends or neighbours for help with the Internet.
If you want to sing, you should join a choir.
Singing does the soul well and has something liberalized - that applies to every age.
