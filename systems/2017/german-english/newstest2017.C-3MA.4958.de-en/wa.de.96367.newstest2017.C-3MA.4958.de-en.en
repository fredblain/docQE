Olympic 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
Blurring: Due to a positive test of doping, Adrian Zielinski from Poland should not start in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympics are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.
A learned athlete would have won almost a medal.
Before the seventh race day, the first official doping cases have become known to the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.
The Chinese swimming in Chen Xinyi, 3000-meter-impeachment helicopter Silvera Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Polish-born winner Adrian Zielinski were positively tested and excluded in Brazil - immediately before the start of the already critical athletics competitions came to light.
In Chen last Sunday, Diureticum Hydrochlorothiazid had already been proven to be used as a mascot for doping substances.
The International Sports Court CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympics on Friday afternoon.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old had the fourth place in the final over 100 m butterfly, only 0.09 seconds missed by the bronze medal.
On Friday, Chen would have to take part in the proceedings over 50 metres of freedom.
Chen has requested the opening of the B sample and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
The national association takes the matter "very serious and demands of Chen full cooperation in investigations," Xinhua said from a notice: "We will work with the International Sports Tribunal CAS and will accept the verdict."
For the first time in history is no longer the IOC, but the CAS for the sanctioning of athletes with positive cases.
Also in the night of Rio, news about the positive rehearsal at Danekowa, the 33-year-old went into the offensive.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," this was "an incredible shock," she told the Bulgarian TV broadcaster BNT.
She was innocent, "the only explanation could be food supplements," the athletic said.
According to the report, the banned substance is supposed to act as an EPO.
Danekowa has been provisionally suspended, according to BNT.
Bulgaria's Prime Minister Bojko Borissow immediately spoke to the athlete with criticism.
"I don't understand why athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said: "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been ruled out."
For example, all the figures from the chronic dysfunctional nation must not take part in Rio.
On Friday it was also known as the "Adrian Zielinski," the London Olympic champion in class up to 85 kg, as his brother Tomasz had been tested positive for the anabolic steroid Nandroll three days earlier.
Both deny taking, but both must not start in class up to 94 kg.
Prior to the launch of athletics, the Danekowa case is another heavy blow to the reputation of the entire sport.
The International Federation of IAAF had banned the entire Russian team until an exception because of systematic doping, including the LÃ¤ufernation Kenya in Rio many bad news.
In the swimming sport, in addition, the earlier offences in China also made a difference between athletes.
So the Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang.
"Sun Yang pinkelt purple."
"If I see the podium above 200 m of freedom, I want to pass," Lourt said in the French radio.
Sun was also at the heart of a clash with Australia's Mack Horton.
"I don't have time and no respect for doping fraudsters," he said.
Sun was positively tested in 2014 with the Chinese championships, but had to leave only a three-month lock.
