Woman overrides on Swiss highway
The victim was in the middle of the night on the highway.
Police are calling for witnesses after a woman was overturned on a highway in the early hours of Thursday at a suspected suicide of several vehicles.
The incident happened on the A1 in the vicinity of Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.
A woman placed himself in the dark "in an act of desperation" on the street and was hit by several cars, police said in Vaud.
It is obvious that a silence in the age of 49, which was overturned by several vehicles, including a load car, wanted to kill himself.
She still died on the ground.
Several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, said police urging them and any witnesses of the incident to report.
It has opened an investigation procedure, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, shared Gilles Hofstetter to Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed.
Was a clash avoidable?
That's something the prosecutor has to decide, "Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases over the past five years show drivers will not be held responsible.
In each of the two cases - where one person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that motorists should not assume that a pedestrian was on the motorway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper said.
Last year, a policeman was acquitted of the negligent killing after driving a man and killed, who was in August 2014 a night on the A1 near Payerne.
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and has been left unconscious on the street.
The court found that the policeman -- who had responded to a emergency call -- drove on a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a "perfectly exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone who has further information on the incident on Thursday in the vicinity of Morges should report to police under the case number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
