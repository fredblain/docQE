The Canadian broadcaster CBC had to apologise after one of his commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimming woman "like Muef went off" and during the race like "a pig died."
Commentator Byron MacDonalds thought his microphone was switched off when he was to give his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m free-room floor.
Macdonald, who had been picked up to the CBS's commentator team to give more "color," could be heard saying: "This little 14-year-old Chesin has lost the connection, baby."
To get up, walked out like Muef, died like a pig.
Thank you.
Chinese swimming in Ai Yanhan, 14, swung the second stage of swimming-board 1: 57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck, which allowed Canadians to close the gap to China.
Viewers across Canada responded quickly online after being shot by the tone and language
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Hat the CBC commentator just said that the 14-year-old swimming woman from China was" like a pig "???
The Idiot didn't train that they were still on broadcast. "
Ai Yanhan from China was described as "this little 14-year-old Chesin has lost, baby."

The network also apologized quickly and issued a notice.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast.
We were quickly apologized to our viewers on the broadcast and our follow-up in social media yesterday night.
To make one thing clear, Byron's comments related to the performance of the swimming woman and not to her as a person.
Yet they were inappropriate and an unfortunate wording.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized in the broadcast and attempted to justify his comment, saying it was not his intention to be designed as a personal attack.
"I would like to take a moment to apologise for the comment that I made after the women's floppies in the CBC Olympics.
"I have focused on the performance of the swimming woman and not on her as a person."
Of course, no disrespect was intended and I am very sorry. "
