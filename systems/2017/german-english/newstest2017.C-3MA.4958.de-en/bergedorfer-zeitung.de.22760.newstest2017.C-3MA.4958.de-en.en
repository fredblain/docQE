Hard to hurt - man stung to his ex-girlfriend
A man has attacked and severely injured his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg.
As the police said yesterday, the 50-year-old had the key to the apartment to pick up his personal things.
Instead, the cultured offender crushed the clothes of his ex-girlfriend.
When this came into the apartment, he sat on it twice.
The 44-year-old was injured at hand and on the body.
Police were able to arrest the perpetrator.
While the 50-year-old destroyed the clothes of his ex-girlfriend, he called his mother.
This was the alarm with his sister.
Together with her lifeline, the 45-year-old wanted to reassure her brother.
She could not move him to leave the apartment.
That is why she went out of the house with her lifeline.
On the road, they met the man's ex-life threat.
When the two women revisited the apartment, the 50-year-old had his sister to the side and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
