Better traffic flow on the motorway
It is regularly on the bypass.
But that is to change: The process of redress will be extended.
This is good news for all drivers who are on the road to the road on the road line every night when driving through the motorway (A 43).
In the area between the Hammer Straße and the departure Weseler Straße, the German road construction company extends the legal machine by 700 metres.
Motorists can enter directly from the Hammer Strasse to the right.
The big advantage: Traffic is becoming more early on, improving the overall process on the multi-way section of the Parkway 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU group in the district representation of Münster-West.
The train ride on the Zugern nerves the motorists especially between 17 and 19.
From the beginning of the 19th century, the bridge over the Albersworth road and sometimes beyond.
The reason is the Nadelör on the B 51 shortly before the departure Weseler Straße.
From here, traffic is only diverted via the motorway bridge.
The second track had to be rebuilt well in three-quarters.
The reason: Static calculations have shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary capacity to absorb heavy traffic in particular.
As long as this bottleneck and the related performance of this bottleneck will continue, the local authority cannot say.
The bridge has an official rest until 2034.
For the extension of the legal system, the local authorities have deliberately chosen the weaker than expected time in the school holidays because they are expected to be subject to a disability.
Traffic will be handed over to the building site on Tuesday and Wednesday.
