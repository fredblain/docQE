Patrick Roy joins the Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned as coach and vice president Of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, leading to too little co-determination in the team's decision-making process.
Alternatively-President / General Manager of Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the club will be looking for a new coach immediately.
"Over the past three years, I have met my duties as chief trainer and Vice President Of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and honesty," the 50-year-old Roy said in an opinion.
Over the summer I have been thinking a lot about how I could improve this team to give him more depth, that it needs and to bring it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the trainer and vice president of hockey operations needs to be perfectly aligned to the organisation.
He must also have a right of co-determination in decisions that influence the team's performance.
These conditions are not currently being met.
Sakic, who had hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick has informed me today about this decision," Sakic said.
We value all that he has done for our organisation and wish him the best for the future.
Roy became the winner of the League's best coach during his debut season at the Avalanche in 2013-14.
He led the club to 112 points and on the first place in Central Vision, but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the Playoffs of Minnesota and missed out in each of the last two years the afterseason.
The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 mark in the 2015-16 season and fell behind the Wild for a second wildcard spot in the Western Conference by five points.
As Hall of Fame Torwart won Roy four Stanley Cups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
