Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephale: 'It gets better'
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But like the least of his contemporaries, Edmund microcephale, the result of a genetic disorder, about which his mother Elizabeth Picciuto did nothing during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was that I did not do that.
I do not.
I did not admit it.
What's not true -- of course, it's been up to it, "she said.
Her husband Vincent and her were told that Edmund will never be able to recognize her and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far that they suggested institutionalising it.
"My first answer to that was' I didn't know that people still do, '" explained Picciuto.
Edmund can run through a salary.
Edmund could neither sit nor craved until his third year of life and he still cannot speak.
But he is making slow progress.
He can run with support and cycling.
He also loves playing and singing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund for "Please call me something before"
"We bring it to him," told Picciuto CBS News.
But it is not a typical sign language -- says it.
Microcephale has a variety of causes: Genetic like at Edmund and infections with viruses such as measles or the Zikavirus during pregnancy.
Symptoms and predictions may vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it will affect the lives of those affected by the Zikavius.
Picciuto recalls the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I always asked what will happen?
What will happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven't been asking for a long time because I don't expect anyone to really tell me.
But Picciuto has had a hopeful advice for mothers of babies with birth damage caused by the Zikavirus.
It's getting better.
You know that it will be better for you.
You'll love your kid and your kid will love you.
