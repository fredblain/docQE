How to protect Krav Maga from gun attacks
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make him a little safer for you.
We were talking to Ron Mizrachi, a grandmaster of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance.
Regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from the back, this video shows you how to turn around for your robber.
If you get closer to you, then you should first turn around, so you can see your attacker and "get out of the rubble," says Mizrachi.
Then take the gun between your front and your shoulder before hitting it with your free elbow.
Then beat him to the Least and turn it into the Least, while the attacker stirs up against pain, throwing the weapon out of his hands.
At attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the gunpoint, take the gun and turn it, so the attacker can't shoot.
At the same time, shift the weight to the weapon and beat the attacker to the chest, then turn the gun out of his handle before moving backwards and targeting the weapon.
Sounds difficult?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi imagines.
But remember that when you smoke, it's safest to pass your money - unless you're a Krav Maga Grand Master.
