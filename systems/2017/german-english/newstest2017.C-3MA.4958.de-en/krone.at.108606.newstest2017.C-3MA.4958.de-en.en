Bomb terror in Thailand - Austrians hurt - multiple dead
The Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, said Foreign Ministry spokesman Thomas Schn√∂ll, Friday morning.
She had suffered cuts and was treated in hospital, but had already been able to leave it again.
Her home trip was scheduled for early September.
Whether from the other explosions on the holiday island of Phuket and in the southern towns of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon also affected Austrian citizens, it is still unclear.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities.
Hua Hin, located about 200 miles south of the capital Bangkok, was initially exploding two bombs on Thursday night.
According to police, a Thailand was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrians, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
Friday morning, two pitfalls were again high, and another man was killed.
A bomb explosion was also reported in the morning.
A taxi driver was injured in the shooting near the nearby town of Patong.
In Surat Thani on the southeast coast of the country, then another bomb exploded, killing a municipal employee.
The assaults were put into the air, according to the authorities in a floral beets before the coast police moved to the air.
Finally, detectives in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast and Chumphon on the south-east coast claimed several injured.
A connection with the explosions in Hua Hin said it was.
"The bomb attacks bear the same handwriting," said Army director Danai Kritmethavee Friday morning.
"We expect it to be a coordinated attack."
It is too early to comment on possible motives - but probably the actions of Muslim rebels.
Thai media, too, wanted to identify a pattern typical for the bombing of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
Thai police, on the other hand, said the attacks were not linked to the Islamist insurgency or international terrorism.
"That's just local sabotage, which is limited to limited areas and provinces," a spokesman said in Bangkok.
Rather, the bombs of opponents of the ruling military junta have been laid down.
The authorities would have received intelligence advice on imminent attacks in the South of the country in the past few days - but they were not informed about the exact timing and locations.
It is still unclear what group behind the attacks.
Police instructed their officials across the country to strengthen security around important government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and amusement areas.
There are still smaller bombings in Thailand, but they are mostly not against tourists.
In Hua Hin, a palace was used over the years by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
The Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on its homepage, is strongly recommending that the Thai security authorities be informed.
High security risk (3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihen and its surroundings.
After clashes between security forces and Muslim populations, they are not going to travel to these provinces.
Increased security (level 2) for the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday were few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.
It also gives strong influence to the military in the years to come.
Junta boss and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-lo-cha said the bombs had been an attempt to stifle chaos, while moving towards stability, improving the economic situation and tourism.
The military unta, which took power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, is helping itself to restore stability and order.
However, the military has not been able to control Muslim rebels in the far south of the country.
More than 6500 people have already been killed in the conflict.
Barely a year ago, in Bangkok, an attack on a popular Hindu shrine was killed 20 people - most of them foreign tourists.
It was the bloodiest attack of the country's younger history.
