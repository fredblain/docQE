Traveller Ian Wright shouted for a travel guide his tongue at the dirtiest places in Europe
A British traveller withdrew his immune system and diggereflex of serious scrutiny - by sending out some of Europe's dirtiest and ecclesious places.
The moderator and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, shouted his course on a Euro-shone, a gunman on Piccadilly Circus, a towing of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to demonstrate the resilience of his immune system.
Before taking any object, he used a luminometer to stand up and to show what he will get.
But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprise results to light.
The idea to sniff off the flip button of a tractor that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely abortive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen cupboard.
On his journey through Europe, Commissioner Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of Darmbakteries and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he left, more than a bad taste in the mouth.
Mr Wright was known to try to test the resistance of his intestine by taking advantage of the world and dreaming about it.
From public change to train stations to sprubs of toilets, the task put his immune system definitely under a sample
In the film he told: "Already as a kid I was relatively unconcerned about what my health concerns and I put all possible things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."
In the film, he became fair to his reputation.
The only thing he opposed was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His sampling showed a luminometer of more than 4000 units.
Compared to this, the luminometer is freshly washed hands less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet he refused to leak after its luminometers were more than 4000 units, while freshly washed hands were one of less than 60
Mr Wright and the Finnish producer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lockhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the bacterium's number in different locations such as the bathroom
In the film, he says: "That comes close to the worst I've got in a toilet."
There is nothing more harmful than that!
I am not going to see anything here because it is outrageous.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.
The company supplies Mr Wright with Valio Karrius, which includes both dairy and Vitamin C and D to support the promotion of Darmbakteries and the immune system.
Valios senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We wanted to really offer consumers something new.
Something that is fascinating to see and also explains the benefits of probiotics.
We caused crazy Brainstorms, which ended up saying that we told "Let Us Ian call."
They claim the interest in colorectal health becomes a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a wider context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of colorectal health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in colorectal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we have been able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!
Tom HAKALA, who led the film's director, added: "Let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had caught some of the things I instructed him to lick, as the eclectic Russian toilet shown in the film."
Of course, there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to sniff them and others where this was quite difficult.
I'm glad we have included some of these dirty leaks on film. "
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of all respondents, particularly with the well-being of Magen and Darm and 58 percent, said that at least they occasionally use products containing accompanying dairy bacteria.
