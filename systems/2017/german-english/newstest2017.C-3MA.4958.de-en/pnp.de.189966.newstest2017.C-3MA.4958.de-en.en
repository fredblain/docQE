Construction ground in double pack
At the recent meeting, the Council focused on issues surrounding buildings.
With relief, the panel adopted the announcement by Mayor Robert Putz that "finally, the marketing of recently designated residential areas can begin."
After settling the plots of land, parenting and finishing points and the applications for surveying, the sale of the plots in the residential areas "road path" and "Schönau-West" (Binderstraße - Section 1) to interested parties is nothing more.
The community centre is convinced that the bunches in the rural and quiet residential community of Schönau are also addressing young families and senior citizens.
As it was said, builders can immediately report to the town hall, over the awarding of the plots, the common council is expected to discuss in its September meeting.
In order to be able to respond to requests for further business activity, linked to job creation, the Community Council decided to amend the set-aside plan only in the spring of this year.
For example, in the area of sub-timescales, the designated industrial area is expanded to include two parts of the road 2112.
