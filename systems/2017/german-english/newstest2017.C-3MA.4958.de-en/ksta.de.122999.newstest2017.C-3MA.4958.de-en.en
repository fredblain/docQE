Rio 2016: ROBEL Kiros Habite becomes internet hip
The Olympic Games or world records do not always determine the headlines at the Olympics.
This shows the bold appearance of ROBEL Kiros Habte during the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.
In the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimsuit from Ethiopia was so slow that he was temporarily unable to see the TV pictures.
He simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut was selected.
In social networks, Habte was subsequently used to go viral.
In fact, the 24-year-old finished with a delay of 48 seconds and ranked 59th place of 59 starter.
It was rather his not just athletic figure, which attracted attention from the international media.
Why the 24-year-old still participates in the Olympics?
The Ethiopians received a special ruling from the international pool.
This will be distributed to make swimming in under-represented countries known.
As the majority of athletes run, Habte wanted to do something else.
Preparation is all: ROBEL Kiros Habite is ready for the big race.
Quickly made the first nickname the round.
Some media called him "ROBEL of the whale."
In addition to a "welfare belly," the English tabloid "The Sun" made it funny.
His time, he suggested just one minute and nearly five seconds over the 100 meters of freedom, played no part.
Comparisons with Eric the Eel were also drawn.
At the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Eric Moussambani's run for median attention.
An unforgettable experience was the appearance of the swimming pool of Equatorial Guinea, when he had to compete alone in a pre-run of 100 metres.
He was fired at the time.
The 22-year-old learned to swim just eight months before Olympia and had never finished so long before the contest.
