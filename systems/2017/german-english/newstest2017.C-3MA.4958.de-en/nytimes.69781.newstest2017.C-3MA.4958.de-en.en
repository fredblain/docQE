The US wins fourth match in women's field hockey, a showdown with Britain faces
One day after she had shot three gates during a six-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two gates for the women's field-hopping team in a match on Thursday against India that Americans won 3-0.
Five goals in two games should actually be a memorable achievement, but Bam (27) said she could not remember that ever.
"I have no idea," she said.
I am not one of the people who kept their doors in mind.
But they know: The Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic race, and they are in their group with the Britons on the first place, which remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan.
Britain and the United States will meet in the final round of the first round on Saturday.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place.
The first burst will be a little longer off the road that will lead the other group.
Whatever the game on Saturday, the Americans have caused a surprise agony, four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 seats.
BAM was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania on, and had the first time with three years a hockey sleigh in hands (her two older sisters played the sport at the Drexel University), with 16 years she became a national player in the US, the youngest in the team's history.
She missed the Olympics in 2008 as she couldn't qualify for the box.
Then came the year 2012, where she and her team went wrong.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the national team and thus began to turn things to better.
"A cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.
We did not have the working sum in London that we now have.
We have been able to take the helm completely.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the torrents in the first half of the game with a backlash from the close range.
India had gone into the game without a win in the tournament, but the team showed surprisingly tough and held the game from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into her hands.
She performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and invited the ball to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.
The Shutout was the first of all of the tournament for the United States, Jackie Briggs, which has so far had a gate in each of the previous games.
She's got a run.
Just like Bam.
"We're in a good position," said Parnham, but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday.
