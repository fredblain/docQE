Jennifer Aniston: I'll always put in drawer
Jennifer Aniston doesn't have to be perfect or successful.
That's what the Hollywood Star has clearly made clear in an interview now.
"I'll always be put in drawers or glued to the outside label, which, with me and the reality, have little to do."
"I do not want to be perfect and successful."
"To be honest, these things are rather shouting."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh about it as "Miss Perfect," as explained in the current "Cosmopolitan."
The actress spends her time at home, prem TV with loser Dutch and Mexican food, it is said in the magazine.
To the White House, they put the question after the children's wish: "We women don't have to be married or have children to be perfect," the Hollywood Star said.
In her new film, "Mother's Day - Love is not a children's game" is Aniston to see as an all-inclusive mother of two sons.
The film runs with us from August 25.
