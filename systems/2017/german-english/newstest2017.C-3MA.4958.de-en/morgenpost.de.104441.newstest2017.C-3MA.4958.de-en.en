Post rises in trade with electric transporters
An electric delivery vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the pig is apparently large.
The post plans to sell its electric car StreetScooter as well.
Soon, the Group intends to launch the trade in transport.
The post will also offer its electric transport vans on the free machine from next year.
"We want to get into the sale to third parties," said a post spokesman on Friday.
The company has been checking for months whether to sell its self-developed streetscooters, with the letters and packs, to sell to other farms too.
Post-chief executive JÃ¼rgen Gerdes had said there are still questions of succession, such as by craftsmen.
According to the news magazine "Der Spiegel" the Bonner Group intends to enter the mass production of vehicles shortly.
In the post-own factory, the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars a year and layer.
Gerdes had announced that the Group would significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and would be able to rapidly switch to environmentally friendly vehicles.
"We're going to make a very, very robust move towards 2020," he said in late July.
I can imagine that we are clearing the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on Germany's roads since 2014.
