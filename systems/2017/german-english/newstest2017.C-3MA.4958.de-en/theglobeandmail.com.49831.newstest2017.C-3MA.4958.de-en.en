Adblock Plus, Facebook in the "Katz-and Mehel" about ad blocking
For companies that are making money with online advertising, one of the software manufacturers tries to circumvent the ad blocking system, a "cat and mouse game."
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block display lockouts on its desktop side, released Adblock Plus posted a blogpost, noting that users could update their filters in the program to block again advertising in the social network.
On Tuesday, Facebook shared that its desktop side would change coding as regards its advertising show, to make it more difficult to identify which part of the site is advertising.
But Adblock announced that it found a new way to circumvent the new codes.
In a blogpost, Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of Hin-and-Her fight between the Anzealous Open Source community and the reunions has already been underway since the invention of display lookers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution.
The fact that the world's biggest social media company has been in the fight is a strong indication of how worrying the industry has become.
Worldwide, according to a study from the last year of Pagefair and Adobe about 200 million people ad loosers; almost four times so much in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile advertising makes up 84 percent of advertising revenue.
The company has it on display blockages on Desktop PCs, as mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebooks mobile app for the social network and Instagram, shared a spokesman.
Advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficient large share of revenue, so Facebook makes the investment of such a step as rewarding.
On Tuesday, Facebook shared that it would update its "display reference tool" to have people more control over their targeted advertising.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblocks would be worrying about new filters because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising.
"For users, this is not a positive experience, so we plan to address the problem," shared a spokesman for Facebook in an email message.
Ad blockers are a stunned tool, which is why we have focused instead on developing tools such as ad Preferences to put more control into people's hands.
