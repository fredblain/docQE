Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That is what I would like to present under the Women's Olympian Mission in Turnen and that is more than a reason.
First of all, I have been in every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.
And secondly: This team has three stars, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Laurie "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin color.
The structure of this crew, the Aly Raisman, which is JÃ¼din and Madison Kocian, who is a Catholic, makes every proud.
This team finally reflects the US.
It has consolidated the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
In the last four years, the number one among female athletes was an Afro-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.
That shows strength.
At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic winner and America.
Now the world has been able to witness the incredible performance of the three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected, yet masterful gymastic routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American, who won for an individual multi-match event for women gold.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We are seeing the top of this sport, but so, in the rest of the country, tournament classes are not.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie beat all the same way as Aly and Madison to create it to the Olympic team.
They are the "Last Five" because the next Olympiad will have only four runners in the team, and this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainee.
But the reality is that Turnen is a more expensive sport and that Turner is primarily in private tournaments maintained by parents who will pay for the training, instruction, travel, competition and hotel costs (for the coaches and their visitors and families).
The majority of these tournaments lie in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.
In these clubs, the Turner receives their entire training and that is a costly and long-term commitment to the families.
Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started with the turf.
We need to allow the municipalities of Aug.
I set up my Turn Foundation of 20 years.
At my events, we have offered a free and affordable tower in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youngsters (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international.
In September we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to provide the youth of high-quality turners who will earn the opportunity to learn and profit from this fantastic Olympic sport.
Turnen develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body and hard work, discipline and consistency for the mind.
This combination offers life-long benefits for health and for educational and professional success.
It is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to interest in the Turnen and that is great.
It is so important to take part in sport, especially for girls.
This is so exciting.
Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this genuine portrayal of "Girl Power" by the Holen of the Olympic team golds and thanks to her so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
