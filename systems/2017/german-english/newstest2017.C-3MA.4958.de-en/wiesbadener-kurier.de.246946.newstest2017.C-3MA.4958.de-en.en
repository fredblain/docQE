Airline is not liable: Fall on passenger bridge
An airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
Because a liability can only be found on dangers typical of the air transport, the Oberland Court argued in DÃ¼sseldorf (Az.: 18 U 124 / 14).
The plaintiff had broken a knee disc in the fall.
However, the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general living risk, so the dish said.
The airline had to pay the man no compensation.
