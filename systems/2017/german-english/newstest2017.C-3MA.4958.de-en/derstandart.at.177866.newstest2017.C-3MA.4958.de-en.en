Ma Long in a own league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympian.
The 27-year-old defeated his compatriot and "title defender" Zhang Joke 4: 0 (12,5,4.4) in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday.
For the first time, the World Cup first took the "Golden Grand Slam" with successes at World Cup, World Cup, World Tour Final Tournament and the Olympia Games.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
The two Chinese, as expected, have been in the final game and have made the title.
It was clear that, for the third time in a row, a Chinese would pick the single title in the sign of the five rings.
Recent non-Chinese on top Olympic stairs was the former SVS-NÖ-legionaire Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left on the plate alone, between the sentences and at times-outs they had no coaches in themselves.
They withdrew to the gallery and left their knacks in fair competition alone.
"I played for my country."
"In the final game I play for myself," Zhang said.
After the partie posed gold and silver medal winners with the China flag.
The match itself was unexpectedly biased.
Ma had really struggled with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first set.
After that, he made the pace at the plate and left Zhang as a whole.
By virtue of Ma's superiority, it did not elaborate the expected match.
But nevertheless, there was enough to see breathtaking ballots.
Mizutani won the game for bronze against the 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4: 1.
In his quarter-finals against Germany's Europaiste Dimitrij Ovtcharov, the White Shrine had a ripenny injury, he was in medical treatment afterwards, had to "end" with Blech.
The Swedes Jan-Ove Waldner (38 / 2004) and Jörgen Persson (42 / 2008) were in similarly high table tennis Olympic.
