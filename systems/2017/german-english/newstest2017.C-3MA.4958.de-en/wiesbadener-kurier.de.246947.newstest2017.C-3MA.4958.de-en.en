Disease: When the organiser pays
Once you have visited the hotel, you will be able to get back if the cause of the disease can be found in the hotel.
However, this is only the case if more than ten per cent of guests have proven the same symptoms.
In the missed case, a family on the second day of their door to Turkey was severely affected by confusion and destruction.
She spent almost the entire holiday in the room.
Her illness caused holidaymakers to return to a defective treatment plant that allegedly polluted sea water.
The family was of the opinion that the journey was deficient - and against the organiser.
In court, the plaintiffs had no success.
The waste water treatment plant was indeed defective.
However, the organiser did not return to it until late.
He had to assume that the sea water was fine.
So he did not violate his information obligations, so the verdict.
No contamination has been found in the samples of the water.
The illness of several hotel guests - possibly by contagion - belonged to the general life risk.
Of 691 guests were only 38.
