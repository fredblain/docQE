Dead at bombs attack: He was the hero of Aleppo
He put his own life at risk of helping others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar devoted his life to the people in Syria.
He risked everything to save others.
Now the 30-year-old has died in an Assad regime's assaults attack.
Omar was a member of the White Helmets, a civil protection group which, according to the Bild newspaper so far, saved nearly 60,000 people.
2900 volunteers put their own lives at risk to attract people from broken houses and to provide first aid in the war area.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the group's face: A video of the civil protector that showed him at an 11-hour rescue of a baby out of the rubble of a house, walked around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrians a shining symbol of the war.
As a hero, however, he has never seen himself, saying "for me that's the real jihad."
"When I'm dying to save life, I think God sees me a martyr."
Just before Omar himself fell victim, he had spoken in a video about the last bombing raids in Syria.
The helicopter rescued four assaults over the Altadia district, one was filled with chlorine gas.
A woman and two children died, seven people suffer from breath.
"We are now eliminating the toxic remains of the bomb, so that they do not play children," the picture quoted his last words before he died.
The Assad regime's deadly bomb had to hit terrorists.
