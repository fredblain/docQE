<seg id="2">A 28-year-old Cook, who recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in the stairwell of a local shopping centre.</seg>
<seg id="3">The victim's brother said he could not imagine anyone who would want to harm him, "at last he went uphill again."</seg>
<seg id="4">The corpse, found on Wednesday morning at Westfield Mall, was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, who shared the forensic department in San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="5">The San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as murder and that the investigation was underway.</seg>
<seg id="6">The brother of the victim, Louis Galicia, told the ABS transmitter KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who used to work as a cook in Boston, had six months ago his dream job as a chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco managed.</seg>
<seg id="7">A spokesman for the Sons & Daughters said that they were "shocked and devastated by his death".</seg>
<seg id="8">"We are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss him painfully," said the spokesman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Our thoughts and condolences are in this difficult time with Frank's family and friends.</seg>
<seg id="10">Louis Galicia stated that Frank initially lived in hostels, but that "things went uphill for him".</seg>
<seg id="11">"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend," shared Louis Garcia KGO with.</seg>
<seg id="12">Louis Galicia said he could not imagine anyone who would want to harm his younger brother.</seg>
<seg id="13">He was a friendly person with a big heart.</seg>
<seg id="14">To combine his way with his family was to always cook us something, to prepare dinner, "said Louis Galicia.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never wanted to take part in any kind of altercation.</seg>
<seg id="16">He was the brother who swam with the stream.</seg>
<seg id="17">"With everything that goes wrong in the world, he was this uncut diamond that shone brightly every day," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone who has information on the case will be asked to call the SFPD phone number at 415-575-4444.</seg>

<seg id="2">Jennifer Aniston doesn't always have to be perfect or successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is what the Hollywood star made clear in an interview now.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I am always stuck in drawers or I get stuck by the outside label, which have little to do with me and the reality."</seg>
<seg id="5">"I myself have no desire to be always perfect and successful."</seg>
<seg id="6">"Honestly, these things are more like me."</seg>

<seg id="1">Golfer Langer gets the sports pyramid</seg>
<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and some colleagues looked for a bit of variety with a horseback ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Chio: "Golden Sport Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">After a few minutes the horses remembered their evening, they hunted at the fast gallop home to the feed troughs.</seg>
<seg id="7">One kilometer at this pace, I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It was not a good experience," says Langer.</seg>
<seg id="9">And then the riding career ended again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday was Germany's best golfer of all time-101 tournament wins-again close to horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He let himself be led with his family over the plant of the ALRV, on a horse he did not even swing for photographic purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Langer was the first time in Aachen and thus also at the Chio.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports aid handed over the Golden Sport pyramid to the man from Oberhausen in the context of a small gala.</seg>
<seg id="15">The likeable athlete does not lack any awards.</seg>
<seg id="16">Federal Cross of Merit, silver Laurel Leaf, Champions Tour player of the year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen has already knighted him.</seg>
<seg id="18">Langer is the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Aachen he met the first winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="20">"This award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it is awarded not only for sporting successes, but also for social commitment".</seg>
<seg id="21">For decades, long has been promoting young people.</seg>
<seg id="22">And so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros equal.</seg>
<seg id="23">With 15 other outstanding athletes, the double US Masterssieger was recorded on Saturday in the "Hall of Fame of German sports".</seg>
<seg id="24">Among the excellent are the light athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the fencers Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the rower Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob Driver Meinhard, the judoka Frank Wieneke, the equestrian Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumously the Handballer Erhard Wunderlich.</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sports legends had come to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="26">After the official part, the illustrious company moved to the Spring Stadium, where the Lavazza prize ran.</seg>
<seg id="27">Bernhard Langer kept distance to the great animals.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton's and Trump's economic policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent the trade agreement TTP-that is what both Clinton and Trump want.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential candidates disagree on tax and energy policy and on a fundamental issue.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">The, about the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns against how the state can harm the economy-with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself, by contrast, would be quite different, Trump says.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will drive back regulations massively, and he makes up for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates-for private individuals and for businesses.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton, on the other hand, says: The state has to perform certain tasks, it has to open up disadvantaged opportunities and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore, the taxes would be increased for the wealthy, she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In which must be invested, Trump and Clinton say almost the same word.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Democratic candidate is announcing the biggest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure are classical democratic politics and are strictly rejected by the Republican state-critical Teaparty wing.</seg>
<seg id="16">In other words, Trump could still have party-internal discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are clearer.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and boost coal production in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production is also to be possible in protected areas, the Paris climate Protection agreement intends to cancel.</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton, on the other hand, wants to use its investment programme to explicitly expand renewable energies and demand: "A country will become the superpower of clean energies and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"It will probably be either China, Germany or America-I want it to be us."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in terms of infrastructure, but also in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the Trans-Pacific trade agreement, do not want to sign either.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, however, both do not want to isolate the US from international trade-but simply to better protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They're supposed to pay better, too, calls for Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger reward.</seg>
<seg id="27">He wants to raise them to 15 dollars an hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do in this question is not entirely clear: once he says: The minimum wage must go up, then he says he should not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be more about the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand is Trump, which wants to relieve the economy and the citizens in order to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics believe that the budget deficit would only be greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton is at least asking the rich to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.</seg>

<seg id="1">Escape: "Every woman who has fled has experience of sexual violence"</seg>
<seg id="2">Sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone, almost to everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="3">When you arrive in Germany, you are often traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen sit four women.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each one has a baby that is at most one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son in the arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks curiously into the room with big eyes.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother stares at the table top.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until she notices she's being watched.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles briefly and kisses the little girl.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene looks normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">She is an area managing director of Condrobs, a supporter of social services in Bavaria, and deals with the issue of women on the run.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen have fled.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralized shelters for single-fled women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January, Condrobs set up the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's assistance.</seg>
<seg id="18">Recently it was officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sixty people live there-about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are no men-even as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a security guard outside the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"It is not exaggerated to say that every woman who arrives here has made experiences of sexual violence on her flight," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they are threatened with torture or death, or because their families send them as hopefuls to Europe," she says.</seg>
<seg id="24">In women, there are other reasons for escape: "Many secretly steal from it because they see no other way out."</seg>
<seg id="25">In their homeland, they have experience of sexual violence, forced marriages, honor killings, slavery or forced prostitution.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is driving them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run this goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"For example, for a bottle of water, tugs demand a sexual act is not a rarity," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">Who believe that the end, as soon as they arrive in Germany, is mistaken, says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here too, single women in refugee shelters would often be regarded as inferior and at worst abused.</seg>
<seg id="32">This leads to the fact that about 90 percent of the women living in the accommodation in the north of Munich are traumatized, she appreciates.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Some of the children have certainly not voluntarily emerged".</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so accustomed to saying nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Or they do not dare to speak openly about what has been experienced, because the shame is too great".</seg>
<seg id="36">Since they often do not know how to help, they need more accommodation just for them, asks Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for accommodating refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">The question of whether you know of a similar project as in Munich in your area of competence answers some with No.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the Oberpfalz and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in government housing.</seg>
<seg id="40">Even in Swabia, women who have fled alone are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, government spokesman.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Upper Bavaria, under-and Middle Franconia there are in some common accommodation floors or own houses only for single women and their children.</seg>
<seg id="42">The exception is Lower Bavaria, where there are two central accommodation exclusively for women.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Committee on Women's Rights and gender equality in the European Parliament also calls for men to be accommodated separately.</seg>
<seg id="44">In a study published for the Committee, it says: "It is very important that men and women be accommodated separately."</seg>
<seg id="45">"If the privacy is lacking or if men and women are accommodated together, there may be continual violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">Especially the washrooms should be separate and easily accessible for women, is in the study.</seg>
<seg id="47">How much the women feel this need for protection can be seen in the crowds that exist on the house in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Since we've been around, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="49">You could easily open a second house.</seg>

<seg id="2">Assistant doctors have called on their union to approve new industrial action in their disputes regarding a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has asked its entire council to approve more industrial action from the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC said that minister failed would have to deal with the concerns about the treaty.</seg>
<seg id="5">In July, assistant doctors and medical students voted on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a letter to the members who was published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the chairman of JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government would have remained "persistently calm" to problems, which led to the treaty being rejected.</seg>
<seg id="8">She said: "In view of this, the JDC board has voted to reject the proposed new contract completely and to request official renegotiation of all your worries."</seg>
<seg id="9">In response to the silence of the government, the JDC board has today submitted a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA council to approve an ongoing programme of escalating industrial action that begins at the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="10">The disputes led to the fact that assistant doctors were striking six times this year, the first overall failure in the history of the NHS.</seg>
<seg id="11">The head of BMA assistant physicians Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed contractual terms that had been recommended by the BMA.</seg>
<seg id="12">He shared BMA members during the meetings, which took place before the vote by 54,000 assistant doctors and medical students, that the contract was beneficial and should be accepted.</seg>
<seg id="13">After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for doctors in England would be forcibly introduced.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and proclaim an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gilded Hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot resist the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was a handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile worked-and he barely radiated warmth, even for his restrained relationships.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "dear friend" Putin-according to a report, whole five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old levels before the crisis, but would even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have acted as if something bad had never happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">His enthusiasm seemed rather to suggest the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But a sustainable coolness that Putin radiated showed that the head of state of Russia had forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: The launch of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border by Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction at the time was furiously.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara of having fallen into Russia's back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offense was even greater, as it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Rebuilding the trust will be difficult, if not impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media conducted a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">Most seriously, the accusations of senior officials were that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from the illicit trade in Syria in areas controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He vehemently denied this.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan, whom he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could be a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the benefits of a truce are clearly obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan needs first and foremost all the friends he can get after he has been removed from his office in a failed coup last month.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard-in particular the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the state television forecasts cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish imports are allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">A report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows: "Tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry with the West as it considers its reaction to the attempted takeover as a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">In addition, there is the continuing resentment of the snail speed of the EU accession negotiations and Putin-eager to benefit from the cool atmosphere and to reduce Turkey's relationship with the west.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian head of state, in Ankara, certainly won a bonus that he demanded support for the elected authorities after the attempted coup d'état.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow, which has itself a deep-seated fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this splendid palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portray, as an analyst once described, "Alliance of Outsiders": two countries that are in violation of the West and feel badly treated and now ally.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It might be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks both presidents said at the press conference that they had not even touched the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize it.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities-and given the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey fired the Russian fighter jet-it is certainly better that the two heads of state will at least talk again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available to customers outside Scotland</seg>
<seg id="2">According to the chief Executive officer of Bank only, the RBS brand is to be reduced to a back office role.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ross McEwan shared with BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was connected with the bank's global ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bank has since distanced itself, when it almost collapsed and had to be saved eight years ago.</seg>
<seg id="6">During this time, brand strategists have used "RBS" to protect other end users ' financial brands.</seg>
<seg id="7">She supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.</seg>
<seg id="8">But now she has decided to put more national brands in the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.</seg>
<seg id="10">In England and Wales all RSB references, the decentralised headquarters and the stock exchange listing will be changed to NatWest.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are other smaller brands for the retail business that will be more important-Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's military bank.</seg>
<seg id="13">McEwan was interviewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in Inverness-shire.</seg>
<seg id="14">He said to BBC Scotland: "The RSB brand will become our investor brand and the brand under which our employees will be employed, as we are now becoming a bank of brands."</seg>
<seg id="15">When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.</seg>
<seg id="16">I am saying now that we are not pursuing global objectives, but local objectives.</seg>
<seg id="17">Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers under these brands.</seg>
<seg id="18">RBS has already testified that it will not continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the visibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship.</seg>
<seg id="19">"It is time for us to develop into the bank of the brands, because how do we focus on the inside (we asked) to make this a better bank for customers?" said the chief Executive officer.</seg>
<seg id="20">It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and that we would have launched these brands.</seg>
<seg id="21">But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think one will see many changes.</seg>
<seg id="22">We can re-launch these brands, so I think the time has come.</seg>

<seg id="2">Dettori sparkles champagne after a double at Newmarket, which brings him 3,000 ten prizes</seg>
<seg id="3">The jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3000-th British win at Newmarket on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="4">He put on Predilection, which is coached by John Gosden, on his local racetrack with his second win of the night a milestone.</seg>
<seg id="5">The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey who reaches the milestone in the flat race.</seg>
<seg id="6">He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.</seg>
<seg id="7">The three-time winner, Dettori, who won in front of Ghayyar, said, "It's something special."</seg>
<seg id="8">I'm very emotional because my family is here too</seg>
<seg id="9">I am very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot-it's a banal Friday night with 20,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I am relieved and very humble.</seg>
<seg id="12">Dettori picks up the cheers as he brings victory to Predilection</seg>
<seg id="13">Two jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race-jockey Richard Johnson and the retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who achieved more than 4,300 victories in a record breaking career.</seg>
<seg id="14">Lester Piggott, the nine-time Derby winner had 4,493 career wins</seg>
<seg id="15">Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern age and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that few have reached before him.</seg>
<seg id="16">He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight room.</seg>
<seg id="17">He is a fantastic ambassador for races, his enthusiasm and charisma fans have been enthusiastic for years for this sport.</seg>
<seg id="18">I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he would have brought 6,000 winnings if he wasn't just a weekend and big tournament jockey!</seg>
<seg id="19">Frankie has already ridden almost 30 years of winners in the UK, which is great.</seg>
<seg id="20">He has a vibrant personality, which is good for a British race, but beyond that he is an incredible jockey.</seg>
<seg id="21">Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical flying dismount</seg>
<seg id="22">From flying finishes to flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades.</seg>
<seg id="23">It was nerve-wracking.</seg>
<seg id="24">A whole series of big tournament wins, including his famous "Glorious Seven" in 1996 in Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and got a drug ban.</seg>
<seg id="25">Three years ago, he had difficulties at first when he returned from his six-month lock, but he showed an impressive character strength to defy his doubters and return to his best.</seg>
<seg id="26">And he is still far from the end-Dettori has once said that he wants to continue at competitions up to his at least 50 years of age.</seg>

<seg id="5">In an opinion of the Kremlin, it is that Putin, without giving any reason, "ordered the dismissal of Ivanov from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration".</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who has been Ivanov's deputy since 2012, has been appointed as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he graduated from the prestigious state Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the embassy in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin's website it is said (in Russian) that he was later the chief of staff and head of government.</seg>
<seg id="10">He said about his appointment to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the government's most important task to support its work as head of State regarding draft laws and controls to implement its instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Are the smiling faces convincing?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow secret shrouded.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidants for a long time and works like him for the Soviet Secret Service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As chief of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, which was aired on television, both men claimed that the chief of staff was resigned at his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smiles for the cameras, few are convinced-especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">Is this the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows that at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official claim-that a man who was once touted as a potential president would like to lead the Russian environmental policy at once-was very sceptical.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said, "It is true that I asked her in a conversation in early 2012 to entrust me with this very complicated post-one could almost say-arduous post for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential Administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was deputy Prime Minister and Secretary of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was the chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin reached power, he named Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was once believed that after Putin's second term, Ivanov could become president of Russia, as a third term Putin would have violated the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became prime minister before returning to the presidency three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the Norddeck of the Queensferry Crossing to the viaduct-which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is the first of four closures of the "deck blowers" that approach the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 inclined ropes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Economics minister Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to cross the bridge from the country.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said: "This is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry crossings.</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic dimension in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for the fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total, almost 79% of the total bridge decks are in their place and the final section of the deck today gets a betonguess for the deck in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, project leader of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "The first closure represents a significant milestone for every bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">In this fantastic project, the shutter is a pioneering building and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After installing the last section of the road and connecting it to the North Tower deck in the expansion, we had to close the remaining gap on the north or the side of the site.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive, since the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled upward at an incline of about 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Tricky, because the tolerances that the team worked on were tiny--on each side they were only a few millimeters.</seg>
<seg id="20">Luckily, everything went very well.</seg>

<seg id="1">Who is building Brunswick's cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="2">The SPD and Greens believe that investors will be much more involved in the future.</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">The SPD is proposing a "living concept of action" at the next Council meeting.</seg>
<seg id="5">But strife is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost, the question is: who is supposed to build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">SPD Bundestag Group chairman Christoph Bratmann says: "We are in agreement with the Greens: if you want to build urban areas, you have to have 20 percent of all apartments as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="9">However, the cheap apartments can also be created in the stock.</seg>
<seg id="10">The big point of controversy in the city hall, however, is Bratmann: "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private land?"</seg>
<seg id="11">"We want investors to build at least 10 percent on such land, but as much as 20 percent of the flats as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">A new urban housing Support programme, which will cost millions and still needs to be financed, should provide incentives.</seg>
<seg id="13">The problem, according to Bratmann: "There is currently no agreement between the political groups."</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make as few regulations as possible for investors.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants still hardships for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Despite this, according to Bratmann, there is a worsening of the situation in the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the concept of action is implemented, this will provide additional tasks in the management of the administration.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the professionals.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the programme is still not complete: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how does one balance the loss of another approximately 1300 cheap flats, the funding of which will expire in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">To prevent this, according to the planning spokesperson Nicole Palm, should now be buying expiring ties from the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">It would also have to be thought about bringing apartments back into the price fixing.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the West.</seg>
<seg id="26">In one shot, the problem could be solved.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the west, deadlines expire at the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments could be put back in the price fixing for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: The owners, the housing companies do not want that.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because the number of social housing in the West is again drastically increased, one removes itself from the goal of the so-called mixing.</seg>
<seg id="31">There will no longer be a concentration of socially weak in only a few parts of the city.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens reckon that there will still be movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">Bundestag Group chairman Holger Herlitschke says: "For a broad majority, the CDU must be in the boat."</seg>
<seg id="34">It has concentrated on more sites for single-family homes.</seg>
<seg id="35">But this does not mean that a compromise cannot yet be found.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It's fascinating to watch the world change.</seg>
<seg id="3">The fact that teenagers and children no longer go out to play, rather prefer to spend their free time on screens, was lamented by many in the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people off the sofa and making them more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then to video games and most recently to smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is therefore great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">I refer, of course, to the Pokémon go craze, an app based on the characters that were first created for the video games in the 1990s (later a series of cartoons, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many phenomena of pop culture, the interest before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand declined somewhat in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that overwhelmed the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days, Pokémon had go more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, the players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokémon that are tracked with a GPS and, once they are found, can be "photographed" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "captured".</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation who played the game when she was younger, joined the craze and jumped for the search from the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the United States, the game led to a significant increase in steps that the "average" person returns every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch tracking 35,000 users, recently shared the Washington Post that within two days of the game's launch, the number of tracked people exercising every day 30 minutes jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon go-it only sees the raw data to improve performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public awareness campaigns on health that make people want to "take 30 minutes to come" from the sofa and "to be active every day" came across deaf ears because many public messages are boring to health and come from people who look miserable.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, the importance of sport cannot be overrated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Anyone who regularly drives sports reduces his chances of getting cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead you here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon go is that it makes people do something outdoors that they enjoy.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus, three pillars of health are covered-movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even make new friends on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there are also grumpy spoilers who always have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What's the matter?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to do sports as this game does.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its allure and the use will diminish over time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Due to Pokemon's success, however, there will be more games that will connect apps and virtual reality with the active in the real world and will help many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="2">Forget the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="3">Forget the hype.</seg>
<seg id="4">Simone Biles is immune to all this.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dynamic on the leaping horse.</seg>
<seg id="6">Effortlessly on the bar.</seg>
<seg id="7">Breathtaking on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="8">Brilliant all over the place.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now finally also Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast climbed on Thursday to the more combat title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Their overall result of 62.198 was clearly ahead of the silver medallist and "final five" teammate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Americans Simone Biles turns on the hovering beam during the single-more combat final of the women in gymnastics at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a more battle title and totals the fifth as she consolidates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey came to an end at that moment.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who have brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has dominated the last three years of its sport, 15 World Cup medals-including 10 gold medals-won with such amazing exercises, which include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Retton of hers said that she is "the best gymnast I have ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">She expected a final test in Brazil, a competition that did not go so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in spring, Texas would be considered disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Americans Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman hug each other after they have won gold and silver in the singles final of the Women in the art gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles took the first medal on Tuesday, while at the farewell party of the retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi served as an exclamation mark.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although Biles insisted that, during their long journey to the top, never planned to have the future, this is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of your ground exercises-which include your typical tumbling pass-is tuned to Latin American music that would fit on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">It's not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, who was adopted by her grandparents as a small child and was discovered by coach Aimee Boormans mother during a school excursion to the gym in which Boorman trained, became a force.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, it has lost no more fighting competition, a series of winnings that will last as long as Biles wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even if Mustafina led by two turns easily, the picture deceived.</seg>
<seg id="27">Hovering beams and ground gymnastics-in which Biles holds the world Championship title-lurked.</seg>
<seg id="28">She picked up again with 15.433 on the levitation beam again-and put a 15.933 on the floor another on it.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman hugged her gently as she expected her Endergbnis--a mere formality--and tears poured on Biles gleaming red, white, and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her scrapbook became reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place, but the bronze medal in a Tiebrake went to Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="31">This time, the 22-year-old team captain named "Grandma" by the Americans had a head start.</seg>
<seg id="32">After her ground exercise, she threw Kusshände at the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed dubious.</seg>
<seg id="33">As far as Biles is concerned, the fast-spreading tweet of the 19-year-olds from the beginning of this week has a whole new meaning:</seg>

<seg id="2">According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot, killed in one of the deadliest attacks in a decade in the first serial killer case of Phoenix, while chatting in the car and listening to music.</seg>
<seg id="3">Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on June 12, while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said.</seg>
<seg id="4">The perpetrator fired eight shots from a handgun while he was standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle that is read in the report.</seg>
<seg id="5">The police said that the triple homicide did not seem to be the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900, which were owned by one of the adult victims.</seg>
<seg id="6">The police spokesman for Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shootout led the investigators to take a closer look at whether she was connected with four previous attacks.</seg>
<seg id="7">In total, in Hispanic residential areas, seven people were killed and two injured in nine attacks within four months.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It happens in a residential area in front of a house," Howard shared the KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, at the beginning of the month.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is believed that the suspect used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.</seg>
<seg id="10">The investigators refused to reveal the evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were linked and committed by the same murderer.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to her injuries and died later.</seg>
<seg id="12">Liner, 31, and Ellis ' daughter Maleah died on site.</seg>
<seg id="13">A witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.</seg>
<seg id="14">The authorities also published a police report on the shootout, which aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial killer.</seg>
<seg id="15">Investigators found cartridge sleeves and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment.</seg>

<seg id="2">Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, playing toys and of course his mother.</seg>
<seg id="3">But like the fewest of his Altergenossen, Edmund Microcephaly has the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto did not know about during her pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="4">When he came home for the first time, my first thought was that I couldn't manage.</seg>
<seg id="5">I can't do this.</seg>
<seg id="6">I didn't get into that.</seg>
<seg id="7">Which is not true at all--of course you have to be prepared, "she said.</seg>

<seg id="9">Some doctors even went so far as to suggest that they institutionalize it.</seg>
<seg id="10">"My first answer was ' I didn't know that people were still doing, '" explained Picciuto.</seg>
<seg id="11">Edmund can run with the help of a walker.</seg>
<seg id="12">Edmund could not sit and crawl until his third year of his life, and he still cannot speak.</seg>
<seg id="13">But he's slowly making progress.</seg>
<seg id="14">He can run with support and ride a bike.</seg>
<seg id="15">He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.</seg>
<seg id="16">Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund has devised for "Please Sing Me Something".</seg>
<seg id="17">"We teach him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.</seg>
<seg id="18">But it's not a typical sign language--she says. Edmund invented some signs on his own.</seg>
<seg id="19">Microcephaly has a variety of causes: genetic as with Edmund, as well as infections with viruses such as measles or Zikavirus during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="20">The symptoms and predictions can vary greatly.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the infected with the Zikavirus.</seg>
<seg id="22">Picciuto remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future.</seg>
<seg id="23">I asked constantly, what will happen?</seg>
<seg id="24">What will happen?</seg>
<seg id="25">And she still doesn't really know.</seg>
<seg id="26">I have not asked for a long time after the prognosis, because I do not expect someone to really be able to tell me.</seg>
<seg id="27">But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zikavirus.</seg>
<seg id="28">It's getting better.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That's what I imagine under the women's olympiamannschaft in gymnastics, and that's for more than a reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">Firstly, I have been with each Summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And second, this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who worked inspiring for many young girls of other skin color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, who is Jewish and Madison Kocian, who is a Catholic, rounds off, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team is finally reflecting the United States.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one among female gymnasts was an Afro-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year, Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">That shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion and America cheered.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they provided unexpected but masterful Gymastikroutinen.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone became the fourth heterosexual American to win gold at an individual multi-fight event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We are experiencing the top of this sport, but this is not the way to see turn classes throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie all hit the same path as Aly and Madison to make it to the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "last five" because the next Olympic team will have only four gymnasts in the team. Moreover, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport and Turner is primarily in private gymnastics, which are maintained by parents who are responsible for training, furnishing, travel clothing, competition and hotel expenses (for trainers and their gymnasts and families). The list can be continued in any way.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these gymnastic clubs are located in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these, the gymnasts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We must allow the communities of Aun, many young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, to have a leistbareres and more accessible Turntrainung.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my Turn foundation of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban teenagers (mainly black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determinedness for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that will make thousands of young girls interested in gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">It's such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real portrayal of "girl power" by bringing the Olympic team gold and thank you, you are motivating so many young girls with different backgrounds to begin their journey, to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="1">Assistant doctors want to organize further strikes after they have rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal</seg>
<seg id="2">The ministers had hoped to be able to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the British Medical Association's officials, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistant doctors who voted at an election refused him.</seg>
<seg id="3">In July, Hunt had unveiled plans to forcibly introduce the treaty and said that the NHS would be in a "No Man's Land" and any further delay would be detrimental to the employees and patients.</seg>
<seg id="4">The first interns are to receive a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend work to improve the care of inhospitable times.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dr Ellen McCourt, the chairman of the BMA committee for assistant doctors informed last night in a communication saying: "Assistant doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will fuel the current staff crisis and fail to treat all doctors fairly."</seg>
<seg id="6">With only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress must be made and time is running out.</seg>
<seg id="7">Efforts on the part of the BMA to resolve disputes through talks came at the government's reluctance to participate and sometimes on deafening silence.</seg>
<seg id="8">This happened to a promise that Jeremy Hunt had just made last month that his door would always be open.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Jeremy Hunt must now act, repeal the enforcement and address the concerns of the assistant doctors."</seg>
<seg id="10">If he does not do so, the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further industrial action.</seg>
<seg id="11">The last strike at the end of April saw a postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and medical specialists were involved to provide coverage to doctors on the picket line.</seg>
<seg id="12">The ministers had hoped to be able to end the dispute over the changes by adopting the reformed Treaty with the British Medical Association officials.</seg>
<seg id="13">The BMA wants a better Wochendentlohnung for the 54,000 assistant doctors who will be subject to the contract.</seg>
<seg id="14">Daniel Mortimer, director-General of the NHS staff, called on the assistant doctors to end the strike.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mortimer said: "Work-related action does not achieve anything of the least, but burdens already overloaded teams and service providers, and they only provide care, distress and interruption to patients, carers and their families".</seg>
<seg id="16">In the last two months, we have spoken to the committee of Assistant doctors and have responded positively to the concerns about guardianship and Whistleblowings with the Ministry of Health and other ministries.</seg>
<seg id="17">Employers hoped that continued positive engagement with other important issues-such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a professional time-out Schulungsksten, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training leave and the gender pay gap in medicine-a sign of how serious it was for employers, the health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the BMA in November , February and May.</seg>

<seg id="2">Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £2-per-day drug after the authorities have been recommended to administer this to more people for a longer period of time.</seg>
<seg id="3">The anti-clotting drug ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.</seg>
<seg id="4">The drug is already being administered for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of stroke or other heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="5">The NHS's nice regulatory authority has recommended a four-year-long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.</seg>
<seg id="6">The NHS's nice regulatory authority has recommended a four-year-long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.</seg>
<seg id="7">Around 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulating fatty material in the arterial walls that form surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="9">When the lining breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot that clogs the bloodstream to the heart, causing a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="10">When the clot dissolves, it can flow through the bloodstream and clog the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="11">People who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having one more.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, which is manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and is distributed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots less likely.</seg>
<seg id="13">Nice's tutorial design, published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a two-day dose of aspirin for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Professor Carole Longson, director of the Nice Health technology Evaluation Centre, said: "Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all persons who have suffered a heart attack, have another heart attack or a stroke-often follow with disastrous."</seg>
<seg id="15">The fear of a new heart attack can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.</seg>
<seg id="16">Experience shows that ticagrelor, in combination with aspirin, is effective in reducing other heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">With a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="18">Information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor-especially the risk of bleeding-is limited to a period of up to three years. The guidance draft does not recommend any treatment beyond this period.</seg>

<seg id="1">Culture of political correctness makes electoral fraud flourish in Muslim areas</seg>
<seg id="2">The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed last year at the instigation of a government report due to corruption from office</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of political correctness has led to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities being deliberately ignored as a devastating government report today revealed.</seg>
<seg id="4">The former Cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police, election observers and halls to have ignored evidence of election abuse due to "over-sensibilities regarding ethnicity and religion".</seg>
<seg id="5">The former Minister of Integration and local government, who is now a Antkorruptionskönig, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up shut-off tapes outside of election booths to protect intimidated voters.</seg>
<seg id="6">He recommends that voters should carry a passport to prove their identity in elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the moment, a voter only has to name and address.</seg>
<seg id="8">The report proposes to apply non-removable ink to a person's finger when they make their vote to prevent someone from dialing twice.</seg>
<seg id="9">Whistleblowers should get more protection, says Sir Eric.</seg>
<seg id="10">It calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions by non-official committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"This serves not only to counter electoral fraud, but also to protect the local government from the wider corruption and financial fraud culture that accompanies it," he said.</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the tower Hamlet's electoral scandal in east London.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last year, a Sonderwahlgericht decided that the incumbent mayor Lutfur Rahman should be removed from his office after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.</seg>
<seg id="14">The court found that Rahman would have perverted the religious sentiments of his Muslim community "in a cynical way" and that he would have silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobienanschuldigungen.</seg>
<seg id="15">Rahman is said to have "led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to elect him."</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 votes were either dubious or the result of an imitation in which a person chooses as someone else.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud across the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">He expressed himself in particular alarmingly to fraudulent absentee ballot-in which older members of the Muslim community would have made pressure on people to elect a candidate of their choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including leading identification, to prove the identity</seg>
<seg id="20">In his report it states: ' It was established that pressure was exerted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, in particular women and young people, in order to vote in accordance with the will of the elderly, in particular communities with a Pakistani or Bangladeschischem background.</seg>
<seg id="21">"There were concerns that... State institutions would knowingly ignored such behavior due to" politically correct "oversensibilities regarding ethnicity and religion."</seg>
<seg id="22">Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including banning political activists from editing letter-dial documents to stop "picking".</seg>
<seg id="23">The report, which is being considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher registry checks to prevent the electoral directory from being used for immigration and social fraud.</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID card.</seg>
<seg id="25">Use non-removable ink on a person's finger once she has given her voice to prevent someone from dialing twice.</seg>
<seg id="26">Carry out systematic checks on the nationality of a person in order to ensure that they are entitled to vote.</seg>
<seg id="27">A three-year limit on requests for automatic absentee ballot.</seg>
<seg id="28">Prohibiting political activists from working on complete mail options and envelopes of letter elections.</seg>
<seg id="29">Give the police the power to set up barricades around electoral stations.</seg>
<seg id="30">A change of law that facilitates an indictment of intimidation in accordance with the representation of the People Act 1983 (the 1983 Act of Representation).</seg>
<seg id="31">Ban in electoral stations.</seg>
<seg id="32">Requirement that only English may be used in the electoral stations (except Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">Intensifying the training to ensure that the employees enforce the rule that voters go alone in the voting booth.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sir Eric Falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that after the Tower Hamlets case no criminal complaint was made.</seg>
<seg id="35">"The electoral court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy unfit for use due to a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.</seg>
<seg id="36">It has been pleaded guilty for a number of reasons, in accordance with the high requirements in criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="37">He also criticizes the ineffective "checkbox controls" of the election registration departments of the halls.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Eric said, "the court ruling in Tower Hamlets from last year was a warning signal.</seg>
<seg id="39">Our country is a proud heir to Parliament's mother, but the worrying and concealed spread of electoral fraud and denial by some authorities threaten this good reputation.</seg>

<seg id="2">The shoppers didn't know where to look when a woman took her clothes out in the middle of a Primark to try out her underwear.</seg>
<seg id="3">To aggravate the situation, she patterned how she looked in it, pulled it out and put it back on the shelf.</seg>
<seg id="4">She continued to rummage and tried four pairs of underpants in a shop at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Primark shop in the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone, where the woman tried the underpants before putting them back on the shelf</seg>
<seg id="6">A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear, "she relocated and left the shop without buying anything."</seg>
<seg id="7">She said, "People couldn't believe what they saw."</seg>
<seg id="8">Standing in the middle of the sales area she took a pair of underpants from the delivery, pulled out her own pantyhose and trousers and tried them.</seg>
<seg id="9">"She didn't even try to find a more discreet place to do it-she just stood there, naughty like Oskar."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Everyone stared when they took off the underpants, which they obviously didn't like, since they put them back on the shelves."</seg>
<seg id="11">She repeated the same with three more underpants, before finally decided that she liked nothing, again attracted herself and outed.</seg>
<seg id="12">"She didn't seem to mind that she was watching someone--or thinking about the person who might be buying the underpants she had tried."</seg>
<seg id="13">Ms. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said, "how disgusting to think that someone would take home underwear with another person and who were not washed."</seg>
<seg id="14">The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="15">Ms. Davidson added, "As I have heard, the employees have tried to pull the garments out of the sale after they went-which is just as good."</seg>
<seg id="16">"I'd hate to go home with a new pair of underpants and find out that another woman was wearing them and took them out again and they weren't washed."</seg>
<seg id="17">A spokesman for Primark said: "Primark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday, August 9th in our branch in Folkestone."</seg>
<seg id="18">All eligible products were drawn from the sale.</seg>

<seg id="1">How to protect yourself from weapon attacks with Krav Maga</seg>
<seg id="2">The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.</seg>
<seg id="3">We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to use armed robbers to close the distance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you are approaching them from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the Spit for your robber.</seg>
<seg id="5">If you approach them from behind, you should turn around first so that you can see your assailant and "go out of the line of fire," says Mizrachi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Then grasp the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder before hitting the face with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Then strike him with his knee in the groin and twist her, while the attacker curvess with pain, the weapon from his hands. Hit him with the barrel in the face and move backwards while you point the gun at him.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the case of attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar-move your body out of the firing line, grab the gun and twist it so the attacker can't shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time, shift the weight to the weapon and hit the attacker's chest, then twist the weapon out of its grip before moving backward and aligning the weapon.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds difficult?</seg>
<seg id="11">Watch the video to see exactly how it mizrachis.</seg>
<seg id="12">But remember, when you're robbed, it's safest to hand over your money-unless you are a Krav Maga Grandmaster.</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveler Ian Wright scrapes his tongue at the dirtiest places in Europe for a guide</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller underwent a serious test of his immune system and gag reflex by licking some of Europe's dirtiest and most disgusting places.</seg>
<seg id="3">The presenter and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk scraped his course on a euro bill, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a flush of a toilet, and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he was going to get into.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner strength", brought some surprising results to daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The idea of licking the flush of a toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the development of intestinal bacteria and his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Luckily, nothing left him licking more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resilience of his bowels by travelling through the world and eating peculiar and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public railings at railway stations to washing-up knobs of toilets, the task was to definitely put his immune system under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he said: "As a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was able to live up to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public restroom in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His trial smear showed a Luminometerzahl of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">In comparison, the Luminometerzahl of freshly washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to lick after their Luminometerzahl over 4000 units of fraud, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the film he says: "This comes close to the worst I have smelt in a toilet."</seg>
<seg id="19">There's nothing more filthy than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I'm not going to lick anything here because it's disgusting inside.</seg>
<seg id="21">"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish dairy producer Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio gefilus containing lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the development of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios senior Venice president for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We really wanted to offer the consumer something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We conducted crazy brainstorming that ended up saying, "Let's call Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context – the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we have been able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think that the movie shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added, "Let me say so--I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I had instructed him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the movie."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course, there were things that made it easier to get Ian to lick her and others where it was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad we've taken some of these filthy treats on film. "</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 percent of all interviewed lactic acid bacteria, in particular with the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58 percent said that they at least occasionally use products containing lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="1">Social family destroyed in front of Delogierung social housing in Saltash, Cornwall</seg>
<seg id="2">A social family left their social housing after a Delogierung with a damage of £50,000 because they had terrorized their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her estate in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After being forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an irreparable state.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls showed gaping holes, wooden planks were torn open, rubbish was scattered on the floor and graffiti was smeared on the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been relocated and it is assumed that she is now living in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for the House administration at Cornwall Housing, said that she was afraid that the apartment would no longer be repaired.</seg>
<seg id="8">She said, "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here, and I think people don't have to live that way.</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider, as this property will probably be considered as not so beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and their reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons, who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflicted included street fights with baseball bats, intimidating residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking, and excessive shouting, arguing, and swearing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, was given an order for anti-social behaviour in June.</seg>
<seg id="13">In some rooms of the house, which may be demolished, old rubbish was found</seg>
<seg id="14">The wooden planks were torn up in the estate where drugs were traded in the past.</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbors said they saw them fighting on the street and had to be called regularly by the police</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing Delogierte You and your partner forcibly this week from the property after giving you an extended period of 11 weeks to undress voluntarily.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Delogierung were cheered by relieved neighbors who said that their lives were turned into hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">One of them said, "They didn't care about anyone."</seg>
<seg id="19">We lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad.</seg>
<seg id="20">The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.</seg>
<seg id="21">"We couldn't sleep this morning."</seg>
<seg id="22">We stood up because it was so quiet here-we are not used to it!</seg>
<seg id="23">Now that you are finally gone, it will be nice.</seg>
<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, neighbourhood enforcement manager of Cornwall Housing, said that the failed family would have to cooperate with local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house to which the police were summoned on a regular basis for 20 years</seg>
<seg id="26">On the overgrown side of the municipal house, trash and old toys were thrown down</seg>
<seg id="27">He added: "It is a shame that the tenant neglected to accept any responsibility for their behavior and that of their family, since a Delogierung is always the last step that Cornwall housing considers.</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case, because the behavior was extreme and their actions had to be terribly brother for their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the community who have been courageously approaching us and who have provided us with the information, have done so.</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will give consolation to some neighbours and convey the message that anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress left in one of the bedrooms of the house after the Delogierung on the floor</seg>
<seg id="33">Workers of the House administration will now have to mountains to clear out the house surrounding</seg>
<seg id="34">In 2014, the police conducted a raid in the house and found about 70g cannabis as well as scales, Paraphernalien and cash in the amount of £1,700.</seg>
<seg id="35">Skeldon received a fine after being guilty of the possession of a class B drug in commercial intent.</seg>
<seg id="36">She claimed that the money was for a gravestone of her son Lee Skeldon, who was killed in a car accident in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="37">After they were without shelter, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.</seg>
<seg id="38">Many room walls of the house were smeared with graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">The police say that they will be tenants who do not abide by the House Rules</seg>
<seg id="40">Angela Crow of the police of Devon and Cornwall said that the Delogierung was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not abide by the House rules.</seg>
<seg id="41">"This goes to those who think that they can behave without self-reproaches as well as those who have been harmed by such behaviour," she said.</seg>
<seg id="42">The Devon and Cornwall Police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behavior that will continue to cooperate with partners to protect our communities.</seg>

<seg id="4">The Air Force indicated that it was on a training flight, but insisted that there was no security risk</seg>
<seg id="5">This was the moment when frightened tourists started to panic after a jet flying down a full beach.</seg>
<seg id="6">Dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft flew almost close to the sun worshippers on the beach section in Aveiro in the north of Portugal.</seg>
<seg id="7">The holidaymakers jumped in when they understandably began to worry about the noise of jet engines without first seeing what was going on in the clouds.</seg>
<seg id="8">The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.</seg>
<seg id="9">Daniel Fernandes, one of the many holidaymakers who posted videos about the dramatic fly-by in the social media, said: "It really flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it was crashing."</seg>
<seg id="10">Nuno Arroja added, "I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was falling down on me."</seg>
<seg id="11">Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were panicked when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep</seg>
<seg id="12">The Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot of the P-3c Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to fly so deep that this was the only way to recognize them.</seg>
<seg id="13">The spokesman said that the jet flew a little deeper than usual due to the poor visibility of the nearby area fires, but the air forces insisted that safety was at no time at risk.</seg>
<seg id="14">Land fires have destroyed these summer parts of the Portuguese mainland, where four people also died on the island of Madeira.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Portuguese air Forces today announced that the pilot had to fly so deep due to the conditions-strong fog and fire smoke-which restricted his view</seg>

<seg id="4">A rare moment in which the usually cocky and self-confident multimillionaire expressed something like concerns, as correspondents reported.</seg>
<seg id="5">After throwing 16 rivals from the race in their own Republican camp, the doubts about his success in the battle for the White House are now growing.</seg>

<seg id="2">The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary commission on the case.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kenya's light athlete threatens to adversity after the second doping affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a fraud attempt at a doping control in the Olympic Village, Kenya sent a coach home.</seg>
<seg id="5">The International Olympic Committee informed that a disciplinary commission should be set up immediately to investigate the case.</seg>
<seg id="6">A Kenyan official had informed that the former sprinter and today's coach, John Anzrah, had given a urine sample in the Olympic Village under the name of the 800-metre runner Ferguson Rotich.</seg>
<seg id="7">This was reported to the team leader of Kenya by the doping inspectors.</seg>
<seg id="8">The IAAF has asked the IOC for information about the case in order to exert its own investigations, a IAAF spokesman shared.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent actions of the IOC, the IAAF will make an assessment," it said in an IAAF statement.</seg>
<seg id="10">"He (Anzrah) has gone to the doping control station and has issued himself as Ferguson Rotich, given the sample and signed it," declared Kenya's Chief de mission Stephan Arap Soi.</seg>
<seg id="11">He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete who was on the list for the training controls of the World Anti-Doping Agency.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ferguson Rotich had become in Beijing World Cup fourth over 800 meters in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="13">Four days earlier, the Kenyan athletics delegation chief Michael Rotich had been deducted from the Rio Games.</seg>
<seg id="14">He is said to have informed the athletes of his country about the upcoming doping tests.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to media reports, he was to be detained on his return to Nairobi airport.</seg>
<seg id="16">Kenya has been under special observation by the IOC for a long time after numerous doping offences.</seg>
<seg id="17">In announcing the IOC's more than 2000 doping target controls before the Rio Games, it was unusually pointed out that athletes from Kenya and Russia are particularly targeted.</seg>
<seg id="18">The World Anti-Doping Agency had exerted a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer Games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.</seg>
<seg id="19">The law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympic start.</seg>
<seg id="20">As a result, WADA Kenya took the list of countries whose anti-doping measures are in conformity with WADA's rules.</seg>
<seg id="21">Kenya is considered a great runner nation.</seg>
<seg id="22">The country's light athletes won most of the medals at the World Cup 2015 in Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="23">In a series of ARD television reports, accusations have repeatedly been made that doping drugs are readily available in Kenya and that there should be a significant mentality of sports fraud.</seg>
<seg id="24">IOC member Richard Pound last requested a similar investigation in Kenya, as he had hired her in Russian athletics.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was possible to demonstrate that in this sport the area was doped and systematic.</seg>
<seg id="26">Russia's light athletes were then excluded from the summer Games.</seg>

<seg id="1">Salzburg "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli</seg>
<seg id="2">In the Shakespeare year, the Salzburg Festival presents the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic pair of lovers, similar to Romeo and Juliet.</seg>
<seg id="3">With doing a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.</seg>
<seg id="4">A musical captured Salzburg: The "West Side Story", Leornard Bern Stein's masterpiece.</seg>
<seg id="5">The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical to the Temple of classical music and fulfilled a youth dream with the role of Mary.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the orchestra, the Simón Bolívar Orchestra is buried under the leadership of the Venezonalischen conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm," he raves.</seg>
<seg id="7">We always say that it is very Latin American.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is a wonderful blend, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="10">I would say that we really have amber music in our blood!</seg>
<seg id="11">In this staging, Bartoli plays an older Maria.</seg>
<seg id="12">She remembers with sadness at her love with Tony, while the younger Maria plays and dances.</seg>
<seg id="13">The role of Mary has always fascinated me.</seg>
<seg id="14">First, because it is exceptional musically!</seg>
<seg id="15">And then there is Mary's personality.</seg>
<seg id="16">She says it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright".</seg>
<seg id="17">So she's smart, of course naïve, and very passionate.</seg>
<seg id="18">"She is very similar to my Italian character, whom I have as a Roman", Bartoli laughs.</seg>
<seg id="19">Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."</seg>
<seg id="20">It's such an honor for us to work with her.</seg>
<seg id="21">She is an immensely generous man.</seg>

<seg id="2">Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join the IS, was reported to have died in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="3">The lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said that her family learned a few weeks ago of her death in Raqqah, Syria.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air raid in Raqqah, the stronghold of the group in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="5">Sultana was 17 years old and died according to her family shortly after she had decided to leave the war-stricken country and return to England.</seg>
<seg id="6">"One can only hope that this is the only good thing-as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war zone-to prevent people from ever taking this decision," said Akunjee.</seg>
<seg id="7">In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London stepped into a plane to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sultana's family was told that she married an Isis fighter in Syria, and became a widow within a few months.</seg>

<seg id="2">Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, will nominate the judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland's endorsement since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.</seg>
<seg id="4">The majority leader in the Senate Mitch McConnell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the deceased judge at the Supreme Court of Antonin Scalia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Reid said on Thursday during a conference call that he expected from Clinton to select Garland "with a certain degree of certainty".</seg>
<seg id="6">A spokeswoman for Reid later said that he had not yet talked to Clinton whether she would nominate Garland and he speculate.</seg>
<seg id="7">He praised Garland and said Clinton's team would not worry about a new candidate.</seg>
<seg id="8">Garland is the supreme judge for the US court for the District of Columbia.</seg>

<seg id="2">"Who does not adapt and praises Erdogan, sits on packed suitcases," says the chairman of the Gülen-near foundation dialogue and World, Edwin Karakoyun.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Kurdish community of Germany expects in the short term with tens of thousands of protection seekers fleeing from Turkey to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the medium term, it could even become "a few hundred thousand", believes the association chairman Ali Toprak.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to the harsh approach of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass exodus to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="6">"In the short term, I reckon with tens of thousands, in the medium term, with a few hundred thousand protection seekers from Turkey in Germany, when the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," says the association chairman Ali Toprak of the "world" of Friday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Because the government had already covered Kurdish strongholds with punitive actions months ago, 500,000 Kurds were fleeing within Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="8">After the thwarted coup, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks would still be added.</seg>
<seg id="9">Many will want to start anew in Europe if they are further suppressed in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="10">"It cannot be that a state that is self-absorbing refugees produces refugees in their own country," said Toprak.</seg>
<seg id="11">The head of the association lamented the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in Alevi cities.</seg>
<seg id="12">This is what Erdogan wants to increase the pressure on the remaining Kurds to leave.</seg>
<seg id="13">"They are the last large minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been exterminated or expelled in the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member.</seg>
<seg id="14">The head of the association called for the Federal government to "position itself as sharply as Austria against Erdogan and its followers".</seg>
<seg id="15">A "witch hunt" against Erdogan critics is also taking place in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="16">I am not feeling safe in Germany for the first time in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="17">The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad.</seg>
<seg id="18">More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and opposition.</seg>
<seg id="19">The branding as a Gülen pendant destroys the professional existence of teachers and other academics.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Who does not adapt and praises Erdogan, sits on packed suitcases, by the way also the kemaists and secular," said Edwin Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen-near foundation dialogue and education, the "world".</seg>
<seg id="21">As reported by the newspaper citing figures from the Federal Ministry, the Turks, before the coup, presented the largest group of asylum-seekers recognised in Germany for political persecution.</seg>
<seg id="22">By the deadline of 30 June, this was 11,386 people and thus almost 29 per cent of all recognised as entitled to Asylum (39,625).</seg>
<seg id="23">In this survey, there is no escaping from war, poverty or hopelessness.</seg>
<seg id="24">The right to asylum according to the Basic Law is exclusively political, i.e. from the state side, individually persecuted.</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The locals do not get anything from the summer election campaign-and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia may not choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern you have understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2021, the Landtag election will not be held again directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">It's no more stupid than it is: summer holidays, heat and Landtag election campaign-this is biting.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals who are to be persuaded by the election campaigners are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">The majority of holidaymakers in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so they must not choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition, there are practical problems: during the holidays, helpers hanging posters, blowing up balloons, distributing flyers and counting votes in the end are only laboriously encouraged.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, the election and last day of the holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, once again, has to pass a election campaign close to the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Celery, leader of an SPD/CDU coalition, must fear for his office.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how much newcomer AfD cuts off and what is left in the end of a coalition fit.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, makes an almost inconspicuous campaign, one sees from his large posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels through the country, spreads roses and chats a little with the people, just as his legendary word-sparse predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise, Seelering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame for blooming the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their refugee policy, their "we create this" has accelerated the rise of right-wing populists, which is now presumably going to cost him the beautiful office.</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its top candidate, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it is like to make a campaign at the wrong time in the right place.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to major rallies; Merkel's Bundestag constituency is located in the northeast.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony there than Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"There was probably the majority in other federal states," Vincent Kokert, general secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently denounced the NDR.</seg>
<seg id="22">But it is also too bad for anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise, the northeast CDU largely renounces the usual electoral stands on market squares and in front of shopping malls with parasols and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">This, says Kokert, only plays a "subordinate role".</seg>
<seg id="25">The Union also noticed that in the country you wegbröselt the base, that it must exert itself very hard to find another wire to the people.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is like the left, the SPD, the Greens: scarcely present in the vastness of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Council of the CDU campaigner Kokert to his comrades, however, is also self-revealing: "You must go where it hurts, namely where people are: festivals, golden Weddings, every birthday party must be used".</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much is at stake, selling his SPD has now called for a particularly committed election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In polls, the Social Democrats were last 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and only just before the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">In the 2011 election, the SPD had still clearly won 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Greens, small party with seven percent in the polls, are likely to make the leap into the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue out of the holiday-not and set their election campaign largely on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Online election campaign", calls it the country's chairman Claudia Müller.</seg>
<seg id="34">Otherwise, green election fighters are looking for local voters to search for the locals.</seg>
<seg id="35">Silke Gajek, the top candidate, curves just with a houseboat through the Mecklenburg Lakes and still finds it beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="36">Her impression: "Election holidays in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment".</seg>

<seg id="1">B27-Rehabilitation: restaurants suffering from blocking</seg>
<seg id="2">There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is being rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="3">For those responsible for the construction work, which starts at 5.30 a.m. and ends at around 8pm, there is praise everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="4">"They made it all pretty smart," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the Jet gas station.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a superteam.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no delay either.</seg>
<seg id="7">The construction site was scheduled to be moved south at the beginning of the week, until the end of October everything should be ready.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is also praised for the people who are responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to setting up makeshift driveways.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site has migrated to the south on Monday and also the blocking of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen has been lifted and thus the connection to Rottenburg again exists, the traffic situation within the village has relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now travel from Ofterdingen from the B 27 again on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Dodge traffic through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"There were sometimes considerable complaints", says the deputy chief executive officer Florian King, who was responsible for the transport management of the renovation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of Bach's street, Stone Laughing Street, Hafnerstraße and pond rain had to contend with more traffic noise, because many creeping paths were searching and more familiar to their navi than the signposting.</seg>
<seg id="14">Which resulted in some trucks being frayed in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the speed limits were not adhered to, the municipality also urged the measuring vehicle of Mössingen.</seg>
<seg id="16">"There were considerable transgressions," said King, who made himself aware of the situation on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three per minute have been flashed.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fastest was 77 hours in the speed 30 zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">Since the construction site has moved on, it has become quieter.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the business people at the B 27, it is only a small consolation that the street is now open to customers from Rottenburg.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But that the B 27 remediation has led to sales slumps, everyone who is asked can be looked through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more and some are less affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those who have less to do with the "end customer", i.e. produced for other companies, for whom the renovation has hardly followed.</seg>
<seg id="25">Thomas Sulz also speaks of a "maximum slight decline" at the Maier dealership, but also admits that "the running clientele is missing".</seg>
<seg id="26">The most heavily battered are the local along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steak House, formerly crown, finds clear words.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already threatening existence.</seg>
<seg id="29">Not only him, but all the restaurants have hit it "hard".</seg>
<seg id="30">Customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.</seg>
<seg id="31">We must be happy about every euro turnover.</seg>
<seg id="32">He quantifies the sales losses to "well over 50 percent".</seg>
<seg id="33">The rehabilitation of the roads had "thrown back" by two years.</seg>
<seg id="34">He had to dismiss half of his employees.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, the policy would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, government president Jörg Schmidt responded to a request from Göhner, whether there could be a financial compensation, with the hint replied, the restaurant will benefit from the benefits of the location on the B 27. Now, it must also bear the disadvantages that arise from the renovation.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows of other counties, where such a thing was handled more generously.</seg>
<seg id="38">In all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family business has been located here since 1715, he refers to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">He can understand that other regulars are now less likely to stop by because of the complicated traffic management.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't go here, it's nice to be somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="42">Göhner has no doubts that his regular clientele will come back after the end of the renovation work.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises with BSE and avian flu, Göhner considers the impact of the B 27 construction work on its clientele for the biggest crisis that its restaurant has experienced in its long history.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six months of construction work, that's already brutal.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the name of the fight against terrorism, laws are constantly being screwed.</seg>
<seg id="2">After the recent attacks, Interior Minister de Maizière now presents a thick security package.</seg>
<seg id="3">But what has a tolerance status to do with terror?</seg>
<seg id="4">And what does the coalition partner say to all this?</seg>
<seg id="5">Thomas de Maizière gives the reconciler.</seg>
<seg id="6">All his proposals are "politically reasonable" to the coalition partner, says the federal minister at the presentation of his new security package.</seg>
<seg id="7">They don't overwhelm anyone.</seg>
<seg id="8">Other, more advanced points would initially be discussed within the parties.</seg>
<seg id="9">I also participate in this.</seg>
<seg id="10">As Minister of the Interior, however, he was given results and a "recoverable consensus" within the coalition.</seg>
<seg id="11">After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, de Maizière has had a little time to pass before presenting his conclusions for security in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="12">But they are now all the more extensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">Some is already known, announced, targeted: that a new security authority should look after the cracking of encrypted communication is not new.</seg>
<seg id="14">Nor is the fact that Germany has to implement several EU regulations on passenger data and weapons law.</seg>
<seg id="15">The call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is also not surprising.</seg>
<seg id="16">In part, de Maizière launches a second start for proposals that were not to be made with the SPD so far: he wants to punish sympathy advertising for terrorist groups and jihadists the German passport with dual citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="17">"These will be difficult points for the SPD", admits the CDU man.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, he deems this to be reasonable and does not demand anything that the coalition partner has no chances anyway.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few new ideas presented de Maizière also.</seg>
<seg id="20">They have it in part: He is planning quick procedures for deportation and more possibilities for detention of people before deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees who are specifically brought into the country should first have their smartphones checked and social media accounts disclosed for a security review.</seg>
<seg id="22">In tolerating rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse than hitherto, such as those who commit crimes or deliberately discard their papers in order to conceal their identity.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of them are politically and legally sensitive.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some things are also baked and leaves questions open.</seg>
<seg id="25">And on some points-in the unequal treatment of tolerated, for example-the question arises: what does this have to do with security and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it is not possible to deny that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">In addition, many people were concerned about security in the face of the high numbers of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="29">And things that people profoundly employed were not even allowed to be excluded in election campaign times.</seg>
<seg id="30">Internal security has been a huge focus.</seg>
<seg id="31">First the attacks in the neighbourhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The uncertainty is great.</seg>
<seg id="34">And yes, there are election fights.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly putting themselves on the subject of internal security.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the past few days, the two parties were high.</seg>
<seg id="37">It was only a nasty dispute over the equipping of the federal Police, then a collection of security policy ideas of some union interior ministers, in which the heads of the ministries also demand a burka ban and a departure from dual citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="38">De Maizière strives is also here for conciliatory tones.</seg>
<seg id="39">He has nothing to do with a departure from the double pass.</seg>
<seg id="40">We have pacified the discussion in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is not sensible to reopen it.</seg>
<seg id="42">And in a burka ban, he has constitutional concerns.</seg>
<seg id="43">Whether his own package at all corners is constitutional and whether it is actually "reasonable" for the coalition partner, has yet to show itself.</seg>
<seg id="44">There are a lot of things that could cause controversy.</seg>
<seg id="45">But the SPD is also trying to profile itself in the topic of internal security.</seg>
<seg id="46">Party chief Sigmar Gabriel first of all tentatively signals willingness to talk and says: "The SPD is ready to speak about everything, which helps to increase security further".</seg>

<seg id="1">The Volkswagen lightly is still coming through.</seg>
<seg id="2">Despite diesel scandals, the delivery figures are rising worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="3">But not all markets are running around.</seg>
<seg id="4">The recall action has a swirl around a term.</seg>
<seg id="5">Volkswagen starts in the second half of the year in the deliveries.</seg>
<seg id="6">Despite the diesel affair, Europe's largest carmaker can continue to present a positive trend in spite of its many brands and some well-running markets.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, in July Brody the VW brand was mainly in Western Europe and again burdened the total sales, as the company quoted in the Dax.</seg>
<seg id="8">Worldwide, the VW brand sold 449100 cars to 1.8 percent fewer vehicles in July than in the same month of the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="9">In Western Europe alone, the second most important market after China, sales were 14 percent below the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the domestic market of Germany, the deliveries slumped by almost one-sixth.</seg>
<seg id="11">Brand Sales manager Jürgen Stackmann introduced the weaker figures from July mainly to two sales days less in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, there has been a reluctance to buy in some core markets by changing economic conditions.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey, the British vote on the withdrawal from the EU also had a negative impact, explained a spokeswoman.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US, where the exhaust affair first escalated, there is also a minus to be booked.</seg>
<seg id="15">Great support for VW is the Chinese market.</seg>
<seg id="16">Overall, the mainly affected home brand of Lower Saxony is still lightly by the diesel scandal: After the first seven months, only a delivery minus of 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles is to be booked.</seg>
<seg id="17">Group Sales manager Fred Kappler continued to have a sales plus from January to July.</seg>
<seg id="18">1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen at this time, worldwide 5.904 million.</seg>
<seg id="19">Volkswagen had been manipulating a software exhaust test.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany alone, VW is calling for around 2.5 million cars to be retrofitted to the workshops.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the course of the changeover, VW reiterated that the conversion of the cars did not have any negative effects.</seg>
<seg id="22">After retrofitting the vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance.</seg>
<seg id="23">After retrofitting, the car manufacturer shall issue a "guarantee-like" certificate to the customer, but do not speak of a "guarantee" as it was called on Friday in company circles.</seg>
<seg id="24">The reason is legal subtleties.</seg>
<seg id="25">The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen now guarantees its German customers a guarantee for converted diesel models.</seg>
<seg id="26">This was confirmed last Monday by VW representative at the Federal Ministry of Transport.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Ministry of Transport confirmed that there was this meeting.</seg>
<seg id="28">"VW has to fully comply with the requirements of my investigative commission and KBA."</seg>
<seg id="29">"Deviations from this will not be accepted," declared federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to the ministry.</seg>
<seg id="30">VW has assumed the guarantee that no deterioration will take place in the case of fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power after conversion and that all vehicle values of type approval are unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="31">Volkswagen itself does not use the term "guarantee", however, as it was called in business circles.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the broad term "guarantee", Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers, for example, will be able to come to a workshop with a motor damage half a year after retrofitting-and this could result in the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is also important in the customer's interest to avoid the fact that any other damage, which has nothing to do with the exhaust gas scandal, comes to uncertainty about possible warranty regulations, as was said.</seg>
<seg id="34">That is why VW does not use the term "guarantee".</seg>

<seg id="1">Raiffeisen Bank Gmund at Tegernsee is asking for wealthy savers in future punitive interest rates-as the second Institute in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="2">Bank chief Josef Paul said on Thursday: "It's only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on Giro or daily money accounts".</seg>
<seg id="3">The Federal Association of German Banks speaks of an individual case and does not see a signal in it: normal savers would not have to worry about paying a rate for their savings.</seg>
<seg id="4">If banks deposit money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they must pay their 0.4 percent penalty rate.</seg>
<seg id="5">From September onwards, Raiffeisen Bank Gmund will demand this fee from private and corporate customers for deposits of over 100,000 euros on Giro or daily money accounts.</seg>
<seg id="6">"The first 100,000 euros are free."</seg>
<seg id="7">"The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year in the future," said Paul.</seg>
<seg id="8">For quite some time he has been herding 40 million euros, which could be lifted from one day to the other and which he could not revalue.</seg>
<seg id="9">"They lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent cost," said the chief.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I can't lie down for every million 4000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="11">The costs are now passed on to the polluter-pays principle.</seg>
<seg id="12">Simply leaving the cash in the safes of the Raiffeisen bank would be far too dangerous: "I have already experienced four raids, I do not like the fifth!" said the bank's board.</seg>
<seg id="13">Most customers would have understood and switched to other forms of investment.</seg>
<seg id="14">Only a few migrated to other banks.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Bavarian Cooperative Association declared: "The ECB's extreme monetary policy stance is causing significant costs for all banks."</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination plates: Who actually buys vinyl records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men of Middle Ages love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you rush to the commentary to sow it under the pseudonym NichtAlleEinsamenMännerMittlerenAlters with harsh insults, this statement derives from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the much-discussed Wiederaufstehung of vinyl records is not due to a boom in millennials, which wants to welcome the news of physical objects, but rather to the mid-life nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are most likely to be aged between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a horde of hobby collectors-it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers tend to keep their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov agree?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog were a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I was walking in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest grey suit and gestuliereing wildly before I stood, holding my hands and saying something decisive like, "So, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Soho is slowly filling up with its charm losing hotels, restaurants and offices now the buildings in which once independent sellers were established-there is still a handful of fantastic record shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, in which I am in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I from sister Ray (data count: Two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckles Records (data number: Eight middle-aged men, a woman, presumably around 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess so," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by email, I did not follow him home), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason he owns such a significant number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy plates that he could not afford when they appeared and again buy items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. Things I was probably a little too young to buy, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy plates are rather introverted and happy to spend time alone, adding: "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.</seg>
<seg id="21">That's my truck.</seg>
<seg id="22">GMT, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets will apply to the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he has also noticed a new wave of people affected by the MEDIENHPE, people who have heard about the comeback and are forced to buy back their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of the conversations I led, people usually got rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of followers of the record revival of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional importance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It only takes a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that record shops provide a soothing community of minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to GMT, some of the older customers took offense to the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record covers, from objects that evoke happy youth memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it may be filling a void or owning material possessions as a kind of consolation," says GMT.</seg>
<seg id="32">It's like a collector and I think it's like that for a lot of people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It's an easy way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"We are like your social workers!" an employee flutes from a stack of plates.</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey by the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to it.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not have a turntable.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this point in the news report, I would probably look very anxious as I leaf through a pile of bossa nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the universe (data number: Three middle-aged men), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"Someone just came in here recently and said," I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead record so I can put it on the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More produktlastig, less musiklastig.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say, "I don't have a turntable."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not elders, who come in slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has devoted almost a whole floor to the records, has a more colourful audience than I go.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who take photos, Teenagejungs and middle-aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops-Wild Beast's newest synthesizer and sexbepackter pop instead of experimental jazz roars out of the loudspeakers-it is good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks very lonely, but nagging mental trauma is hard to detect if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around for a few minutes and is looking at the variety of plates for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It's more of a window shopping than a big shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">She doesn't deserve much, so collecting records is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to listen to music from a computer or other way, but the beauty of plates is... "She drives with a loving sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it-it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I seem to be patterning the jeans hot pants, I'm watching a group of young teenage girls who are grouping around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter think about buying a Crosley turntable.</seg>
<seg id="56">To the left is a staircase, a wall full of plates by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: A mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one looks at them-perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far up that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art".</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and some customers could send into the deep sohos for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one who spends most on luxury items such as slabs.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research has shown that the results of YouGov are correct, they, at least in record stores in Soho, do not take into account the large number of female collectors and record lovers who exist in reality, record shops and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They certainly do not spend their Thursday morning strolling through the record shops of Berwick Street and leafing through slabs, while avoiding the glaring gaze of an uncanny, 30-year-old false moderator who rises above the shoulders of middle-aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court has rejected an offer of the authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live, barriers.</seg>
<seg id="3">At a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that that the state should be empowered to dismantle 72 provisional transactions in which persons within the camp were, from cigarettes to energy, sell, offer hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in makeshift restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Calais prefecture argued that these places should be demolished, because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would entail a fire and sanitation risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups shared with the court that the shops and restaurants were important because the free meals offered by the state-sponsored association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also stated that the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people carrying out the 72 provisional transactions, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were "absolutely comprehensible."</seg>
<seg id="8">The judge Jean-François Molla said that the grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than just feed people who "live in extremely precarious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas provide quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places threatened by low-tearing, was the camp's Jungle Book Kids ' Café, which is run by Gemeinnnützig and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to uphold the kids ' café.</seg>
<seg id="12">In a letter to the Guardian it was said that the closure "for these children would be a catastrophe of which the youngest are eight years old."</seg>
<seg id="13">The two aid organizations help refugees and l'auberge of the migrant estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp had risen to over 9,000 men-the highest number to date-after a steep increase of newcomers during the summer.</seg>

<seg id="2">Germany's speeders have to adapt to the next generation of speedometers: in various federal states, among others in Hesse and Brandenburg, new flash units are being tested, which are intended to make the speed sinners particularly effective.</seg>
<seg id="3">The futuristic enforcement trailers of the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example in accident areas where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.</seg>
<seg id="4">For example, on motorway construction sites or on refurbished bridges with a temporary speed limit, there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide a stationary flasher for adherence to the speed limit.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, permanent mobile construction can be dangerous or costly.</seg>
<seg id="6">The enforcement trailer is self-sufficient: its battery lasts five days with continuous measuring operation, the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem.</seg>
<seg id="7">With laser measurement technology, all vehicles can also be recorded across several tracks simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="8">Variable speed limits as well as transit bans by time, lane and vehicle class can also be monitored.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Britain's 7-er rugby came in the final on Thursday night to an abrupt halt at the last hurdle in the form of the Fijis, when they were beaten with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji awarded a master class in handling, side stepping, back, line and raw power to win gold-their first Olympic medal of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was sweetened by the not too bad consolation price of the silver medal-Britain's fourth on that day-and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semifinals on the same day could fall back on them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of this, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in its best form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It might be a consolation for GB--but it probably won't--that at least one Brit tomorrow will have a gold medal hanging around his neck: Fiji's head coach Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind it.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, she lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens under Ryan.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This setback will hurt, but the progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started out wonderfully and made the attacks GBS bounce out of fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. as if they were running in buses. The World Series winners went 5-0 up as Osea Kolinisau in the corner of Rüberhechtete.</seg>
<seg id="14">With another four minutes of playtime, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner he converted.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A an tackle by Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa to score a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute lete Jasa Veremalua in the right corner a touchdown and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the kick-off and there were still over a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou dashed by further weak tackles of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a goal.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 until the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's like Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB still learns.</seg>
<seg id="22">That's the way it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced fundamental changes at halftime and closed the Fijianische Gap... for a whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half until Joshua Tuisova went through a brilliant intermediate play of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started a trial for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game was long in favor of the South Pacific Islander, whose fans sang, waving flags and danced in the grandstand.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle sounded, the Fijis hugged each other and GB kicked devastatingly beaten in the lawn.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier that day, Fiji had defeated Japan in the semifinals with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a tight semi-final match from the race-Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Boks to the front in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive work and scored a goal among the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late tackling of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-aside team, secured the win and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by battle with the cancer of the trainer to Rudersieg</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no emotinaleres gold than these games, and that will mean something.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first stroke to the last, 220 hard Hieve that go into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though there were only the two who were seated at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. The echo of coach Robin Williams, was present as they rowed to the second Olympic gold in the two without a tax-woman in a row, the first women in the history of British sports, who laid such a yardstick.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolute, after all, their 39th undefeated commitment, which is also unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athletes gliding across the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not completely reflect the nature of the triumph.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in rowing is a battalion of willing helpers, that contribute to the incremental progress that makes the difference and there was no one more helpful than the coach who did not know 30 months ago if he would survive that day when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">Like he said he was risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, which is inoperable, and they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If they don't, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he could start treatment in early 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if that is the right term in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to get better soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran around the station-20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice.</seg>
<seg id="18">That's how it starts.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing in itself is a challenge, but that makes it even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the immediacy of victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve-wracking morning talking a little more than usual, trying to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Stanning, who was a captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment in a mission in Afghanistan, said, "I was an emotional wreck this week. That may be something extreme, but it means so much. "</seg>
<seg id="22">It only repeats how much this means to me how much I and Helen and also Robin have worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin we would be nobody, so a massive thank you to him. He's the best coach in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I could not have wanted a better person to train or a better coach.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to unlock, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very caught at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen cried "Stay in the process, stay in the process".</seg>
<seg id="31">It's really important not to be swept away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not prepared to do something great.</seg>
<seg id="33">We didn't want fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, which we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a time out for a year before it will make decisions about their future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover must appear next week at a wedding, her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backwill.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't mean to say this was my last race.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have meant too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">In London it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="40">It was all so new to me and I was so stressed out.</seg>
<seg id="41">It took about four minutes.</seg>
<seg id="42">That feels so much better, "she said.</seg>

<seg id="12">For other towns and municipalities there are water supply.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current chairman, Mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was hired as a water warden in 1985 and was appointed managing Director of the Purpose Association in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"His tasks have been very diverse and they ranged from Wasserleitungsbau and maintenance work to office and organisational activities, the preparation of budgets, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations at weekends," said the chairman.</seg>
<seg id="15">As outstanding events, she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new Wells (1994), land purchases in the area of the new Wells (1998) and compensation for farmers, the refurbishment of the High Reservoirs (1999), the repurchase of a central computer control (2004) and the partial renewal of water pipes.</seg>
<seg id="16">There has been no standstill and there have always been new additions, because water is life and drinking water is the most important foodstuff.</seg>
<seg id="17">In her eulogy she praised Göllers loyal, reliable and correct service for over 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">He has used his passion for his water association and he has lived the water association as if it were his own company.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of Veitensteingruppe for nitrate reduction in front of the water Forum of the District under Franconia.</seg>
<seg id="20">He received a great deal of recognition and praise for this.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rupert Göller, on his part, praised Water wart Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.</seg>
<seg id="22">He's the best water wart and he was a loyal squire.</seg>
<seg id="23">Together we were an unbeatable team.</seg>
<seg id="24">As a high point from his point of view he described the well-being and the restructuring of the purpose Association.</seg>
<seg id="25">The biggest challenge and the most difficult bet were the pipe at the high reservoir at Kirch Lauter on a 3rd January.</seg>
<seg id="26">Here, at minus 17 degrees, the whole night had to work, so that the localities could be supplied with water.</seg>
<seg id="27">It was also possible to maintain the supply of the Brunn only, because the high tank of Pettstadt was filled with hoses.</seg>
<seg id="28">The management of the drinking water zweckverbandes was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauterbrunnen, who succeeded Rupert Göller.</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel-light view for German steel industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-stricken and energy-intensive German steel industry remains unaffected by additional costs in millions of dollars.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that threatened the industry from the promotion of green electricity are off the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">It remains in the liberation from the renewable energy distribution at the existing plants for the so-called own-electricity production in the German steel industry, said federal minister of Industry Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "West German General newspaper" (Waz, Friday edition).</seg>
<seg id="5">"I am really pleased that we have finally been able to achieve this after two years of tough negotiations."</seg>
<seg id="6">The European Commission, therefore, had initially planned to ask the steel producers who use gas from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the German Industry association, the steel industry was threatened with additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel told the WAZ that there is now a fundamental agreement with the EU Commission after talks with competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only when the generators are replaced in the steel mills will an EEG-deposit of 20 percent be used.</seg>
<seg id="10">But this is also not being raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed Germany's unification with the European Commission for the generation of own electricity.</seg>
<seg id="12">In this way, the status quo of the previous regulation is largely enshrined.</seg>
<seg id="13">The successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry were of particular importance.</seg>
<seg id="14">"With regard to our ' steel is Future ' campaign, this is a first step."</seg>
<seg id="15">"More must follow."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Climate and employment targets are also to be weighed in the reform of emissions trading," said IG Metall chief Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.</seg>
<seg id="17">The steel industry in Europe has been suffering from overcapacity and a considerable price pressure since the 2008 financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year, the situation intensified as the world's largest producer country, China, threw mass steel on the world market in the face of weakening domestic demand.</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel companies of price dumping.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the course of this spring the situation has eased somewhat.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one, import duties imposed on imported steel have an effect, and the economic outlook in China has brightened.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry Primus ThyssenKrupp remained cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lastly, prices were again rather stagnant.</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">Last but not least, ThyssenKrupp did not want to exclude the closure of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the German steel industry, around 86000 people were employed at the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="28">In July, the German steel manufacturers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.</seg>
<seg id="29">With 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less steel than in the same month of the previous year as the Steel Industry Association on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="30">After a short increase in May, the quantity produced went back the second month in a row.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since the beginning of the year, production has been two percent below the prior-year figure.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the coming months, the Association anticipates an increase in output due to an improved order situation.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, mind, health: singing does seniors well</seg>
<seg id="2">The singing has accompanied Ursel tipping her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in the teaching studies she took the music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Singing moves me--emotionally and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal she feels balanced, cheerful and overall more lively, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way she does something good for her health and her mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">After all, singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Field of the German senior League.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describes field.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular co-existence, seniors can establish and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Social and family structures often dissolve in old age, and a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">This experience has also made Ursel tilt in her chorus: "To speak out and organize, to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other-a chorus is a very special form of being together".</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be strenuous in a positive sense, says field.</seg>
<seg id="12">For this, seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly demand their lungs will not be able to get out of breath in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an ideal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">For older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Association of the senior organizations.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, joint singing had a much higher importance, it was part of everyday life, both in school and in leisure, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people arouses many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through lyrics and especially melodies, even dementia-stricken people are reminding themselves of long-standing events.</seg>
<seg id="19">When singing, the head is also required to perform a special performance, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time focus on one's own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers-this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially older people who live alone are practicing not only to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition you learn from singing in the choir, says field.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great compliment.</seg>
<seg id="24">Self-esteem is also growing as a result of singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: if I practice for a long time, I will be better and grow beyond myself-this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start singing are enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">If you want to try out a new hobby, you should not hesitate-even if he thinks you have little talent, Lenz advises.</seg>
<seg id="28">You do not sing alone-with 50 singing people, who hears when a sound goes wrong?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the right offer, seniors have different options, says field.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone from the known Circle sings in a senior choir, you can simply join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer views of the choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Anyone wishing to sing in a church choir can directly contact the church or the church's head.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Those who do not have access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbors for help with internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">If you want to sing, be sure to join a choir, advise field.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing is good for the soul and has something liberating-that applies to all ages.</seg>

<seg id="1">Cats respond more sensitively than hangovers on cries of young</seg>
<seg id="2">Biologists in Hanover have investigated the effect of calling cat babies on adult animals.</seg>
<seg id="3">To her surprise, the meowing also caused the males not to be cold-however, in contrast to the females they always behaved the same.</seg>
<seg id="4">Female cats can recognize the level of arousal of cat babies at the meowing of the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="5">They react by ten percent faster to the lute of kittens, who feel in great distress, as scientists have found out from the veterinary college and the medical School Hannover (MHH).</seg>
<seg id="6">Tomcats also react to the calls of kittens-but always the same.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Apparently the acoustic differences between the meowing of less and strongly excited young animals for the males are either not perceptible or not significant," said the biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.</seg>
<seg id="8">She is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the "BMC Evolutionary Biology" magazine.</seg>
<seg id="9">In a previous investigation, the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the kitten cries differed with the urgency of their need for help.</seg>
<seg id="10">A total of nine adult hangovers and eight females from the animal husbandry of the mhh were observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">They were played on a call of little ones, who were taken out of the litterbox for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings.</seg>
<seg id="12">On the other, they were confronted with cries of more excited kittens who were additionally lifted.</seg>
<seg id="13">The researchers consider their results to be meaningful despite the small sample.</seg>
<seg id="14">"All the females, even those who have not had their own offspring, reacted in a differentiated manner to the cries," said Konerding.</seg>
<seg id="15">They turned faster to the loudspeaker when this call of the more excited kittens played.</seg>
<seg id="16">This ability may be inbred or develop with sexual maturity.</seg>
<seg id="17">"One surprise was that the males reacted at all," said the biologist.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the past, scientists have been investigating the reactions of women and men to baby sounds several times in humans.</seg>
<seg id="19">Some studies also showed that women reacted more sensitively to infants, whether they were mothers or not, reported the biologist Marina Sage.</seg>

<seg id="2">Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Turkey, a warrant has been issued against the former football star Hakan Sükür.</seg>
<seg id="4">He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.</seg>
<seg id="5">For the first time after the coup attempt, an important football match will take place in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="6">Before the duel of the arch between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul around the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: "Business as usual" is announced.</seg>
<seg id="7">Even when the state of emergency was imposed after the overthrow in July, the Government affirmed that the everyday life of ordinary citizens should not be affected.</seg>
<seg id="8">But this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, which is blamed for the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="9">It does not stop there before football.</seg>
<seg id="10">Against the former star kicker Hakan Sükür, the prosecutor made a warrant.</seg>
<seg id="11">Thus, the Sükür now living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.</seg>
<seg id="12">Sükür is to be followers of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is blamed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the state of emergency, which was initially imposed for 90 days, still applies until October, in fact it has almost no effect on the lives of most Turks.</seg>
<seg id="14">The nightly "Democracy guards" in public places across the country have declared Erdogan to be finished on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="15">The sport is-like the whole country-divided into followers and opponents of Erdogan.</seg>
<seg id="16">Especially fans of the workers club Besiktas do not traditionally count among the friends of the President.</seg>
<seg id="17">What unites the majority of Turks, however, in the face of dramatic experiences in history, is the strict rejection of military coups.</seg>
<seg id="18">Even the fans agree-no matter if your heart beats for Galatasaray or Besiktas.</seg>
<seg id="19">At the Cup Winner "Gala" it will be especially on Lukas Podolski arrive again.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Cologne proved its sporting value in the past season: with 17 goals and nine originals in all competitions, the 31-year-old finished his first season as top of his club.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the final against Fenerbahce he scored the 1:0 victory.</seg>
<seg id="22">The newspaper "Fanatik" cheered him: "He was the best on the pitch."</seg>
<seg id="23">He completed the season in an excellent way and secured the trophy for his team.</seg>
<seg id="24">Thanks to "Poldi", the disappointing season for the record Master was a conciliatory conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="25">After the preliminary round-K. O In the Champions League, the "Lions" also distinguished in the European League early.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the Süper League, it was only enough to rank six.</seg>
<seg id="27">The season was not good.</seg>
<seg id="28">The trophy was the only way to win something.</seg>
<seg id="29">"We have done that and that is the most important thing," said Podolski.</seg>
<seg id="30">For master Besiktas the year was better.</seg>
<seg id="31">Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who, with 26 season hits as Süper-Lig top scorer, laid the basis for the 14th title.</seg>
<seg id="32">That is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="33">In the process, the one contracted by the AC Florence and rented to Besiktas only Gomez after the coup attempt announced that he would not return due to the political situation in the country after his em-holiday.</seg>
<seg id="34">"If Mario wants to come to us, he only has to say it", the magazine "kicker" quoted Clubchef Fikret Orman.</seg>
<seg id="35">However, the striker would have to be willing to forgo about one third of his annual salary estimated at 7.5 million euros, Orman clarified: "We cannot pay his salary at Florence".</seg>

<seg id="12">He has already been banned for doping two times (2001 and 2006 to 2010).</seg>
<seg id="13">Since its spell, the 2004 Olympic champion and former world champion have been running even faster than before, he is the world's number one in 9.80 seconds and is considered the Usain Bolt's biggest challenger.</seg>

<seg id="1">Bomb terror in Thailand-Austrian injured-several deaths</seg>
<seg id="2">The Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, said the spokesman of the Foreign Ministry, Thomas Schnöll, Friday morning.</seg>
<seg id="3">She had suffered cuts and had been treated in the hospital, but had already been able to leave.</seg>
<seg id="4">Her journey home was planned for the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="5">Whether the further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon are also affected by Austrian citizens, is still unclear for the time being.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities, says Schnöll.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Hua Hin, located approximately 200 km south of Bangkok's capital, was first exploded on Thursday evening in an nightlife quarter.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the police, a Thai was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Friday morning, two explosives were raised again, and another person was killed according to the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="10">Phuket also reported a bomb explosion in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the detonation near the beach Patong, popular with holidaymakers, a taxi driver was injured according to police information.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Surat Thani, on the southeast coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing an urban employee.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the authorities, the explosives were blown up in a flower bed in front of the coastal police station.</seg>
<seg id="14">Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwest coast and Chumphon on the southeast coast demanded several injured.</seg>
<seg id="15">You go from a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it was said.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The bomb attacks bear the same handwriting," said Army general Danai Kritmethavee Friday morning to journalists.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We assume that this is a coordinated attack."</seg>
<seg id="18">It is too early to comment on possible motives, but it is probably the deeds of Muslim rebels.</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to see a pattern in the attacks that is typical of the bomb attacks of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, stated that the attacks were not linked to the Islamist insurgency or international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"This is only local sabotage, which is limited to limited areas and provinces," said a spokesman in Bangkok.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rather, it is assumed that the bombs were placed by opponents of the ruling military junta.</seg>
<seg id="23">In recent days, the authorities would have received intelligence on impending attacks in the south of the country-but they were not informed about the exact time and places.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police instructed their officials throughout the country to reinforce security around important government buildings as well as airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Thailand there are always smaller bombings, but they are usually not directed against tourists.</seg>
<seg id="27">In Hua Hin is a palace used for years by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">After the present bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its homepage that the instructions of the Thai security authorities must be guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="29">High security risk (Security Level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and environs.</seg>
<seg id="30">After clashes between the security forces and Muslim populations, it is not advisable to travel to these provinces.</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased security risk (Security Level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution prepared by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This also gives the military great influence in the years to come.</seg>
<seg id="34">Junta chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-Cha said the bombs were an attempt to wreak havoc, while the country was moving towards stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Militärunta, which had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, is self-sufficient to have brought the kingdom back to stability and order.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, the military has not managed to get hold of the rebellion of Muslim rebels, which has been simmering in the extreme south of the country for many years.</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have already been killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">Just under a year ago in Bangkok, 20 people were killed in an attack on a popular Hindu shrine-most of them foreign tourists.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was the bloodiest attack of the country's recent history.</seg>

<seg id="1">The right "identitary movement" is in the sights of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="2">According to several provincial offices, the constitutional activists in the Confederation have also put the group under observation.</seg>
<seg id="3">"We see the ' Identitarian movement ' as evidence of aspirations against the Liberal Democratic fundamental order," said the head of the German press agency, Hans-Georg Maaßen, of the Deutsche Presse-office in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="4">Thus, immigrants of Islamic faith or the Middle East are defamed in extremist ways.</seg>
<seg id="5">That is why we are observing the movement now.</seg>
<seg id="6">The "Identitary movement" is a group with French roots which has been active in Germany since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is opposed to "multicultural delusion", "uncontrolled mass immigration" and the "loss of one's own identity through alienation".</seg>
<seg id="8">Constitutionalists in nine federal states-Bremen, Bavaria, Hesse, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia-are already observing the "Identitarian".</seg>
<seg id="9">Maaßen said his authority was in close coordination with the provincial offices in the decision.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Groups like the ' identitary movement ' are trying to pick up their target group where it stands," said the chief of the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="11">In general, extremists try to address them with youth-just language, often with pop music.</seg>
<seg id="12">This is what Islamists and right-wing extremists do.</seg>
<seg id="13">This is not cooperative advertising for one's own cause.</seg>
<seg id="14">The propaganda is supposed to appeal to people emotionally.</seg>
<seg id="15">Young people are particularly susceptible to this.</seg>
<seg id="16">That's dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lastly, there had been reports from several federal states on contacts of the "Identitarian" to AfD politicians.</seg>
<seg id="18">Maaßen said he had no knowledge of this.</seg>
<seg id="19">For the protection of the Constitution, possible contacts of this kind are only relevant at some point.</seg>
<seg id="20">It depends on whether the respective party-in this case the AfD-by certain persons who are extremist, changes their target direction and becomes so extremist.</seg>
<seg id="21">The decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is not recognizable.</seg>
<seg id="23">In view of the significant increase in right-wing crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelters, Maaßen said he would not yet speak of new Right-wing terrorism in this context.</seg>
<seg id="24">But we have noticed in recent years that there can be terrorist structures on the right.</seg>
<seg id="25">There was the group ' Old School Society ' or the ' distal group '.</seg>
<seg id="26">It may well be the case that further legal terrorist groups or microgroups are formed, which plan attacks against asylum seekers, against refugee homes or attacks from other right-wing extremist motives.</seg>
<seg id="27">However, a nationwide or Europe-wide control of legal terrorism is not recognizable.</seg>
<seg id="28">The previous groups were created at the regional level or in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="29">Maaßen expressed concern about the fact that many attacks were made on the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right scene.</seg>
<seg id="30">That is the worrying.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum seekers have not previously been known as criminals, politically motivated offenders or supporters of the right-wing scene.</seg>
<seg id="32">"So many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists who might have been politically indifferent or, for example, elected CDU, SPD or leftist, who have radicalizeded by right-wing extremist sentiment."</seg>

<seg id="2">The Olympians or world records do not always determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the aquatic center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that he was temporarily no longer seen in the TV pictures.</seg>
<seg id="5">He just disappeared-no matter how far the neckline was selected.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the social networks, they then became viral Internethit.</seg>
<seg id="7">In fact, the 24-year-old ended its lead with a backlog of 48 seconds and occupied the 59. Place of 59 starters.</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was rather its not just a sporty figure, which attracted the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why does the 24-year-old still participate in the Olympic Games?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian was given a start to the International Swimming Federation.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is being distributed to make swimming in the underrepresented countries more famous.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since in Ethiopia most athletes run, they just wanted to do something different.</seg>
<seg id="13">Preparation is everything: Robel Kiros got ready for the big race.</seg>
<seg id="14">The first nicknames quickly made the rounds.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some media referred to him as "Robel of the Whale".</seg>
<seg id="16">Following a "Prosperity belly", the English tabloid "The Sun" made fun of him with "dad bod".</seg>
<seg id="17">His time, he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter freestyle, played no role.</seg>
<seg id="18">Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">At the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Eric Moussambani's run provided media attention.</seg>
<seg id="20">The appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea was unforgettable when he had to compete on his own in a prerun of 100 metres of freestyle.</seg>
<seg id="21">frenetically, Moussambani was cheered at that time.</seg>
<seg id="22">The then 22-year-old learned to swim only eight months before the Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.</seg>

<seg id="1">GfK leadership takes off after disappointing business figures</seg>
<seg id="2">The consumer research company GfK exchanges its chief Matthias Hartmann.</seg>
<seg id="3">The resignations came suddenly-but not surprisingly.</seg>
<seg id="4">The difficult situation of the market research company GfK suggests that the chair of CEO Matthias Hartmann becomes all the more unsure, the longer the successes he promises.</seg>
<seg id="5">Turbulence at the forefront of the Nuremberg market research company GfK: After disappointing business figures and the resignation of corporate management, the world's number five in the industry is facing a new beginning.</seg>
<seg id="6">GfK Executive Board chairman wants to leave the company at the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="7">The chairman of the GfK Supervisory board, Arno Mahlert, has already resigned from the supervisory board with effect from 12 September.</seg>
<seg id="8">As early as September 1, the Management board member Gerhard Hausruckinger, the company, has already taken over the leadership.</seg>
<seg id="9">He should officially assume the function of a "board spokesman" until a successor to Hartmann is found.</seg>
<seg id="10">As a reason for the resignations, the company called "different views" on the long-term business policy orientation.</seg>
<seg id="11">Details did not want to call a company spokesman on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="12">Those who will lead the market research company in the future are still unclear at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the case of investors, it was said on Friday that the shareholders had recently been disappointed with the continuing success of the restructuring initiated years ago.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr. Hartmann has been at the top of GfK since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="15">"The fruits of the restructuring are still not visible after 5 years," it said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Given the recent poor GfK business figures, each shareholder will eventually become restless.</seg>
<seg id="17">"If that were the case with BMW, that would also make the Quandts so," it said.</seg>
<seg id="18">After setbacks in the previous quarters, the company had not been able to stop its loss-taking in the second quarter of 2016.</seg>
<seg id="19">At 361.2 million euros, sales were 6.1 percent below the level of the same quarter of the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="20">In relation to the first half of the year, sales shrank by 3.4 percent, with 721.2 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="21">Profit in the second quarter was mainly due to the lower value of the company in view of its difficult economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="22">The goodwill amortization of 139 million euros, which was necessary in the Consumer experience business unit, gave the group a loss of 148.2 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the second quarter of 2015, GfK still generated a net profit of 19.7 million.</seg>

<seg id="1">The fee per cubic metre of wastewater is from 1 October 2016 for the area of the wastewater plant Neudorf/reuth/Welschenkahl 3.44 instead of 2.10 euros; For Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp 3.36 euro (previously 2.26 euro) and for Azendorf 3.64 euro (previously 2.18 euro).</seg>
<seg id="2">At the plant in Azendorf, the wastewater charge will increase once again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">After an approximate calculation, the wastewater price in Azendorf will be at 4.37 euros per cubic metre.</seg>
<seg id="4">As Mayor Bernd Steins (CSU) reported, when approving the budget by the District Council of Kulmbach, it was found that these sewage plants were under cover.</seg>
<seg id="5">The market Kasendorf is obligated to operate the plants in a cost-comprehensive and legal basis.</seg>
<seg id="6">From 1 October 2016 the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial enterprises from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to dig deeper into the purse.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As managing director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the panel, a recalculation of the fees for the sewage systems of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over-or under-coverings from the previous calculation period were also to be offset.</seg>
<seg id="10">The serious increase in fees was justified by Schmidt's fact that all three sewage plants were relatively small facilities with a very small wastewater attack, which was between 6800 and 12000 cubic metres per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, due to the low distribution base, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the volume of wastewater in all three plants is slightly declining.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, the previous calculation period for all three plants was not least due to their old-age renovation and repair expenses to a considerable extent.</seg>
<seg id="14">The plant in Azendorf was nearly 30 years old, the plants for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt pointed out that in the sewage system Azendorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the pumping Welschenkahl the nearly 20 years old conveyor systems had to be overhauled from the ground up and at the pond sewage treatment plant Lopp had to be excavated after nearly 20 years of operation of the first Klärteich, the sewage sludge is disposed of and an additional ventilation facility can be installed in order to be able to comply with the water regulations.</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: "These extraordinary expenses were attributable to the amortisation and maintenance costs, which have to be taken into account in the new calculation period."</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which were still significantly below the current level during the previous calculation in the years 2011/2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made it clear that in the small wastewater seizure in the three plants the expenses for the operation and maintenance are "fully penetrated".</seg>
<seg id="20">In the process, Schmidt added that the market community had been spared from large-scale entertainment costs in wastewater treatment facilities over the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="21">According to stone houses, the situation for the aforementioned plants will remain precarious in the long term, especially since it is not possible to extend the supply area of the sewage Zweckverbandes Frisian Brook around these plants because they are deficit facilities.</seg>

<seg id="1">Snapchat "anime" effect criticized as Asian cartoon</seg>
<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say that it is insensitive to breeds.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filtering tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that borders on the absurd.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that might be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are blunt, feature twisting tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All missteps reach the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have in the past been criticized in which they were accused that the app would promote blackface or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When this week some users suggested a filter that gave them slit eyes, false teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians-"yellow face".</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered whether these repeated controversies pointed to a bigger problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and outrage were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from the Verge and motherboard, one day after Snapchat informed that it would have disabled the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was intended as a tribute to anime characters and not as a caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced racism reminded the filter of infringing clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the anime comparison decidedly.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an email, Grace Sparapani wrote, a Korean-American art student whose tweet was widely spread over the photos that the filter was "offensive and mildly uncomfortable."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it was difficult to argue with the contrast of a very disgusting Asian caricature and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not gelbgesichtig, but that the yellow face was dragged into the devaluation extremity.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stumbling wires.</seg>
<seg id="18">American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in our hands.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats large audiences of young people-who are more diverse than their older counterparts in terms of race-could be more likely to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">When one of Snapchats filters creates an image that is offensive to a user, "it is much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed when it was previously the case," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay for medium and in a telephone interview she said that they believe that racial controversy reflects a lack of diversity in recruitment practices at Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticized the large part of white, only male leadership, and finished her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors who work there but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say something about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat largely left unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and indicates its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural background of his employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a personnel manager who focuses on underrepresented population groups and on internal integration efforts.</seg>
<seg id="28">Zhu said that she will leave her Snapchat account closed and added, "I wonder if you need more users like us to be able to say that this is not OK."</seg>

<seg id="1">Military leadership distorts ISIS Secret Service information, Committee of Congress notes</seg>
<seg id="2">Military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the actual conditions on the ground would have allowed, a congressional committee of Inquiry reported in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The preliminary report, created by a task force of the Republican members of the Streitkräftekommitees, Geheimdienstkommitees and the Wehrbudgetkommites, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, abbreviated Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Intelligence information, which were typically nod by high-ranking CENTCOM commanders, regularly drew a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism than the actual conditions on the ground had allowed and were consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence services," a newspaper article quoted the report.</seg>
<seg id="6">"What happened in the CENTCOM is unacceptable-our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives.</seg>
<seg id="7">The leadership errors in the Centcom range to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows in detail persistent problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct evidence that government leaders under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts have faced pressure from their superiors to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"During the first six months of 2015, many Central Command press releases, opinions and statements before the Congress were much more positive than the facts", the report noted.</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a CENTCOM member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could begin already in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"After months of investigation, is so clear." said Mike Pompeo, Republican congressman from Kansas, in an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="14">From mid-2014 to mid-2015, Central Command leaders changed intelligence reports to downplay the threat of ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans launched the task force after they were told that analysts were concerned about manipulating reports on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while the investigations will continue.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigations of the CENTCOM reports by the inspector General of the Ministry of Defence are underway.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Nachrichtendienstekomittees published their own findings on Thursday, which coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"In the years 2014 and 2015, the Centcom created an overly limited process for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," the ranking Democrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, announced in an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="20">This process, Mr. Schiff, "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," damaged morale among analysts and "gave excessively little room for divergent opinions."</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats stated that they had not found any evidence of a White House's intervention in the CENTCOM analysts regarding a "certain political opinion".</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the congressional investigations were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast".</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the General Inspector of the Pentagon, which were recorded after complaints from CENTCOM analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a press officer at the Pentagon, stated in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on congressional reports, while the investigations of the General inspector were still underway.</seg>
<seg id="25">But he also stated that "experts sometimes have divergent opinions about the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions beyond the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Defense Ministry).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the accusations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the central command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism regarding the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of disputes of more than ten years ago, as a CENTCOM analyst, Gregory Hooker, a document written about how the then government under George W. Bush, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, had only a small occupying force in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current coverage of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team of Mr. Hooker stated, according to government agencies, contrary to the Government's statements against the refiners held by the Islamic State, there would be no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these provisional refineries would have been put into operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, this knowledge was not published, The Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcoms then commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin was retired in April and was passed by the Central Command. Replaced Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="1">The USA wins fourth match in the field of women's hockey, a showdown with Britain is imminent</seg>
<seg id="2">One day after shooting three goals during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five goals in two games were supposed to be a memorable achievement, but BAM (27) said she couldn't remember ever doing that.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I don't belong to the people who keep their goals in mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">She knows, however: the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are in their group with the British women in the first place, who remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Great Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals, the game will decide which of the two within their group of six teams will win the first and second place respectively.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first-placed will take a little longer to the strong Dutch in the direction of the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">However the game may go out on Saturday, the Americans have caused a startling whirl through their success story, four years after they landed at the last of the 12 seats in the last London Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years of playing a hockey bat in her hands (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), at age 16 she became national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympics in 2008 because she could not qualify for the squad.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012, in which everything went wrong for you and your team.</seg>
<seg id="15">The following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the national team, began to turn things up for the better.</seg>
<seg id="16">"A change of culture, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the workload in London, which we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have been able to pull the rudder completely around.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening, BAM opened the Torreigen in the first half of the game with a backhand from the close range.</seg>
<seg id="20">India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until BAM took the game into their hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and lupfte the ball into the gate to give the American in a 2-0 leadership.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the goalkeeper of the United States, Jackie Briggs, who had previously booked a goal in each of the previous games.</seg>
<seg id="24">She's got a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"We are in a good position" said Parnham, but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the midst of the rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, whatever the time, it's the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constantly and inevitably, a frenzied relay race between competition and aspirations.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is handed from the crossbow to the swimmer to the gymnast to the triathlete.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the coffee queue, without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the quarrel between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there's Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time in the Olympic Games and a swarm of women with dimples, could well have been among these well known names sent to prime time, built by sponsors and well-being TV advertising, if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even fencer.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic trampoline gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally accepted: Aerial pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast swimming and may it reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I could humbly make arguments for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it debuted in Sydney, it has been so sparsely perceived for the last 16 years that many who, I had questioned, did not know that it is an Olympic sport at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping and had an athlete who made it to the finals by 2012.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jumping has a certain outsider charm, partly because it sounds more fitting for the unenlightened ear for a clown school than the one for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a earthbound enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential-the kartoonhafte tremor of its never-ending lingers impact-but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that it essentially unites.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as "springboard."</seg>
<seg id="22">Aspiring winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a series of falling movements (turning, pikes and somersaults) before they land on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to the official Olympia programme, they are rated according to their execution, difficulty and "flight time".</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medal hopefuls must go further in their pursuit of gold, faster, upward and over, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They not only hunt the finish line or the exit wall, but also a further scornful goal in television broadcasting: those of the world or the Olympic record.</seg>
<seg id="28">The purposeful pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical-and it is enough to even stir a spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I perceive as a bit tiring even when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline jumper is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">Moving forward is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless as an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">Here too there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, no bulging in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition in the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final round of women will be held on Friday afternoon, streaming at 13.00 Eastern time; The men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will broadcast the finals as part of a Nachmittagblocks on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia mania you promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in the general turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the Angaffen and the objectification of male athletes-as the male US gymnasts have recently suggested according to the Wall Street Journal-then Mr. Dooley expects his air-ringing, new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="1">"One generation protests" in Ethiopia, long an ally of the USA</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators calling for political change in Ethiopia came up against the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that tens of protesters were killed during the clashes with the police in the event of gunshots.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just collapsing?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the west with a fast-growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months, protests against the government shook the country and expanded into more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week, thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organizations, the Government's response was ruthless.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen shot and killed tens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">Circulating videos about the protests, which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security people beat young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a hand-held against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights authority now demands an in-depth investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats beyond the region, particularly in Somalia. Only a few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western aid.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a remarkable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved drastically-there is a new commuter in the capital city of Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy-human rights organizations have continually led the oppression of the government-the opposition in the country has been curtailed, with dissidents effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent to exile or to prison, killed or driven into the vast expanse of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"If you suppress people and have no other options other than protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">One generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints covering everything from land use to stranglehold on power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea; A struggle for this jagged, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, who have been more or less vanquished in recent years, can exploit the turbulence and re-arm themselves.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of pre-Hinköchelnsing under the surface now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years have many Ethiopians been able to communicate through the social media, since cheaper smartphones have become more frequent and the Internet services have improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government is blocking access to Facebook and Twitter, which it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies that hide where they are staying.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians stated that they were thus gathered to protest.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons, prospered Amharas, which come from Äthopiens predominantly Christian Highlands, in politics and economy, while they yielded the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in lowland lands.</seg>
<seg id="37">But that also changes right now.</seg>
<seg id="38">"We are about to coordinate under one umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group who make up about 6 percent of the population and who are dominant in the military, secret services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the riots is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was the Prime Minister of Ethiopia until his death in an unpublicized disease in 2012 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say he was particularly adept at perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special envoys to deal with opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"The current regime lacks this basic skill," said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst.</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively opaque reasons to take on the position of Mr Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say he does not enjoy the confidence of the Tigray controlled security services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia experienced such a riot was in 2005, after thousands of counter-elections were protested, according to analysts, apparently botched by the government and subsequently stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the ensuing raids, many protesters were killed, even though it was less than in the last few months and this time of unrest was passing relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter, and for their measurable progress in combating poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the Ethiopian Government's internal grudge.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes on a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, protesters attacked in Gondar, a Amharic city, from Tigray-led businesses and the hatred towards the Tigray is becoming more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflüge over neighboring Somalia, even though she recently said that it has closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West is clearly willing to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile area.</seg>
<seg id="59">"This," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin tightrope hike."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his claim Obama had been founded ISIS was "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">On Friday, Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign by stating that his repeated assertion that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the terrorist group of the Islamic State was not meant to be serious.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raised new questions about the communication capabilities of the Republican presidential candidate on whether he was able to communicate clearly and with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings his comrades, who seek to protect him during an eventful phase, in the peculiar position of having to explain statements that he could not have meant at all.</seg>
<seg id="5">After making the hint at a campaign event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump rowed back in relation to the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to imply that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just being sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was the contrast to the previous day that Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he meant the accusation completely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative radio presenter Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism patters down on Mr. Trump while he was trying to focus his campaign on the economic situation due to falling survey values.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton kept talking about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this topic again.</seg>
<seg id="12">Reporting on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he had found her speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he drew strong criticism when he said the Russians were to hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he explained, "Of course I meant that sarcastically."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then rowing back as needed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans, how they arrive, and then, if necessary," clarify "depending on how the reaction fails." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also believe that he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more caustic tone, as his poll values have declined further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, released on Friday, showed a leadership with great prominence in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump generally tries not to apologize for his provocative remarks, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humor.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he is increasingly focusing attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's jokes have brought his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable situation of having to stand by him, regardless of how provocative his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent advocates, gave himself great effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview from Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," said Mr. Giuliani, so he was questioned about the veracity of Mr. Trump's statements as to whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that before Obama was ISIS an almost unknown, small organization, he called it backbench, completely wrong and that's why it happened because he pulled the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as secretary of state, allowed ISIS to spread out by leaving the situation in the Middle East aggressively under control.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media, accusing them of riding around on each of his words and being biased against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">He mocked the "poor, pathetic" television pundits who try to understand him and said, "You can't do it!".</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the Democrats mocked Mr. Trump's apology as just another proof that he was unfit for president.</seg>

<seg id="1">Once displaced over the price of the market, café comes back in Greenpoint</seg>
<seg id="2">Verb Cafe was a shabby café in Williamsburg where you could only pay for a bar that had no Wi-Fi but served good coffee for 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="3">Of course, was ousted by the prices from his Bedford Avenue storefront.</seg>
<seg id="4">The business soap Cherie, which replaced the verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Locals mourned it as a last loss in a Gentrifizierenden city.</seg>
<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is changing, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is gutted and is now a soap shop."</seg>
<seg id="7">But if New York is a change, it is also a reinvention.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revived Verb cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new verb has wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the Old café, who is the owner and managing director of the New Café.</seg>
<seg id="12">He started working at verbs in 2001 and remained there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a customer offered him to provide funds for a new outpost, he was excited to do it, he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rodriguez, 36, maintained a lot of things.</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb used the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are trimmings such as capers and sautéed onions.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are natural rice bowls.</seg>
<seg id="21">The café does not serve any beer, but there are fresh juices.</seg>
<seg id="22">After nine months, Rodriguez said that he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Many old customers were also ousted by prices from Williamsburg," he said.</seg>
<seg id="24">Recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.</seg>
<seg id="25">Oliveira, 34, lived earlier in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after she had moved to Greenpoint, she would take the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">After the verb had closed, she gave up drinking coffee for a while, she said.</seg>
<seg id="28">"I realized that there was coffee and culture in the verb that I liked," she said.</seg>
<seg id="29">Now she drinks coffee again, even if she ordered a blended chai tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee, which is another new addition.</seg>
<seg id="30">Since the beginning of the verb in 2003, Tom Rosenthal has been a further longtime and loyal customer.</seg>
<seg id="31">He went there before work and inevitably ordered the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I came quarter after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my everything-bagel with butter," he said.</seg>
<seg id="33">Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nowadays Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his everything-bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.</seg>
<seg id="35">Rodriguez said that he had no grudge that the soap business had taken over the old business premises.</seg>
<seg id="36">In fact, the owners of soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for verb with the coffee brewed in the café as an ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="37">"I think we're going to go into your offer," said Rodriguez.</seg>
<seg id="38">And the traditional Polish inhabitants of Greenpoints have also accepted the café.</seg>
<seg id="39">A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said he intends to show them soon, so that his new neighbors will feel welcome.</seg>
<seg id="40">The location also has other advantages.</seg>
<seg id="41">A local Saftlokal wants to fill and sell the cold brewed coffee.</seg>
<seg id="42">There is a chance that the café will expand to a neighboring building.</seg>
<seg id="43">For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.</seg>
<seg id="44">Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said that he was devastated when the café closed.</seg>
<seg id="45">When the new café opened, Whitt said that entering the premises and ordering a new coffee felt like a homecoming.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I had to smell that," he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">The depressing food of the economic crisis in "an abundant meal"</seg>
<seg id="2">In March 1933, shortly after his ascent to the president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.</seg>
<seg id="3">As a foodie, President Roosevelt had a penchant for refined delicacies of Fifth Avenue such as pâte de foie gras and Maryland water Schildkrötensuppe.</seg>
<seg id="4">His menu on that day was somewhat humbler: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and as a dessert a plum pudding.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.</seg>
<seg id="6">Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">Coes last book "Chop Suey" was about Chinese cuisine in the USA, while Ziegelman in her book "97 Orchard" tells about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective.</seg>
<seg id="9">Her latest collaboration, "A decent meal" that will appear on Tuesday at Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="10">They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at the Eisenberg's Sandwich shop for dinner, a small, straightforward snack in the Flatiron district, which has been in business since the 1929 stock market crash.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive scraps, while Coe, 57, ate turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture.</seg>
<seg id="12">When the reporter ordered Meatloaf, this was due to the couple for a discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Rich foods were very popular," said Ziegelman.</seg>
<seg id="14">There was peanut bread, loaf and bean bread.</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve you as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">Coe grinned.</seg>
<seg id="18">"It must have been placed in the stomach like lead," he said.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an all-you-can-eat buffet.</seg>
<seg id="20">Women's teams cooked for male field workers and it was served freshly baked pate for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</seg>
<seg id="21">They were the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War. "A square Meal" records the ways in which the country was no longer the land of paradise.</seg>
<seg id="22">"It was a time when food for the Americans became a central, tense topic," Begündete Coe, why he and his wife wanted to write about it.</seg>
<seg id="23">Equally tense was the new budget diet: Mysterious foods such as breads and casseroles became staple foods, the casserole as "wonderful way to eat leftovers recycle," noted Ziegelman, as cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meat, which was the focus of American cuisine for years, became a rare luxury.</seg>
<seg id="26">Peculiar mixes were tried, as a calorie and nourishing gratification had precedence over taste or even healthy kitchen mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">During her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from that epoch, baked onions with peanut butter.</seg>
<seg id="28">"It was not a popular addition to the Mittagstsich," says Coe.</seg>
<seg id="29">Brick man goes on: "It was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions do not match.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the housekeeping recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">Like never before or ever since, household economists-including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943-drove the eating habits of the country in such a way.</seg>
<seg id="33">By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "household politicians" and to meet the challenge of turning mush like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.</seg>
<seg id="34">"A square meal" is a feast of historical tidbits.</seg>
<seg id="35">Particularly palatable are the reports of the Government's response to the starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's Lass-me-cake-eating posture.</seg>
<seg id="36">While publicly praising the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen, he dined like the million-dollar man of the world to which he has become.</seg>
<seg id="37">"He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," said Coe.</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in an almost gilded dining room and wore a tuxedo.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was gloriously alien to reality.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake, unless his wife Eleanor asked him to make an example with his stomach.</seg>
<seg id="41">As described in the book, hiring a housekeeper with no interest in flavours by Mrs. Roosevelt led the White House to produce the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most bleakly prepared. "</seg>
<seg id="42">Many of the species from the era of Great Depression, dealing with food, were discarded as soon as the country got back on its feet.</seg>
<seg id="43">The legacy is based on our continued focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as on how science was applied to food.</seg>
<seg id="44">The couple gave a better understanding of Ziegelmans's eating habits when writing the book-for example, how they could not throw food away.</seg>
<seg id="45">"She had a real fear of wasting food," said Coe.</seg>
<seg id="46">Ziegelman remembered: "She actually made people sick."</seg>
<seg id="47">There was the wind bag incident.</seg>
<seg id="48">After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, they and Coe drew out a dessert they had prepared at home: The plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.</seg>
<seg id="49">"It is called Prune whip," said Ziegelman, adding that it was a common trick to miss modest recipes a chic name.</seg>
<seg id="50">There was no whipped cream, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.</seg>
<seg id="51">Each one reluctantly dipped a spoon in the tough, brown goo.</seg>
<seg id="52">Surprisingly, it didn't taste bad.</seg>
<seg id="53">Coe picked up three times a repercussion.</seg>
<seg id="54">Like a can-do Budgetierer, he said to his wife, "a couple of chopped walnuts would help."</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: The oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland sharks usually only come to the surface in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to sea after an investigation aboard the research vessel Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born 1624 and swims with a good 1 km/h through the North Atlantic until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland sharks only get offspring with 150 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Greenland swims slowly along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it is on average just 1,220 meters wide.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it counts, the five-metre-long animal accelerates to a whopping 2.6 km/h-and is half as fast as a seal at this maximum speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">This lifestyle, which is characterized by slowness, seems to be a panacea for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" in any case from a Greenland that could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Madness", commented Alexander Scheuer from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock This life span, which means a world record for vertebrate animals.</seg>
<seg id="12">The evolutionary biologist has long suspected that Greenland sharks are old.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland sharks are difficult to observe, after all they live mainly in the Arctic Ocean in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in winter on the surface.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of the Greenland sharks.</seg>
<seg id="17">They measured their slow-motion tempo as they were equipping six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitsbergen.</seg>
<seg id="18">Prey still make these sharks: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, and another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">They may be chasing sleeping animals or patrolling at the bottom of the Arctic Ocean, looking for carcasses staggering from higher levels of water.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues were now examining 28 Greenland sharks, which caught fishermen from Greenland or Spitsbergen from the depths of the North Atlantic between 2010 and 2013.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 inches long, while the largest 502 centimeters in size.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens core of the Sharks with the carbon 14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This center of the eye lens arises even before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein are later no longer renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a remarkable amount of carbon-14 in the lens core.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons attempts hurled larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the 220 cm length third smallest animal, the lens core, however, contained a small surplus of carbon 14 from the nuclear weapons trying, so it should have celebrated its 50th anniversary in its investigation in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">In contrast, all the larger Greenland sharks had normal carbon-14 amounts in their lens core, which is caused by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon 14 clock for a 493 centimeters long Greenland showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimeters might even be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">The fact that Greenland females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers could assign the length to an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres was probably on the threshold of sexual maturity and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland sharks with the multiplication obviously can be at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be the world record for vertebrate animals.</seg>
<seg id="33">The fact that such Methusaleme mainly live in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">The previous record holder, a 211 year old whale, in whose bacon on the nape of a 120 year old harpoon tip, was also trapped in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on a saving flame.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they ripen later and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep themselves warm in the cold water, the animals are also often particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal heat losing.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a Gram mouse is therefore much larger than a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: they have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"A smaller animal lives more dangerously and should concentrate on having as many offspring as possible in the early days," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuer.</seg>
<seg id="42">A very large animal should instead invest its resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="1">Frankfurt profits from the Brexit</seg>
<seg id="2">The city on the main therefore has the best chance of attracting jobs and companies moving from London in the competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg.</seg>
<seg id="3">"It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit vote," says Michael Voigtlander, head of the financial markets and real estate markets of the IW.</seg>
<seg id="4">After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether money houses can continue to operate from London from financial transactions throughout the EU.</seg>
<seg id="5">For the so-called EU passport, you have been granted approval in the UK.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is what large US banks are using.</seg>
<seg id="7">Several banks have already announced to relocate jobs.</seg>
<seg id="8">The lobby association "Frankfurt Main Finance" expects 10000 new jobs on the main within five years.</seg>
<seg id="9">For Frankfurt, according to the IW, the seat of the European Central Bank (ECB), which unites responsibility for monetary policy and oversight of the largest banks in the eurozone, as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance supervision Eiopa and the Risk council ESRB.</seg>
<seg id="10">In Paris, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has its headquarters, but it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The proximity to the central bank is important for banks, as they can communicate directly with the supervisor," says IW Professor Voigtlander.</seg>
<seg id="12">Luxembourg has a large fund industry, but as well as Dublin, the infrastructure is worse off.</seg>
<seg id="13">Thanks to the large airport, Frankfurt is much easier to reach.</seg>
<seg id="14">Further points the city with readily available commercial real estate.</seg>
<seg id="15">"In Paris it is not so easy to find free high-quality offices," says Voigtlander.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Seine also rents for first-class commercial properties by 50 percent higher than the main.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime.</seg>
<seg id="18">In a ranking of business consultancy Mercer, the city ranked seventh, Luxembourg at number 19, Dublin on Place 33 and Paris at 37. Place.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even though quality of life is a matter of preference: "With its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market, Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors," concludes the IW.</seg>
<seg id="20">But, despite the Brexit vote, London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe, the economists say.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also the situation of the forces: in London, in accordance with the figures of the Landesbank Helaba, around 144000 people worked in the banking industry at the end of 2015, in Frankfurt it was 62500.</seg>

<seg id="2">Hillary Clinton published her tax return for 2015 on Friday, which resulted in an income of USD 10.75 million for the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband, and an effective federal VAT rate of 34.2%.</seg>
<seg id="3">In 2015, the Clintons donated USD 1 million for charitable purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; Former President Bill Clinton generated nearly USD 5.3 million in speech fees; The former foreign minister issued an income of USD 3 million from the publisher Simon & Schuster for her book about her term of office in the Foreign Ministry.</seg>
<seg id="4">Clinton's candidate for the vice presidency, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, has published his tax returns for the last ten years together with his wife Anne Holton.</seg>
<seg id="5">They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency," announced Clinton's campaign helper Jennifer Palmieri in an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="7">In stark contrast, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and retracts in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, although they are not obliged to do so by law.</seg>
<seg id="9">Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have stated as a reason for his refusal a tax audit by the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="10">"You are on the train," wrote Clinton's campaign helper Ian Sams on Twitter, regarding the publication of the Democratic presidential candidate.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's special adviser, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish anything before the tax audits are not completed.</seg>
<seg id="12">Trump's critics, including the Republican presidential candidate of the year 2012 Mitt Romney, have already announce that his refusal raises issues relating to wealth, his donations to charities, his business and various other links, especially with Russia.</seg>
<seg id="13">Clinton has already crashed on the subject and published on Friday a video on the internet, in which highly Albanian Republicans Trump invite his tax return.</seg>
<seg id="14">On Thursday, she also addressed the topic during a speech on the economy in Michigan.</seg>
<seg id="15">"He refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and publish his tax returns." She said to the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="16">Politico reported that Trump paid no or very little taxes for two years during the 1990s, and a New York Times business journalist quoted a number of Steueranwältenn and tax advisors on Friday, saying that this could still be the case.</seg>
<seg id="17">Federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="18">Clinton supports a scheme named after the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett who would make sure that individuals who earn more than USD 1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.</seg>
<seg id="19">President Obama is also supporting the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="20">During an election campaign for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate has his seat here, urged Trump to a meeting to exchange their tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="21">Buffett said he was also subjected to a tax audit by the IRS and Trump did "fear" before the voters and not before the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="22">Clinton's campaign has published tax returns by the year 2007.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Clintons who now live in Chappaqua, New York, on average paid an effective federal tax rate of about 32% between the years 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined rate of about 40.5%.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Clinton tax return of 2015 showed that these were only USD 100 of their income as a wage, unlike the bulk of all Americans.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their main financial investment was a cost-effective index fund, from which the Clintons taxed dividends and revenues of USD 109,000.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media riot after he had betrayed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list an Israeli area code, since it had "requested" Arab guests according to an employee.</seg>
<seg id="3">Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah", left his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper Faz.</seg>
<seg id="4">During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the country code list of the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, the country was not listed between the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.</seg>
<seg id="6">How is it possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted in the year 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany?</seg>
<seg id="7">Wrote Lanzmann.</seg>
<seg id="8">Instead, the Kempinksi Bristol offers a way to select Israel via its own call center.</seg>
<seg id="9">Looking for an explanation, the director turned to the hotel reception.</seg>
<seg id="10">The answer he received there, "shocked him," as Lanzmann wrote.</seg>
<seg id="11">The hotel clerk said that the measure was an "intentional decision of the management of Kempinski hotels."</seg>
<seg id="12">The reason behind it was even more anger in the director.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Most of our guests are Arabs and they have requested that the area code be deleted," the employee of Lanzmann was quoted.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great shame", reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung.</seg>
<seg id="15">We were horrified and dismayed by this event.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is really shameful.</seg>
<seg id="17">The fact that this has taken place in Germany in this very hotel chain is even more of a disgrace.</seg>
<seg id="18">That does not require explanation.</seg>
<seg id="19">We expect the hotel to "draw the right conclusions," said the official.</seg>
<seg id="20">The incident triggered a rather large response on the Internet, where people called it a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="21">Some told the Kempinski hotel that it had "given up" the alleged calls of Arab guests.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Be ashamed," it was said in another article, in which it was pointed out that the hotel, located on the noble Kurfürstendamm, is near a synagogue.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hotel quickly dismissed all accusations and called the incident an "oversight" and "apologized" at Lanzmann, reported the mirror.</seg>
<seg id="24">"There was never a direct instruction" not to include Israel in the Quick list, "the Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman for the Kempinski hotel.</seg>
<seg id="25">It adds that the country code has now been added.</seg>

<seg id="5">Of course, further trade expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran, "said Dzhagaryan.</seg>
<seg id="6">He noted that trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent in the first five months of 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, and $856 million fraud.</seg>
<seg id="7">In particular, Russian imports into Iran rose by 91.5 percent and amounted to $697 million.</seg>
<seg id="8">Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $158 million.</seg>
<seg id="9">The trade boom was achieved through deliveries of machinery, land vehicles and weapons, "said the ambassador.</seg>
<seg id="10">Dzhagaryan goes out for this year from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="11">Last year, the Russian foreign representation issued around 35,000 visas, primarily travel visas, to Iranian citizens.</seg>
<seg id="12">Iran also reached the top 20 of the countries, as regards the number of tourists in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="13">One could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia from last year, are broken, "he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the same time, only relatively few Russians visit Iran, something the ambassador hopes will change.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, who have preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization in a good state," he said.</seg>

<seg id="2">A robbery was perpetrated on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Rewe XXL on the Waldbröler Gerber Road.</seg>

<seg id="2">The altar from the pastoral unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Four stages have been managed together.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the time to the next ' of all altar in probably two years, the Oberministrantenrunde St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a pilgrimage lasting several days.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various pilgrimage destinations were examined and finally, it was decided for the Bishop's City of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy with the Open Gate of Mercy at the Freiburg Minster, a special pilgrimage destination was offered.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis from Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and holy rooms made their way.</seg>
<seg id="7">The evening before, Pastor Storost sent the pilgrims out in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the Pilgrims ' crosses and granted the pilgrim blessing.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb it was driven by train to the starting point of Villingen, where there is also a cathedral of Our Lady and so the pilgrimage from Münster was started.</seg>
<seg id="9">The individual day trips were framed in the morning and evening by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and written texts.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way, the Minis on field crosses, chapels or churches repeatedly made a rest to sing together a song from a specially assembled pilgrim Liedheft.</seg>
<seg id="11">The church of the local parishes were available for the overnight stays.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the stage goals, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller made for a tasty as well as invigorating dinner and breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">It continued on the second day via Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">The next day, the stage to St. Peter, which was the most route, had to be climbed at first around 500 meters of altitude and then re-ascended after a sultry heat.</seg>
<seg id="15">The deserved reward was a communal barbecue at the Badweiher.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the imposing convent church of St. Peter, the final stage went to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="17">Visibly relieved and happily, the Minis met at the Freiburg Minster later in the afternoon and passed through the Gate of Mercy.</seg>
<seg id="18">With a little impulse, God was thanked here.</seg>
<seg id="19">At the evening fair in Münster, the Minis of Kooperator Markus Obert arrived at the Pilgrim's destination.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the service the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.</seg>
<seg id="21">The next day was still time for the Breisgaumetropole.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the afternoon we went back to Horb by train.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner raced to fame last night in the men's team sprint at the velodrome in Rio, when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took on the anchor role that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made his own. The young made the legend proud when he stormed home to win a victory from the favourites of New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy clinched the fifth of six Olympic gold.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they took a modest sixth place in March at the rail World Championships in London despite the resignation of Hoys.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as Hindes showed up.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys Retirement created a gap that Kian 'emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man they stayed in when they saw potential in the Scots that has now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny-who won with Hoy four years ago and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hindes was barely back after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner kept it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a large part of the transformation, in which Hindes drove in a higher gear to slow him down and to allow Kenny and, above all, Skinner to keep pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy watched from his position as BBC expert and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they stepped on the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "It's a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set an Olympic record in the finals and defeated the world champions.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just amazing.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph of 2012 on the side of Kenny and Hoys, Hindes admitted that he deliberately fell on the track after a weak start.</seg>
<seg id="21">He later withdrew this statement and there was no opposition from England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such an outstanding victory, there was no such problem this time.</seg>
<seg id="23">Hindes said: "It feels with all the GB flags in the grandstand like London."</seg>
<seg id="24">We've been together as a team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have come so badly from so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win again at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation that won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days in the velodrome.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form Kennys it is in the realm of possible that he reiterates Hoys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be for Kenny-who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, which was also born on 23 March (an apparently holy date for British sport; The day also included Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister)-a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same for Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny is next in the sprint, which starts today and will go on for three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I just enjoy this for the moment."</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with your colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a little lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal contest of the day, but there was more good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified for the fastest performance in the four-kilometer race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at the destination in 3:51,942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was at 3:51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) are held today on the second day of the Wettbewers, where Wiggins will certainly be in the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="42">He had argued with the Commissioner before the qualification yesterday, when he called him officials to measure his body size.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding women's competition, which will be continued and finished tomorrow, advanced Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in Weltrekordszeit in 4:13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team relies on its strong track team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to bring a bevy of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly exceptional portrayal of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">Dramas played out in the background, according to the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid sexism and bullying accusations as well as retiring from greats such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if you look at the first evening of the competition in the velodrome, it looks as if the now legendary call GBS, which has reached its climax at the perfect moment, can be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Future of the melting of Portland due to repeal of the energy contract questionable</seg>
<seg id="2">The future of the aluminium smelting of Portland in Victoria, as well as hundreds of workers ' jobs, is at stake as the plant operator is announcing the energy supply contract and thus canceling all supply contracts, as the delivering energy company announced.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed the government's decision in Victoria earlier this year to award no further subsidies to the operation of the facility.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy for 20 years expires in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs at Alcoa's facility in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">No less than 2000 jobs-direct and indirect-could be at risk of closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, domino effects could occur as the melting consumes around 10 percent of Victoria's total power generation.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014, Alcoa closed the point Henry Melting, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">Alcoa's melting in Portland is losing money and risking closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the years of speculation about the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and lastly due to the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, who supplies the large aluminium melting with his Loy Yang a power plant in Latrobe Valley, said that it is assumed that three other owners will terminate their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The plant is in the majority ownership of a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, the Chinese company Citic and the Japanese Marubeni Corp. hold smaller shares.</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the Portland facility will continue to operate, which means a further physical demand for electricity through the melting," the company said.</seg>
<seg id="14">AGL continued to say that the treaties were so-called "hedges", which should have entered into force from November 2016.</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12-month notice period so that they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Therefore, AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenue in the financial year 17," said the electricity supplier.</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential effects on revenue on AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong futures markets for wholesale current prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL stated that it had already depreciated the value of the contracts in its Jahresabschlus of $187 million in "expectation of termination".</seg>
<seg id="19">Alcoa said that the decision to book the contracts, the "ability of Alcoa... to operate the melting or to ensure the power supply to the melting" is not affect.</seg>
<seg id="20">The US company said it had completed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to enter into force from November this year, even if it is still guilty of a statement as to why it has resigned from the treaty.</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn about the poor economic situation of the industry before the possible closure of the Portland melting in Victoria and the Tomago facility near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">In reference to the statements of analysts at the beginning of the week, the head of operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes around 600 megawatts per year and Tomago around 900 megawatts of electricity.</seg>
<seg id="23">If both plants disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand in the [electricity market].</seg>
<seg id="24">And for us as power generators, that wouldn't be good, "he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September edition of Vogue</seg>
<seg id="2">Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner clan Kris is on the cover of the coveted September edition of US Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kendall, who is the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran at fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on her Instagram account.</seg>
<seg id="4">"In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry," wrote Kendall.</seg>
<seg id="5">The unveiling of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians similar?), scripted reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (with the exception of the problem cases rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the most popular showbiz uncle and producer of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as she forgets the cover of her sister and ends with a classic twist: they have all planned a surprise party.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is the clichéd plot of almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we'd forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit on a square at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to somehow let her other girls take part in this publicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September issue of Vogue has certainly begun a new Era of Kardashians.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendall's big sister Kim likes to have beaten her as far as the Vogue cover is concerned (she and her husband Kanye West were to see it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league by itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September edition is the most sold edition of the Year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a volume that is more like a picture-set than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (according to the fashionista were from the 832 pages of the Tome 615 page advertising).</seg>
<seg id="11">The revelation of his cover star is so eagerly anticipated that in the last two years images of the magazine were leaking before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">In recent years were clearly more "celebrities who model" than "models who are celebrities" on the cover.</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover, a year after Lady Gaga had the honor.</seg>
<seg id="15">But even at the slight chance that Mrs Jenner-who is described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation-falls under the former category, she is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers of today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even if it all applies to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are truly talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had with the release of lemonade one of the most successful years of her career.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course, Jenner's success doesn't appeal to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With her reality TV story, Jenner's position in the fashion world was always somewhat tense.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June, the former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized her and called her "the pieces of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings boiled up again when the news came out with the release of Jenners on the Vogue cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But riding around on the moroseness seems to pass by the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is in the truest sense of the word a supermodel.</seg>
<seg id="26">She's running for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">She's advertising her primer, Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">You and all your sisters sell you pictures of yourself on their respective paywall apps.</seg>
<seg id="29">She sells her pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to Love magazine.</seg>
<seg id="30">And in her free time she is in reality TV. Presumably only to see her sister Kourtney and their children.</seg>

<seg id="2">More than 160,000 of the Hilfsbedürfigsten of the country are dismissed annually by the municipal law centres, while the industry is looking at the effects of further budget cuts on already overloaded transactions.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Queensland, three out of five people – mostly older persons, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who have no means of unjust eviction and the like – are already dismissed in their application for free legal advice and legal assistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Legal services of the municipality, which are already over-utilized, are ready for further cuts.</seg>
<seg id="5">From June next year, it is foreseen that these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds.</seg>
<seg id="6">The director of the Gemeindrechtszentren of Queesland James Farrell said that the last survey of the National Association of Community Law Centers revealed that thousands of people are already dismissed every year.</seg>
<seg id="7">Farrell said the situation would only get worse without a resolution of the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Queensland's Community law centers are chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people are dismissed from important services they need," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">People who leave violent relationships people with unmanageable and oppressive debts, families going through separations, workers who have been unfairly dismissed--all these people have legal problems and this survey shows that they can't get the help they need.</seg>
<seg id="10">The federal government will cut the funds by 30 percent from June 2017, which means that thousands of hilsbedürftigeren people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help.</seg>
<seg id="11">We call on the general attorney and federal designated, as well as senators from Queensland George Brandis, to lift these funds immediately, so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems.</seg>
<seg id="12">Last year, the state Government fulfilled its pledge to raise funds for legal aid to the national average.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is now time to look at the needs of Community law centres and their customer communities, and that the government of Palaszczuk invests in this important work.</seg>

<seg id="2">NEW York: Donald Trump's campaign has been accused of alleged inaction after it was told that its campaign leader for North Carolina in February had a firearm on an employee while they were on a jeep in February.</seg>
<seg id="3">The incident is described in a indictment filed on Wednesday in the Charlotte court by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in this state.</seg>
<seg id="4">Bordini stated that he had waited for months for the matter to be settled internally before realizing that "this would not happen."</seg>
<seg id="5">The campaign leader, Earl Philip, "pulled a pistol, put his right forefinger on the trigger, and rammed the barrel into Vincent's knee," Bordini in his indictment.</seg>
<seg id="6">After complaining to the local and regional campaign management, Bordini noted that at least four other people had already made the same experience with Phillip, he stated in the indictment.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Weapons don't have to be fired to inflict damage," Bordini said.</seg>
<seg id="8">The indictment comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate triggered a riot, when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment people" firearms owners and gun friends should take action in case his rival Hillary Clinton should be elected and appoint judges.</seg>
<seg id="9">Trump's campaign made it clear that the media had torn his words out of context and that he would not incite violence.</seg>
<seg id="10">Bordinis complaint requires compensation from the campaign for the violation of the duty of care and Philip for bodily injury and permanent psychological damage.</seg>
<seg id="11">Trump's press spokeswoman Hope Hicks was unable to reach for an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="12">Attempts to contact Philip failed as well.</seg>
<seg id="13">WCCB, a local news channel in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer a campaign member.</seg>
<seg id="14">He did not respond to calls from his consulting firm, innovative consulting services.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has so far led a controversial campaign.</seg>
<seg id="16">The procedure is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump for President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).</seg>

<seg id="2">In the forthcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (September 4) and Berlin (September 18), significant losses for the SPD and CDU government parties are looming.</seg>
<seg id="3">This resulted in representative surveys of the research Institut INSA for the "Bild" newspaper (Friday).</seg>
<seg id="4">While the red-black government coalition could continue to rule in the north, this is not possible according to the survey values in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="5">In both federal states, the SPD would be the strongest party and would have a good chance of continuing to be the head of government.</seg>
<seg id="6">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD fell from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the survey, the party would be just barely in front of the CDU, which could come back to 23 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">The third place is controversial between the left and the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="9">The left would be 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="10">Despite slight losses of 6 percent (previously 8.7 percent), the green would returned to the Schwerin Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="11">NPD and FDP would not be represented in the Landtag with 3 percent each.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the poll, the SPD of the Berlin House of Deputies would only be 23 percent (election 2011:28.3 percent).</seg>
<seg id="13">The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.</seg>
<seg id="14">It was still behind the Greens with 19 percent (2011:17.6 percent), but ahead of the left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).</seg>
<seg id="15">The AfD would be represented in the House of Deputies for the first time at 14 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">With 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, but the Pirates would miss the entry in 2011.</seg>

<seg id="4">The device weighed nearly half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iphone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was thicker and bigger, so it was not good in the hand either.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was quite clunky.</seg>

<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair CeBIT in Hanover as "office in the West pocket-sized".</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the new mobile phone could be used for then standards a lot: SMS and emails could be sent and received, even by fax the Communicator was reachable.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even access to Web pages was possible via HTML browser, albeit excruciatingly slow.</seg>
<seg id="15">A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna, and the phone could be opened up similar to a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then found a small keyboard and a black and white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The price was quite proud: 2700 D-mark, i.e. about 1400 euros.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">No one could have guessed in August 1996 that the Communicator would be the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Everything has changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="22">The smart phones are a success story, albeit not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Finns ' cell phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster, was eventually sold to Microsoft and settled.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today the market is dominated by vendors who all came much later than Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="25">Be online anytime and anywhere, this is today for a lot of people everyday.</seg>
<seg id="26">In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="27">About 1.4 billion units were sold, with Samsung and Apple alone 555 million.</seg>
<seg id="28">Worldwide sales of the equipment are around 400 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="29">In addition, there are the well-running businesses of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies.</seg>
<seg id="30">A whole industry has been created around the smartphone.</seg>
<seg id="31">The decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only in early 2007, then Apple boss Steve Jobs announced on the Mac world the introduction of the iphone.</seg>
<seg id="32">He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an internet communicator, all by touch screen easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="33">The triumph of Apple began, even today, the iphone is the group's most important product.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nokia, Motorola and BlackBerry, who dominated the market, had a look.</seg>
<seg id="35">They eventually disappeared, BlackBerry has to fight.</seg>
<seg id="36">The saying now have Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung.</seg>
<seg id="37">The smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention.</seg>
<seg id="38">On average, every German now looks to his mobile phone 88 times a day.</seg>
<seg id="39">"We all have to learn how to put the smartphone to the point," said Janina Ball, who is in charge of the Siemens Board of Management for personnel.</seg>
<seg id="40">Permanent accessibility is now regarded as a curse and a blessing.</seg>

<seg id="2">Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="3">For me, this was the biggest attraction in Heathrow, just as it was in London in 2012, when we were doing a great effort to make sure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympics brought great benefits for Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">For our local communities, we will already have 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs, and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.</seg>
<seg id="7">Just as you were ahead of us in London in 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of expanding Heathrow is too great.</seg>
<seg id="8">I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be embarrassed on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be mistaken at Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers each question asked.</seg>
<seg id="11">Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project.</seg>
<seg id="12">Expansion is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in witschaftlichem growth and a legacy of skills and employment both to leave the airport as well as all over the UK.</seg>
<seg id="13">We have a great team at Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment programme in time and budget, from the T5, which was voted the world's best airport terminal for five consecutive years, to the T2 built in the midst of the world's two busiest catwalks.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now you are ready to deliver a third catwalk, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment.</seg>
<seg id="15">The London Games of 2012 were a great success for UK and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is time for us to steer this Olympic spirit and to expand Heathrow, thereby securing our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.</seg>

<seg id="1">Adblock Plus, Facebook in "Cat and mouse" with regard to ad blocking</seg>
<seg id="2">For companies that earn money with online advertising, one of the software manufacturers is trying to circumvent ad blocking, a "cat and mouse" match.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad blocking on its desktop site, Adblock Plus released a blogpost that told users could update their filters in the program to block re-advertising on the social network.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Tuesday, Facebook informed him that his desktop page would change the encoding of his ads to make it more difficult to detect what part of the advertising page it is viewing blocking.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to circumvent the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">In a blogpost, the spokesman for Adblock Ben Williams wrote, that "this kind of back-and-forth struggle between the ad blocking open source community and the outsiders has already been underway since the invention of ad blockaders," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fact that the world's largest social media company has been put into combat is a strong indication of how worrying ad blocker have become for the industry.</seg>
<seg id="8">Worldwide, according to a study from last year by Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people use ad blocker; Almost four times as much 2013.</seg>
<seg id="9">With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook through their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of Facebook's advertising revenue.</seg>
<seg id="10">The company has it on ads blocker on desktop PCs aside, since mobile ads blocker have no effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social Network and Instagram, a spokesman shared with.</seg>
<seg id="11">Advertising on desktop PCs accounts for a sufficient amount of revenue, so Facebook seems to be worth the investment of such a step.</seg>
<seg id="12">On Tuesday, Facebook shared that it would update its "Anzeigenpräferenzentool" to have more control over people's targeted advertising.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters were worrying because they would also block content on the site that is not advertising.</seg>
<seg id="14">"For users, this is not a positive experience, so we plan to address the problem," a spokesperson from Facebook shared in an email message.</seg>
<seg id="15">Ad blocker are a blunt means, which is why we instead focused on developer tools like ad preferences to put more control in people's hands.</seg>

<seg id="2">The victim was in the middle of the night on the highway.</seg>
<seg id="3">The police call witnesses after a woman was run over in the early hours of the morning on Thursday in a presumed suicide of several vehicles on a highway.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.</seg>
<seg id="5">A woman put herself in the dark "in an act of despair" on the street and were hit by several cars, the police said in Vaud.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is obvious that a Swiss, at the age of 49 years, who was run over by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill herself.</seg>
<seg id="7">She died on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="8">Several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, said the police, who ask them and any witness of the incident to report.</seg>
<seg id="9">A preliminary investigation was opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, shared Gilles Hofstetter with the Le Tribune de Geneve.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="11">Was a collision avoidable?</seg>
<seg id="12">This is something the prosecutor must decide, "said Hofstetter.</seg>
<seg id="13">Two similar cases over the last five years show that drivers are not being held accountable.</seg>
<seg id="14">In each of the two cases-in which a person ran in the dark on the highway-it was decided that the motorists would not have to assume that a pedestrian in the middle of the night runs on the highway, as was said in the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="15">Last year, a police officer of the negligent killing was acquitted after she had run over and killed a man who was in August 2014 one night on the A1 near Payerne.</seg>
<seg id="16">The 22-year-old victim had drunk and became unconscious on the street, heard the court.</seg>
<seg id="17">The court found that the policeman--who had responded to an emergency--drove in a justifiable way, and that the presence of a man on the street was a "perfectly extraordinary and unpredictable situation," said the judge.</seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone who has further information on the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under the number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.</seg>

<seg id="1">NASA climate model: Venus was once livable</seg>
<seg id="2">According to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably once livable.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere, could once have shown Earth-like conditions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously suggest that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and still slowly turned on.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably had more arid areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protect it from rapid evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.</seg>
<seg id="10">"In the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exposed their day-side of the sun for almost two months," explained Giss scientist Anthony del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This heats up the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the sun's warmth.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result are average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus similar to the evolution that was previously suspected by planetary scientists.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was once presumably habitable, Venus--over several billion years--was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned away by the ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">When their hydrogen escaped, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect was left behind--the Venus that we know today.</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.</seg>

<seg id="2">Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday as a coach and vice president of hockey operations of the Colorado Avalanche and led a too small co-determination right to the team's decision-making process.</seg>
<seg id="3">Alternative president/General manager of Colorado's Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the club will immediately look for a new coach.</seg>
<seg id="4">"For the past three years, I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations of the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determinedness," commented the 50-year-old Roy in an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="5">Over the course of the summer, I've been thinking long and much about how I could improve this team to give it more depth, need it, and bring it to a higher level.</seg>
<seg id="6">To achieve this, the trainer's vision and vice president of hockey operations must be perfectly aligned to that of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="7">It must also have a right of co-determination in decisions that affect the performance of the team.</seg>
<seg id="8">These conditions are not met at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="9">Sakic, who had hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Patrick has informed me of this decision today," said Sakic.</seg>
<seg id="11">We all appreciate what he has done for our Organization and wish him the best for the future.</seg>
<seg id="12">Roy was awarded the best coach of the league during his debut season at the Avalanches 2013-14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Award.</seg>
<seg id="13">He led the club to 112 points and to the first place in the central vision, but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the playoffs of Minnesota and missed in each of the last two years of the post season.</seg>
<seg id="14">The avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 mark in the 2015-16 season and dropped five points behind the game for a second wildcard spot in the Western Conference.</seg>

<seg id="2">The labour disputes regarding remuneration for oil workers are being suspended, while all parties to the conflict are at the table for a new round of talks, said negotiators.</seg>
<seg id="3">Strikes against the oil field Service provider Wood Group were sporadically carried out on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Wood Group as well as the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to relaunch the settlement process of the current dispute," it says in a common statement.</seg>
<seg id="5">We will be holding a few full-day sessions in the next few weeks that will start early next year to tackle the problems anew.</seg>
<seg id="6">The unions said that their last strike, which is the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent.</seg>
<seg id="7">Wood Group has cut the rates of its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent this year due to negative market pressure.</seg>
<seg id="8">The company's rate reduction follows a 10 percent drop for onshore contractors in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="9">The company said that additional cutbacks give the company the space needed to get through the market downturn.</seg>
<seg id="10">Shell has released for its part thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its business activities as a result of its Megazusammenschlusses with the British energy company BG Group.</seg>
<seg id="11">Energy companies are under pressure as a result of lower crude oil prices, an economic situation that has intensified as a result of the British decision to leave the European Union in June.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission with the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates under the stars of the Pleiades cluster.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data helps astronomers understand why stars revolve in the cluster at different rates and in which context the rotation periods are related to the formation of planets.</seg>
<seg id="4">"We hope that by comparing our results with other clusters of stars, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his age, and even the history of his solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The cluster of stars of the Pleiades is 445 light years away from Earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this cluster of stars, which arose about 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">They're turning out the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">At peak rotation rates, these ripening stars emit large amounts of stellar winds.</seg>
<seg id="9">As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">When a star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow down.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot--such as sun spots.</seg>
<seg id="12">The latest catalogue of rotation rates suggests that more massive stars turn slower than less massive stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with larger stars turning slower pirouettes than smaller ones.</seg>
<seg id="14">"In the" ballet "of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said.</seg>
<seg id="15">As the cluster of stars of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The cluster of stars of the Pleiades provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.</seg>
<seg id="17">There is still much ahead of us about what we would like to know more about, how, when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and, so to speak, hang their "dance shoes".</seg>
<seg id="18">And their colleagues have reported in detail in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Pleiades, which will soon appear in the Astronomical journal.</seg>

<seg id="3">After his emotional resignation, the 41-year-old professional will wear the jersey of his New York Yankees for the last time on August 12th against the Tampa Bay Rays.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I love this game and this team."</seg>
<seg id="5">"I say goodbye to both," explained the 14-time All-Star Game participant of Major League Baseball (MLB).</seg>

<seg id="8">Until the end of the contract on December 31, 2017, he will act as a consultant and youth coach-with full salary.</seg>
<seg id="9">As a player, Rodriguez paid back for a long time with performance.</seg>
<seg id="10">With 696 home, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001-2004) and since 2005 the Yankees he made some milestones.</seg>

<seg id="2">Caught: Due to a positive doping test, weightlifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland in Rio can not start.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio DE JANEIRO-The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.</seg>
<seg id="4">A caught athlete almost won a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the seventh day of the competition, the first official doping cases became known as the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-metre obstacle runner Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were positively tested and excluded in Brazil-immediately before the start of the already critically eyed athletics competitions, these news come to the untimely.</seg>
<seg id="7">At Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, which was used as a masking agent for doping substances, had already been proven last Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="8">The International sports Court CAs confirmed their exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday the 18-year-old had occupied fourth place in the final over 100 m butterfly, only by 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday, Chen would have participated in the rounds over 50 m freestyle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Chen has requested the opening of the B-probe and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee (IOC).</seg>
<seg id="12">The National Association takes the matter "very seriously and demands full cooperation in the investigations", Xinhua quoted from a communication: "We will cooperate with the International Sports Court CAs and will accept the verdict".</seg>
<seg id="13">For the first time in history, the IOC is no longer responsible for sanctioning athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also the night of Rio leaked the news about the positive sample at Danekowa, the 33-year-old went into the offensive.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I had three Tests, all negative, and my fourth Test was positive", this was "an incredible shock," she told the Bulgarian TV channel BNT.</seg>
<seg id="16">She was innocent, "the only explanation could be dietary supplements," explained the athlete.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the report, the banned substance should be the blood doping agent EPO.</seg>
<seg id="18">Danekowa was temporarily suspended, according to BNT, the B-sample should have been positive as well.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgaria's Prime Minister, Boyko Borisov, immediately spoke to the athlete with criticism.</seg>
<seg id="20">"I do not understand why the sportsmen do not draw the right conclusions," he said: "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded".</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, all weightlifters from the chronically doping nation must not participate in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">On Friday the case "Adrian Zielinski" was also known, the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested like his brother Tomasz three days previously positive on the anabolic steroid nandrolone.</seg>
<seg id="23">Both deny the intake, but both are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before the start of the light athletes, the case of Danekowa is another serious blow to the reputation of the entire sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The IAAF World Association had banned the entire Russian team from launching, except for one exception due to systematic doping, even the runner nation Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the sport of swimming, the earlier mispasses in China had also caused fierce clashes between the athletes.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang harshly.</seg>
<seg id="28">"Sun Yang pees purple."</seg>
<seg id="29">"When I see the podium over 200 m freestyle, I want to surrender," said Lacourt on the French radio.</seg>
<seg id="30">Sun was also at the heart of an engagement with Australian Mack Horton.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I have no time and no respect for doping fraudsters," said this.</seg>
<seg id="32">Sun had been tested positively for the stimulant Trimetazidin at the Chinese championships in 2014, but only had to sit for a three-month ban.</seg>

<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeting companies-and are doing so successfully.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey of malware-defense specialists Malware bytes under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of companies surveyed in the past twelve months have been at least once, sometimes multiple victims of an attack with Blackmailer software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already aiming for ransomware blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims readily paid the ransoms required by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the attacked systems and data again.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their blackmail software according to the observations of malware bytes on attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potentially blackmailing ransom will be significantly higher than for private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We are currently witnessing a terrifying rapid evolution of malware," explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski talking to the "world".</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most malware programs were still designed to send advertisements.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the offenders discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private users were the target, but the change to company attacks took place in recent months frighteningly fast.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works on a simple pattern: once active on a victim's computer, it searches for recently modified files such as Word, Excel or database files, as well as archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and permanently delete the originals.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the demands of the blackmailers.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the Endschlüsselungs code to the files, the victims have to transfer money-usually in the form of Cryptowährung bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, where the personal photo database is at stake for private users, companies are sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production stands still.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage is higher if a ransomware strikes.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the German companies concerned reported sales losses by ransomware, 13 percent even had to interrupt the business altogether, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks, whose patients may be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"We always tell the victims: Don't pay, you only promote the problem," explains Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay will get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is difficult for managers to reject the claim of the perpetrators in the face of standstill in the company.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers, in turn, know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, F-Secure's security researchers examined the user interfaces and contact with the blackmailers and came to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain to their victims via chat how they can pay via Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support sites or decrypt free sample files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private individuals are redeemed for a few hundred euros, companies will have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data back unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">With potentially high and relatively risk-free gains from ransomware blackmail, hackers are becoming more professional and sharing the work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski from antivirus vendor Sophos: "A single person can write a ransomware circa within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">It is more probable, however, that these are three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software kit to the actual blackmailers.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous malware kits were created by buying the malware itself, consulting and additional tools for a one-time, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Included is a customization tool so that smaller configurations, appearance, and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmailers then seek out other hackers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service economy.</seg>
<seg id="34">So one logs into one of the forums underground, buys the set from a criminal and commissions another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per infected computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"The criminals usually commission spammers with the spread," explains Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of ransomware is now known to many companies who are better at securing their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of corporate IT executives in the malware bytes survey rely on the ability to defend ransomware with file back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"If encrypting data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful Erpessung, the perpetrators will instead threaten to release sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing," explains malware byte boss Marcin Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="41">This means that the damage potential is much higher than before, depending on the type of data.</seg>
<seg id="42">In future, the perpetrators could also take completely new targets on the internet of things.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the hacker conference DEFCON, security researchers demonstrated how to get control of a thermostat connected to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter, the activation of such a blocked heater could well be worth a ransom for many victims.</seg>
<seg id="45">If, instead of heating, the perpetrators block an entire production line in a factory in the future, ransomware could also become an issue in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="1">One for all cases</seg>
<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use</seg>
<seg id="3">In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupe and even the versatility of a minivan.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds rather cluttered, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the only 1.60 m high hr-V is rather small, the passengers have a lot of space in the front row as well as in the rear, it does not work closely at any point.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the interior are well processed and work pleasantly, only the cockpit top falls off.</seg>
<seg id="7">The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in storage space.</seg>
<seg id="8">There is not only a trunk of 453 l at raised and 1026 L with folded backs available, but there are the "magic seats".</seg>
<seg id="9">This is less magical than it sounds: the seat surfaces of the back bench can be folded up like a movie chair and thus offer storage space that is up to the ceiling 1.24 metres high.</seg>
<seg id="10">The trunk can be loaded well, but the height with 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-L-diesel with 88 kw/120 HP speeds up the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, he should do his job a little more quietly.</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 L/100 km is pleasing.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another motorization: a 1.5-litre petrol engine with 96 kw/130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">A four-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">The driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamism and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the steering should be a little more direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">The equipment in the tested top variant "executive" leaves nothing to be desired.</seg>
<seg id="19">The security systems include the city-emergency assistant (works up to Tempo 32), the collision warning system and the tracking assistant.</seg>
<seg id="20">The collision detector sometimes irritates because it evaluates many obstacles as "approaching objects" when shunting.</seg>
<seg id="21">The remote lighting Assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent tempo control responds to the traffic signs detection and throttles, if required, the speed.</seg>
<seg id="23">The full connectivity is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, Navi, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two usb and one HDMI jacks are located under the armrest and are therefore somewhat awkward to reach.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who do not want to invest so much will receive the petrol from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="27">The engines meet the Euro 6 standard.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the HR-V Honda offers a versatile and everyday suitable car.</seg>

<seg id="4">In the negotiated case, a family on the second day of their Türkeiurlaubs was severely affected by diarrhea and vomiting.</seg>

<seg id="1">De Maizière said that after the violence perpetrated by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were worried about further attacks.</seg>
<seg id="2">The State must act prudently and resolutely at the same time to respond to terrorist threats.</seg>
<seg id="3">Surely, our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.</seg>
<seg id="4">We will not grant this triumph to the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, if offenders had to leave the country sooner, the security and strength also increased the public's consent to the refugee policy.</seg>
<seg id="6">De Maizière wants to achieve the implementation of the proposals until the federal election of 2017.</seg>
<seg id="7">He also announced a further personnel strengthening of the security forces, namely "in a medium four-digit order over several years".</seg>
<seg id="8">Sympathy advertising for terrorism must again be punished.</seg>
<seg id="9">Video surveillance is to be improved, the gun law is amended so that, above all, the purchase of weapons on the internet is complicated.</seg>
<seg id="10">The last much discussed silence obligation for doctors is to be maintained according to de maizières words.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, in a dialogue with the medical profession, he wants to find solutions to how to reduce the vulnerability of citizens, he said with regard to psychic abnormalities.</seg>
<seg id="12">In order to counteract the radicalisation of refugees, the Minister considers that better social care is necessary.</seg>

<seg id="16">It is important that the interior Minister clearly spoke out against Actionism.</seg>
<seg id="17">"That was a slap for the sharpeners in the CDU/CSU," said Gabriel to the newspapers of the Funk Media Group (Friday).</seg>
<seg id="18">De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the union after a burka ban and the abolition of dual nationality.</seg>

<seg id="1">Better traffic flow on the highway feeder</seg>
<seg id="2">It regularly jams on the ring road-here is a picture of November.</seg>
<seg id="3">But this should change: the legal lane should be extended.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is good news for all drivers who are in traffic jams on the road every night when they drive through the motorway feeder (a 43).</seg>
<seg id="5">The state-run road construction extends on the next Tuesday and Wednesday (16/17 August) in the area between the hammer road and the exit Wesel Straße the right turn lane by 700 meters.</seg>
<seg id="6">Drivers can then directly thread right from the hammer road.</seg>
<seg id="7">The big advantage: the traffic is divided more early, which improves the overall flow on the busy section of the federal Road 51.</seg>
<seg id="8">The idea with the extended exit was the CDU group in the district representation Münster-West.</seg>
<seg id="9">The road narrowing on the feeder annoys the drivers especially between 17 and 19 o'clock.</seg>
<seg id="10">On weekdays, the backlog reaches the bridge over the Albersloher path and sometimes beyond.</seg>
<seg id="11">Reason is the needle on the B 51 just before the exit Wesel Straße.</seg>
<seg id="12">From here the traffic is only single via the motorway bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">The second track had to be built back well three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="14">The reason: Static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer possesses the required load capacity, in particular to take two lanes of heavy traffic.</seg>
<seg id="15">How long this bottleneck and the associated work will last a daily congestion can not be said by the competent State company.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, it is to be reckoned with years: because the bridge has an official residual useful life until the year 2034.</seg>
<seg id="17">For the extension of the legal Lane, the national company deliberately chose the less favourable time during the school holidays because of the difficulties with disabilities.</seg>
<seg id="18">The traffic is passed on Tuesday and Wednesday single at the construction site.</seg>

<seg id="1">RESTful night: Tips for sleeping disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening you roll around forever, at night you are awake for hours, and in the morning it is already far before the then to think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but restful.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is with such problems in good company: According to the Robert Koch Institute has about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disorders manifest?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and they can be based on a variety of causes, stresses Hans-Günter Weeß, board member of the German Society for Sleep Research and sleep medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What one understands by land, however, is the insomnia, i.e. a sleep disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">In particular, many people feel that sleep is unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagonman, member of the Board of the German House association with practice in the Lower Saxon Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind insomnia?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disturbances are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">This may include organic, psychological or behavioral factors, but also medications.</seg>
<seg id="12">Often the sleep disorder is the expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Waking up very early is particularly common in a depression," says Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="14">And it may be that different factors cause each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">Those who have a herniated disc, for example, can lie badly, wake up every two to three hours, and may start brooding over everyday problems and worries, Weeß gives an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should you go to a doctor with insomnia?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and are impaired during the day should go to the doctor, advises Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: one is beaten, tired, tired, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is slightly irritable, has mood swings or physical discomfort such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">To alleviate the sleep disorder, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Treatment options include, among other things, behavioural changes, cognitive behavioral therapy or even medications-classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Germany, there are hardly any sleep physicians in the country, stresses Prof. Ingo Fan, head of the Interdisciplinary Sleep Medical Center of the Charité University medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, in case of sleep problems you should first contact the family doctor, advises Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be investigated to determine whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to the sleep lab, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For examination in the Sleep laboratory, for example, doctors advise on snoring with breathing dropouts, in case of morbid daytime fatigue, in sleep transformers or if one does not find the cause of a sleep disorder, explains fan.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't really have to prepare for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend your day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Only please don't make a nap," says fan.</seg>
<seg id="30">After wiring, you go to bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes on the body, you wear a pair of nose glasses, a chest strap and a finger sensor.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera on the ceiling draws the sleeping end.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can affected people handle the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a few set screws on which you can fix for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Weeß counts on: regular sleep and rise times, not too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, do not watch TV to fall asleep, avoid alcohol and do not watch at night-then you start to expect immediately, and that is not conducive at all.</seg>

<seg id="3">In December 2014, he had brought gold for the first time at the world Championships in Doha, and at the same time he set his record at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="4">Now, the former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has put himself in front of his critical ex-teammates on Facebook protecting himself.</seg>
<seg id="5">"In a country where an Olympic champion gets €20,000 bonus and a jungle king €150,000 should not wonder about missing medals," wrote the 26-year-old at night to Friday on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="6">The conveyor system in swimming is bad, but the doping controls are very good.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, a few linden trees, in between a remnant of cobblestones: The Riga Street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not look like this at first sight, but the police are one of the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">Walking down the street from east to west, you will pass by playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a grocery store.</seg>
<seg id="3">Someone sprayed "ugly!" on the façade of a grey house.</seg>
<seg id="4">Opposite of a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, is already built: by 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new rented apartments will be created.</seg>
<seg id="5">Articles about this "trendy district", as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, are, however, in the last weeks preferably illustrated with burning cars.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have lease agreements, but on the ground floor are still occupied rooms and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, Berlin's senator Henkel, in particular, had repeatedly spoken out for a crackdown on the project by the police, the area as a "no-go zone" for police officers and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">On the 22nd of June, the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers had been vacated, patrolled the police for three weeks, according to official statements, with 30 to 40 officials and three team wagons on site, blocked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, construction workers refurbished the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners.</seg>
<seg id="10">On July 13th, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the eviction had been illegal, and a day later, police and construction workers withdrew under the cheers of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">This summer afternoon the road is peaceful: Parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the Sun, others entertain themselves before late.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left-wing violence is not the main concern of many local residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in the neighbourhood since 1999, and Jana *, which draws three children, are mainly annoyed by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the residents of the house projects they share the concern about rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a neighborhood that has a majority wished for police protection from Vandalierenden left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch that the Berlin Interior senator and the police open between squatters and their neighbors does not seem to exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district, which also today has a low average income and high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="18">House occupations and the resulting housing projects have long been part of the neighbourhood: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer Strasse near the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the mainzers had been evacuated under great police command in a regular street battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigas and are still inhabited by the people they had occupied 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and the choice of Berliners from all over the world in recent years: with them, residents from GDR times and former squatters now share their neighborhoods.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also noticeable in the rents, which have risen by almost 60 percent in the case of newcomers since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in Riga are being attacked as symbols for this development: they can be seen on the rolled-up discs or freshly painted facades that have been pelteded with color bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other street was mentioned this year so often along with the words "left-autonomous violence".</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason why not all neighbors see this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as bodily injury are almost exclusively directed against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the offences are subject to damage that tends to hit new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a tenement house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, there can be no question of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As for acts of violence, it is appeasing: the people in the 94 are their neighbors, they certainly have not been.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars have been out of the rigaer for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the architect studied her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "Here one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more from each other, than elsewhere".</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer was deliberately dragged into the Riga road-and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">That's why it was so important to her that residents get back their streets: From the police, politics and the media, who all of a sudden claimed the sovereignty over the district in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away from them: through faceless new buildings in former construction gaps that displace the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"These are, after all, condos that are not interesting for many here-people who are not so well-heeled," she says.</seg>
<seg id="34">"I absolutely cannot tolerate violence and destruction."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what do you do if someone never listens?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the residents.</seg>
<seg id="37">For those who are annoyed by color bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the House projects and the left scene belonged to the neighbourhood.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who move here should be aware of this-just like someone who pulls into a pub district, can complain about noise there badly.</seg>
<seg id="39">All people presented with first names have asked not to be named with their proper name</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee commissioner</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July, Annika Deuschle has been the refugee commissioner for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the team of the administration around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees herself as a contact person for all actors: refugees, the Working Group refugee Assistance, administration, authorities and who else is involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine's client from the Working Group suggests that the volunteers are more than thankful that Deuschle is now there, the egg legend woolly trades, which has above all a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">For example, some-less taunting than the multitude of desired areas of activity-meant that the administration wanted to write out the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">An administrative assistant was sought with a talent for languages and people, coupled with many years of experience in the field of social work, just a egg legend wool trades.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not her central area, says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organizing, working with the local people and also behind the scenes as well as networking.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been around for six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50-percent position on a three-year term.</seg>
<seg id="14">"It was high time," says Regine customer, that Annika Deuschle supports honorary and major players.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers will be in Wasen Street</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem has been for some time now to find housing for the Port refugees who have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">Local authorities are responsible for connecting accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living spaces.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs of building, renting or renovating these accommodations must be borne by the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the District council to the municipality and job.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: There are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">In fact, the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far, it is not functioning, but it is dependent on private housing, according to Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, municipal apartments have to be strengthened, as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So new containers are soon set up in Wasen Street.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine's customer and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a firm stay, there are internships, training places, school places, one-euro jobs and temporary work for refugees and migrants who need to be found or established.</seg>
<seg id="31">"More places would be good," reports Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the yard or help janitors, do charitable work-and that is motivated and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">It hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external impact.</seg>
<seg id="34">That is "no employment therapy".</seg>
<seg id="35">Activity does not mean only work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day need a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So you need offers like sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So here, too, administration and volunteering.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcomed in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the proceedings is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They need to explain to the refugees that it is just taking time and that they can make a meaningful bridge, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Anyone who eventually develops the feeling that he cannot help anyone in Urbach should not work and be useless, he will never integrate.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">But there are also problem cases, says customer honestly, "people who don't do anything". The work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always also to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a mammoth task.</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: have the two after the recent occurrences fear of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"No," says Regine's customer quite clearly, "what some may call naïve". However, a residual risk could not be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also a matter for the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They have the fear that the assassins will completely discredit them.</seg>
<seg id="53">"They want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">In other words, the local and local volunteers need to look for activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">In the background, you will always have a new surge of refugees and migrants coming to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a ceiling?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly, politics is shy.</seg>
<seg id="59">In fact, it is unfair to provide helpers on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="60">"In Urbach we have not yet arrived where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine's customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher are already busy integrating the existing people in a sensible sense.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mostly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But if people are in need, they must be helped, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world is so complicated because there are no easy answers.</seg>
