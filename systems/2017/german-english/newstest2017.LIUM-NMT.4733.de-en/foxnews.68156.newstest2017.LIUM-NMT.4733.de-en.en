Reid says Clinton will remain a candidate for the Supreme Court in the case of an electoral victory in Garland
Harry Reid, the leader of the Senate's Democrats, is convinced that the Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland's confirmation of his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
The majority leader in the Senate Mitch McConnell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the late judge at the Supreme Court Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on Thursday during a phone conference that he expects Clinton to choose "with a certain degree of certainty."
A Speaker of Reid later said that he had not yet spoken to Clinton whether she would nominate Garland and speculate.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team would not worry about a new candidate.
Garland is the supreme judge of the US Appeal Court for the District of Columbia.
RAID said that Republicans blocked the Garland nomination, be Lakaies, and supporters of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also noted that Donald Trump was unsuitable for the presidency.
