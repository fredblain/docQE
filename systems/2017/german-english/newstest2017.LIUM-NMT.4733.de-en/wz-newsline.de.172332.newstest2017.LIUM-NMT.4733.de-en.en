Two women and two men aged between 50 and 61 were arrested on Thursday.
The suspects had committed multiple pocket and baggage steels as bands.

The two men and two men had committed several offences since mid-July, and were involved in a collaborative, labour-intensive and particularly professional manner.
The specialists in the Crime Office 34 can show four deeds to the thieves who have entered Germany specifically for committing crimes.
They used a total of more than 15,000 euros.
