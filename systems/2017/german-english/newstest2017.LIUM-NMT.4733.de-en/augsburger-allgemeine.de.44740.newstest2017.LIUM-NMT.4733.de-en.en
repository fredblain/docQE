Escape: "every woman who fled has experience of sexual violence"
Sexual violence is part of everyday life for women who flee on their own.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers refuge.
Four women sit in a large kitchen.
Each has a baby that is not at most one year old.
One has put her little son in the arm.
He looks with great eyes curiously in the room.
His mother starred on the table.
Until she realizes that she is observed.
She smiling in short and kissing the little ones.
The scene is normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is a business leader of Condrobs, a company for social assistance in Bavaria, and is concerned, among other things, with the issue of women on the flight.
The four women in the kitchen have fled.
They live in the North of Munich in one of the few decentralised accommodation for women and their children in Bavaria.
In January, Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid.
It was officially opened recently.
60 people live there - 40 women and 20 children.
Men do not exist - either as visitors.
The exception is a watchman in front of the door.
"It is not an exaggeration to say: Every woman who arrives here has had experience of sexual violence on her flight," says Bahr.
"Men are fleeing for wars because they are persecuted politically, because they are threatening torture or death, or because their families send them as a hope for Europe," she told.
For women, there are other reasons for escaping: "many are secretly stealing from it, because they do not see any other way out."
In their homeland they have had experience of sexual violence, forced marriages, honour killings, slavery or forced prostitution.
It continues.
It continues to flee.
"It is not rarity, for example, for a bottle of water for a bottle of water," says Bahr.
And women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Who believe that the end of the end, as soon as they arrive in Germany, misses Bahr.
Here, too, single women in refugee accommodation would often be regarded as inferior and, at worst, abused.
This means that approximately 90% of the women who live in the city of Munich are traumatised.
"Some of the children are certainly not voluntary."
Many women are so accustomed to saying nothing.
"Or they do not dare to speak openly about the experience, because the shame is too big."
Because they often do not want to help, it needs more accommodation only for them, demands Bahr.
In Bavaria, the seven regional governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.
Some say "no" to the question of whether they know about a similar project as in Munich in their area of competence.
In the Upper Palatinate and Oberfranken, for example, there is no such thing in government accommodation.
There are also women who are not kept separate, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press spokesperson of the government.
In Oberbayern, Unter- und Mittelfranken, in some community accommodation there are floors or own houses only for single women and their children.
The exception is Niederbayern, where there are two central accommodation exclusively for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommodated separately.
In a study published for the committee, it says: 'It is very important that men and women be accommodated separately'.
"There is a lack of privacy, or if men and women are housed together, there can be - perpetual - violence against women."
In particular, the washing areas should be separated and easily accessible for women, in the study.
How much the women feel this need for protection can be read in the rush to the house in Munich.
"Since we have talked about that we have, we have a long queue," says Bahr.
You could easily set up a second house.
