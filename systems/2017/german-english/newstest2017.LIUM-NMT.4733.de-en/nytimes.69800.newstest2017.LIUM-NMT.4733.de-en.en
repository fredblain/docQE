Amid the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of Trampoline
Wherever you are, how late it is, it is the Olympic Games.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inevitable, a rapid relay between competition and striving.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself would be a burning stair which is passed from the Armbrustprotect to the swimmer to the turner for the triathlete.
You cannot turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour's conversation in the coffeeshop, without listening to Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there is Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is for the first time in the Olympic Games and a female swarm with greetings, could well have been among these well-known names that are sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising, if he would be a swimmer, turner or even real.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is battling for gold in the Olympic trampolines.
The Olympic flame does not shed light on every event.
Further from the centre, partly in the shade are the sports, which are not universally recognized: Air pistols, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always have the breast swim and may be there for a long time.
But if I humbly make arguments for my particular darling, I would like to draw your attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years have been so sparingly perceived that many, I had asked, did not know that it is an Olympic sport in the first place.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Despite the fact that the US sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in trampoling, and had had an athlete by 2012, who managed it to the end.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to get the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians to share in women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
The trampoline has a certain outsider charms, partly because it is suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clowns school that sounds for the Olympic Games.
At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a geothermal enthusiast.
It has humoristic potential - the cartoonous citation of his never-ending upshot - but also the grace of the tournament and diving, the two sports that essentially unite it.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means so much like "springboard."
Rising winner jumps on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a series of falling movements (turning, hues and balances) before they end up on the feet.
According to the official Olympic programme, they are assessed on the basis of performance, level of difficulty and "flight time."
Two thousand athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will face each other in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight.
Medal hopes must continue in their quest for gold, faster, upwards and above, sometimes to the target, sometimes to and back, upwards and downwards in the playground.
They are not only hunting the finishing line or the original wall, but also in television broadcasting another kind of polish objective: That of the world or of the Olympics.
The purposeful quest is noble, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to stir even a spectator to tears.
But it is also what I feel rather tiring when watching these games.
The trampoline offers a breathing space.
The trampoline vector is above.
A forward movement is not the goal.
He or she turns off, apparently heavier than an astronaut, goes upwards, then downwards, then effortlessly again.
Here too there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no vaults in the distance, only the dreamful, elegant lifting of time and gravity.
It can only be as much as competition in the Olympic Games.
The qualification and final stages of the women will take place on Friday afternoon, in the streaming around 13.00 Eastern Time; that of the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.
NBC will broadcast the ends as part of a afternoon block from 14.00.
In the midst of the Olympic mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in the general tumult.
If awareness raising can only be achieved through the creation and objectification of male athletes - as the male US turner suggested a short time ago according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr Dooley expects the new fan community to follow his air.
