Who is building Braunschweig's cheap apartments?
The SPD and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance believe that, in future, investors should be made much more accountable.
How do we react to the bad news that, in the next few years, Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments?
The SPD proposes a "concept of action" for the next Council meeting.
But dispute is programmed.
First of all, the question is: Who should actually build the cheap apartments?
There is no regulation until now.
SPD group chairman Christoph Bratmann argues: "We are in agreement with the Greens: Those who want to build on urban areas will have to designate 20% of all housing as social housing in the future."
However, the cheap apartments can also be found in the stock.
However, the big point in the city hall is: "How to deal with investors who want to build on private land?"
"We want investors to build at least 10% on such land, but as 20 per cent of housing as social housing."
A new urban housing support programme, which will cost millions and still needs to be financed, is intended to provide incentives.
The problem, Mr Bratmann, said: "There is currently no agreement between the groups."
The CDU wants to make as few regulations as possible for investors.
The Left intends to impose even tougher constraints on investors.
Despite this, Mr Bratmann, the situation is worsening in the housing market.
If the concept of action is implemented, this will ensure additional tasks in the building management.
More staff will be needed.
It is unclear whether we will get the workers.
But the programme is not complete: The around 1260 new apartments, which should be built in any case.
But how do we compensate for the loss of a further 1300 favourable housing, which will be phased out in the next few years?
It will be 500 homes by 2020 alone.
In order to prevent this, the planned spokesperson Nicole Palm, should now be bought out of the city.
Moreover, thought should be given to bringing back homes back to price fixing.
This is possible in the west city.
The problem could be dealt with at a stroke.
This is because, in the West City, deadlines expire at the end of the year.
Around 1800 apartments could be found there back in the price fixing for cheap apartments.
Only the owners, the housing companies, do not want that.
If there is a dramatic increase in the number of social housing in the Western City, the aim of the so-called 'mix' will be removed.
A concentration of social weak in just a few parts of the city should no longer exist.
The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the debate.
Group Chairman Holger Herlitschke argues: "For a broad majority, the CDU must be in the boat."
This has focused on more building sites for single-family houses.
But what does not mean that a compromise cannot be found.
