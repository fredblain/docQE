A seat at the forefront of the stunning architecture of the Los Angeles Central Library
Learn more about the history of the central library in the city centre, since the Society of Architectural Historians/Southern California Chapter holds a salon with Arnold Schwartzman and Stephen Gee, the author of the new book "Los Angeles Central Library: A History of its Art and Architecture."
It is planned that Gee and Schwartmann will discuss and share pictures of the 1926 Bertram Goodhue Design and the 1993 Restoration and Supplement of Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates.
The Salon is scheduled for 21 August from 14.00 to 16.00 in Salle Modern in the Art Deco Southwestern School of Law (formerly Bullock Wilshire), 3050 Wilshire Blvd.
Visitors can visit the central hall, the stylish rooms, the Kaktuslounge and the Teesalon.
Only pre-sale tickets; SAH / SCC Members, $15; non-members, $25.
