Mahaj Brown, 6, "stripped of balls," survives shooting in Philadelphia
The police announced that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week, the second time that a 6-year-old child was shot.
The grandparents of the boy identified him as Mahaj Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
The grandparents said that Brown suffered several shooting injuries, including in the Lending, Bein, arm and belly, but that he was aware of his transport into the hospital.
"He has gone through a lot, his small body was pierced by balls," said his grandmother Delores Melendez to the transmitter.
I simply cannot believe that.
The state of the boy was classified as critical in a hospital and had to undergo several operations.
The boy's family told the transmitter that it was expected to be recovered again.
It should have started the first class in a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: Two at the age of 29 and a 32 year old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in a critical state; the other two victims are in a stable state, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29-year-old, who is in a critical condition, shot up, reports the transmitter.
The other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating whether it could be among the injured men of the perpetrators.
Investigators shared CBS Philadelphia with the fact that it seems to have been a crossfire between several guards.
Patron sleeves for storms, which have been traced back to various Storm rifles, have topped the scene.
It seems that this has clearly been an ongoing battle.
On the road, on both sides of the walk, HÃ¼lsen were.
It seems that there have been several armed fighters who have been very active," said police officer Anthony Ginaldi of the police in Philadelphia.
Several houses and vehicles have also been made in the area.
There has been no arrests and the police are reportedly reviewing the surveillance video.
On Tuesday, another 6-year-old girl was hit at the arm by a torturer when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West Oak Lane.
They are recovering and the police are still looking for a suspect.
