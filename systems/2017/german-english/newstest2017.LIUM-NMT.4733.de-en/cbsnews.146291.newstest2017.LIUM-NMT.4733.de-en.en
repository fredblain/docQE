Heavy rains, flooding in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rainfall and large-scale flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday.
Many rivers in the southeast of Louisiana and the south of the Mississippis flooded their shores and threatened with large-scale flooding after extreme rainfall, reported the national weather service.
The Governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards announced that government officials are in permanent contact with the local authorities and are already on the way to the municipalities concerned.
Mike Steele, a spokesperson for the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness of the Board of Governors, announced that the requests for flood vehicles, boats and sand bags were raised.
Steele said that the municipality of Tangipahoa would have requested ten thousand sand bags.
A flood warning system is used throughout the south of Louisiana until Saturday.
The weather service announced that there could be an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain in this area.
In the south of Alabama, a flood early warning system was used on Friday, while in the Mobile area it was still raining.
The Comite River near Baton Rouges and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both in Louisiana, are likely to reach record levels over the weekend.
The Metereologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a downward flooding in Ascension Parish is a danger, as it will only slowly flow into Lake Maurepas over the rivers that have occurred.
The River Tickfaw, south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level at 09.00 on Friday, which has ever been recorded.
Rescue teams still plunged people from the flood water in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in the south-west of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and his stepson were among those who were saved on Friday near Gloster.
Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house, rose sharply overnight.
He said that he would have warned him another stepson, who lives close.
"We have woken up and flooded the water," said Hansford.
It reached my waist.
His wife told Hansford that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years in which she lived there.
Hansford said that he and his family members would have all disabilities and would be the only one who could swim.
Hansford said that Nothelfer had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire guard in Gloster, where they were housed until Friday.
Krautmann said that the flooding had "rapidly spread," since heavy rains continued and that the authorities were considering evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, an observer reported close to Livingstone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.75 inches.
Krautmann said that the soil had been heavily insulated by the rainfall since Wednesday.
The authorities said that heavy rainfall and road flooding caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and school failures in five school districts.
The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that an associate in Tangipahoa gave up 200 houses flooded.
The inhabitants were evacuated into two churches that have now been flooded.
The head of the municipality of Robby Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets strained by flooding.
In the cities of Amite and Hammond, emergency accommodation has been set up to accommodate the evacuees.
"As soon as the water starts going back, they will be able to return to their homes," he said.
In the town of Hammond the municipality of Tangipahoa, almost two dozens of roads were closed due to the flood and sand bags were provided to the residents for taking part, hoping to keep the water from their homes and shops.
"The last major flooding we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum from the City Council.
This seems to be a similar event.
In Mississipp, the emergency manager Rupert Lacy of the Harrison Countys said that it was still raining on the Gulf Coast.
According to his data, a handful of houses have been reported to be flooded on Thursday, but none of this has been reported on Friday.

"I saw water in places where I never saw it before," said Townson, "and it still comes."
