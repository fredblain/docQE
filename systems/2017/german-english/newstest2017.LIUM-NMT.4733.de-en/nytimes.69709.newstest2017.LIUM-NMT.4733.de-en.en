Snapchat "Anime" Effects as Asian cartoon
Snapchat says that this filter is inspired, but some observers say that it is insensitive to races.
With its filter tool, Snapchat enables around 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identities in such a way that borders on the absurd.
You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be out of a kind of Lichtenstein painting.
The filters are rugged, self-defeating tools that create more than 30 million improved selections per day.
All misdeeds go to the public.
Snapchat filters have been criticised in the past, in which they were accused of promoting the use of the Blackface or white skin as a beauty deal.
When, this week, some users proposed a filter that gave them slimming, wrong teeth, and evicted cheeks, some critics called a racist caricature of Asians - "Gelbgesicht."
They wondered whether these repeated controversies pointed to a major problem that the company has with diversity.
The news and indignation were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat announced that it would have deactivated the feature.
The company offered an apology: The filter was conceived as a tribute to anime characters and not as a caricature of Asians.
But outsiders who have seen racism reminded the filter of vulnerable stereotypes.
Others rejected the anime-comparison.
In an email, Grace Sparapani wrote, a Korean-American art student whose Tweet was widely disseminated over the photos, that the filter was "vulnerable and, to say the least, inconvenient."
She added that "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgusting Asian caricature and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow, but that the yellow light has been dragged to the extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stumbling block.
American culture appears to be implicated in an endless diversity and integration campaign, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in their hands.
And Snapchats's large audience of young people - who are more diverse than their older counterparts - could be expected to expect sensitivity.
When one of Snapchats filters creates an image that is offensive to a user, "it is much more difficult for such things to remain unnoticed than was previously the case," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who worked as a product manager and engineer for the medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account, asking others to do the same.
In an essay for medium and in a telephone interview, she said that they believe that racial controversy reflects a lack of diversity in the recruitment practices of Snapchat.
Zhu criticized the large part of white, only male leadership, and ended her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.
"either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so they can make such decisions," said the Chinesich-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say what against."
Others share their opinion, a complaint that has left Snapchat largely unanswered.
The company does not publish figures for the diversity of its staff and points out its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its staff, but, according to a spokesman, the company has recently recruited a staff responsible, focusing on under-represented groups and on internal integration efforts.
Zhu, for her part, said that she would leave her Snapchat account and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to be able to say that this is not O.K.."
