Pokémon Go, a health and happiness hunt that pays
It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.
The fact that teenagers and children are no longer outside the game, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time on screens, has been lamented by many over the past decade.
Pokemon Go is about getting people out of the sofa and getting more active.
The time on the screen was initially limited to TV, then video games and most recently on smartphones.
It is therefore great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.
I refer, of course, to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were first created for the video games in the 1990" s (later created as a cartoon series, game cards, and other spin-offs).
Like many phenomena of pop culture, the interest in the United States, Australia and New Zealand began in early July, prior to the release of the game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand.
The market introduction in other countries has been postponed by the massive demand that the servers have congested.
Within days, Pokémon Go had more users than tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, the players, with their smartphones, go out and search for Pokémons, which will be traced with a GPS and, once found, "photographed" (via a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "captured."
A generation that played the game when it was younger, followed the election and jumped for the search of the sofa.
In the US, the game led to a significant increase in the number of steps that the "average" person spends every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which follows 35,000 users, told the Washington Post recently that within two days of the market launch of the game, the number of persecuted people who train every day 30 minutes, jumped from 45% to 53 per cent.
The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go - it only provides raw data for performance improvement.
Many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to get "30 minutes of time," "to come from the sofa," and "to be active every day" have fallen on deaf ears, because many public messages are dull for health and come from people who look elend.
However, the importance of sport cannot be exaggerated.
Those who regularly drive sports reduce their chances of being affected by cancer or depression.
Physical exercise helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of advantages that are too long to lead them.
But the miracle of Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open that makes them fun.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.
Some people even catch new friendships on the hunt.
As always, there are also mürric gamepers, who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could go against a door.
What should it be?
There has been a breakthrough.
Even if smartphone apps such as Fitbit had already been able to track our activity earlier, they did not give us any reason to drive sport as it does.
The new will lose its appeal and the use will diminish over time.
However, there will be more games based on poker's success that will unite Apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world and will help many people in the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.
