Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid
His experiences on the horse are manageable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer, with some colleagues, was looking for a little variety with a ride on the beach.
For the 58-year old it was a premiere.
Chio: "golden sports pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses reminded themselves of their festivities, they woke up to the fodder in the fast Galopp home.
A kilometre at this rate, I have been afraid.
"It was not a good experience," said Langer.
And then the riding career ended up again.
On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all times - 101 tournament wins - was back in the vicinity of horses.
He could lead his family through the installation of the ALRV, on a horse he is not even for photo purposes.
Long was the first time in Aachen and also the CHIO.
The reason was very convincing.
The German sports help presented the golden sports pyramid to the man from Anhausen in the context of a small gala.
The sympathetic sportsman does not miss out on a number of awards.
Silver Lorbeerblatt, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...
Even the British Queen has killed him.
Long is the 18th winner of the sports pyramid.
In Aachen, he met the first winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
"This award gives me a great deal," says Langer, "because it is not only awarded for sporting success, but also for social engagement."
For decades, Langer has been supporting the young.
And so he added the prize money of EUR 25.000.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the double US master winner was added to the "Hall of Fame of German Sports" on Saturday.
Among the exhibitors are the athlete Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the Freal Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob-driver Meinhard Nee, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the Springtor Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumously the Handballer Erhard.
Many of these sports races came to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrious society migrated to the Springstadion, where the Lavazza Prize ran.
Bernhard Langer kept far from the big animals.
