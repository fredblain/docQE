Illness: When the organiser pays
After their journey, sick holidaymakers will only get money if the cause of the disease is unquestionably found in the hotel.
But this is only the case when more than ten per cent of the guests have shown the same symptoms.
In this case, a family was hard hit by diarrhea and vomiting on the second day of her Turkish leave.
She spent almost the whole holiday in the room.
Their illness led the holidaymakers to a defective purification plant, which was supposed to pollute the sea water.
The family was of the opinion that the journey was so flawed - and complained against the organizer.
The plaintiff had no success before the Court of First Instance.
It is true that the wastewater treatment plant was defective.
But the organizer learned of it just before the plaintiff's departure.
He had to assume that the seawater was in order.
In other words, he did not violate his information obligations, so the verdict.
No pollution has been found in water samples.
The illness of several hotel guests - possibly by contagion among themselves - belongs to the general risk of life.
Of 691 guests were only 38.
