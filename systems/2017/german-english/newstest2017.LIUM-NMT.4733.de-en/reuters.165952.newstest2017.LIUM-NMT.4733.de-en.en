Clinton earns 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
On Friday, Hillary Clinton published her tax declaration for 2015, which showed an income of USD 10.75 million for the presidential candidate and her husband, and an effective tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clinton Foundation spent $1 million for charitable purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton earned almost USD 5.3 million in speech fees; the former Secretary of State gave an income of USD 3 million from Simon & Schuster for her book about her term of office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's candidate for the vice-presidency, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, publicly published his tax declarations over the past ten years, together with his wife, Anne Holton.
They paid an effective tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency," said Clinton's campaign helper in Jennifer Palmieri in an opinion.
In a stark contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and returning to publish his tax returns on his promises to date.
It is customary for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations, although they are not required to do so by law.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have declared a tax check by the tax authorities as a reason for refusal.
"They are on the train," wrote Clinton's campaign helpers Ian Sams on Twitter, with regard to the publication of Democrats" presidential candidacy.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's Special Adviser, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish something before the tax reviews are closed.
Trump's critics, including the Republican presidential candidate for 2012 Mitt Romney, have already said that his refusal raises questions about wealth, his contributions to charitable organizations, his conduct, and various other connections, especially with Russia.
Clinton has already touched on the issue and published a video on Friday in which senior Republican Trump would be calling for his tax declaration to be published.
On Thursday, she also addressed the issue during a speech on the Michigan economy.
"He refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and publish his tax returns," she said.
Politico has reported that Trump has not paid for two years, or paid very little, during the 1990" s, and an economic journalist in the New York Times quoted on Friday a number of tax lawyers and tax advisors who said that it could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign.
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, who would ensure that people who earn more than USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During an election campaign for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate is located here, asked Trump to exchange his tax returns.
Buffett said that he had been subjected to a tax review of the IRS, and Trump had "fear" in front of the voters, not before the tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has released tax returns by 2007.
The Clinton, now living in Chappaqua, New York, has on average paid an effective tax rate of around 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
The Clinton tax declaration of 2015 showed that they accounted for only $100 of their income as wages, unlike most of the Americans.
Its main investment was a low-cost index fund, from which the Clinton dividend and earnings of USD 109.000 were taxed.
