Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now linked to Fife
The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the North deck of the Queensland Crossings with the viaduct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four closures of the "cover blowers," which are nearing completion to each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 ropes.
The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017.
Minister for Economic Affairs, Keith Brown, visited the site today and was one of the first to go to the bridge.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensland Crossings.
We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly great degree to this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used solely for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for the operation.
In total, almost 79% of the total bridge cks in their place and the last part of the decks are now in Rosyth for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be placed on the bridge.
Michael Martin, project leader of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "The first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the closure represents forward-looking high and low construction.
After installation of the last section of the road and its connection to the North Tower deck, we had to close the remaining gap on the north or south side.
This was achieved by dragging the northern feed bridge 700 millimetres south.
This was a massive and, at the same time, very delicate activity.
Because the viaduct is 222 meters long, about 6,000 tonnes and has had to be pulled up at an increase of about 3%.
Delicate, because the tolerances that the team worked on were tiny - on each side, they were only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
