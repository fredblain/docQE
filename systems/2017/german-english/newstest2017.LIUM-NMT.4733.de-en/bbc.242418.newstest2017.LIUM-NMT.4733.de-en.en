On Friday, the Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3.000th British profit at Newmarket.
He sat on predilection, which was trained by John Gosden, on his local race track with his second win of the night a milestone.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey that reached the milestone in the flat race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
The three winner, Dettori, who won against Ghayyar, said: "It's something special."
I am very emotional because my family is here too.
I am very happy that it has happened in Newmarket, because I arrived here 30 years ago.
It is not a big meeting, it is not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday evening with 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very modest.

Two Jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jockey Richard Johnson and the retired 20-year-old winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who reached more than 4,300 wins in a record breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the ninth Derbywinner had 4,493 career countries,
Frankie is one of the best jockey of modernity and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone, which few have reached before him.
He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect, which distinguishes him from the other in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for races, his enthusiasm and charisma enthusiastic fans for years for this sport.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he had already gained 6,000 profits if he were not just a weekend and big tournament!
Frankie has already won almost 30 years in GB, which is great.
He has a lively personality, which is good for a British race, but it is also an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the flagship of the British flavor for two decades.
It was nervous.
A series of big tournaments, including his famous "Glorious Sieben" in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived an airplane crash and received a drug ban.
Three years ago, he initially had difficulties when he returned from his six-month block, but he showed an impressive strength to defy his doubts and return to his best form.
And he is not at the end of the day - Dettori once said that he wants to continue in competitions up to his at least 50 years of age.
