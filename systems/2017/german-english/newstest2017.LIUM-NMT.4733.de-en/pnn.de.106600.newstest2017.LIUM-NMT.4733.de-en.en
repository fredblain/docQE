Greenland: The oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old
Rare sight.
Greenland sharks come to the surface only in winter.
The Hai was able to return to the sea after a study on board the Sanna research vessel.
He was born in 1624 and swimmed with a 1 km/h of the North Atlantic - until today.
It is only 150 years later that Greenland sharks.
As a result of the North Atlantic, the Greenland shark continues along the North Atlantic, in an hour it reaches an average of just 1,220 metres wide.
Only when it arrives, the five metre long animal accelerates on satte 2.6 km/h - and is half as fast as a seal with this maximum speed.
But the lifestyle that is characterized by slowness seems to be a patent formula for a high age.
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the magazine "Science" in any case from a Greenland hai, which could be 392 years old.
"madness," commented Alexander Schtaxation of the Max Planck Institute for Population Research in Rostock this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates.
It is true that the evolutionary biologist has long believed that Greenland sharks.
Only failed the evidence.
Greenland sharks are hard to see, and they live in the Arctic Ocean in particular from the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually occur only in the winter on the surface.
Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks.
They took their time at a time when they met six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitsbergen.
Today, this sharks still do: In the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jaw of a young polar bear.
It may be hunting sleeping animals or patrolling on the bottom of the ice sea and looking for carcasses from higher layers of water down.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now investigated 28 Greenland sharks that caught fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spitsbergen as by-catches from the depth of the North Atlantic.
The smallest hai was just 81 centimetres long, while the largest 502 centimetre was measured.
In order to determine the age of animals, they analyzed the linens of sharks with the carbon 14-method.
This center of the eye lens already arises before the birth of the sharks, the proteins that it contains are not renewed later.
The two smallest sharks had a remarkably high carbon 14 in the lens.
Their birth, therefore, should be after the early 1960" s, when nuclear weapons tests carried larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
By contrast, with 220 centimetres in length, the lineup contained a small surplus of carbon 14 from nuclear weapons attempts, so it should have celebrated its 50th birthday in the course of its 2012 investigation.
All major Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal carbon 14 volumes in their lineup, resulting from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
Indeed, the carbon 14 clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493 centimeter of Greenland, while the record -Hai, with 502 centimetres, is expected to be 392 years old.
It was known that Greenland females will not be born only if they are longer than four metres.
Now the researchers of the length have been able to assign age.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres was probably on the threshold of sexual maturity and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland sharks with the propagation appear to be at least one and a half centuries.
This is also likely to be world record for vertebrates.
It is no coincidence that such methusaleme is mainly living in icy waters.
Even the previous record holder, a 211 year old Greenland whale, in whose speck on the neck was a 120 year old Harpunenspitze, was caught in front of Alaska.
As a result of the low temperatures, the body of the animals living there often also runs on sparflammes.
So they later mature - and old more slowly.
In order to keep themselves warm in cold water, the animals are often particularly great.
Because the volume is growing much faster than its surface, by which the animal loses heat.
The heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much greater than a gram of elephant.
Another advantage: They have fewer enemies.
"A smaller animal lives more dangerously and should concentrate on having as many descendants as possible as early as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Schtaxation.
A very large animal should, on the other hand, invest its resources in a long life.
