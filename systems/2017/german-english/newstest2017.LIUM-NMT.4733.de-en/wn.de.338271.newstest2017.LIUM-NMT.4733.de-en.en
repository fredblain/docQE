Improved flow of traffic on the motorway
It is regularly on the bypass - here is a picture of November.
But this should change: The legal basis is to be extended.
This is good news for all car drivers who are on the road on the road every night in congestion when they drive through the motorway (A 43).
On Tuesday and Wednesday (16/17 August), the country's road construction sector extends the area between the Hammer Straße and the Weseler Straße exit at 700 meters.
Car drivers can then turn right directly from the Hammer Straße.
The big advantage: The traffic will be more early, thus improving the overall process on the much-frequented section of the Bundesstraße 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU group in the district representation of Münster-West.
The road narrowing down to the supplier will leave the car drivers mainly between 17 and 19: 00.
On weekdays, the backlog reaches to the bridge over the Albersloher way and sometimes beyond.
Reason is the needle eye on the B 51 shortly before the departure of Weseler Straße.
From here, transport is guided only by the motorway bridge.
The second track had to be built more than three quarters of years ago.
The reason: Static calculations have shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary capacity to absorb heavy goods traffic in particular.
As long as this bottleneck and the related workday congestion will continue, the competent state company cannot say.
However, there are years to be expected: The bridge has an official retention period up to 2034.
For the prolongation of the legal deduction, the country has deliberately chosen the weaker time in the school holidays, because it is expected to be disabled.
The traffic is closed on Tuesday and on Wednesday at the site.
