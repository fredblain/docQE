Condoms with chilipudes, fireworks promote dance anias elephant protection
Naturalists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from going into settlements inhabited by people - they throw condoms on them that are filled with Chilipuder.
The method has proved effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea already years ago, has stepped up its promotion, along with US natural protection, by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-step method to protect their homes and crops without violating animals.
Previously, many spears used to defend themselves.
Friday is World Call Day dedicated to animal welfare.
"Since we have developed the... toolkit, we have seen a change in their attitude within these communities, while they are much more confident that they can dissuade the elephants from their fields without harming the elephant," said Honeyguide Damian Bell in a communication.
The first two steps include the lights of the elephant with a torch and the bladder in a horn.
If it is not scared, a so-called "Chilicloud" will be thrown.
Chilipuder mixed with earth, combined with a firework body in a condom, the end of which is turned into the ignition.
When it is lit, the condom bursts with a bang and sprays fine dust on Chilipuder in the air.
A hint is usually already out to chase the elephant.
One last option is a Werfer, who is shooting a gold fire in the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
