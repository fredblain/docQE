De Maizière said that, according to the acts of violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people would be concerned about further attacks.
The state must respond calmly and resolutely to terrorist threats.
What is certain is that our country will not respond to the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
We will not treat this triumph to the terrorists.
If criminals would have to leave the country more quickly, however, that would increase security and also give the people the support of the refugee policy.
De Maizière intends to implement the proposals until the federal elections in 2017.
He also announced a further reinforcement of the security forces of the security forces, "in the middle of a number of years."
There must be a return of sympathy for terrorism.
Video surveillance is to be improved, the right of arms to be amended to make it more difficult to buy weapons on the Internet.
The last much-discussed confidentiality requirement for doctors is to be maintained in the words of Mrs Maizières.
However, in dialogue with the medical profession, he wants to find solutions to how to reduce the threat to the citizens, he said, with regard to mental disorders, for example.
In order to counter the radicalisation of refugees, the Minister considers better social support.
Teachers would have to be better prepared for dealing with traumatised people.
In order to prosecute criminals in specific areas of the Internet (Darknet), de Maizière plans to use covert investigators.
SPD boss Gabriel said: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further raising security."
It is important that the Minister for the Interior has clearly opposed activism.
"That was a slap for the sharfmakers in the CDU/CSU," said Gabriel the newspaper of the Funke Media Group (Friday).
De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the Union for a ban on Burma and the abolition of double nationality.
A general ban on full concealment is constitutionally problematic.
We cannot ban everything that is opposed, and I reject the wearing of the burka.
We can talk about rules, for example, in the case of road transport or for witnesses in court.
Mr Simone Peter, head of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, said to the Minister that he wanted to simulate the power and ability to act with ever new anti-terrorism packages.
Left party leader Bernd Riexinger said: "Fleet and a tightening of the right of residence do not bring security to the people of this country."
