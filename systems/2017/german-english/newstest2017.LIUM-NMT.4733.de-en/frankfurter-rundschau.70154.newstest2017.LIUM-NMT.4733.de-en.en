Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "To go where it weaves"
Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The locals get nothing from the summer campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia cannot choose the country day.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.
In 2021, the provincial elections will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament decided at the beginning of the year.
This is not the case: Summer holidays, heat and land tagging - it is a bite.
The locals, who are supposed to be convinced by the election fighters, are on holiday.
The vast majority of holidaymakers in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so they are not allowed to choose the country day.
In addition, there are practical problems: During the holidays, workers who hang posters, balloon air balloons, distribute flyers and count in the end of votes, are only laborious.
Until September 4, 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, once again, must continue to campaign for a short while on the people.
The hot phase, if you can say this at all, has just begun.
And it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, head of a SPD/CDU coalition, must fear his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys.
It is exciting to see how much Neuling AfD is cut off and what remains to be done in the end of the coalition.
Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost inconspicuous campaign.
He travels through the country, distributes roses and chatts a little with the people, just as his legendary word-like predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.
Otherwise, soul will get cold feet and give Chancellor Merkel the blame for the bloom of the AfD.
Her refugee policy, her "We are creating this" has speeded up the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him a good job now.
The CDU with its top candidate, the Minister for the Interior, Lorenz Caffier, has already seen how it is to campaign in the right place at the wrong time.
She has twice invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel to Germany. Merkel is in the northeast.
But the target group did not vote, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berliner and Sachsen da als Mecklenburger and Vorpommern.
"Since was probably the majority of other federal states," said Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in NDR.
But it is also a shame for anyone from other parts of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel.
Otherwise, the North-East CDU largely waives the usual campaign stands at marketplaces and in front of shopping centres with sunshades and balloons.
This means that coke is only a "minor role."
The Union, too, has noted that it is breaking the ground on the ground that it has to make a great effort to find a way back to the people.
As the Left, the SPD, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, have hardly ever seen.
However, the Council of the CDU election fighter Kokert is also self-evident: "You must go to where it weaves, namely where the people are: Dorffeste, golden weddings, every birthday party must be used."
Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called its SPD into a particularly dedicated campaign.
In surveys, the Social Democrats were last with 22 percent behind partners CDU (25) and only just before the AfD (19).
At the 2011 election, the SPD had clearly won 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).
The Greens, a small party with seven per cent in the surveys, are expected to make the leap into the country.
They make a modern virtue out of the holiday need and, most of all, move their campaign to the Internet.
"Online campaign," called the president of the country, Claudia Müller.
Otherwise, green voters come to search for local voters among the holidaymakers.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, just curvates with a house boat through the mecklenburgish lakes and finds it beautiful.
Her impression: "Electoral leave in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment."
