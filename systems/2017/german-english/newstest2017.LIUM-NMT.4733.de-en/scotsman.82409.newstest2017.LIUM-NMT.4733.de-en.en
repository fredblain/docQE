Scote Callum Skinner stormed home when Brite gold won gold for cycling
Scotland's Callum Skinner last night in the men's team sprint in the Velodrom in Rio for glory, when the British team defended the London 2012 title.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had to embrace.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy took the fifth of six Olympic medals.
They repeated the trick after they had only a modest sixth place in March at the World Championships in London despite the resignation of Hoys.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Staff.
They did so in good time.
Hoy's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man with whom they remained, when they saw potential in the Scots, which has unfolded.
Hindes, Kenny - who won Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualification rounds, but in the standard races the New Zealand won the first round.
And the British trio won the Duell with gold.
After his round, Hindes fell short, but Kenny brought the team to the front and skinner.
A change of strategy made a large part of the transformation, in which Hindes drove in a higher course in order to slow it down and to allow Kenny and, above all, Skinner, to keep pace.
Hoy looked from his position as a BBC expert and noticed Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they went to the podium.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said: "It's a flattering comparison."
I am only here to do my best and make a name.
We have established an Olympic record in the final stage and defeating the world champions.
It was simply incredible.
There is no better way to win.
After the triumph in 2012 at the Kennys and Hoys side, Hindes admitted that, after a weak start, he was deliberately on the train.
He withdrew this statement later, and there was no opposition from England's rivals.
This time, there was no such problem with such a surprising victory.
Hindes said: "It feels with the whole GB flags in the gallery as London."
We have been working as a team over the past three months.
We did so badly for so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win again at the Olympics.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of our progress over the past five months that we expect successful five days in the Velodrom.
With the form Kennys, it is in the realm of the possibility that he repeats Hoy's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.
This would be for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on 23 March (an apparently holy date for British sport; in the day Steve Redgrave, Mon Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.
That would be the same as Hoy.
Kenny is next in the Sprint, which starts today and will go over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I enjoy this only for the moment."
The team event is always the best.
It can be won with his colleagues.
It feels rather lonely to win.
Hindes said: "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten."
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in four four-kilometre races.
They arrived in 3: 51,942.
The world record that won gold in London in 2012 was 3: 51,659.
The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the contest, where Wiggins will definitely focus.
Yesterday, he met with envoys prior to qualification, when officials called on him to measure his body size.
In the corresponding female competition that continues tomorrow and ends, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13 260.
The GB team relies on its strong rail team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to catch up with medals.
After a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio were downgraded.
Dramas played in the background, such as the resignation of the technical leader Shane Sutton in April, in the midst of sexism and harassment charges, as well as retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria pendleton.
However, if you look at the first night of competition in the Velodrom, it looks as if the legendary call GBs, which reached its climax at the perfect moment, could be repeated again.
