Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a new refugee commissioner
Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organizer.
She is also a social worker on the ground.
Since July Annika Deuschle has been the refugee commissioner for Urbach.
The social pedagogy supports the team of management around Achim Grockenberger.
It sees itself as a contact for all actors: Refugees, refugee aid, administration, public authorities, and anyone else.
Regine customer of the working group suggests that the honorary official is more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the eierlegende Wollmilchsau, which mainly has a problem.
For example, some were referring to the multiplicity of tasks that were needed, rather than the administration, when the administration wanted to write out the job.
An administrative force with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long experience of social work, has been sought, just as a ferocious Wollmilchsau.
But administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deuschle.
Above all, it is about organisation, work with the people on the ground and also behind the scenes and network activity.
The 31-year-old has been doing so for about six weeks.
It has limited a 50 percentage point to three years.
"It was high time," says Regine customer, that Annika Deuschle supports honest and main actors.
There are large and small problems, organisational, human and communication problems.
New containers will soon be available on Wasenstraße
A serious problem has been going on for some time now to find housing for the connecting refugees who have been recognised.
The municipalities are responsible for connecting services.
They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented homes.
The costs of building, renting or renovating these accommodation must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
The responsibility changes from the Landscape to Kommune and Jobcenter.
Problem: There are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been very difficult for some time.
De facto, the administration does not find private homes.
So far, it does not work, with the need for private housing, such as Deuschle.
Therefore, public housing needs to be caught up, as it is so beautiful.
So new containers will soon be placed in the Wasenstraße.
But only with housing is it not done.
Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to a fixed lead, there are traineeships, training places, school places, one-euro jobs and training for refugees and migrants who need to be funded or set up.
"More seats would be good," says Regine customer.
Many work in the Bauhof or help homemasters, do not-for-profit work - and this is motivated and very orderly, as Annika Deuschle reports.
It hopes that work for the community will lead to a positive external effect.
That is "no employment therapy."
But work does not only mean work.
The day needs a fixed structure, say Deuschle and customer.
People would have to develop a sense of belonging.
So it needs offers like sport, contacts with locals and especially language courses.
Professional courses are rar.
So, here too, there is administration and honorary official.
It is crucial that the refugees feel that they are wanted and welcome in Germany.
The long duration of the procedures is a problem.
They need to explain to the refugees that it will take time and that they will be able to bridge the time, for example with language courses.
Anyone who develops the feeling that he cannot help anyone in Urbach should not work and be useless, who will never be able to integrate himself.
The clear majority was motivated.
The work of Deuschle and the customer is therefore always to motivate others.
All this is a "mammoth task."
A difficult question: After the recent events, are the two afraid of radicalization, including in a small community like Urbach?
"No," says Regine customer very clearly, "what some may call naïve," but it cannot and do not preclude a balance of risk.
However, the volunteers are already aware of this.
These incidents are also issues for the refugees.
They are afraid that the attackers are making them completely discredited.
"They want to show that they have nothing to do," says Regine customer.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
In other words, local and local volunteers must look out for activities in the region.
They have always been in the background that a new blow could soon come to refugees and migrants to Urbach.
Does Germany need a ceiling?
To give a clear answer to this question is the policy.
In fact, it is unfair to place them on the spot.
"In Urbach we have not yet arrived at where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees would relax the situation.
Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher has already been used to integrate the previous people wisely.
These are about 100 people, mostly young men.
But if people in need are in need, they must be helped, both women agree.
The political world is so complicated, there are no easy answers.
