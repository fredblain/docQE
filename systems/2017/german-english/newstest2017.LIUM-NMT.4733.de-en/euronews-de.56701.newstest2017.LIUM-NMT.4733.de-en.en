"West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare Year, the Salzburg Festival presents the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic love affair, similar to Romeo and Juliet.
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
Salzburg: The "West Side Story," Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.
The artistic director, Cecilia Bartoli, wanted to bring the musical into the temple of the classic and fulfilled the role of Maria a youth space.
In the orchestra dig the Simón Bolívar Orchestra under the direction of the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm," he warms.
We always say that it is very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody.
It is a wonderful mixture, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say that we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this staging, Bartoli plays an older Maria.
She reminds her of her love with Tony, while the younger Maria plays and dances.
The role of Maria has always fascinated me.
First of all, because it is musically exceptional!
And then there would be Mary's personality.
She says it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright."
It is therefore wise, of course naively, and very passionately.
"It is very similar to me, my Italian character, which I have as a Römerin," laughed Bartoli.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It is thus an honour for us to work with it.
It is an enormous human being.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an exceptional artist and very passionate!"
Diriging is a necessity for him.
You see it in each of his movements, in his gaze, it's his life!
It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We have both a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a happy approach to life, which is very important at all!
For the American director Philip Wm, McKinley, the "West Side Story" is very topical: "This piece is about prejudice and fanaticism."
Today we have the refugees, at that time the Puerto Ricans went to New York, and the New York residents did not want it.
These are the same issues, and they are just as powerful today as they did at the time.
59 years later, the piece is still relevant.
