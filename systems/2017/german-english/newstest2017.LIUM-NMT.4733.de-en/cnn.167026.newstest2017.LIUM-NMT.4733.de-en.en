Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That is what I see under the Women's Olympics in the tower, and that for more than one reason.
First of all, I have been here since 1984 at every summer Olympics and the US has never been so dominant.
And secondly, this team has three turners, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, which inspired many young girls of other skin colour.
The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, who is the JÃ¼din, and Madison Kocian, who is Catholicin, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the US.
It has reinforced the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
In the last four years, the number one among female turners has been an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.
This shows strength.
At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was hailed by a surprising Olympic winner and America.
Now the world has been able to witness the incredible performance of the three World Championships Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they provided unexpected, yet mastery gymastics routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American, who won gold at an individual multi-contest event for women.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We see the top of this sport, but this is not the way to see tournament classes in the whole country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie suggested all the same way as Aly and Madison to create it into the Olympic team.
They are the "last five," because the next Olympic team will only have four turners in the team, and this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.
But the reality is that Turnen is an expensive sport and turner in the first place in private tournaments that are maintained by parents who pay for the training, installation, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their turner and families).
The majority of these clubs are in affluent suburbs that can support business.
In these clubs the Turner will receive all their training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started with the tower.
We need to provide the communities with countless, young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, to provide more efficient and accessible training.
I set up my 20 years of tournament foundation.
During my events, we offered free and affordable Turnen in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people (mainly black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
In September, we will be expanding to Detroit (my hometown) in order to offer young people high quality gymnastics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Turnen develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the spirit.
This combination offers life-long benefits for health and for school and professional success.
It is the inspiration of this team, who bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the tower and that is great.
It is so important to participate in sport, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real presentation of "Girl Power" by the Holen of the Olympic team gold and thank you so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
