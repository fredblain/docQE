Post rises to trade in electric transporters
An electric delivery vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the vehicle is obviously great.
The post plans to sell its electric vehicle streetscooter.
The company intends to start trading with the transporter in the near future.
The postal service wants to offer its electric transporters in the free car market from next year.
"We want to get involved in the sale to third parties," said a post spokesman on Friday.
The company has been checking for months whether it is going to sell its own developed stream scooter, with which letters and packets are delivered to other companies.
Post-management JÃ¼rgen Gerdes had said that there were repeated inquiries, such as craftsmen.
According to the news magazine "Der Spiegel," the Bonn Group intends to enter the mass production of the vehicles in the near future.
In the post-own factory, the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and layer.
Gerdes announced that the company wanted to expand its fleet of electric cars and, in the long term, a complete switch to environmentally friendly vehicles.
"We will make a very, very resilient step towards 2020," he said at the end of July.
I can imagine that we will change the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on Germany's roads since 2014.
