Haigerloch: Pilgrims to the mercy of mercy
The Ministrants from the Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way to a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Four stages have been taken together.
In order to bridge the period until the next visit of all Ministrants in two years, the Oberministrantenround St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage tour.
Various pilgrimage goals have been examined and one has finally decided for the Bishop city of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage goal was offered with the opening of the Barm cordial at Freiburger Münster.
16 Minis from Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Heiligenrooms were on the way.
In the evening, Father Storost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrims and gave the pilgrims.
From Horb it was driven by train to the starting point of Villingen, where there was also a Münster Unserer Lieben woman and thus became the Pilgerweg of Münster.
The individual day tours were framed in the morning and in the evening by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and texts.
At the same time, the Minis went back to the field cruises, chapels, or churches to sing together a song from a specially assembled pilgrimage settlement.
The local parishes were made available for the overnight stays.
At the stages, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller served for a tasty as well as a delicious dinner and breakfast.
On the second day we went to Gütenbach.
At the end of the day, the stage after St. Peter, which was the most exhausting route, had to be climbed up to about 500 metres in the heat of the heat and then again.
The deserved reward was a common barbecue at the beach in the evening.
After the morning impulses on the fourth pilgrimage day in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter, it went to Freiburg.
Obviously, the Minis met at Freiburger Münster later in the afternoon and went through the doors of mercy.
With a small impulse, God was thanked here.
In the evening fair in Münster, the Minis of Cooperative Markus Obert was welcomed at the pilgrimage destination.
After the worship, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.
The next day was still time for the latitude metropolis.
In the afternoon it went back by train to Horb.
In the end, all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked.
