"One generation protesting" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the US
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters demanding political change in Ethiopia were committed to violent resistance from the government.
Witnesses say that many protesters were killed during the clashes with the police.
Is Ethiopia going to collapse?
Over the past decade, it has been one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a fast-growing economy.
But, in recent months, protests against the government have shaken the country and expanded in more and more areas.
Last week, thousands of people stormed on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.
The government's response was ruthless, according to human rights organisations.
Witnesses said that policemen were shot and killed on dozens of unarmed demonstrators.
In circulating videos about the protests, which are likely to be the last or the beginning of this year, show how security men beat young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a stand against a wall.
The head of the UN Human Rights Agency is now asking for an in-depth investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and in future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa, and its stability is cherished by the West.
American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorist threats across the region, particularly in Somalia, with few countries in Africa, if anything, receiving so much Western assistance.
Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable rate.
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia was far from being a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously cited oppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, with dissidents being effectively silenced.
Many were sent to exile or to prison, killed or driven into the walls of the desert.
But this could change.
"If you suppress people and have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia.
All young people are protesting.
A generation is protesting.
There are numerous complaints that cover everything from the use of land to the stranglehold on power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last opposition's seat and now control 100% of Parliament.
At the same time, the tensions along the border with Eritrea are rising; a fight for this delicate, contentious line called for hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists, such as the Oromo Liberation Front, or the Ogaden's National Liberation Front, which have been forced more or less defeated in recent years, could explode the turbulence and rearmed themselves.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of maneuvering beneath the surface are now exploding.
The first seems to be harmless: Smart phones.
Only in recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more common and Internet services have improved.
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said that they gathered themselves to protest.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
Since Eons, the Amharas, mostly Christian highlands, have prospered in politics and the economy, while exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in lowlands.
But that, too, is changing.
"We are in the process of coordinating under one umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The biggest protests took place in the areas of the Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, which account for around 6% of the population and are dominant in the military, secret services, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr Meles, a former rebel leader, was the Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until his death on an unpublicised disease in 2012.
He was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think of corners.
Analysts say that he was particularly adept at seeing early evidence of discontent and using special envoys to process adversaries and make them harmless.
"The current regime lacks this fundamental skill," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively obscure reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.
Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of North Ethiopia, Mr Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say that it does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such a revolt was in 2005, after thousands protested against elections, which, according to analysts, seem to have been swamped and stolen by the government.
During the following raids, many protesters were killed, even if it was less than in recent months, and this period of unrest has passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in the fight against poverty.
But it is obvious that this did not prevent the Ethiopian Government's intensification of its internal resentment.
And it adopts a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, an amusing city, run by Tigray, and the hatred of Tigray, became increasingly common in the social media.
Analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies in a peculiar position.
The American administration used Ethiopia as a base for round-the-counter flights over neighbouring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it has closed this base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile area.
"This," said Mr Abdi, "is a very thin migration."
