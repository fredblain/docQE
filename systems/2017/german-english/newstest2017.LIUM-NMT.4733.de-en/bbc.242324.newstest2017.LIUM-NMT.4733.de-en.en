Councillors strike: Demands for new industrial action measures
The representatives of the assistants have called on their trade unions to approve new industrial disputes in their disputes regarding a new Treaty.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has asked its entire Council to approve more industrial action measures from the beginning of September.
The JDC said that it had failed ministers to respond to the concerns of the Treaty.
Assistant doctors and medical students have voted in July on the rejection of a contract agreed with BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the president of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government had "persistently calm" problems, leading to the rejection of the Treaty.
She said: "In light of this, the JDC has voted to fully reject the proposed new Treaty and have requested official renegotiations on all of your concerns."
In response to the government's silence, the JDC has today submitted a formal request to a special meeting of the BMA Council in order to approve an ongoing programme of escalating industrial action that begins at the beginning of September.
The disputes resulted in the fact that assistant doctors this year razed six, the first total defaults in the history of the NHS.
The head of the BMA assistant physician Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed contract conditions recommended by the BMA.
He informed BMA members during the meetings that took place before the vote by 54.000 assistant doctors and medical students, that the contract was beneficial and should be adopted.
After the vote, the Minister for Health, Jeremy Hunt, said that the contract for doctors in England would be enforced.
