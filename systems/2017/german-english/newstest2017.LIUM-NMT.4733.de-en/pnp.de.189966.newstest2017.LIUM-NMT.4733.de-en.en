Building ground in double pack
In the recent meeting, the municipal council focused on topics around construction.
It facilitated the communication by Mayor Robert Putz that "the marketing of the newly identified areas of residence can finally begin."
After the land, parcelling and closing issues were clarified and the applications were made to be measured, the sale of the land in the residential areas "Straslweg" and "Schönau-West" (area Binderstraße 1) is no longer in the way of interested parties.
The municipal council is convinced that the blooms in the rural and quiet residential community of Schönau are equally appealing to young families and the elderly.
As it was said, developers can report to the city hall as from now, and the municipal council is expected to discuss the award of the parcels at its September meeting.
In order to be able to respond to requests for the settlement of other businesses linked to the creation of jobs, the municipal council decided to amend the land-use plan newly created in the spring of this year in sub-areas.
In the area of Untertimlarn, the industrial area already designated there will be extended by two parcels in the direction of State Road 2112.
