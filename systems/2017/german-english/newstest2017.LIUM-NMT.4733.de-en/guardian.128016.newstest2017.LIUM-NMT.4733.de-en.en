French court rejects offer on the demolition of shops in the jungle of refugee camps
A French court has rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais to set down dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.
During a trial this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be empowered to establish 72 provisional shops in which people within the warehouse sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, sell hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.
The Calais prefecture argued that these places should be torn down, because they would constitute a parallel economy that would not pay taxes and which have a risk of fire and sanitation.
Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important, because the free meals offered by the state-sponsored association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They also claimed that the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille decided that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of people carrying out the 72 provisional shops, but acknowledged that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were "absolutely understandable."
The judge Jean-François Molla said that food shops, cafés and restaurants would play a much greater role than simply feed people who "live in extremely precarious conditions."
He said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the rainfall was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the Camp, which is operated by the public, and offers 200 meals on the day, English and French classes, as well as advice on asylum matters for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.
In a letter to the Guardian, it was said that the closure "would be a catastrophe for these children, of which the latest eight years old."
The two relief agencies Help refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants on Friday estimated that the number of people living in the jungle of the jungle increased to more than 9,000 people - the highest number so far - after a sharp rise in new arrivals during the summer.
