Trump does not see the looming electoral defeat so narrow
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at an election campaign in Florida.
If there is nothing about the election to the US President, Donald Trump already has an alternative video.
He then goes on on holiday.
If Donald Trump loses the US presidential election in November, he would be relatively indifferent: "In the end, it will either fold, or I have a very, very nice, long holiday," said the Republican candidate in a phone interview with the US TV station CNBC.
If it is not enough for him for reasons of political correctness, be that in order, Trump said.
For example, he called US President Barack Obama and the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton, as the founder of the Islamic State of Islamic State (ISIS).
Within his party, more and more resistance emerged.
