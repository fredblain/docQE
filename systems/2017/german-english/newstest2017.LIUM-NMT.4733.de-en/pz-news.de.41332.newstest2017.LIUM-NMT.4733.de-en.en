Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
The city on the Main, therefore, in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg, has the best opportunities to attract jobs and companies from London.
"It is very likely that Frankfurt is most likely to benefit from the Brexit vote," says Michael Voigtland, Head of the financial markets and real estate markets of the IW.
After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether money houses can continue to operate from London out of financial transactions across the EU.
For the so-called EU passport, they have been authorised in Great Britain to date.
Large US banks are making use of this.
Several banks have already announced that jobs can be relocated.
The lobby association "Frankfurt Main Finance" expects 10000 new jobs to be created within five years.
For Frankfurt, such as the IW, the seat of the European Central Bank (ECB), the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest eurozone banks, as well as other important authorities, such as the European insurance supervision, EIOPA and the ESRB risk management.
In Paris, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has its headquarters, but it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.
"The proximity of the central bank is important for banks, as they can communicate directly with the supervision," says IW-Professor Voigtland.
It is true that Luxembourg is a large fund industry, but, as well as Dublin, it is worse off in terms of infrastructure.
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport.
In addition, the city with easily available commercial properties.
"In Paris, it is not so easy to find free high quality offices," says Voigtland.
At the same time, they were 50% higher for first-class commercial real estate than on the Main.
Moreover, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good health care and infrastructure and less crime.
In a ranking of the business consultancy Mercer, the city is in place seven, Luxembourg in place 19, Dublin in place 33 and Paris in 37th place.
Although quality of life is a question of preferences: "With his already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market, Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors," says the IW.
But, despite Brexit's vote, London will remain the main financial centre in Europe, as economic researchers believe.
In London, according to figures from the Landesbank Helaba, in London, around 14,000 people worked in the banking sector at the end of 2015, with 62,500 in Frankfurt.
