Berlin/Schwerin: Survey against Rural elections: SPD and CDU lose
In the upcoming elections in the LÃ¤nder of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September), significant losses for the government parties to the SPD and CDU groups are emerging.
This resulted in representative surveys of the opinion research institute INSA for the "Picture" newspaper (Friday).
While the red-black government coalition in the North could continue to govern narrowly, this is not possible according to the survey values in Berlin.
In both states, the SPD would be the strongest party and would thus have a good chance of continuing to head the head of the government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD fell from 35.6% five years ago to 24 per cent.
According to the survey, the party would only be close to the CDU, which could come back to 23%.
The third place is controversial between the Left and the AfD.
The left would be 19% (previously 18.4%), the AfD would be represented at 19% for the first time in the country.
In spite of a slight loss of 6% (previously 8.7%), the Greens were reluctant to return to the Schwerin Landtag.
NPD and FDP would not be represented at 3% in the country of the country.
According to the Berlin Chamber of Deputies, the SPD of the survey would be only 23% (election in 2011: 28.3%).
The CDU reached only 18% after 23.4%.
As a result, it would be 19% (17.6% in 2011), but before the left with 15% (previously 11.7%).
The AfD would be represented at 14 percent for the first time in the Chamber of Deputies.
With 5%, the FDP could hope for a return, but the pirates would miss out in 2011.
