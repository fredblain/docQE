Helen Glover and Heather Stanning
There will be no emotinaler gold than in those games, and that will mean what.
From the first rowing to the last, 220 hard Hieve, who enter the history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
There were three votes in the boat, even if it was only the Beides who sat at the ruder, and the trainer Robin Williams, who was present at the second Olympic old in the second without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British sport, who set such a yardstick.
Their dominance was absolutely, after all, their 39.ter unlagged commitment, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes who glide over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not fully reflect the kind of triumphant.
Behind every gold in rowing, there is a battalion of willing helpers that contribute to the incremental advances that make the difference and it was no more assistant than the coach who did not know 30 months ago whether he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer.
As he said, he was risky.
I had bladder cancer, which is operational and that they did.
If you do not, it spreads everywhere.
It would have been a rather serious situation.
It changes a little of the outlook.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if that is the right term in such circumstances.
I needed money, so I had to go better again soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in hospital and ran on the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice.
That is how it begins.
Rowing in itself is already a challenge, but this makes it an even bigger one.
In the immediacy of the victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a thrilling morning doing something more than otherwise, trying to process his own fears.
Stanning, who was the captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment in Afghanistan, said "I was an emotional wreck this week, perhaps a bit extreme, but it means so much."
It's only how much I mean, how much I and Helen and Robin worked.
It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin we would be no one, so a massive thanks go to him; he is the best coach in the world.
I could not have had a better person for training or a better coach.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost races over the past five years.
The pair had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not compete.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to catch up, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very much at the moment.
Helen called "remain in the process, remain in the process."
It is really important not to be sidelined.
We had a good start and at the same time we were not looking to do something.
We did not want fireworks today, we simply wanted to achieve a good result, go further and win the race, which we did.
The couple will take time out for a year before taking decisions about his future.
Glover must appear next week at a wedding, their own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now it simply wants to enjoy the moment.
I did not want to say that this was my last race.
That would have been too much pressure.
In London, it took around six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion.
It was all so new for me and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes.
It feels so much better," she said.
