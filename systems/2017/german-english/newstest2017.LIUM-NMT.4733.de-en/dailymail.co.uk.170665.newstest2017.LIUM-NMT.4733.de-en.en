£2 per day medicine, which can reduce the risk of heart attacks
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from £2-per day medicine, as recommended by the authorities to provide more people for a longer period of time.
The ginning agent Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with cardiac disease.
The drug is administered for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
NICE of the NHS has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.

Some 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or a stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the collection of fatty material in the arterial walls, which form a bellow.
When the surface is broken, it can cause a blood cloak that clots the blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.
If the blood cloak solves, it can flow through the bloodstream and clog blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clocks less likely.
The NICE, published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre said: "In spite of the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all those who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or a stroke - often with disastrous consequences."
Fear of a renewed heart attack may have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person.
Experience shows that in combination with aspirin, Ticagrelor is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes with people who have already had a heart attack.
With a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
The information on the effectiveness and safety of Ticagrelor, especially the risk of blood, is limited to a period of up to three years, and the draft loan does not recommend treatment that goes beyond this period.
