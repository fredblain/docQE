Volkswagen is still a glimpse.
Despite diesel scandals, the delivery figures are rising worldwide.
But it is not in all markets.
In the call-back action, there is a term.
Volkswagen starts its deliveries in the second half of the year.
Europe's largest car manufacturer, despite its many brands and some well-run markets, has continued to offer a plus in the past year.
In July, however, the Volkswagen brand, especially in Western Europe, weakened the overall sales, as announced in the Dax listed company.
With 449100 cars, the VW brand worldwide sold 1.8 per cent fewer vehicles in July than in the same month of the same month.
In Western Europe alone, after China the second largest market, sales were 14 percent below the previous year.
In the home market of Germany, deliveries fell by almost one sixth.
Brand sales leader Jürgen Stackmann brought the weaker figures back in July, especially at two sales days, less in Europe.
Moreover, in some core markets, a "changed economic environment" has given way to buying back.
In addition to the situation surrounding the coup d'état in Turkey, the British vote on leaving the EU was also burdened by a spokesperson.
In the United States, where the gas affair was first escalated, there is also a minus of beech.
Great support for VW is the Chinese market.
As a whole, the mainly affected domestic trade mark of the Lower Saxony is, in any case, further conspicuous by the diesel scandal: After the first seven months, only an extradition minus from 0.9 per cent to 3.37 million vehicles is to be found.
Fred Kappler, CEO of the Group, continued to present a sales margin from January to July.
At this time, 1.3 per cent more vehicles supplied Volkswagen, 5,904 million worldwide.
Volkswagen had manipulated exhaust gas tests.
In Germany alone, VW calls about 2.5 million cars for conversion into the repairers.
In the course of the conversion, VW confirmed that the conversion of cars has no negative effects.
After the conversion of the vehicles, there will be no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power.
The vehicle will provide the customer with a "guarantee" certificate after the conversion, but does not speak of a "guarantee," as was said on Friday in business circles.
The reason is legal subtlety.
The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen now guarantees its German customers a guarantee for converted diesel models.
Last Monday, this would have been confirmed by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport.
It was confirmed by the Ministry of Transport that this meeting was held.
"VW fully meets the requirements of my investigation commission and the KBA."
"Sections of this are not accepted," said Federal Minister for Transport, Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), according to the ministry.
VW has taken the guarantee that, in the case of fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power after the conversion, there will be no deterioration and all the type-approved vehicle values will remain unchanged.
Volkswagen itself does not use the term "guarantee" as it was said in company circles.
With the broad term "guarantee," Volkswagen provides the possibility for customers, for example, to come to a workshop half a year after the conversion, for example - and to return this to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
Also, in the interests of the customer, it is important to avoid that any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust scandal will lead to uncertainty regarding possible warranty regulations, as was said.
That is why VW does not use the term "guarantee."
