Ensuring clarity for 31 years
The managing director of the "Veitenstein Group," Ruppert Göller, is retiring.
The association is regarded as "Bavarian."
A small Franconian drinking water association as a model for the large water producers.
Some time ago it was in the original tone of the Bavarian Radio.
Little later, the water forum of the government of Unterfranken commended the purpose federation.
The work of the Veitenstein Group applies "Bavarian far as exemplary."
Behind all this is Rupert Göller, who was 31 years in the association of employees, of which 28 years as the managing director.
Now he has been retiring at the age of 65.
The Veitenstein Group with its headquarters in Kottendorf, municipality of broadband, promotes approximately 150000 cubic meters of water every year and supplies 32 places and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants.
The municipalities are the municipalities of Kirchloud, Broadbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.
Water supply contracts exist for other cities and municipalities.
The current president, Broadbrunn Mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller, in 1985, was set up as a waterkeeper and has already been appointed Managing Director of the Association of Objectives in 1988.
"His duties have been very varied and they have covered water management and maintenance work on office and organisational activities, budgeting, calculation of fees and contributions, and emergency rates for weekend ends," said the chairman.
As outstanding events, it called the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells (1994), land purchases in the area of the new wells (1998) and compensation for farmers, the renovation of the high container (1999), the creation of a central computer control (2004) and the partial renovation of water pipes.
There has been no stalemate, and there have always been innovations, because water is the most important food in the world, and drinking water is the most important food.
In her Laudatio, she praised Göllers's faithful, reliable and correct service over 31 years.
He has set himself up with a great deal of heart blood for his water group, and he has actually lived up to the Water Management Association as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a true practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veitenstein Group to reduce nitrates in the water forum of the Unterfranken area.
He has received a great deal of praise and praise for this.
Rupert Göller, for his part, praised Alfons Gabrael, who worked with him for 28 years.
He is the best waterkeeper and he was a faithful knee.
Together we were an unbeatable team.
As a highlight from his point of view, he described the construction of the fountain and the reorganisation of the purpose federation.
However, the biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the collapse of the high container at Kirchlouer on a third January.
Here we have to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night, so that the villages could be fed with water.
It was also possible to maintain the supply of Neubrunn only because the high container of Pettstadt was filled with hoses.
The management of the drinking water service association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who took the succession of Rupert Göller.
