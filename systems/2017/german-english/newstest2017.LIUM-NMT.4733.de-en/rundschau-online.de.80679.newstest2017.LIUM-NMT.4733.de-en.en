Looking at: Beverage market in forest fires invaded
A robbery was carried out on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Rewe XXL at the forest fires Gerberstraße.
On the basis of a firearms, three dark-dressed people, who had congregated their faces, asked for the release of cash from the employee of the beverage market and then, first and foremost, took refuge on foot and then presumably with a silver yellow VW gulf.
How much money has been exploited does not share the police.
The perpetrators should have been between 1.60 and 1.70 metres in size, in other words relatively small.
The beverage market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the Rewe-Market and is poorly visible.
After the robbery, the offenders have to move towards Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg, and from the gravel car park located in front of the Parkhauseinfahrt with the silver car, possibly in the direction of B 256 (Schladernring).
Anyone who has made observations (at 7.45 p.m.) in connection with the robbery, is to be reported to the police as a matter of urgency.
