Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available
According to the head of the Bank, the RBS brand is expected to be reduced to a back-office service.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told the BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the Bank's global ambitions.
The Bank has since dissociated itself since it had almost collapsed and saved eight years ago.
At this time, brand strategists "RBS" used to protect other consumer finance brands.
She supported international sports with millions of pounds of sponsoring, from the Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon, Andy Murray.
But now she has chosen to focus more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralised headquarters and the stock exchange listing are going to go to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other minor brands for retail, which will be more important - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and employees in Inverness shire.
He told the BBC Scotland: "The RSB brand will become our investment brand and the brand that our staff will be working on, as we are now becoming more of a bank of brands."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I now say that we are not pursuing global objectives but local objectives.
Each of these brands will be completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers under these brands.
RBS has already said that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the visibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship.
"It is time for us to develop at the bank of the brands, because how do we concentrate inside (we have asked) to make this a better bank for customers?" said the CEO.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and that these brands would have been launched.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think we will see many changes.
We can launch these brands again, so I think that the time has come.
