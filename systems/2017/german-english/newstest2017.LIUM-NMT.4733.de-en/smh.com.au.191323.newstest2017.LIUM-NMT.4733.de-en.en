More than just a Kardashian Reality-TV Star, Kendall is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue.
Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September edition of the US Vogue.
Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder, and ran on the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on her Instagram account.
"In a space full of people I love, the sight of this cover for wines," wrote Kendall.
The revelation of the Covers was followed by a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians?), scripted reality video that shows the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (except for the problems of Rob and Caitlyn, and in the presence of the most popular showbiz uncle and producer of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest).
This is the stereotypical act of nearly every birthday of a child's day (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought that we had forgotten you?," with the sincerity of a cartoonist on a television at 8 a.m.), but Kris had to leave her other girls somehow in this publicity.
With regard to the September edition of the Vogue, a new era of Kardashians has certainly begun.
Kendalls's big sister Kim may have beaten her as far as the Vogue cover is concerned (she and her husband Kanye West were to see it in April 2014), but the cover of the September edition of the magazine is a league for itself.
The September edition is the most sold edition of the year for Vogue.
With a volume that looks more like a picture band than a fashion magazine, the output attracts a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista was from the 832 pages of the ramp 615 pages advertising).
The revelation of his co-star is so eagerly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine were leaked before the official announcement.
Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years there were clearly more "celebrities, the models" as "models that are celebrities" on the cover.
Oscar-Prize winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer herself was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honour.
But even with the little chance that Mrs Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakage model" of her generation - falls under the previous category, she is in good society.
These celebrities are not related to famous people or Reality Stars or young people of today, who know how to turn a good snapchat video (even if all of these are applicable to Jenner).
They are really talented women who are in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of lemonade.
Of course, Jenner's success is not everyone's success.
With her reality TV history, Jenner's position in the world of fashion has always been somewhat tense.
In June, the former Victoria's secret-model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague, Gigi Hadid, criticised and called them "the mistpieces of the moment."
These feelings came up again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue cover.
But there seems to be a mistake on the point at the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue.
It is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.
She runs for Marc Jacobs.
It makes advertising for your greeting of Estee Lauder.
They and all their sisters sell images of themselves on their respective pay apps.
She sells her pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine LOVE.
And in her leisure time she is in Reality TV, probably only to see her sister Kourtney and her children.
