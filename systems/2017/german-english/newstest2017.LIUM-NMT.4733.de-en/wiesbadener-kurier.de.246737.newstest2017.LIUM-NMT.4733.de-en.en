One for all cases
Honda HR-V is flexible and everyday
In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: A little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan.
Sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.
Although the HR-V, which is only 1.60 m high, is rather small, the passengers have a lot of space in both the first row and the rear, it does not work closely.
The materials of the interior are well processed and are pleasant, but only the cockpit top has something to do.
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles.
It is not only a bounce room of 453 litres at high level and 1026 l. It is available at the same time as the "Magic Seats" and the "Magic Seats."
This is less magic than it sounds: The seat of the back bank can be folded up like a child's boiler and thus offer storage space, which is 1.24 m high from the ground up to the ceiling.
The boot room can be loaded well, but the loading height with 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1.6-l-Diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges very powerful.
However, he is expected to do his work more quietly.
The daily consumption of 4,7 l/100 km is gratifying.
There is another motorisation: A 1,5-l-Benziner with 96 kW / 130 hp.
An all-wheel drive is not offered.
Driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamism and comfort.
But the governance should be a little more direct.
The equipment in the top version of "Executive" does not leave any wishes open.
Security systems include the city emergency brake assistant (working up to speed 32), the collision warning system and the track record assistant.
The collision warner sometimes irritates because it evaluates many obstacles as "approaching objects."
The remote light assistant works very reliably.
And the intelligent Temporegler responds to the traffic sign detection and reduces the speed when required.
Full connectivity is available only for the top level: 7-inch touchscreen, Navi, App-Integration and more.
Two USB and one HDMI connector are under the armrest and are therefore to be achieved in a cumbersome way.
The around 29000 euros for the well equipped top diesel are in order.
If you don't want to invest so much, you will receive the gasoline from €20000, the Diesel from 23000 euros.
The engines meet the Euro 6 emissions standard.
With the HR-V Honda offers a versatile and all-day car.
