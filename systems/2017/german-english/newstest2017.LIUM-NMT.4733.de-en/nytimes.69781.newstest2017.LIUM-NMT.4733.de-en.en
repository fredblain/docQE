The US wins fourth match for women's field hockey, a showdown with Britain
One day after having shot three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the American women won 3-0.
Five goals in two games should be a worthy achievement, but Bam (27) said that they could not remember that they had ever done.
"I have no idea," she said.
I am not one of the people who remember their goals.
However, they know that the American women stand at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are also in their group with the Britons in the first place, which, after their 2-0 victory against Japan, remain unsecured.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last round of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals, the game will decide which of the two within their group of six teams will each get the first and second place.
The first place will be a little longer for the strong Dutchmen who lead the other group.
Whatever the outcome of the game on Saturday, the American women have created a surprising confusion by their success story, four years after they landed at the last London Games in the last 12 places.
BAM was part of this team.
She grew in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years in hands (her two older sisters played the sport at the Drexel University), with 16 years she became national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.
They missed the Olympics in 2008, because they could not qualify for the cadre.
Then came the year 2012, where everything went wrong for her and her team.
In the following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the national team and thus began to turn things to better.
"A cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," Bam said.
We did not have the work in London that we now have.
We have been able to get rid of the ruder.
On Thursday evening, Bam opened the doors in the first half of the game with a handshake from the local area.
India was in the game without victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the game from 1-0 to the third quarter, until Bam took the game into its hands.
She carried out a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and left the ball in the gate to give the American women a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.
The Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the USA, Jackie Briggs, who had previously had to make a goal in each of the previous games.
It has a course.
Just like Bam.
"We are in a good position," said Parnham, but how good will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday.
