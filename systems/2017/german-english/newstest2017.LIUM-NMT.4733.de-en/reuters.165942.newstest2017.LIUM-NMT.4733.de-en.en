Gilead receives legal costs from hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A US president has decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to a refund of the legal costs incurred by her from the Hepatits C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was exempted from a $200 million compensation payment for the breach of two patents of Merck, which were associated with the blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead, after a US judge revealed a pattern of misconduct by Mercks, including the freedom of expression and other unethical acts.
In the case of the action on Thursday, US President Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead has the right to adopt the costs incurred during the defence of the case.
Merck tries to match with Gilead, which dominates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs, which can cure more than 90% of patients with liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck accused each other of each other and the property on laboratory work that Sofosbuvir underlying the active ingredient in Gilead's drugs.
