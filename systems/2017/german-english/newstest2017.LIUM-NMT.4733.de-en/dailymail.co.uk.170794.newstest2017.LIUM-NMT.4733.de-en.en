Traveller Ian Wright scaled his tongue at the dirty places of Europe for a travel guide
A British traveler underwent a serious investigation of his immune system and the wormhole - by leaving some of Europe's dirtiest and most secretive places.
The presenter and traveler Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, drove his course on a Euro ticket, a banker at the Piccadilly Circus, a flop of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to demonstrate the resilience of his immune system.
Before the end of each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us to show what he is going to do.
But the experiment that was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" brought some surprising results to light.
The idea of filling the flush of a train toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be totally repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
On his journey through Europe, Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of colorectal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing left him, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.
Mr Wright was known to test the resilience of his intestine by riding roughshod over the world and enjoying unique and wonderful things.
From public chants to stations to flush heads of toilets, the mission has definitely put his immune system under a test
In the film he told: "As a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."
In the film, he was in any case fair to his reputation.
The only thing he opposed was a loud public toilet in Russia.
His sample showed a luminaire number of more than 4000 units.
In comparison, the luminometers of freshly washed hands are less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to eat, after its luminometometers were more than 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60.
Mr Wright and the Finnish producer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in various places such as the bathroom
In the film he says: "That comes close to the worst thing I have in a toilet."
There is nothing more dirty than that!
I will do nothing about this, because it is urgent in this respect.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish producer of dairy products Valio.
The company provides Mr Wright with Valio Battilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D in order to support the promotion of colorectal bacteria and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We wanted to offer consumers really something new.
Something that is fascinating for viewing and, at the same time, explaining the advantages of probiotics.
We carried out crazy brainstormings that ended that we said "Let us call Ian."
They claim that the interest in colorectal health will become a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to place them in a wider context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of colorectal health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in colorectal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we have been able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!
Tom HAKALA, who directed the film, added: "Let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had leaned some of the things I ordered him to lick, like the ecelastic Russian toilet that is shown in the film."
Of course, there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to try them and others where it was rather difficult.
I am glad that we have included some of these delicious leaks on film."
In a survey carried out by Valio in 2015, 84% of all respondents associated with Milk acid bacteria, in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestinal and 58 percent, said that at least occasionally they use products containing attached milk-acid bacteria.
