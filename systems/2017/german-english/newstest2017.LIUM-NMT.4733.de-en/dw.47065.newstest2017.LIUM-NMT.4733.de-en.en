Donald Trump admits massive problems in the election campaign
The leadership of the US Republicans is plagued by massive worries, even in traditionally conservative states, to lose their majority.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump has now admitted weaknesses in his election campaign in the former Republican stronghold of Utah.
A rare moment in which the usually large and self-assured multimillionaire said something like concern, as correspondents reported.
After having thrown 16 rivals within his own Republican camp out of the race, doubts about his success in the battle for the White House are now growing.
"We have huge problems in Utah," said Trump before evangelical Christians that he asked for support in important states such as Ohio, Florida, or Virginia.
To blame are the false reports of his candidacy, he reinstated his well-known media.
Wackening Republican strongholds
Utah is usually a safe bank for the Republicans.
According to a survey conducted by SurveyUSA in June, Trump and his rival, Hillary Clinton, were on the same footing.
Other institutions see Trump ahead, but not with the distance that is common for Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also at risk.
In an interview with CNBC, Trump responded to the question of how to stop Clinton's advance: "just as I have done so far."
And whether it will be "successful," or I'll do a very nice, long holiday."
He does nothing else than to "tell the truth."
If it is not enough for him for reasons of political correctness, be that in order, Trump said.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to the press, the Trump party is supposed to have threatened to remove funds to support his campaign, if he does not be able to present better results.
Instead of doing so, the Republicans" candidates for Congress have a greater role to play in Congress.
