Jewish director has broken Berlin's hotel because Israeli pre-election has been removed from the "Arab" call - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media rebellion after he had betrayed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli pre-election, as it had "requested" Arab guests "requested."
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah" caused his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel's list of countries.
However, the country was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel has been eliminated and deleted?
Wrote Lanzmann.
Instead, the Kempinksi Bristol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own Call Center.
After a statement, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received there "shocked him," as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel staff said that the measure was a "deliberate decision of the management of the Kempinski Hotels."
The reason behind it was even more furious in the director.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre-election be deleted," was quoted the employee of Lanzmann.
The Israeli ambassador in Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great shame," reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
We were horrified and dismayed from this event.
That is really very shameful.
The fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even more disgraceful.
No explanation is needed.
We expect the hotel to "draw the right conclusions," said the official.
The incident caused a fairly large response on the Internet, where people called the whole affair a scandal.
Some of the people of the Kempinski Hotel said that it would "have given way to the supposed calls of Arab guests."
"Have you," it was said in another speech that it was pointed out that the hotel, which is located on the noble Kurfürstendamm, is close to a synagogue.
The hotel quickly made all the accusations of itself and called the event a "mistake" and "apologized" at Lanzmann, reported Der Spiegel.
"There was never a direct statement "to not include Israel in the quicklist," the Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesperson of the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the country code has now been added.
