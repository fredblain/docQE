B27-Sanation: Restaurants suffer from blocking
There is nothing to forget about the speed with which the B 27 is renovated.
There is a lot of praise for those responsible for the construction work which starts at 5.30 a.m. and ends at 20: 00.
"These have made things quite zacky," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet tank.
This is a super-team.
Nor is there any default.
The construction site could be moved to the south at the beginning of the week, until the end of October.
Praise will also be given to those responsible for the work of the works, for instance when it comes to setting up temporary journeys.
Since the construction site has migrated to the south on Monday and the blocking of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen has been lifted and the connection to Rottenburg also exists, the traffic situation has relaxed within the place.
The citizens of Ofterdingen are now back on both sides of the B 27.
There seems to be a return of traffic through the place.
"Since there were some serious complaints," says Florian King, responsible for the management of the renovation.
The residents of Bakhenstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because many light routes were looking for and more familiar to their Navi than the signage.
What led to some lorry driving in residential areas.
Since the speed limits have not been observed, the municipality increased the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.
"There have been considerable overruns," says King, who made himself aware of the situation on the ground.
There have already been two to three per minute.
The quickest was travelling with 77 kilometers in the Tempo-30 zone.
Since the site has been moved, it has become more quiet.
For the businessmen at the B 27, it is only a small consolation that the road is open to customers from Rottenburg.
They are not happy to look at the cards.
But that the B 27-Sanation has led them to take up sales, each one is asked to look through.
However, some are more and some less affected.
Those who have less to do with the "end customer" are produced for other companies, for which the rehabilitation has little effect.
Thomas Sulz also speaks of a "slight decline" of the car in Maier, but also admits that "the race is missing."
The most exploited are the clubs along the road.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the steakhouse, formerly crown, finds clear words.
This is already threatening.
Not only it, but all restaurants have "hit hard."
It failed customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil.
We must be happy with every euro turnover.
The loss of turnover amounts to "well above 50%."
The road recovery has "thrown back two years."
Half of his staff had to dismiss him.
If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been made redundant, the policy would have reacted differently.
Instead, President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a question by Göhner, whether there could be a financial compensation, with the indication that the restaurant will benefit from the benefits of the situation at the B 27. Now, it must also bear the disadvantages arising from the renovation.
Göhner knows about other districts where it has been handled more generously.
In all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.
Finally, the family business has been here since 1715, it refers to the long history.
It can be understood that other regular guests are now less frequently watching because of the complicated mode of transport.
If you cannot drive, it is also nice elsewhere.
Göhner has no doubt that his tribal clientele will come back to the end of the remediation work.
Despite the crises with BSE and avian influenza, Göhner considers the impact of the B 27 work on his customers for the greatest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its many years of history.
Six months of work, which is already brutal.
