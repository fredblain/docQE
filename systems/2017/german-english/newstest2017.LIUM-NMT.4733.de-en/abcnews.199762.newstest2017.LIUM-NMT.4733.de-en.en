28-year-old Koch in San Francisco Mall died dead
A 28-year-old chef, who recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping centre.
The victim's brother said that he could not imagine anyone who would hurt him, "Entily, it was going uphill with him."
The corpse found on Wednesday morning in the Westfield Mall was identified as the 28 year old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, told the court of justice in San Francisco.
The San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as murder and the investigations are running.
The brother of the victim, Louis Galicia, told the ABS transmitter KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who previously worked as a chef in Boston, gave his dream job as chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokesman of the Sons & Daughters said that she was "shocked and destroyed by his death."
"We are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss him painfully," said the spokesman.
Our thoughts and condolences are at this difficult time at Franks family and friends.
Louis Galicia announced that Frank first lived in hostels, but that "things for him finally went uphill."
"He found a apartment, he had a girlfriend," said Louis Garcia KGO.
Louis Galicia said that he could not imagine anyone who would hurt his younger brother.
He was a friendly person with a great heart.
His way of combining his family with his family was to give us something to cook, to prepare us for dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to participate in any kind of controversy.
He was the brother who swunk with the stream.
"In everything that goes wrong in the world, he was this uncle Diamant, who brightly lit every day," he said.
