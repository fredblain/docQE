The future of Portland's melting pot due to the lifting of the energy contract
The future of Portland's aluminium melting in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - are at stake, as the plant operator will terminate the energy supply contract and thus lift all supply contracts, as the supplying energy company announced.
This was followed by the decision of the Government in Victoria earlier this year not to grant any further subsidies for the operation of the plant.
A 20-year subsidy will expire in November.
Up to 2000 jobs in Alcoa's plant in Portland are at stake.
No less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure.
Moreover, it could lead to domino effects, as the melting process consumes around 10% of the total power generation of Victorias.
In 2014, Alcoa concluded the Point Henry Schmelzerei, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa's melting pot in Portland loses money and risks closing down.
This step follows years of speculation about the future of the plant, initially as a result of the strong Australian dollar and, most recently, the electricity price for the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melting machine with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that it is expected that three other owners will terminate their contracts.
The plant is in the majority possession of a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity through melting," said the company.
AGL continued to say that the contracts were so-called "security transactions," which would have been in force since November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period so that they will end in 2017.
"From this point of view, AGL considers that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenue," said the electricity supplier.
All potential effects on AGL revenue from GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL announced that it had already written off the value of the contracts in its annual accounts of $187 million in "expectation of termination."
Alcoa said that the decision to make the contracts, the "ability of Alcoas... to run the melting or the supply of electricity to the melting machine" did not affect.
The US company said that it had completed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which should have entered into force in November this year, even if it is still guilty of a declaration of why it has resigned from the Treaty.
As a result of the bad economic conditions of the industry, analysts warn against the possible closure of the Portland Schmelzerei in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.
In reference to the analysts' statements at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland uses approximately 600 megawatts and Tomago around 900 megawatts of electricity annually.
If both units disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [electricity market].
And for us, as electricity producer, it would not be good," he said.
