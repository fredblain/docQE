Once sold over the price of the market, Café is back in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a damaged coffee shop in Williamsburg, in which one could only pay cash, which had no Wi-Fi, but for 15 years it served good coffee.
Of course, the prices from his Bedford Avenue crowd out of charge.
The Soap Cherie business, which replaced the verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of Cupcakes.
Indigenous people have been the last loss in a city that is gentrified.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know, New York is changing, but I still cannot believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea hotel is excluded and verb is now a soap business."
But if New York is changing, it is also reinventing.
A revived Verb Cafe opened in Greenpoint last November, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same employees and a similarly simple atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old café, the owner and managing director of the new café.
He started working at Verb in 2001 and remained there until the end.
When a customer offered to provide funds for a new outpost, he was excited to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, maintained a great deal.
Verb used the same espresso machine model to use the same distributor for the Bagels.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said that he also wanted to experiment.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the menu there are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnizations such as capers and soaked onions.
There are natural travel dishes.
The café no longer serves a beer, and there are fresh juices for this purpose.
After nine months, Rodriguez said that he had noticed a constant stream of old regular customers.
"many old customers have also been squeezed out by prices from Williamsburg," he said.
Recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, lived earlier in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would take the path.
After the verb had closed, she gave a while the coffee box, she said.
"It was clear to me that it was the coffee and the culture of the verb that struck me," she said.
Now she is drinking coffee again, even if she ordered a blended Chai Tea on this day, instead of her usual Iced coffee, which is another new addition.
Since the beginning of the verb in 2003, Tom Rosenthal has been another long-standing and faithful customer.
He went there before the work and inevitably ordered the same.
"I came quarter after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Everything-Bagel with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and incorporate new ingredients into the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his Everything-Bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said that he did not think that the soap shop took the old business room.
In fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered to produce a special soap for verb with the coffee of the café as an ingredient.
"I think we will go back to their offer," said Rodriguez.
And the traditional Polish inhabitants, Greenpoints, have also accepted the café.
A new customer has translated the menu into the Polish and Rodriguez said that he plans to exhibit it soon so that his new neighbours feel welcome.
The site also has other advantages.
A local juice shop wants to fill in and sell the hot coffee in the bottle.
There is an opportunity to expand the café to a nearby building.
For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a regular customer, saying that he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed.
When the new café opened, Whitt said that the entry of the restaurant and the order felt a new coffee like a return.
"I had to smell it," he said.
