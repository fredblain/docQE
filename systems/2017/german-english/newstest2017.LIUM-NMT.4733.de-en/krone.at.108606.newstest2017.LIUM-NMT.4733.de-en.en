Bombing in Thailand - Austrians injured - Several deaths
The Austrian Embassy in Thailand was in contact with the woman, said the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Thomas Schn√∂ll, Friday morning.
She has suffered cuts and has been treated in hospital, but have already been able to leave it.
Your home trip was scheduled for the beginning of September.
It is still unclear whether the other explosions on the island of Phuket, as well as in the southern towns of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon, also affect Austrian citizens.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities.
Hua Hin, located around 200 km south of Bangkok's capital, has exploded in two bombs on Thursday evening in a quarter of the city.
According to the police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrians, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
Friday morning, there were once again two exploits, and another human being killed, according to the authorities.
A bomb explosion was also reported by Phuket in the morning.
A taxi driver was injured in the detonation near the popular beach of Patong, which was popular on holidaymakers.
In Surat Thani on the south-east coast of the country, another bomb killed an urban employee.
The earthquake, according to the authorities, went into the air in a flower bed in front of the Refour of the Coastal Police.
After the end of the Second World War, Phang Nga and Trang, on the south-west coast and in Chumphon on the south-east coast, called for a number of injuries.
From a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it was said.
"The bomb attacks carry the same manuscript," said Army General Danai Kritmethavee Friday morning before journalists.
"We believe that this is a coordinated attack."
It is too early to comment on possible motives - but probably they are the actions of Muslim rebels.
Thai media, too, wanted to recognize in the attacks a pattern typical of the bombing of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
The Thai police, on the other hand, said that the attacks were not related to the Islamist insurgency or to international terrorism.
"This is only local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces," said a spokesperson in Bangkok.
Rather, it is believed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military junta have been laid.
In the past few days, the authorities would have received secret references to imminent attacks in the south of the country, but they were not informed about the exact time and the places.
It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.
The police told their officials throughout the country to strengthen security around important government buildings and airports, stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.
In Thailand, there are still small bomb attacks, but most of them are not directed against tourists.
In Hua Hin is a palace that has been used for years by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
After the current bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its homepage to comply with the instructions of the Thai security authorities.
High security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and surroundings.
After clashes between security forces and Muslim populations, there is no need to travel to these provinces.
Increased security risk (security level 2) applied to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution prepared by the military junta.
This will give the military a great deal of influence over the next few years.
Junta boss and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs were an attempt to stifle chaos while the country is moving towards stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.
The military unta, which took power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, considers itself to have been able to bring the kingdom back to stability and order.
However, the military has not been able to cope with the insurgency of Muslim rebels who have been living in the extreme south of the country for years.
More than 6500 people have already been killed in the conflict.
Almost a year ago, in Bangkok, 20 people were killed in an attack on a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.
It was the most bloody attack on the country's recent history.
