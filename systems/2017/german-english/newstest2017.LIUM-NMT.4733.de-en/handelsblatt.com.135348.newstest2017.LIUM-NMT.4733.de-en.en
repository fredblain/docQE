The Enforcement Trailer
Germany's Raser has to adapt to the next generation of speed knives: In various states, among others in Hesse and Brandenburg, new flash devices are being tested to transfer the Temposunder in a particularly effective way.
The futuristic Enforcement Trailer of the Vitronic company from Wiesbaden may, for example, be used in areas of accident, where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, there are no necessary infrastructure to ensure the compliance with speed limits, for example, on motorway construction sites or on renovating bridges with temporary temples.
However, a mobile device can be too dangerous or cumbersome.
The Enforcement Trailer is autark: Its battery holds five days at uninterrupted measurement operation, the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem.
With laser measuring technology, all vehicles can also be detected at the same time across several tracks.
Variable speed limits as well as driving bans after time, driving strips and vehicle classes can also be monitored.
It is possible to move the trailer in a highly-driven condition, according to the manufacturer, with each car with trailer clutch.
So that it is not easy to clamp down, it is reduced in the measurement operation, so that the wheels disappear in the armored and, by the way, even smoother outer shell.
In addition, a built-in alarm system is intended to protect the blouse from vandalism.
Since 2015 the trailer has been tested according to Vitronic in various federal countries and has now been used.
Also foreign authorities are blessing with the new technology: Recently France has ordered 100 pieces, following an order of 150 pieces over the past year.
