Rio 2016: ROBEL Kiros Habte becomes Internethit
The Olympic Games or the world records do not always have the headlines at the Olympic Games.
This shows the courageous appearance of ROBEL Kiros at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.
In the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight float from Ethiopia was so slow that it could no longer be seen in the TV pictures.
It simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut was selected.
In the social networks, Habte subsequently became a viral internethit.
In fact, the 24 year old, with a backlog of 48 seconds, finished its course and occupied the 59th place of 59 starters.
But it was rather his not exactly sporty figure who drew the attention of the international media.
Why does the 24 year old take part in the Olympic Games?
The Ethiopian got a special start law from the international swimming pool.
This is distributed in order to make swimming in under-represented countries more well-known.
As the majority of the athlete was running in the field, Habte simply wanted to do something else.
Preparation is all: ROBEL Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.
The first nicknames quickly made the round.
Some media called it "ROBEL of the Wal."
The English tabloid "The Sun" with "Dad Bod" made fun of it.
His time, he only beat with one minute and almost five seconds over the 100 m free style, played no role here.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.
At the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, the course of Eric Moussambani provided media attention.
The appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea was an unforgettable experience, when it had to take over 100 metres of free style on its own.
Frenetically, Moussambani was fired at the time.
The then 22-year-old learned to swim only eight months before Olympia and had never had such a long distance before the competition.
