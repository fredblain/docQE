Woman suspected suicide on Swiss motorway
The victim was on the motorway in the middle of the night.
The police call witnesses after a woman was overturned on a highway in the early morning hours on Thursday in the case of a suspected suicide of several vehicles.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the Canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.
A woman put on the street in the dark "in an act of despair" and were hit by several cars, said the police in Vaud.
It is obvious that a Swiss woman, at the age of 49, who was overrun by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill himself.
She died on the ground.
Several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, said the police, who are asking them, as well as any witnesses of the incident, to sign up.
An investigation procedure was opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, said Gilles Hofstetter to the Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed.
Was a collision preventable?
This is something that the public prosecutor must decide," said Hofstetter.
Two similar cases over the past five years show that drivers are not being held responsible.
In each of the two cases, where one person was on the motorway in the dark, it was decided that the motorists did not have to expect a pedestrians to run on the motorway in the middle of the night, as was said in the newspaper.
Last year, a policeman of the negligent killing was released after she had passed and killed a man who was at the A1 near Payerne in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and became unconscious on the street, the court took away.
The court found that the policeman -- who responded to an emergency call -- was in a legitimate way, and that the presence of a man on the road was a "completely extraordinary and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone who has further information on the event on Thursday, near Morges, should contact the police under the number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
