Simone Biles creates gold in the throne
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all of this.
Dynamic on the springboard.
Effortless on the bar.
Breathtaking on the ground.
At the same time it is very important.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
On Thursday, the 19-year-old American turlady erklom on Thursday for a multi-battle title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.
Their total score of 62.198 was clearly before the silver medal winner and "Final Five" team of Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.
The American women, Simone Biles, turnt on the wavelength during the single campaign of women in the art tournament at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro in 2016, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American, who wins a multi-battle title and, as a whole, the fifth, while consolidating her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.
She broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey came to an end at that moment.
This success brings them to the same league as a unique athlete such as Michael Phelps, who has brought her sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated her sport for the past three years, 15 World Championships - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the 1984 Olympic champion, Mary Lou rescuon, told her that she is "the best turderman I've ever seen."
They expected a final exam in Brazil, a competition that did not go so far between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.
Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be seen as disappointment.
The Americans, Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman, are outraged after they won gold and silver in the individual campaign of women in the art tournament at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, Thursday.
Biles took the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as an exclamation mark at the farewell ceremony of the team coordinator Martha Karolyi in retirement.
Although Biles insisted, during their long journey to the top, never planned to have the future, that is not really true.
Part of its soil exercises - which contain its typical tumbling pass - is linked to Latin American music, which would fit at home on the road outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
It is no coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child, and was discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school flight in the gym in which Boorman trained, was put into effect.
Since the summer of 2013, it has no longer lost a competition competition, a series of victories that will continue as long as it wishes.
Even if Mustafina easily led through two rotations, the image drove.
Schwebebalken and Bodenturnen - in which Biles holds the World Championship title - lauded.
She picked up again with 15.433 on the swear bar - and put one on the ground with a 15.933 on the ground.
Raisman embraced them gently when she expected her final result - a pure formality - and tears flowed on Biles shiny red, white and blue Eyeliners, as the vision that she once described in her collection book became reality.
Raisman's performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago, when she fought for third place, but the bronze medal in a Tiebrake went to Mustafina.
This time, the 22 year old team capital called "Oma" by the Americans had a lead.
After her soil exercise, she overthrew the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes appeared doubtful.
As far as Biles is concerned, the rapidly expanding Tweet of the 19-year olds, from the beginning of this week, has a very new meaning:
