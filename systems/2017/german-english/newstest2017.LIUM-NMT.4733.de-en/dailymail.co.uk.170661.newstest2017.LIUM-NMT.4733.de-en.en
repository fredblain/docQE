Assistant doctors would like to organize more strikes after rejecting Jeremy's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by adopting a reformed Treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 per cent of the 37.000 assistants who voted in an election rejected him.
In July, Hunt revealed plans to introduce the treaty and said that the NHS would be in a "no-land country" and that any further delay would be harmful to employees and patients.
The first assistants are to receive a new contract that contains changes to night and weekend packages to improve care at a time of time.
Dr Ellen McCourt, the president of the BMA Committee for Assistants, announced last night in a communication: "Assistants have serious concerns about the proposed Treaty, in particular that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and do it to treat all doctors in a fair way."
For only eight weeks left until the first group of doctors falls under the new Treaty, progress must be made and time is running out.
Efforts on the part of BMA to resolve the disputes by talking to the government for reluctance to participate and sometimes deafening silence.
This was the promise made by Jeremy Hunt only last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, lift the effort and raise the concerns of the assistants."
If he fails to do so, the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further industrial action.
The last strike at the end of April saw a postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 dates, as nurses and specialists were involved to provide coverage to physicians on the strike chain.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by adopting the reformed Treaty with the functionaries of the British Medical Association.
BMA wants to have a better week-end pay for the 54,000 assistants who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director General of the NHS staff, asked the assistants to stop the strike.
Mortimer said: "Measures of industrial action have nothing to do with little, but already burdensome teams and service providers and prepare patients, carers and their families only of concern, need and interruption."
Over the past two months, we have spoken to the Committee of Assists and have responded positively with the Ministry of Health and other ministries to the concerns about the guardians and the whistleblowings.
Employers hoped that continued positive engagement on other important issues - such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a career, training, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how seriously the employers, the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health were concerned about compliance with BMA in November, February and May.
