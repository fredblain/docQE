GfK's leadership comes after disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK exchanged its head, Matthias Hartmann.
The resignations came suddenly - but not quite surprisingly.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK showed that the chair of the Executive Board, Matthias Hartmann, becomes all the more uncertain the longer the success he has promised.
Turbulent at the head of the Nuremberg market research company GfK: Once again disappointing business figures and the resignation of the company's management are the world's number five in front of a personal new beginning.
GfK CEO will leave the company at the end of the year.
The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board, Arno Mahert, is already leaving the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September.
The management board of the Management Board will take over the previous member of the Board of Management, Gerhard Hausruckinger, as of 1 September, informed the company.
He should officially take over the function of a "board speaker," until a successor for Hartmann was found.
As a reason for the resignations, the company called "different views" for long-term business orientation.
Details did not want to call a business spokesperson on Friday.
It is still unclear who will lead the market research company in the future.
In investor circles it was said on Friday that the shareholders were most disappointed with the continued success of the restructuring undertaken years ago.
Mr Hartmann has been at the GfK head since 2011.
"The fruits of the restructuring are not yet to be seen after 5 years," said it.
In view of the last bad GfK business figures, each shareholder will at some point be restless.
"If this were the case at BMW, that would be the same thing as the quandts," he said.
After setbacks, the company had not been able to stop its loss drive in the second quarter of 2016.
With 361.2 million euros, sales fell by 6.1 percent below the level of the same quarter of the previous year.
In the first half of the year, sales declined by 3.4% with EUR 721.2 million.
The profit gained in the second quarter mainly affected the company's reduced value in the face of its difficult economic situation.
The company's value write-downs of 139 million euros, which were needed in the Consumer Experience Division, gave the group a loss of EUR 148.2 million.
In the second quarter of 2015, GfK generated a consolidated profit of 19.7 million.
