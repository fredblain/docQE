Criminal Minds Star Thomas Gibson fired after producer beat
Last month Gibson took part in a physical dispute on the set of the series in Los Angeles.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced in a joint statement his dismissal.
Gibson, who played the Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, publicly apologised on Thursday prior to the announcement of his dismissal.
There were artistic differences and a difference of opinion on the set.
I regret the incident," he said in a communication.
For details on how the character Gibsons comes out of the series that follows a team of FBI agents, they are expected to be released at a later date, according to the opinion of ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old who previously played in the sitcom Dharma & Greg was involved since the first season of the series in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have brought up my entire heart blood over the past twelve years," said Gibson in a communication published on Friday.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but that will no longer be possible.
I would like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and, above all, the best fans who can only wish for a series.
The planned broadcast of the twelfth season is scheduled to take place on 28 September.
