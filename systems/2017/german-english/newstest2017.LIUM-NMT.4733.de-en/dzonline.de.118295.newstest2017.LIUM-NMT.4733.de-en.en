Olympia: Three cases of fraud in the case of doping
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary committee on the case.
Kenya's athlete faces the Second World War of the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro Ungemach.
After an attempt to combat doping in the Olympic village, Kenya sent a coach to the home.
The International Olympic Committee agreed to immediately set up a disciplinary committee to investigate the case.
A Kenyan functionary had announced that the former sprinter and today Coach, John Anzrah, had made a urine sample at the Olympic village under the name of the 800-Meter farmer Ferguson Rotich.
This has been reported to Kenya's team management from the monitoring agencies.
The International Federation of IAAF has asked the IOC for information on the case to make its own investigations, an IAAF spokesperson informed.
"According to the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IOC, the IAAF will carry out an assessment," said an ILO declaration.
"He (Anzrah) has gone to the doping control station and has spent himself as Ferguson Rotich, the sample and signed," said Kenya's head of Mission Stephan Arap Soi.
He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete, who was on the list of training controls of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
Ferguson Rotich had become more than 800 metres in Beijing in 2015.
Four days earlier, the Kenyan athletic delegate, Michael Rotich, had been removed from the Rio Games.
He is supposed to have informed the country's sportsmen and women of upcoming doping tests.
According to media reports, he should have been arrested on his return to Nairobi Airport.
Kenya stands at the IOC for a long time and has been under special observation for a long time.
In the announcement of the IOC's more than 2000 doping targets in the run-up to the Rio Games, it was unusual to point out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are being targeted.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had put a great deal of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympic start.
As a result, WADA Kenya took part in the list of countries whose fight against doping is consistent with the rules of WADA.
Kenya is regarded as a great lender nation.
The country's athletics won most medals during the 2015 World Championship in Beijing.
In a number of television reports of the ARD, allegations have repeatedly been made that doping funds are easily accessible in Kenya and that there should be a significant mindset of sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya, as he had done in Russian athletics.
It has been shown that in this sport, there has been a widespread and systematic use of this type of sport.
Russia's athletics were then excluded from the summer games.
