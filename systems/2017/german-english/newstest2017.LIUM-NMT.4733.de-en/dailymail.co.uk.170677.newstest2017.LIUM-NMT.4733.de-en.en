Political Correctness culture boosts electoral fraud in Muslim areas
Former Mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year on the basis of a government report on corruption.
A culture of political correctness has caused widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities to be knowingly ignored, as demonstrated by a devastating government report today.
The former cabinet member, Sir Eric Pickles, speaks verbally to the police, election observers, and town halls for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse on the basis of "hypersensitivity to ethnie and religion."
The former Minister for Integration and Local Government, who is now an anti-corruption king, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to establish lock-outs outside of ballot boxes to protect intimidated voters.
He recommends that voters should lead a card to demonstrate their identity in elections.
At the moment, a voters must only call his name and address.
The report proposes that non-removable inks be put on the finger of a person when they vote in order to prevent someone from electing twice.
Whistleblower should receive more protection, says Sir Eric.
It calls for the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions from non-official commentary or working groups.
"This is not only against electoral fraud, but is also intended to protect the local government from the broader culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a consequence of the Tower Hamlet electoral scandal in East London.
Last year, a special election court decided that the current mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from his office after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had "cynically perverted" the religious feelings of his Muslim community, and that he would have silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman is supposed to "have led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to elect him."
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the consequence of a imitation in which one person elects as someone else.
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud across the country.
In particular, he expressed an alarming view of the fraudulent selection of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community would have put pressure on people to elect a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, drawn up, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including the use of cards to demonstrate identity.
In his report, it says: 'The proof has been shown that pressure has been exerted on vulnerable members of certain ethnic minorities, particularly women and young people, to vote in accordance with the will of the elderly, in particular communities with Pakistani or bangling background.
"There were concerns that... state institutions would knowingly ignored such behavior on the basis of "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnie and religion."
Sir Eric talked about 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including the ban on political activists working out post-ballot papers to stop "election harvests."
The report, which is being considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher registration checks in order to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and social fraud.
Consider options to ask voters before the election after your identity.
Do not use removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone from electing twice.
To carry out systematic reviews of a person's nationality in order to ensure that they are entitled to vote.
A three-year limit to requests for automatic mail selection.
Ban on political activists working in full letter elections and envelopes.
Give the police the power to set up barriers to polling stations.
A change of law to facilitate charges of intimidation in accordance with the Representation of the People Act 1983 (Law of the People's Law in 1983).
Ban on photography in electoral stations.
Requirement that only English should be used in the voting stations (except Wales).
Intensifying the training in order to ensure that employees get the rule that voters go to the ballot box on their own.
Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing," that after the Tower of Hamlet, no criminal display has been filed.
"The election court ruled Lutfur Rahman and his deputy for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.
It was found guilty for a number of reasons, in accordance with the high standards of criminal law.
He also criticizes the ineffective "Abhakchecks" of the electoral registration departments of the town halls.
Sir Eric said: "The judgment in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.
Our country, as the mother of the parliaments, has a proud heritage, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities is threatening this good reputation.
