Donald Trump's campaign for election campaign accused of using a gun.
New York: Donald Trump's campaign has been charged for alleged inaction after it has been informed that her campaign leader for North Carolina, in February, has sent a gun to an employee while travelling in a jeep in February.
The event is described in an indictment which was filed on Wednesday in the District Court of Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in this state.
Bordini admitted to have been waiting for months for the matter to be settled internally before he realized that "that would not happen."
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, "pulled a gun, put his right finger on the withdrawal, and rammed the run in Vincents Kniekehle," Bordini gave in his charge.
After having complained to the local and regional campaign management, Bordini found that at least four more people had already had the same experience with Phillip, he admitted in the indictment.
"Arms must not be fired on to cause damage," said Bordini.
The charge comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate triggered a revolt when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment People" - firearms owners and weapons friends - should take action if his Rivalin Hillary Clinton is elected and judges should appoint.
Trump's campaign made it clear that the media would have taken its words out of context, and that it would not incite violence.
Bordinis complaint calls for compensation from the campaign for the infringement of the duty of care and of Philip for the injury of the body and the persistence of mental damage.
Trump's spokesman Hope Hicks was unable to reach an opinion.
Attempts to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local news station in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer a member of the campaign.
To call on his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, has not reacted.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has so far led a controversial campaign.
The trial is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
