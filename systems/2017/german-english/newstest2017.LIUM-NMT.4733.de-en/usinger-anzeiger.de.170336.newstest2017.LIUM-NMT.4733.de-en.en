A controversial Baseball Star
The tears ran faster with Alex Rodriguez than the US aseball star in best days from Base to Base.
After his emotional resignation announcement, the 41 year old Profi will wear the jersey of his New York Yankees on the 12th of August against the Tampa Bay Rays.
"I love this game and this team."
"I say 'Goodbye' to join," said the 14-time All-Star Game participant of the Major League Baseball (MLB).
Three times, Rodriguez was elected the most valuable player in the league, in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees.
His signature under a ten-year contract awarded him 27 million US dollars a year since 2007.
Until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, he will be an advisor and youth coach in the future.
As a player, Rodriguez spent a long time with performance.
With 696 Homeruns, 3114 Hits and 2021 points for his teams ("Runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and since 2005 the Yankees created some milestones.
With Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two other baseball players, Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, have similar values.
However, the 41-year-old should not be included in the rest hall of the baseball.
Because so successful Rodriguez - nickname "A-Rod" - was in the field, so controversial is his appearance outside the place.
As early as 2009, the superstar at "ESPN" admitted that steroids were prohibited between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, by the end of 2014, it was blocked for 211 games due to an involvement in the so-called biogenesis scandal by the end of 2014.
Rodriguez is considered to be the main suspect to have received performance-related funds for years through an anti-aging clinic in South Florida.
After a dispute, the lock was reduced to 162 encounters.
"The league could even have done me a favour for 2014, because I have been playing through 20 years without pause," said Rodriguez at the time.
Even his farewell days are not silent.
While many baseball legends in their last games once again received the big stage, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench.
"My job does not include a farewell tour."
"My job involves trying to win each game," said Yankees-Coach Joe Girardi.
After all, Rodriguez, who was married with the actress Cameron Diaz and followed the conditions with Popstar Madonna and actress Kate Hudson, received sympathy for the fans of the Yankee-Archrival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod," the supporters sang in the 4: 9 defeat against the Rodriguez team.
