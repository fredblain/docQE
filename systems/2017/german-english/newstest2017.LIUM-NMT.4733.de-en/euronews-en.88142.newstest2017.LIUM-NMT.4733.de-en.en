London schoolgirls who joined the ISIS were killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join the ISIS, reportedly died in Syria.
The lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said that their family heard a few weeks ago of their death in Raqqa, Syria.
It was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air raid in Raqqa, the Bollwerk of the group in the country, reported ITV News on Thursday.
He was 17 years old and, according to her family, died shortly after she claimed to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
"One can only hope that the only good will be - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war area - to prevent people from ever taking this decision," said Akunjee.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from East London stepped in a plane in the direction of Turkey, followed by a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became the widow in a few months.
