Britain gets silver in 7 Rugby after Fiji Masterclass Gold
The impressive performance of Great Britain at the 7-year Rugby came to an abrupt halt on Thursday evening in the last hurdle in the form of Fijis, when they were beaten with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave a master-class in handling, Side-Stepping, descendants, regular run and roher power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any colour.
The defeat was lost by the not too bad price of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall back on them in the finals.
However, in this form, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in its best form.
It could be a consolation for GB - but it will probably not happen - that at least one Brite will have a gold medal tomorrow at his neck: Fiji's head trainer Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult way to go.
Eight years ago, they lost under Ryan every game with the Adelaide Sevens.
Here they lost only one.
This cap will hurt, but progress is amazing.
Fiji began miraculously and caused the attacks to take place out of fun.
At the end of the 20th century, Captain Tom Mitchell felt it would be a good idea for the captain, Tom Mitchell, to run on, as if you were going to run in a driving bus, the World Series winners went up 5-0, when osea Kolinisau drove in the corner.
With four minutes of gameplay, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner he converted.
12-0 and GB has hardly heard the ball.
A hedging tack from Mitchell stopped the mount of Man Leone Nakarawa a third gate, but it stopped Fiji only.
In the seventh minute JASA Veremalua lete a touch down in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the re-launch and there were still over one minute of playing time... in the first half.
Vbreatho Ravouvou drove through further weak Tacklings of the UK team and hit the line to make a goal.
The conversion brought a 29-0 until the break.
It is as if Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB is still going to be registered.
That is how it is.
GB carried out fundamental changes at half time and closed the fiji gap... for four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half of the day, until Josua Tuisova went through a brilliant intermediate play by Fiji.
Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game has long gone for the south of the South of the South, whose fans sanged, scrambled and danced in the gallery.
It was not difficult to admire Fiji's playful approach.
Mata Viliame put the i-bag with another attempt in the last few seconds.
The Pfiff, the Fijis embraced himself and GB kicked down in the lawn.
In the early days, Fiji Japan was defeated in the semi-final with 20-5 and Britain pressed South Africa in a narrow semi-finalmatch from the race - Britain's transformation of difference.
Kyle Brown brought the Bok in the first half of the front, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive foot work and scored a goal under the post in the second half.
A brilliant late Tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the profit - and thus the silver medal.
