Local law centres provide 160,000 people per year
More than 160,000 of the country's assistance needs are rejected annually by local authorities, while the industry is looking at the effects of further budget cuts on already congested transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly older people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, and those who do not have funds for unjust delogations and the like - are already dismissed in their search for free legal advice and legal assistance.
Legal services of the municipality, which are already excessive, are prepared for further cuts.
As from June next year, these legal centres will lose another 30% of their federal funds.
The director of the district legal centres of Queesland James Farrell said that the last collection of the National Association of Local Law Centres showed that thousands of people are already dismissed each year.
Farrell said that the situation would only get worse without the decision of the Federal Government.
"Queensland's municipal law centres are chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people are rejected by important services that you need," he said.
People who leave violent relations, people with insurmountable and suffocating debts, families who go through separations, workers who are unfairly laid off - all these people have problems of a legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need.
The Federal Government will cut the funds by 30% from June 2017, which means that thousands of people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the General Public Prosecutor and the Federal Justice Minister, as well as Senators from Queensland George Brandis, to lift these budget cuts without delay, so that people can get the help they need in the case of legal problems.
Last year, the state government met its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of community law centres and their clientele, and that the Palaszczuk government invests in this important work.
