Destination plates: Who actually buys records?
Lonely middle-aged men love plates.
Before you rush to the commentary part, in order to oversee him under the pseudonym non-AlleEinsamenmen's middle age with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed resurrection of records is not a boom in the Millennium, which wants to welcome the novelty of physical objects, but is due to midlife nostalgia.
Those who recently bought a record are, in all likelihood, between 45 and 54 years old.
In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely target group.
It is also no hordes by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: Older record buyers retain their feelings more for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it to spend time alone (69% vs. 66%).
But will the results of YouGov vote?
If this blog would be a news report on television, the camera would follow me while I run in the midst of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit and wild, before I stop, my hands and say something like: "So, let us take a closer look."
So let us look at it.
Even if the heart of Sohos is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings that were once an independent seller - there is still a handful of fantastic record special deals.
I would probably ask the cameraman to eliminate the camera for the next part, in which I am close to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind through observation.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55 to which I am of Sister Ray (data count: Two young women, three men of middle age) in Reckless Records (data count: Eight men middle age, a woman, presumably around the 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
"I appreciate," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.
These records, shown above (he sent me the snapshot by email, I didn't follow him home), dress the walls of his living room.
The reason he holds such a significant number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: He is now able to buy plates that he could not afford to buy and buy items that he sold when he was young and bankrupt.
"Many things I buy are out of the late sixties, early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12, things where I was probably too young to buy them," he says.
He agrees that those who buy plates are rather introverted and happy to spend time alone, and add: "I do not smoke and I don't drink a lot.
That is my disaster.
WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers he meets on the YouGov profile.
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and are forced to buy back their old plates.
From the conversations that I have had, people usually kidnapped their collection in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their disks to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their disks again," he says.
This would explain the boom to supporters of the record revision of a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional meaning of plates?
It takes only a few seconds in a business like Phonica to recognize that record stores offer a reassuring community of like-minded people.
According to the WEZ, some of the older customers took the lead in the contactless payment system.
Some disk fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retire to the stability of trusted records.
"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a emptiness or possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation," says WEZ.
This is the case with me as a collector, and I think it is true for many people.
It is an easy way to deal with mentally.
"We are like their social workers!"
A survey of the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not yet heard them.
The survey also found that 41% have a record player that they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not have a record player.
I would probably be very concerned at this time of the news report while I smoked through a stack of Bossa Nova.
Jonny, 42, who works at sounds of the Universe (data count: Three middle-aged men), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the Revival.
"someone came here very recently and said: "I don't have a record player, but I would like to buy a radiohead record, so that I can put it into the shelf," he says.
This is not a large percentage, but it is definitely going.
More productive, less musical.
We have people who say: "I have no record player."
These are younger people, not older people who are only slowly coming out.
Fopp, which has dedicated the records almost a whole floor, has a blower audience than I meet.
There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above shops - Wild Beasts is the latest synthesizer and sex-packed Pop instead of experimental jazz, it is good to see such a diversity among the customers.
None of them looks particularly lonely, but mental trauma is hard to determine if you are standing for 30 seconds next to someone.
Elanora, 27, has been running in the shop for a few minutes and considers the variety of the plates on sale.
It is more likely to be a shop window than a big bucket.
It does not deserve much, therefore the collection of plates is not a real option, says it.
It costs a lot.
It is easy to listen to music from a computer or in other ways, but the beauty of plates is..." it drives with a loving sigh.
I do not know how to explain it - it really is unique.
My last stop is a business that says that a new generation of record lovers will be inspired: Urban Outfitters.
While I appear to design the Jeans Hotpants, I watch a group of young teenage girls who are working for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter consider buying a Crosley record player.
On the left there is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: A mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are merely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to grasp them.
It is pure "record art."
But in view of the fact that every attraction for these items means more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain.
It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends most on luxury items such as plates.
Even if my enquiries revealed that the results of YouGov vote, they leave, at least in record shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors who exist in reality, record shops and online forums.
These people are likely to work hard at school or in offices.
They are certainly not going to spend their Thursday morning with the slums of the Berwick Street and the leaves of plates, while they avoid the inflexible gaze of an unsecret, 30-year-old false moderator, who rises above the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
