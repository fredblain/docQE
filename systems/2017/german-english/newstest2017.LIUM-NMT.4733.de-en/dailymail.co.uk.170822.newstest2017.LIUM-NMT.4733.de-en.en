Asocial family destroys social housing in Saltash, Cornwall
An asocial family left their social housing after a delogation of £50,000, because they terrorized their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her property in Saltash, Cornwall.
After they were forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the Housing Cooperatives found property in an irreparable state of affairs.
The walls had clad holes, wooden panels were thrown up, rubbish was dispersed on the floor and graffiti was reduced to the walls.
The family has been relocated and it is assumed that it now lives in a private housing
Donna McEvoy, who works for the house administration at Cornwall Housing, said she feared that the apartment was no longer to be repaired.
She said: "It was an absolute nightmare for people here, and I believe that people do not have to live in this way.
There are many things to take into account, as this property will probably be regarded as not so beautiful part of Cornwall.
The family is notorious and its reputation is also known.
The couple had three sons, who lived in the apartment in the meantime, and the police said that the terror inflicted on the family, street battles with baseball clubs, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive cries, disputes and flights.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the rental contract, received an order for antisocial behavior in June.

Neighbors said that they had to fight them on the street and called on the police to be called on a regular basis.
Cornwall Housing delogated her and her partner this week forcibly from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to leave voluntarily.
The delogation has been applauded by facilitated neighbors who said that their lives were made to hell.
One said: "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived for 20 years besides them and it was always bad.
The countless times we are saying to the police are incredible.
"We could not sleep this morning."
We stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not accustomed!
Now that they are at last, it will be nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that the family had failed to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house at which the police were called at regular intervals, for 20 years
Rubbish and old toys were thrown down on the overgrown side of the municipal house.
He added: "It is a disgrace that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and that of their family, since a delogation is always the last step that Cornwall Housing takes into account.
This was a very difficult case, because the behaviour had been extreme and that their actions had to be terrible for their neighbours.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the community who have been courageous and have provided us with the information.
I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and will send the message that anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they are all over 20.

In 2014 the police carried out a Razzia in the house and found over 70g cannabis as well as scales, parapaphernals and cash amounting to £1,700.
Skeldon received a fine after she found himself guilty of the possession of a class B drug.
She claimed that the money was a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After they were absent, Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many of the room's walls were painted with graffiti.
The police says that it will delogate tenants that do not comply with the domestic order
Angela Crow of the Devon and Cornwall police said that the delogation was a clear warning to the other tenants who do not keep to the house code.
"This goes to those who think that they can behave without self-charge and those who have been harmed by such behavior," she said.
The Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
