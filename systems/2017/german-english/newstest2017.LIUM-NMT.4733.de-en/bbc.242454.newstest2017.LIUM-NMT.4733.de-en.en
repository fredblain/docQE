Riddles around fish in the garden in Banff
A inhabitant of Banff called for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that the 75 fish around Sandaale could be used by a fountain.
Mr Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, published a video of the spectacle in Periscope in the hope that someone could shed light on the appearance of the two customs long fish.
