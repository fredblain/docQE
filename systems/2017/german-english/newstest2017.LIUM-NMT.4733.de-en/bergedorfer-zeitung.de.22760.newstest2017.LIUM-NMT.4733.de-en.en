Seriously injured - husband on his ex-girlfriend
A man has attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and seriously injured.
As the police told yesterday, the 50 year old had the key to the apartment to get his personal things.
Instead, the alcoholic perpetrator crushed the clothes of his ex-girlfriend.
When she came into the apartment, he stopped twice on her.
The 44-year-old was injured on the hand and on the body.
The police could arrest the perpetrator.
While the 50 year old destroyed his ex-girlfriend's clothes, he called on his mother.
As a result, he alerted his sister.
Together with her companion, the 45-year-old wanted to reassure her brother.
However, she could not persuade him to leave the apartment.
That's why she went out of the house with her companion.
On the road, they met the woman's ex-Lebrist.
When the two women reprayed the apartment once again, the 50 year old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
