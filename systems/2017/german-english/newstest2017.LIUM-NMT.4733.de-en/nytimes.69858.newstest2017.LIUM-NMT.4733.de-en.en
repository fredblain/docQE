Donald Trump declared Obama's assertion that ISIS was "sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump, on Friday, tried to dispel the last controversy that surrounds his campaign by claiming that his repeated claim that President Obama and Hillary Clinton was the "founder" of the Islamic State's terrorist group was not serious.
This clarification raised new questions about the communication capabilities of the Republican presidential candidate, whether it was clear and comprehensible to communicate with the American public.
It also brings his colleagues, who are trying to protect him during an eventful period, in the peculiar position of having to explain statements that he could not have meant at all.
Having made the suggestion at a campaign event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump resisted the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that the President and Mrs. Clinton would have created ISIS.
But, in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said that he was simply sarcastic.
The Tweet was the opposite of the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews that he was very serious about the accusation.
When the conservative radio station, Hugh Heaten, wanted to help Trump to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know anything about it.
The last storm of criticism crashed on Mr. Trump, while trying to direct the focus of his campaign to the economic situation due to falling surveys.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches on the state of the state in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this issue.
On Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already put sarcasm at his defense.
At the end of July, he received strong criticism when he said that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he said "Of course, I thought the sarcastic."
This method allows Mr. Trump to defer the linguistic limits in politics and then go back to need.
"I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans, how they arrive, and then, if necessary, "to make clear, depending on what the response is," said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observed the language of both candidates.
But I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Rather than defying the tone for the presidential election, Trump has adopted an even more negative tone, as its survey values have continued to decline.
A new survey by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed a leading lead in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump is generally trying not to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics of distorting what he says or misunderstand his humor.
But, while he has stepped up the focus of attention in the last few months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's Scherze has brought his loyal colleagues into the uncompromisable situation of having to face him, no matter how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent princes, took great trouble to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview of Thursday.
"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," Mr. Giuliani said about the accuracy of Mr. Trump's statements, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had established the Islamic State.
It is true, in this sense, that before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called it back brokers, completely wrong, and so it happened because it withdrew the troops from Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the Obama administration, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread out by failing to control the situation in the Middle East aggressively.
Prior to the election campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of being slandered and biased on each of his words.
He mocked the "poor, pitiful" television experts who try to understand it and said 'You cannot do it!'.
Some of the Democrats mocked about Mr. Trump's excuse as yet another proof that he was unsuitable for the presidency.
