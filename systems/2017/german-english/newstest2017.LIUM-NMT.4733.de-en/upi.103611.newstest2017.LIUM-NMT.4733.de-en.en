Northern oil workers meet again, strike strike
The wage war on pay for North Sea oil workers is being suspended, while all the parties to the dispute stand for a new round of talks, said negotiators.
Strikes against the oil field provider Wood Group were carried out sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and the Unite and RMT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the settlement process of the current dispute," says a joint statement.
We will hold some all-day meetings in the next few weeks, which will start at the beginning of next year to address the problems.
The unions said that their last strike, the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30%.
This year, Wood Group has reduced the rates of its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure.
The company's group reduction follows a 10-percent decline for on-shore contractors in 2014.
The company said that additional cuts would give the company the necessary space to cope with the market downturn.
Shell has laid off for its part thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas activities in up to 10 countries, since it rationalises its business activities as a result of its mega-merger with the UK energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure as a result of lower crude oil prices, an economic situation that has been reinforced by the decision of the British in June to leave the European Union.
The Scottish MEP, Dave Anderson, met with workers at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest disputes that have taken place in the North Sea for a generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for many, not just for a few," he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion of spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected to be around $7 billion over the past five years.
