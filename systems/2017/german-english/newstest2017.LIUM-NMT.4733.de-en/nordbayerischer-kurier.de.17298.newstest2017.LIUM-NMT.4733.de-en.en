The fee per cubic metre of wastewater is from 1 October 2016 for the area of the new village of Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl 3.44 instead of up to now 2.10 euros; for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp 3.36 euros (currently 2.26 euros) and for Azendorf 3.64 euros (up to 2.18 euros so far).
At the plant in Azendorf, the wastewater fee will be increased again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are needed.
After an excessive calculation, the wastewater price in Azendorf will be 4.37 euros per cubic metre.
As Mayor Bernd Steinhaus (CSU) reported, in the approval of the budget by the Landrat Kulmbach, it was found that there were undercuts for these wastewater plants.
Due to legal bases, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the facilities on a cost basis.
As of 1 October 2016, the citizens, as well as the industrial and industrial companies from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to get deeper into the purse.
Charges are between 48 and 67%.
As executive director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the body, a recalculation of the fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary.
Over the period from October 2016 to September 2020, it is also necessary to compensate for excess or undercover from the previous calendar period.
The serious charges raised by charges were justified by the fact that all three sewerage plants are relatively small, with a very low sewerage case, between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.
For example, the small distribution base would have a serious impact on expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros.
Furthermore, the volume of wastewater in all three installations is slightly diminishing.
Furthermore, in the past calculation period, all three installations, not least because of their age of rehabilitation and repair, have been affected to a significant extent.
The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the plants for Welzschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years.
Schmidt pointed out that in the Azendorf wastewater plant the mechanical ventilation system had to be exchanged for damage.
At the Pumpwerk Welschenkahl, the nearly 20 years old conveyor equipment had to be overtaken from the ground, and in the pond Lopp, after nearly 20 years of operation, the first sewage sludge had to be washed out, the sewage sludge was disposed of and an additional ventilation facility had to be installed in order to be able to comply with the water requirements.
Schmidt: "For these extraordinary expenses, the advanced care and maintenance costs that must be taken into account in the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs, which were still significantly below current levels in the previous calculation of 2011/2012.
Stone houses made it clear that at the low level of wastewater in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance are "fully through."
The market community has been spared large entertainment costs for wastewater plants over the past 20 years.
The situation for these facilities will continue to remain precarious, in the view of stone houses, especially since the supply area of the Friesenbachtal basin is not possible to extend these facilities because they are deficient.
