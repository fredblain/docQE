England must steer the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and across London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was the biggest attraction on the right side, just as in London in 2012, when we did a great deal of effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympics brought great benefits for Stratford and the East End.
And this will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies close to Heathrow.
For our local communities, we will already create 10 000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.
Just as they were ahead of us in London in 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of enlargement is too big.
I have been told that England will never be ready for the Games and that we will be blaming ourselves on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcoming, but Heathrow answers every question he raises.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many, and not for individual, an infrastructure project.
Enlargement is one way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion of growth and a legacy of skills and employment, both at the airport and in the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from the T5 - five years as a result of the world's best airport terminal, up to T2, built in the middle of the world's two most frequented runways.
Now they are ready to deliver a third run, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment.
The 2012 London Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.
It is time for us to steer this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, thereby safeguarding our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.
