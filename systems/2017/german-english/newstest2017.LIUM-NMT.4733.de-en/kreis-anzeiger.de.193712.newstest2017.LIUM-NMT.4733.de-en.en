Community, spirit, health: Sing seniors good
The Singen has already accompanied Ursel Kipp for her whole life: As a young girl she was in the school choir, in the school of teaching she was the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old is singing in a senior choir.
"sing me - emotional and physical," she describes.
After a sample she feels balanced, cheerful and, in general, living, she says.
By the way, she does something good for her health and her spirit.
Because Singen is a great hobby for the elderly from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the German Senior League.
Most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describes Hackler.
Through regular interaction, senior citizens can establish and maintain social contacts.
There are often social and family structures in old age, a chorus is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "To speak out and organize, to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of cohabitation."
Sing can be exhausting in the positive sense, says Hackler.
After all, seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.
Even in everyday life, those who regularly demand their lungs do not get so quickly out of the puste.
Even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice in old age, Singen is an optimal hobby.
For older people, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz of the German Association of Senior Citizens' Organisations.
In the older generations, the common singing had a much higher role, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure, it explains.
Lenz frequently observes that the singing or listening of songs to elderly people awakens many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.
By means of lyrics and in particular melodies, even dementia sufferers, people who suffer from a long period of time lag behind.
When singing is also demanding a special performance for the head, Lenz explains.
At the same time focusing on their own voice and on a given rhythm, adapting themselves to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.
Even older people living on their own practice not only to focus on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition given by the singing in the choir, says Hackler.
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.
The feeling of self-esteem is also growing through singing in the choir.
To show himself: If I long for something, I'll be better and alert beyond me - this experience strengthens.
There are good reasons to start with the singing, so there is enough.
Anyone who wants to try out a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent, Lenz advises.
You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who already hears when a sound goes next?
In search of a suitable offer, seniors have various possibilities, says Hackler.
If someone is in a seniors chorus, you can easily join.
Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the surrounding area.
If you want to sing in a church choir, you can go directly to the town or the church.
Many elderly choirs can also be found via the internet.
If you do not have access to the Internet, you can ask the family, friends or neighbours for help in Internet search.
If you want to sing, you should definitely join a chorus, do Hackler.
Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that is true for any old age.
