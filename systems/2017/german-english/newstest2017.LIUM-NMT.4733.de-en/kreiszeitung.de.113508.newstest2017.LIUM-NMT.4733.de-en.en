Cats respond more sensibly to the cries of young animals
Biologists have studied in Hanover the effect of the use of cat babys on adult animals.
For her surprise, the manches didn't make cold - but they were always the same in contrast to the females.
Female cats can recognize the degree of irritation of cat babys on the small ones.
They react by ten per cent faster on the lute of kitchens, which are in great distress, as scientists have discovered from the Veterinary Office of Applied Sciences and the Medical University of Hanover (MHH).
Kater is also responding to the demands of kitchens - but always the same.
The biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH, said the biologist Wiebke Konerding said.
She is the author of the study published on this Friday in the magazine "BMC evoluutionary Biology."
In a previous investigation, the research team had already discovered that the length and pitch of the kittens cries is different with the urgency of their need for assistance.
A total of nine adult katers and eight female animal husbands have been observed.
They were played by small ones who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated from their mother and siblings.
On the other hand, they were confronted with cries of more erred kitchens, which were raised in addition.
Researchers consider their results to be significant despite the low sample.
"All females, even those who have not yet had their own children, reacted differently to the cries," said Konerding.
They turned faster to the loudspeaker, when the cry of the more mature kittens played out.
This ability may be innate or develop with sexual maturity.
"One surprise was that the males have reacted at all," said the biologist.
In the past, scientists have repeatedly examined the reactions of women and men to baby noises.
Some studies showed that women reacted more sensitively to babies, whether they were already mothers or not, the biologist Marina Scheumann reported.
