Kepler attaches the rotation rate of stars to the star clusters of the plejades.
The latest mission with the Kepler Space telescope helped astronomers collect the most complete catalogue of rotational rates under the stars of the plejades.
The new data will help astronomers understand why stars in the star clusters rotate to different levels, and in what context the rotation periods are associated with the planetary development.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The star cluster of the plejades is 445 light years away from Earth.
Many stars in this star cluster, created around 125 million years ago, are now reaching adulthood.
They are now the fastest.
At peak rotational rates, these ripening stars attract large numbers of star winds.
Since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a brake effect on the stars.
When a star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by detecting the time between the appearance of a visible star spot -- like sunspots --.
The latest catalogue of rotational rates points out that more solid stars turn more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars with dancers, while larger stars turn slower pirouettes than smaller ones.
"In the "Ballet" of the plejades, we see that slow rotors tend to be massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," said Rebull.
Since the star cluster of the plejades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates.
"The star clusters of the plejades offer an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.
There is still a lot ahead of us to learn about how, how, how, when and why stars slow down their rates of rotation and, so to speak, hang their "dance shoes."
Rebull and her colleagues have reported in detail in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the rotational rates of the plejades, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
