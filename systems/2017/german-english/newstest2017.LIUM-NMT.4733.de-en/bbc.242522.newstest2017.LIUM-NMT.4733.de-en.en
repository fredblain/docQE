Salvation at Moelfre Bay: Three men have "happiness to be alive"
Three men have "happiness to be alive" after they were thrown off by their fishing boat before Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station beat on Friday at 13: 20 BST alarm, after a crew watched the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulty swimming in safety while their boat moved on from their own strength.
"We saw the boat in its vicinity revolted and presented us the worst," said the head of the rescue station of Moelfre Vince Jones.
"Unfortunately, the strong winds have already widened the boat beyond their reach until we left the water," he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fisherman, while the third man at the age of 60 was exhausted and found on a Boje with no bailout.
They were all on board the coast rescue boat and were taken back to the rescue station
Mr Jones said: "The three men thrown into the water are lucky and still alive.
The boot engine had an emergency stop, but it caused the boot of the boat from the person who fired the boat.
Someone has woken up today about these men.
