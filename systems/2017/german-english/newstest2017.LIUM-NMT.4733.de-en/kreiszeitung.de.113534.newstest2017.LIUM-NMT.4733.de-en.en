Podolski goes to Supercup with "Gala"
Hakan Sükesr is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hakan SüKür.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time after the coup attempt, an important football match is taking place in Turkey.
Before the duel of the arch-rival between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolski's Galatasaray Istanbul to the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: "Business as usual" is scheduled.
Even when the state of emergency was imposed after the coup attempt in July, the government said that the everyday life of ordinary citizens should not be impaired.
But this does not apply to those who are suspected to belong to the movement of the preacher Fethald Gülen, who is responsible for the coup attempt.
This will not stop football.
An arrest warrant was issued by the Public Prosecutor's Office against the former Starker Hakan Sükesr.
As a result, South Africa, now living in America, is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
It is intended to be a supporter of the preacher Fethald Gülen, who is responsible for the coup attempt by the President of the Republic, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
It is true that the state of emergency initially imposed for 90 days is valid until October, but in fact, it does not have any impact on the life of most Turks.
The night "democracy guards" in public places across the country has declared Erdogan to be closed on Wednesday.
Sport - like the whole country - is divided into supporters and opponents of Erdogan.
Especially fans of the Besiktas Labor Club are traditionally not among the president's friends.
What unites the Turks, however, in the face of dramatic experiences in history, is the strict rejection of military coups.
Even the fans agree, regardless of whether their heart beats Galatasaray or Besiktas.
In the event "Gala" it will be particularly important to arrive again at Lukas Podolski.
In the past season, the Kölner showed its sporting value: With 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions, the 31-year-old ended his first season as the top scorer of his club.
In the final game against Fenerbahce, he scored the 1: 0 victory.
The newspaper "Fanatics" cheered him: "He was the best in the place."
He completed the season in an excellent way and secured his team the cup.
Thanks to "Poldi," the disappointing season for the record master found a conciliatory conclusion.
After the Vorrunden-K.o in the Champions League, the "lions" came out in the Europa League early.
In the south of Lig, it only reached rank six.
The season was not good.
The cup was the only way to win something.
"We managed to do this, and this is the most important thing," said Podolski.
For Master Besiktas the game year ran better.
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who, with 26 seasons of the season, presented the basis for the 14th title.
This is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31-year-old.
In this case, the Gomez, under the contract of the AC Florence and the Besiktas, had only announced, after the coup attempt, that Gomez did not return because of the political situation in the country after his/her holidays.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say," quoted the magazine "Kicker" Clubchef Fikret Orman.
To do so, however, the storm would have to be prepared to dispense with around one third of its $7.5 million year, said Orman: "We cannot pay his salary in Florence."
