The soprano Anna Netrebko openly deals with the autism of her son Tiago - and turns to other affected parents: "They must have the courage to talk about it."
"medicine has made great progress," said the 44-year-old of the Italian newspaper "Corriere della Sera."
When the disease was detected by her son, she believed she had to die.
However, the eight year old Tiago was well ahead and now learned privately in New York, where there are the best therapists.
"To give an example: If I ask him something about two years when I sang at the Milan Scala, he doesn't remember anything," said Netrebko.
But he is the happiest person on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebkos's connection with the Bassbariton Erwin scrap.
She is now married to Tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
