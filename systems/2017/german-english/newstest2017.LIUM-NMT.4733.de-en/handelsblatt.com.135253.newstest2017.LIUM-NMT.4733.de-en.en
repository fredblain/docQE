Despite Olympic disappointment: Martin remains fierce
In spite of his disappointing appearance in the Olympic timescale, he does not want to allow himself to be undermined.
"I continue to keep the World Championships in view, remain confident and continue to fight," wrote the 31-year-old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook.
He does not have an explanation for his miserable twelfth place in the sugar hat.
"I really find it hard to comment on the timing of yesterday," Martin said.
He must analyse in calmness the reasons for the debacle.
At the time of the 2010 World Cup in Qatar, Martin wanted to fight for the title.
"I will look carefully at what we have changed in recent times."
"This includes my position," wrote the three-time world champion, who had lost on Wednesday to the 54.5 km more than three minutes on Olympic winner Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland).
