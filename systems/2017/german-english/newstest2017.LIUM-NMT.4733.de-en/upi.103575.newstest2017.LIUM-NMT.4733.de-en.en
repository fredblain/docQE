Patrick Ferrero-Waldner resigns as trainer of Avalanche
On Thursday, Patrick began resigned as coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations of the Colorado Avalanche and led a too low right of co-determination in the team's decision-making process.
Alternative President/General Manager of the Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the club will search for a new coach without delay.
"In the last three years I have fulfilled my duties as Chief trainer and Vice President of Hockey Operations of the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," said the 50-year olds in an opinion.
In the course of the summer I have thought a lot about how I could improve this team to give it more depth, it needs it and to bring it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the vision of the trainer and Vice President of Hockey Operations must be perfectly aligned with that of the organisation.
It must also have a right of co-determination in decisions that affect the team's performance.
These conditions are not being met at the moment.
Sakic, who had been recruited on 23 May 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick has informed me today about this decision," said Sakic.
We appreciate all what he has done for our organization and wish him the best for the future.
