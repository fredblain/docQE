Troops supported by the US say that they have reconquered full control of the Islamic State's manpower.
Troops supported by the United States have reconquered full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border, after the last ISM fighters in the city have left them, said a spokesman for the group on Friday.
The Democratic Forces of Syria (DKS) run through the city after the withdrawal of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city.
They have released more than 2,000 civilians who were held hostage by the fighters, shared Sharfan Darwish of the Manu military council of Reuters allied with the DKS.
"The city is now under perfect control, but we are carrying out clean-up work," he told Reuters.
