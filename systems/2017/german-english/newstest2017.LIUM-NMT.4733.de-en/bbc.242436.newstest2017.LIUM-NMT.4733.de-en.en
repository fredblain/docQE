Russia's Putin boosts Stodief Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly sacked his chief chief Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of Putin for many years.
The 63-year-old was appointed Special Envoy for Environment and Transportation.
In an opinion from the Kremlin, it is that Putin has "ordered the dismissal of Ivanovs from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration."
Anton Vaino, who was Ivanov's deputy since 2012, was appointed to his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious State of Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo.
On the Kremlin's website, it says (in Russian) that he was later the head of the head of the head of the government.
He said about his appointment to Putin: "Thank you for your trust."
I think that it is the government's most important task to support your work as head of state regarding draft laws and controls to implement your instructions.
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Are the smiling faces convincing?
This step has made Moscow mysterious.
Sergei Ivanov was, for a long time, one of the closest trusted Vladimir Putin and worked as he did for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.
He was one of the most powerful men in the country.
In a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the chief chief resigned on his own wish.
But, despite the smile for the cameras, few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So, is this the result of a sort of power struggle?
Nobody knows that at the moment.
But the official claim - that a man who was once prized as a potential president, would like to direct Russian environmental policy - was skeptical.
In his remarks to Putin quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said "it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 to entrust me with this very complicated post - one could almost say - for four years.
As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov adopted the post in December 2011.
Previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB State Security Service.
In the late 1990" s, when Putin was president of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people he trusted most.
It was once assumed that, after Putin's second term of office, Ivanov could become President of Russia, as a third term of office would have violated Putin's constitution.
But this post was taken by another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later.
