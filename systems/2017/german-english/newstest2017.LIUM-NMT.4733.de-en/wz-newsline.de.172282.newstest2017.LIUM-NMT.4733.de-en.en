Rainfall rather than star rates: Hope for weather improvement
The weather has made the star schnuppen-Guckern in the south-west of Germany in the night on Friday one of the lines of the bill - but there is still hope.
The night, due to clouds and rain, was bad enough to observe the heavenly spectacle, said the chairman of the observatory Welzheim, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.
Our hope lies on the night of Saturday.
The weather is supposed to be good, then we certainly see many starches in the sky.
The startups are Perseiden, which, with 216000 kilometres per hour, are among the fastest startups.
They have their name, because they seem to come from the star image of Perseus, which goes to the northeast.
