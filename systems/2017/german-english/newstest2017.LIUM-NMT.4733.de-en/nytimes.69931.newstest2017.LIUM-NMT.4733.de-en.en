The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a rich meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his rise to the president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch in the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt had a Faible for refined delicatessen from Fifth Avenue, such as PÃ¢te de foie gras and Maryland waterturtle soup.
Its menu on this day was slightly more modest: Filled eggs in tomato sauce, potato puree and as desserts a plum pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with people suffering," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to Americans how they should eat."
The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coes last book "Chop Suey" was about Chinese cuisine in the US, while Ziegelman told her book "97 Orchard" about life in a home on the lower East Side from the food perspective.
Her latest collaboration, "A decent meal," which will be released on Tuesday in Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small snake snack in the Flatiron District, which has been in the business since the 1929 stock market crash.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olives, while Coe, 57, Truthahn had a potato purple and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered Hackbraten, this was the couple for a discussion about food in the Great Depression era.
"Great food was very popular," said Ziegelman.
There was ground bread, liver cheese and bean bread.
They were made from an ingredient and something cheap, which is the ingredient of the ingredient.
Imagine to eat so many nuts that they serve them as dinner.
CoE grinded.
"It must be in the stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American budget, especially in rural areas, an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Teams of women coined for male Feldarmen and it was served with freshly baked pastes for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the first World War, and "a Square Meal" sets out the ways in which the country could no longer be the shlaring country.
"It was a time when food was a central, tense topic for Americans," Coe said, why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The new budget disobedience was just as tense: Mysterious foods such as bread and casserole have become staple foods, the casserole as a "wonderful way of revaluing the remains of food," noted the gods, as cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry fruit.
Meat, which was the focus of American cuisine for years, became a seldom served luxury.
Unique mixtures have been tried out, since a calorious and nourishing satisfaction took precedence over taste or even healthy cooking.
During her search for the book, which includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a court of this period, baked onions with peanut butter.
"It was not a popular addition to lunch," says Coe.
Ziegelmann continues: "It was surreal."
Peel butter and baked onions do not match each other.
It was typical for many of the homebusiness receptions.
As never before, or since then, household economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - have been doing so in such a way.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "household politicians" and to meet the challenge of turning pampe like creamy spaghetti with carnival into delicious meals.
"A Square Meal" is a feast of the historical Leckerbissen.
In particular, the reports of the government's response to the starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoovers Lass-mich-Kuchen-Essen, are particularly tasty.
While he publicly praised the simple Iowa Farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen, he starred like the millionaire man from the world to which he has become.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with Gurkensauce," Coe said.
He ate in an almost gilded dining room and wore a smoking.
He was truly alien to reality.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not asked him to set an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, the Anheuern of a housekeeper, with no interest in flavors by Mrs Roosevelt, said that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington, but also prepared one of the most troublesome."
Many of the species from the Great Depression era to deal with food were discarded as soon as the country came back on its feet.
The legacy is based on our continued focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, and how science was applied to food.
When writing the book, the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother-in-law - for example, how it could not throw away food.
"It had a real fear of food waste," Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled: "They made people ill."
There was a windfall incident.
After leaving the Teller at Eisenberg's, they and Coe created a dessert that they had prepared at home: The plum dessert that President Roosevelt had at lunch.
"It is called Prune Whip," said Ziegelman, adding that it was a normal trick to miss modest recipes.
There was no scared cream, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone appeared somewhat grudgingly a spoon in the tame, brown glibber.
Amazingly, it was not bad.
CoE took up three times a night.
As a Can-Do-budgetierer he said to his wife, "A few hacked walnuts would help."
