Police: 3 victims in serial murderment when listening to music in the car
According to the police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot dead in one of the most deadly attacks for a decade in the first series murder case of Phoenix, while they were in the car and listened to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis's daughter Maleah were shot on 12 June, while the car was parked in a trip, the authorities said.
The perpetrator fired eight shots from a handgun gun, while he was on the front-passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, read in the report.
The police said that the triple murder did not appear to be the result of a robbery, because the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 that were in possession of one of the adult victims.
The police spokesman of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting team led the investigators to take a closer look at whether they are linked to four previous attacks.
In a total of four months, seven people were killed and two more injured in a total of four months in nine attacks.
"It happens in a residential area in front of a house," said Howard of the KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, at the beginning of the month.
It is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990" s, a black BMW from the late 1990" s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same murderer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to her injuries and died later.
Liner, 31, and Ellis daughter Maleah died on site.
A witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which was aimed at an empty pickup push half an hour before the triple murder, and it was assumed that it was the work of the serial killer.
Investigators found cartridges and secured a domicile and spherical fragments from the motor room.
