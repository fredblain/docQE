Clinton and Trump's Economic Policy: It's all about the money
Investing in infrastructure and avoiding the TTP trade agreement - that is what both Clinton and Trump want.
However, the two US presidential applicants are in charge of taxation and energy policy and a fundamental issue.
The difference in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is based on a fundamental, rather philosophical, difference.
That, about the role of the state.
Trump is in doubt rather small and warns about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax and regulate the economy to death, he says.
He himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, claiming Trump.
He will massively reduce regulations, and he is strong in favour of a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for businesses.
Clinton, on the other hand, says: The state has certain tasks to perform, it has the opportunity to open up, and needs money for it.
That is why taxes on the rich would be increased, says it.
Interestingly, both are very close to the subject of infrastructure.
We need to invest in this, say Trump and Clinton.
The democratic candidate has even announced the biggest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.
Government investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic politics, and are strongly rejected by Republicans" state critical teaky wing.
So, for Trump, party-internal discussions could come.
The differences in energy and climate policy are clearer.
Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and re-launch coal mining in the US.
Oil extraction is also expected to be possible in protected areas as well.
By contrast, Clinton wants to explicitly expand renewable energy with its investment program: "A country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs."
"It will be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be."
But, not only in terms of infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not far from each other.
TPP, the Trans-Pacific Trade Agreement, do not want to sign both.
But, at the same time, both do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply to protect American jobs better.
They should then be better paid for, for example, for Clinton.
The current minimum wage of USD 7.25 is a hunger wage.
It wants to increase it to $15 per hour.
What Trump wants to do on this issue is not very clear: Once he says that the minimum wage must be rushed, then he says that he must not be changed.
But the big discussion in the coming months is likely to be more about the fiscal policy of the two camps.
On the one hand, Trump is standing to ease the economy and citizens to boost growth.
His critics suggest that the budget deficit would be even bigger.
On the other hand, Clinton, who, at least, wants to demand from the rich that they pay more taxes, and their critics say: More taxes are not the solution.
