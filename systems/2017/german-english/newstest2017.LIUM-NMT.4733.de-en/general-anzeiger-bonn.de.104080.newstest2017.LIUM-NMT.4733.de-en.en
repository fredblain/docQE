Laws are constantly being screened in the name of the fight against terrorism.
Following the recent attacks, Minister of the Interior de Maizière is now presenting a thick safety package.
But what has a debt status to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say about all this?
Thomas de Maizière gives the reconciliation.
All his proposals are "politically reasonable" to the coalition partner, says the Federal Minister of the Interior in presenting his new security package.
They are not asking anyone.
Other, more advanced points would first be discussed within the parties.
I am also involved in this.
As Minister for the Interior, however, he had achieved results and an "achievable consensus" within the coalition.
After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, de Maizière, a little time has passed before it presents its conclusions on security in the Republic.
However, these are all the more important.
Something is already known, announced, announced: That a new security authority to deal with encrypted communications is not new.
Nor is the fact that Germany has to implement several EU rules on passenger data and arms law.
The call for more video surveillance and staff for the security authorities is not surprising.
In some cases, de Maizière launches a second attempt to make proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD: He wants to criminalise the promotion of sympathy for terrorist groups and to turn the German passport into jihadists with double citizenship.
"This will be difficult points for the SPD," says the CDU man.
It nevertheless seems to be reasonable, and it does not demand anything that does not exist in the case of the coalition partner in any case.
A few new ideas also presented de Maizière.
Some of them are in themselves: It plans rapid procedures for deportations and more possibilities for detaining people from deportation.
Refugees who are targeted in the country should first check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a security review.
In the case of excesses for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some worse off than until now - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw out their papers in order to mask their identity.
Some of them are politically and legally sensitive.
Some of them are still inextricable and leave questions open.
And, on a number of points - for example, in the case of unequal treatment - the question arises: What does this really have to do with security and terror?
Yes, says de Maizière that it is important to distinguish between the issues of refugees and terror.
But it cannot be denied that the perpetrators of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
Moreover, many people were concerned about security in the face of high numbers of refugees.
And things that people deeply employed could not be excluded even during the election campaign.
Internal security has become a major focus.
Only the attacks in the neighbourhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
Uncertainty is great.
And yes, there are election campaigns.
The Union and SPD are therefore increasingly in position on the issue of internal security.
Over the past few days, the two parties have had a great deal of attention.
First of all, there is a dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police, then about a security policy collection of some Union interior ministers, in which the portfolios of portfolios also call for a ban on burka and a departure from dual citizenship.
De Maizière is also concerned here with conciliatory sounds.
It does not seem to be moving away from a double pass.
We were happy with the discussion in Germany.
They do not make sense.
And with a ban on Burma, it has constitutional concerns.
Whether its own package is constitutional, and whether it is really "reasonable" for the coalition partner, has yet to show itself.
There are some things that could cause controversy.
But the SPD, too, is trying to benefit from the issue of internal security.
"The SPD is prepared to talk about everything that contributes to further raising security."
