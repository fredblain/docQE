Killed in the bombing: He was the hero of Aleppo.
He put his own life at the game to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar devoted his life to the people of Syria.
He risked everything to save others.
Now, the 30-year old has died even in the Assad regime's bomb attack.
Omar was a member of the "White Helmets," a civil protection group that, according to the Bild-Zeitung, saved nearly 60,000 people so far.
2900 volunteers are risking their own lives in order to pull people out of bombed houses and to provide first aid in the war area.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: A video of the civil guard showing him an 11-hour bailout of a baby from the rubble of a house went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrians a shining symbolic figure in the horrors of the war.
As a hero, he never saw himself, said the picture: "For me, that is the real Jihad."
"If I die of saving life, I think God sees a martyr in me."
Shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack, he spoke in a video about the last bomb attacks in Syria.
The Helikopters fired four bomb bombs over the Alzheimer's district, one was filled with chlorine gas.
A woman and two children died, seven people suffer from breath.
"We now eliminate the toxic remains of the bomb, so that children do not play with it," the image quotes his last words before he died.
The Assad regime's deadly bomb was supposed to hit terrorists.
