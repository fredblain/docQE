Airline is not responsible: Overthrow on Passenger Bridge
An airline is not responsible for the overthrow of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
The Supreme Court of DÃ¼sseldorf (Az.: 18 U 124/14) argued that a liability would only be possible in the case of dangers that are typical of air transport.
The plaintiff had broken a knee in the fall.
However, the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life, the court said.
The airline did not have to pay compensation to the man.
