What the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming
The former German swimmer Markus Deibler has expressed himself on Facebook for the disappointing performance of the DSV team at Olympis.
In December 2014, he first won gold at the World Championships in Doha and, at the same time, presented his first world record.
Now, the former DSV Athlet Markus Deibler, via Facebook, has been protesting against his ex-team colleagues who are in criticism.
"In a country where an Olympic winner receives 20,000 €premium and a jungle king 150,000 €should not be surprised by a lack of medals," said the 26-year-old in the night on Friday on his Facebook page.
The support system for swimming sport is bad, but the control of doping is very good.
In this way, we cannot compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look at it in the same way as we do on the issue of doping.
"I do not say that controls should be stopped here," he added.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler would have to be notified nine months before his first launch of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).
This is how it should be maintained with countries.
"He who cannot be checked for a certain period of time before World Cup/OS by independent inspectors of WADA/FINA cannot participate," says the Election Hamburg, who is now conducting an ice cream.
