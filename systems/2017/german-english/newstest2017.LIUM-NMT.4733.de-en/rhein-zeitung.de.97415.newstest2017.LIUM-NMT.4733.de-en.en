Municipal Council decides unanimously: No Kioskneubau at St. Goarer Rheinufer
Normally, the St. Goarer investments are taken by traders with Kusshand - but the retail trade in the core city is considered to be significant.
However, the city council is now unanimously opposed to the request for the new construction of a sales skiosk on the banks of the Rhine, in the immediate vicinity of the Rheinbalkons under construction.
"In principle we welcome new traders, but at this location in an exposed location on the banks of the Rhine, this kiosk does not fit in," said Michael Hubrath for the CDU group.
