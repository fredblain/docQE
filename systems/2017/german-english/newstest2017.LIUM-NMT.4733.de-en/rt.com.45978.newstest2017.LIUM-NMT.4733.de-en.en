Police forces tears and rubber bullets to protest Brazilian students
Students met with the police in the Brazilian city of São Paulo on Thursday, when they gathered together to demonstrate the government's reform of the public education system.
The police set up tears and rubber bullets against the demonstrators.
The difficulties began when police officers tried to divide the students, leading the police to implement rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their consternation about the plans.
According to the board of governors of the federal state of São Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, a little less than 100 public schools are closed, while 300,000 students are being implemented to save money.
Some of the Protestants saw graffiti against the temporary president, Michel Temer, on walls.
The recent protests occurred several days after demonstrators were on the streets in order to support the suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been removed from office by a vote of the Senate.
