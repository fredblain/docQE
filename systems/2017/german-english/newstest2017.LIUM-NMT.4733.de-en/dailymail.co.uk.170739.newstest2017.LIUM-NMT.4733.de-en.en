Protecting Krav Maga against arms attacks
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make it more secure for you.
We spoke with Rhon Mizrachi, a grandmaster of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance.
Regardless of whether you are approaching you from the front or back, this video will show you how to rotate the spider for your robber.
If you are approaching you from the back, then you should turn around, so that you can see your attacker and "get out of the line," says Mizrachi.
Take the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before turning into the face with your free elbows.
Then beat him down with the knee and turn, while the attacker collapses before pain, the weapon is out of his hands.
For attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the line, take the gun and turn it away, so that the attacker cannot shoot.
At the same time, shift the weight to the weapon and beat the attacker to the chest, then turn the gun out of its grip before moving backwards and put the gun on it.
Is it difficult?
See the video to see exactly how Mizrachi pretends.
But remember that a robbery is the safest to transfer your money - unless you are a Krav Maga Grand Master.
