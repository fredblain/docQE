Steel - lighting for German steel industry
The crisis-battered and energy-intensive German steel industry will be spared additional costs in millions.
The financial burden that the industry has threatened to support from organic production is from the table.
As a result of the exemption from the renewable energy levy on the stock in the German steel industry, the Austrian Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), said the "West German General Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition).
"I am really happy that we have finally been able to achieve this after two years of tough negotiations."
The European Commission, therefore, had initially planned to pay for the steel producers who use the gases from the blast furnace for their own consumption.
According to the German industry, the steel industry has threatened additional costs of EUR 120 to 240 million per year.
Gabriel said the WAZ, there is now a policy agreement with the EU Commission after discussions with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
It is only when the generators are replaced in the steel plants that a 20 per cent levy is applied.
But this is not the case in the steel industry.
The IG Metal welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission on the production of oases.
As a result, the status quo will be largely enshrined in the current regime.
The success of Gabriel for the steel industry is particularly important.
'With regard to our 'steel campaign', the future is 'a first step'.
"More must follow."
"We also need to weigh up climate and employment targets in the reform of emissions trading," said IG Metall-boss JÃ¶rg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
The steel industry in Europe has been suffering from overcapacity and considerable price pressure since the 2008 financial crisis.
Last year, the situation continued to aggravate when the world's largest producer country, China, threw on the world market on a massive scale in the face of weak domestic demand.
European producers are proposing price dumping for Chinese steel companies.
In the course of this spring the situation has been somewhat relaxed.
On the one hand, import duties have been imposed on imports and, on the other hand, the economic outlook in China has surged.
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.
The German industry prime minister of the industry remained cautious on Thursday.
Last but not least, prices would have been more stagnant.
The industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Last but not least, ThyssenKrupp did not want to exclude the closure of individual works.
In the German steel industry, around 86000 people were employed at the end of 2015.
In July, German steel producers will remain wary, despite rising prices and increasing orders.
With 3.4 million tonnes, they produced well six per cent less raw steel than in the same month, as the steel industry announced on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the amount produced went back the second month.
Since the beginning of the year, production has fallen by two percent below the previous year.
In the coming months, the association expects an improved order position with an increase in output.
