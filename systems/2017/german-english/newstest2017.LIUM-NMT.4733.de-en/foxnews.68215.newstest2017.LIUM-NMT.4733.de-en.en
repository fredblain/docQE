She wants Nacktkalendar for "Women and for Men"
The Treats magazine works together with the photographer David Bellemere to release a 70s Pirelli-inspired Calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they would like to find the next generation of top models for their NU muses Kalendar in 2017.
The editor-in-chief of Treats Steve Shaw told us at the beginning of this year that his naked magazine is different from Oldschool-Playboys, as "Playboy is for men."
I do that for women.
It seems to him that it does the Kalendar.
"We must return to the depiction of timeless and classic nakness, in which both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body," Shaw said in a press release to publish the calendar.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a wonderful work of art.
Models can submit their pictures online or personally in the open casting call in Los Angeles and New York.
