Trade between Russia & Iran suddenly rises to 71% - RT business
With the lifting of the sanctions, according to the Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the volume of trade between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 per year.
Since international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, the interest on the part of Russian companies in shops in the country has increased sharply, the ambassador informed.
Russian companies take existing links with Iran, while new firms are prepared to gain access to the market.
Of course, further trade development is one of the biggest priorities for bilateral cooperation with Iran," said Dzhagaryan.
He noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran rose by 70.9% in the first five months of 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, and $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports in Iran increased by 91.5% and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16% to $158 million.
The trade recovery was achieved through deliveries of machines, trucks and weapons," said the ambassador.
This year Dzhagaryan comes from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia.
Last year, Russian foreign representatives issued some 35,000 visas, primarily Reisevisas, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, Iran reached the top 20 of the countries as regards the number of tourists in Russia.
One could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year, are broken, "he said.
At the same time, only relatively few Russians visit Iran, something that the ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, who have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in a good state, "he said.
