CBC commentator for the Olympic Games apologies his statement that Chinese floats "died as a pig"
Byron Macdonald's analysis of the fourth place of the 14-year old Ai Yanhan at dr 4x200m outdoor squadron squandered spectators of the CBC live transfer of the Olmypic Games on Wednesday
The Canadian transmitter CBC had to apologize after one of his commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese float was "like Mief," and during the race as "a pig died."
The commentator Byron MacDonalds thought that his microphone was switched off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m free movement squadron.
Macdonald, who was brought to the commentary team of the CBS on board to give more "color," could be heard: "This small 14-year-old Chinesin has lost the connection, Baby."
Too excited, went as Mief, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
The Chinese float in Ai Yanhan, 14, swept the second stage of the swimming squadron 1: 57.79 - 1.61 seconds more slowly than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to fill the gap with China.
Viewers across Canada quickly reacted online after they were shocked by the tone and language of the language.
Emmett Macfarlane tweete, "Has the CBC commentator just said that the 14-year-old swimmer from China "like a pig died"???
The Idiot did not realize that they were still on show."
Ai Yanhan from China has been described as follows: "This small 14-year-old Chinesin has lost the connection, baby."

Twitter users did not go back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: "WoW, # ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and let us all look like racists.
A short time later, Scott Russel, who moderated the CBC programme, apologized for MacDonald's comment and said: "We apologize that the comment on a swimming power was broadcast."
It was an unfortunate wording, and we are sorry that it has happened."
At the end of the year, CBC apologized to the people who responded to the information on Twitter
Scott Russel's commentator has had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald.
CBC copied and added his apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about MacDonald's comments
The network also apologized quickly and issued a communication.
We sincerely regret that these statements have been made and that it has been possible for them to be broadcast.
Last night we apologized to our spectators on show and our folklore in the social media.
To make one clear, Byron's comments related to the performance of swimmers and not to them as person.
However, they were inappropriate and an unfortunate wording, and Byron is very tired of what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized in the programme and tried to justify his comment by saying that it was not his intention to be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment that I made after the feminine squadron at the CBC Olympic event, he said.
"I have been referring to the performance of the swimmers and not to them as a person."
Of course no contempt was intended and I am very sorry."
