Intercultural journey: Cultural offers for schools
The international class of the Forest School visited the play "The invisible house."
The club NIMA's and the Young Theater are now planning a music project.
The association NIMA's enables young people with migration and refugee backgrounds to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Class International" of the Waldschule Kinderhaus has attended an idea of the award winning piece "Das invisible Haus" of the Young Theater Münster.
In the context of the "Intercultural journey" initiated by the association NIMA's, 19 students visited between eleven and 15 years the staging in the small house.
Since the beginning of the year the association, which aims at the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background, has offered schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project.
Most young people in the class had come to Münster from September 2015 to March 2016, including Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia, and Syria.
Thanks to the choreographies, the scenical images and video animations, it was possible for them to follow the course of action, such as the press release of the boy Theater Münster.
The club NIMA's, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel, and the Young Theater will work in the next season in the context of a music theater-project.
From October to December, young people with and without a flight and migration background should be given the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing, dance, play and music.
Offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theatrical language mediation are in the planning.
The "Intercultural journey" project continues.
In view of the increased numbers of refugees, the club expects many classes that want to participate.
