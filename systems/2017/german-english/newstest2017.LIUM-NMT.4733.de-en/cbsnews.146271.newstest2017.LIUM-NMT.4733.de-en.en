Mother of a 6-year old with microcephalie: "It will be better"
Like most 6-year olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But, like the least of his contemporaries, Edmund's microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder, did not know his mother Elizabeth Picciuto during her pregnancy.
When he came home for the first time, my first thought was that I didn't do it.
I do not.
I did not agree with that.
What is wrong at all --, of course, one has gone into it," she said.
Her husband Vincent and her was told that Edmund would never be able to see her and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institutionalize it.
"My first answer was 'I didn't know that people still do, 'said Picciuto.
Edmund can walk with the help of a walk.
Edmund was unable to sit there until his third year of life and he was still unable to speak.
But it is progressing slowly.
It can run with support and cycling.
He also loves playing and singing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language Edmund for "Please sing me a bit before."
"We bring to him sign language," said Picciuto CBS News.
But it is not a typical sign language -- it says, Edmund has invented some signs on its own.
Microcephaly has a variety of causes: Genetic as in Edmund as well as infections with viruses such as measles or Zikavirus during pregnancy.
The symptoms and predictions can vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it will affect the life of the Zikavirus infected.
Picciuto recalls the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I constantly asked what will happen?
What will happen?
And she still does not really know.
I have not been asking for the forecast for a long time, because I do not expect them to be able to tell me.
But Picciuto has a hopeful tip for mothers of babies with birth damage caused by the Zikavirus.
It will be better.
You know that it will be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
