Adblock Plus, Facebook in the "cat and mouse game"
For companies that earn money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers, attempts to circumvent display blockage, a "cat and mouse game" are the same.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block display loops on its desktop, Adblock Plus published a blogpost that said that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising in the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the encoding in terms of its advertisements, in order to make it more difficult to detect it, the detection of which part of the site is advertising.
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.
In a blogpost, the spokesman of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of Hin--and-Her-struggle between the open-source community and the evasions has been underway since the invention of advertisers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution.
The fact that the world's largest company for social media has entered the fight is a strong indicator of how worrying advertisers for the industry have become.
According to a study carried out by Pagefair and Adobe last year, around 200 million people in the world use display lockers, almost four times more in 2013.
With 1.03 billion active users who access Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84% of the advertising revenues.
The company has it on display blockers on desktop PCs, as mobile ad blockers have no effect on facebooks mobile app for the social network and instagram, a spokesperson informed.
Advertising on desktop PCs makes up a sufficient amount of revenue so that Facebook appears to be worth the investment of such a step.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update its "scoreboard of preferences" to give people more control over advertising targeted at them.
On Thursday, Facebook Facebook that Adblocks would give new filters cause for concern, because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising.
"This is not a positive experience for users, so we plan to raise the problem," said Facebook spokesperson in an email communication.
Ad blockers are a blunt means, which is why we have focused instead on developing tools such as Ad Preferences in order to put more control in the hands of people.
