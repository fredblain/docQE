US-backed troops say they have regained complete control over Manbij from the Islamic state
US-supported troops have regained complete control over the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city have left them, said a group spokesman on Friday.
The Democratic Forces of Syria (DKS) are currently combating the city after extracting the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city.
They freed more than 2,000 civilians who were held hostage by the fighters, Sharfan Darwish told Reuters, the Manbij military council, who had joined the DKS.
"The city is now under perfect control, but we are just performing cleanup," he told Reuters.
