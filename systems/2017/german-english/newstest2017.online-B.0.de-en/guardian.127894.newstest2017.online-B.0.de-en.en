Destination Records: who actually buys records?
Lonely middle-aged men love plates.
Before you rush to the comment section to sneak it out under the pseudonym NotAlleEinsamenMÃ¤nnerMittlerenAlters with harsh insults, this statement is derived from current data.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed re-emergence of records is not due to a boom in millennials that want to welcome the novelty of physical objects, but to mid-life nostalgia.
Those who have recently purchased a plate are most likely to be between the ages of 45 and 54.
In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group.
It is also not a hordes of hobbies - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers keep their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).
But do you agree with the results of YouGov?
If this blog were a news report on TV, I would follow the camera as I walk in the middle of a bustling street in Soho, wear a modest gray suit and stalk wildly before I stand still, hold my hands and say something definite like, "Let's take a closer look."
So, let's take a look at it.
Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where once independent vendors were resident - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specials.
I would probably ask the camera man to turn off the camera for the next part, where I am in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records, is one day long for a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
"I guess," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.
These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), dress the walls of his living room.
The reason he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they appeared and again to buy items that he sold when he was young and broke.
"Many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. Things I was probably a bit too young to buy them to me," he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are more introverted and like to spend their own time, and adds, "I do not smoke and I do not drink very much.
This is my vice.
Wez, 25, who works for Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers he meets apply to the YouGov profile.
He has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media hit, people who have heard about the comeback and are looking to buy their old records again.
From the conversations I have conducted, people have usually departed from their collection in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records, "he says.
This would explain the boom in followers of the plate revival of a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional meaning of records?
It only takes a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers took offense at the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record covers, of objects that evoke happy memories.
"I think sometimes it can be the filling of an emptiness or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," says Wez.
This is so with me as a collector so and I think that it is with many people like that.
It is an easy way to mentally deal.
"We are like their social workers!" A colleague from a plate pile out.
A survey by the ICM in April reveals that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not listened to it yet.
The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record have no record player.
At this time of the news report I would probably look very worried while I leaf through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works for Sounds of the Universe, has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revival.
"Someone just came in here recently and said," I do not have a record player, but I'd like to buy a radiohead record so I can put it on the shelf, "he says.
This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.
More product-compliant, less music-resistant.
We have people who say, "I do not have a record player."
These are younger people, not older ones, who are only slowly coming.
Fopp, who has devoted almost a whole floor to the records, has a colorful audience when I go.
There are couples around the 70, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beast's newest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz booms out of the speakers - it is good to see such a diversity among the customers.
None of them looks very lonely, but gnawing mental trauma is hard to pinpoint when you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been running around the shop for several minutes and is looking at the variety of plates available for sale.
It is more like a window shopping than a big shopping.
It does not earn much, so collecting plates is not a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It's easy to hear music from a computer or some other way, but the beauty of records is ... "she drifts off with a sigh of love.
I do not know how to explain it - it is truly unique.
My last stop is a store that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I seem to be looking at the jeans hotpants, I watch a group of young teenage girls grouping around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter decide to buy a Crosley record player.
To the left is a staircase, a wall full of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far up that it is impossible to touch them.
It is pure "plate art".
But considering that any attraction for these items could make more money for the industry and send some customers to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain about.
It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is the one that spends most on luxury items such as plates.
Even though my research has shown that the results of YouGov are right, at least in record shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors who exist in reality, record stores and online forums are disregarded.
These people probably work hard in school or in offices.
They certainly do not spend their Thursday morning strolling through Berwick Street records and leafing through plates, while avoiding the staring gaze of an eerie, thirty-year-old fake presenter who stands out over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
