"One generation protested" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the US
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia met with violent resistance from the government.
Witnesses say that tens of thousands of protesters were killed during the clashes with the police at gunpoint.
Is Ethiopia just breaking up?
Over the past ten years, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months protests against the government have shaken the country and expanded into more and more areas.
Last week thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.
The government's response, according to human rights organizations, was ruthless.
Witnesses stated that policemen were shooting and killing at tens of unarmed demonstrators.
Videos circulating about the protests, presumably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security guards beat young people with sticks while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall.
The head of the United Nations Human Rights Authority is now asking for an in-depth investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together, and in the future it will be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is, after Nigeria, the most populous country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West.
American military and intelligence services are working closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorism across the region, especially in Somalia. Only a few countries in Africa, if any, receive so much Western aid.
Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.
Its infrastructure has drastically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.
The streets are generally quiet, safe and clean.
Even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy, human rights organizations have consistently repressed the government, the opposition in the country has been restricted, and dissidents have been effectively silenced.
Many were sent to exile or to prison, killed or driven into the vastness of the desert.
But that could change.
"If you oppress people and they have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia.
All the youth protested.
One generation protested.
There are numerous complaints covering everything from land use to strangleholds with regard to the power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament.
At the same time, the tensions along the border with Eritrea are rising, a struggle for this jagged, controversial line required hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which have been more or less conquered in recent years, could exploit the turmoil and arm themselves again.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness are exploding after years of aching below the surface now.
The first seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years have very many Ethiopians been able to communicate through the social media, as cheaper smartphones became more and more frequent and the Internet services improved.
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, which it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate through Internet proxies that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said they gathered in protest.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
For ages, the Amharas, coming from Ethiopia's predominantly Christian highlands, prospered in politics and economics, exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in flatland areas.
But that too is changing.
"We are going to coordinate under one umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The largest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which account for about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, intelligence services, commerce and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr Meles, a former rebel leader, was prime minister until his death in a non-publicized disease in 2012 for 17 years.
He was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think of corners.
Analysts say he was particularly savvy in seeing early signs of dissatisfaction and using special commissioners to deal with opponents and render them harmless.
"The current regime lacks this basic skill," said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected for relatively opaque reasons to take over the position of Mr. Meles.
Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Northern Ethiopia, Mr Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he does not enjoy the trust of the Tigray-controlled security services.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time that Ethiopia experienced such an upheaval was in 2005, when thousands protested against elections that, according to analysts, seemed to be bogged down by the government and subsequently stolen.
During the subsequent raids, many protesters were killed, even though it was less than in recent months and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in the fight against poverty.
But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal dislike of the Ethiopian government.
And it assumes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, an Amharic city, started business from Tigray, and the hatred of the Tigray became more common in the social media.
Analysts say the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.
The US government used Ethiopia as the basis for drones over neighboring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it has closed this base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile area.
"This," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin tightrope walk."
