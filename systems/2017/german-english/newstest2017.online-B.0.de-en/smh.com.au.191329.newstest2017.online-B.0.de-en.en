There are 160,000 people annually
More than 160,000 of the country's most vulnerable are refused annually by the municipalities, while the industry is focusing on the impact of further cuts on already overloaded transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly elderly persons, immigrants, needy workers, victims of violent acts and those who have no means of unfair detention and the like - are rejected in their request for free legal advice and legal aid.
Legal services of the municipality, which are already exhausted, are preparing for further reductions.
As of June next year, these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds.
The director of Queesland's communal center James Farrell said that the latest survey of the National Association of Town Centers showed that thousands of people are already rejected every year.
Farrell said that the situation would only get worse without repealing the decision of the federal government.
"Queensland's community centers are chronically under-funded, which means that thousands of people are being rejected by important services you need," he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with unmanageable and crushing debts, families who go through divisions, workers who have been unjustly dismissed - all these people have problems of a legal nature, and this survey shows that they can not get the help they need.
As of June 2017, the federal government will cut the funds by 30 percent, which means that thousands of more needy Queensland people will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the Federal Prosecutor's Office, the Federal Ministry of Justice, and the Senators of Queensland George Brandis to immediately abolish these cuts so that people can get the help they need in the event of legal problems.
Last year the state government fulfilled its pledge to raise funds for legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of community centers and their customer communities, as well as to invest the Palaszczuk government into this important work.
