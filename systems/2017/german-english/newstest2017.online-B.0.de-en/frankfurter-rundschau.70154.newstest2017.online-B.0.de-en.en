Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Go where it hurts"
Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The locals do not get anything from the summer election campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the state parliament.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they have understood.
In 2021, the Landtag election will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin parliament has already decided earlier this year.
It is not so stupid as before: summer holidays, heat and the election of the provincial elections - that bites.
The locals, who are to be convinced by the election campaigners, are on vacation.
Most of the holidaymakers who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee on the way, are no local people, so they can not choose the state parliament.
There are also practical problems: during the holidays, helpers who hang up posters, blow up balloons, distribute flyers, and finally count votes, can only be troubled.
Until September 4, 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has yet to pass the election campaign just past the people.
The hot phase, if one can say at all, has just begun.
And it is also about something: Minister President Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must be afraid of his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls.
What is exciting is how much newcomer AfD cuts off and what remains in the end coalition suits.
Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 government minister, makes an almost inconspicuous acting election campaign, one from his large poster.
He travels around the country, spreads roses and talks a bit with the people, just as his legendary worthless predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.
Otherwise Seelering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame for the AfD.
Their refugee policy, their "We create that" has accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists, which is probably going to cost him the nice office.
The CDU, with its top candidate, the Minister of the Interior, Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it is like to be at the wrong time in the right place.
Chancellor Angela Merkel has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale surveys, Merkel Bundestagswahlkreis is located in the north-east.
But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony than Mecklenburger and Vorpommern.
"There was probably the majority of other states," complained Vincent Kokert, secretary general of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR.
But it does not pity anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once.
Otherwise, the Northeast CDU largely renounces the usual election booths at marketplaces and in front of shopping centers with umbrellas and balloons.
This, according to Kokert, plays only a "subordinate role".
The Union has also noticed that you are breaking the ground in the country, that it has to be very hard to find a wire to the people again.
It is like the left, the SPD, the Greens: scarcely available in the vastness of the country.
The advice of the CDU candidate Kokert to his colleagues is, however, also self-explanatory: "They must go where it hurts, where the people are: Dorffeste, Golden Weddings, every birthday celebration must be used".
Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called his SPD to a particularly dedicated campaign.
In surveys the Social Democrats were last with 22 per cent behind partner CDU (25) and only just before the AfD (19).
In the 2011 election the SPD had clearly won 35.6 percent ahead of the CDU (22).
The Greens, small parties with seven percent in the polls, are likely to make the leap into the state parliament.
They turn a holiday virtue into a modern virtue and move their campaign largely into the Internet.
"Online election campaign," states the country's chairman Claudia Müller.
Otherwise, green election campaigners are on track searching for local voters among tourists.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, is curving straight with a houseboat through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it also beautiful.
Your impression: "Election holidays in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment".
