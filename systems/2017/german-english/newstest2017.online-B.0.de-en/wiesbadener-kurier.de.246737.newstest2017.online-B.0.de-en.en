One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coup√© and also the versatility of a minivan.
Sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, proves to be very flexible in everyday life.
Although the HR-V, which is only 1.60 m high, is rather small in size, the passengers have plenty of space in the front row as well as in the rear, but it does not work at any point.
The materials of the interior are well-processed and pleasant, only the cockpit top falls somewhat.
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in the storage space.
There is not only a trunk of 453 l with raised seats and 1026 l with folded backrests, but there are the "Magic Seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: the seats of the rear bench can be folded up like a cinematical chair, offering space space that is 1,24 m high from floor to ceiling.
The trunk can be loaded well, but the loading height is 650 mm slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1.6-liter diesel engine with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very strong thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.
He should, however, do his work somewhat more quietly.
Pleasing is the daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km.
There is another engine: a 1.5-liter petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.
An all-wheel drive is not offered.
The driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
The steering should be somewhat more direct.
The equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the tested top variant "Executive".
The safety systems include the city emergency brake assist (works up to speed 32), the collision warning system and the tracking assist.
The collision warning device sometimes irritates because it judges many obstacles as "approaching objects" during maneuvering.
The high-beam assistant works very reliably.
And the intelligent cruise control responds to the traffic sign detection and throttles the speed as required.
The full connectivity is available only for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation, app integration and more.
Two USB and one HDMI jack are located under the armrest and are therefore a little cumbersome to reach.
The around 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are all right.
If you do not want to invest so much, you get the gasoline from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23000 euros.
The engines meet the Euro 6 emissions standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
