Russia and Turkey: An "Alliance of Outsiders"?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end to the eight-month-long war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I can not deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.
There was the hand, yes.
But Putin's smile seemed to be narrow-necked, and he barely radiated warmth, even for his reserved circumstances.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report five times.
I could not count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but would even improve.
The next day, a newspaper described Erdogan as if nothing bad had happened.
To me his enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite.
But one of Putin's radiant, lasting coolness showed that Russia's headmaster had not forgotten anything.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory remarks: the shooting of a Russian combat aircraft on the Syrian frontier through Turkey.
Moscow's reaction to the time was fierce.
Putin said, accusing Ankara of falling behind Russia.
The offense was even greater because it was committed by a supposed friend.
Reconcile confidence will be difficult, if not impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media launched a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.
Most seriously, the allegations of senior officials were that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from illegal oil trade in Syrian territories controlled by the so-called Islamic state.
He vehemently denied this.
But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan, which he wanted to hear.
Russia was able to score a victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a truce are clear.
Erdogan needs first and foremost all the friends he can get after he has almost been deprived of his office last month in a failed state coup.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights, which each year usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast.
The number has declined by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights are resumed.
They count on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.
This week, state TV forecasted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports were allowed again.
A report in Vedemosti put it as follows: "Tourists there long, tomatoes here long."
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West because it sees its response to the attempted seizure of power as a weak response.
In addition, there is the ongoing resentment over the snail tempo of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is keen to benefit from the cool mood and to reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West.
The Russian state secretary certainly won in Ankara a bonus for the fact that after the attempted coup he demanded support for the elected state organs.
This is a self-evident fact for Moscow, which itself has a profound fear of regime change.
The summit in this splendid palace by the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey, as an analyst once described, to depict the "alliance of outsiders": two countries that are offended by the West and feel badly treated and are now allying.
Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played a role as a peace-builder, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It could be significant that after nearly three hours of initial talks, both presidents at the press conference said they had not even touched the issue.
The President of Turkey intentionally avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize this.
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator to Syria can be found.
But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a complete disaster, as NATO member Turkey shot the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state at least talk again.
