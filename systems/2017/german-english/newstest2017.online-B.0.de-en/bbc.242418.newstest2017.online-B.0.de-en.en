Frankie Dettori reaches his 3,000th win at Newmarket on Predilection
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket, which brings him 3,000th win
The jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.
He set a milestone on Predilection, which is trained by John Gosden, on his local race track with his second win of the night.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in the flat race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry, and Willie Carson.
The three-time winner Dettori, who previously won Ghayyar, said, "It's something special."
I am very emotional because my family is here as well
I am very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday night with 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very humble.
Dettori takes the rejoicing as he takes the victory on Predilection
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jockey Richard Johnson and the retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who scored more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time Derbysieger, had 4.493 career bonuses
Frankie is one of the best jugglers of the modern age and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that few have reached before him.
He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for races, his enthusiasm and charisma has inspired fans for years for this sport.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he already had 6,000 gains, if he were not just a weekend and big tournament jockey!
Frankie has already won almost 30 years in GB, which is great.
He has a living personality, which is good for a British race, but he is also an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the flag of the British open-air race for two decades.
It was nerve-racking.
A whole lot of big tournament winnings, including his famous "Glorious Seven" 1996 in Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and got a drug ban.
Three years ago he had difficulties at first when he returned from his six-month suspension, but he showed an impressive strength of character to defy his doubters and return to his best form.
And he is far from the end - Dettori once said that he wants to continue his competitions up to at least 50 years of age.
