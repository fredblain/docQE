Old buildings, a few linden trees, between the rest of the cobbled streets: the Riga street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not look like this at first sight, but the police rank it as one of the "dangerous places" of the city.
Walking along the road from east to west, you will pass playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a health food store.
To the facade of a gray house someone has "ugly!" Sprayed.
Opposite of a Lidl, which is also to be demolished soon, is already built: By 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new rental housing is to be created here.
Articles about this "trendy district", as the responsible real estate firm calls Friedrichshain, are illustrated in the last few weeks, however, with burning cars pictured.
The house is numbered 94: Once it was occupied, now the residents have leases, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.
In particular, Henkel, the Berlin interior designer, had repeatedly spoken of the project as a "no-go zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.
After the premises on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, had been cleared by 300 policemen on June 22nd, the police patrolled three-week officially with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on the street, blocking parts of the street and preventing visitors from entering the house with the number 94.
During this renovated construction workers on behalf of the unknown house owners the rooms.
On July 13, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the eviction had been illegal, and a day later police and construction workers withdrew under the exultation of sympathizers and local residents.
This summer afternoon the street is peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the citizenry in front of the houses in the sun, others talk about Sp√§ti.
In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens.
Left-wing violence is not the main concern of many local residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in the neighborhood since 1999, and Jana *, who is raising three children, are annoyed by the police.
Together with the inhabitants of house projects, they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification.
It does not sound like a neighborhood, which mostly wanted police protection from vandalizing left.
The ditch, which the Berlin interior designer and the police between house occupiers and their neighbors open up, does not exist so obviously.
Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional workplace, which today also has a low average income and a high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city.
House occupations and the housing projects resulting from them have long been a part of the Kiez: in 1990 numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzerstrasse, very close to the Riga.
While the Mainzer had been evicted under a large police force in a regular street battles, many of the projects in the Riga were legalized and some are still inhabited by the people who occupied them 26 years ago.
At the same time, the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and electoral Berliners from all over the world in recent years. They now share their neighborhood with GDR-era residents and former occupiers.
This is also evident in the rents that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 for new leases.
Many of the new buildings in the Riga are attacked as symbols of this development: they can be seen on inserted panes or freshly painted facades, which were stained with color bags.
No other street was so often mentioned this year together with the words "left-wing violence".
One reason that not all neighbors see this as a problem may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: offenses such as bodily harm are directed to statistics almost exclusively against police officers.
The majority of the offenses constitute damage to property, which tend to meet the new buildings and newly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a tenement house for the past 17 years next to the controversial 94, there can be no question of uncertainty.
As for violent acts, it is appeasing: the people in the 94 are their neighbors, they were not that.
Even the famous burning cars do not exist anymore in Riga.
For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary: "They help each other, live together on the street and get more from one another than elsewhere."
Neugebauer deliberately moved to Riga Street.
That's why it was so important for the residents to get back to their streets: from the police, the politics and the media, who all of them suddenly claimed the importance of interpreting the district in July.
But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the street is still being taken away from them: through faceless new buildings in former vacant lots, which the old inhabitants displace.
"These are ultimately condominiums, which are not interesting for many people here - people who are not so well looked after are more likely to live here," she says.
"Violence and destruction, I can absolutely not approve."
But what can you do if nobody ever listens to you?
There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the residents.
Kerstin Neugebauer has little sympathy for people who are attracted to color bombs: the house projects and the left scene belonged to the neighborhood.
Anyone who pulls should be aware of this - just like someone who moves into a pub area, can complain badly about noise.
