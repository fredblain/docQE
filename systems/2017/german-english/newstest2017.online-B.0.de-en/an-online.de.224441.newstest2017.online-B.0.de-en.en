Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid
His experiences on the horse are manageable.
At the end of a golfing tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer looked for a bit of variety with a few colleagues and a ride on the beach.
For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.
CHIO: "Golden Sportpyramide" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses remembered on their evening's eve, and they hunted home to the feeding troughs in the fast gallop.
One kilometer at this rate, I was afraid.
"It was not a good experience," says Langer.
And then the riding career ended again.
On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament victories - was again close to horses.
He and his family ran across the ALRV, and he did not even swing on a horse for photographic purposes.
Langer was the first time in Aachen and thus also with the CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German sports aid handed over the Golden Sportpyramide to the man from Anhausen in the context of a small gala.
The sympathetic athlete is not lacking in awards.
Federal Tour Cross, Silver Laurel Leaf, Champions Tour Player of the Year ...
Even the British Queen has already ennobled him.
Langer is the 18th prize winner of the Sportpyramide.
In Aachen he met the first prize-winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
"This award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it is awarded not only for sporting success but also for social commitment".
Langer has been supporting the new generation for decades.
And so he gave the prize money of 25,000 euros the same.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time US-champion was taken to the "Hall of Fame of German Sports" on Saturday.
Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the gymnasts Eberhard Gienger, the fencers Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the rudder Peter-Michael Kolbe, the bob driver Meinhard Nehmer, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumping rider Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumous handball player Erhard Wunderlich.
Many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part the illustrious company went to the jumping stadium, where the Lavazza prize was running.
Bernhard Langer kept distance from the big animals.
