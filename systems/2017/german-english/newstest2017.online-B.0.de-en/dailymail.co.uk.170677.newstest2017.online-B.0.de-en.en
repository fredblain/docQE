Culture of Political Correctness makes electoral frauds flourish in Muslim areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year at the instigation of a government report for corruption
A culture of political correctness has led to the fact that widespread election fraud in Muslim communities is knowingly ignored as a crushing government report today.
The former Cabinetmember Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police, election observers, and town halls to ignore evidence of abuse of choice due to "hypocrisy about religion and ethnicity".
The former Minister of Integration and Local Government, now an anti-corruption kings, said the intimidation of religious voters was so bad that the police should be allowed to set barrier bands outside election booths to protect intimidated voters.
He recommends that voters should carry an identity card to prove their identity in elections.
At the moment, a voter simply needs to name his name and address.
The report suggests applying non-removable ink to a person's finger when they cast their voices to prevent someone from dialing twice.
Whistleblowers should get more protection, says Sir Eric.
He calls for the press to have more access to community records and decisions by unofficial committees or working groups.
"This is not only against electoral fraud but also to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture associated with it," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlet's election scandal in East London.
Last year, a special court ruled that the acting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be exempted from corrupt and illegal practices after a litany.
The court found that Rahman "perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community" cynically, "and that he had silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman is said to have "led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."
Up to 300 voices were either doubtful or the result of an imitation in which a person chooses as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
In particular, he expressed an alarming response to the fraudulent correspondence - in which older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, depicted, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including passing IDs to prove identity
In his report, the report stated that "pressure was being put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, to choose according to the will of the elderly, especially communities with a Pakistani or Bangladeshi background.
"There were concerns that ... state institutions had knowingly ignored such behavior because of" politically correct "hypocrises about ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including the prohibition of political activists to edit the voting documents to stop "electoral".
The report, which is being considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher registration checks to prevent the election list from being used for immigration and social welfare purposes.
Consider options to ask voters before the election for your ID.
Use non-removable ink on a person's finger as soon as she has cast her voice to prevent someone from dialing twice.
Systematic checks on the nationality of a person to ensure that they are entitled to vote.
A three-year limit on applications for automatic dialing.
Prohibition of political activists working on full postal and envelopes.
Give the police the power to set up barriers around polling stations.
A law amendment which facilitates an accusation of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983 (Volksvertretungsgesetz 1983).
Photography prohibition in election stations.
Requirement that only English may be used in the election stations (with the exception of Wales).
Intensification of the training to ensure that the employees enforce the rule that voters go into the election booth alone.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that after the Tower Hamlet's case no criminal complaint was made.
"The electoral court declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy to be unfit for corruption and illicit practices because of a litany," he said.
He was found guilty on the basis of a number of reasons, according to the high requirements of the criminal procedure.
He also criticized the ineffective "check controls" of the electoral registration departments of the town halls.
Sir Eric said, "The judging in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.
Our country, as the mother of parliaments, has a proud heritage, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and the denial of some authorities threaten this reputation.
