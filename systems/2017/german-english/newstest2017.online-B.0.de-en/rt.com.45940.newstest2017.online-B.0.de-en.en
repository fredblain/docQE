Jewish director smashes Berlin hotel because Israeli preselection was removed after "Arab" call - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media upheaval after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list any Israeli dial-in code, as Arab guests had "requested" it from a staff member.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentation "Shoah" left his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the country code list of the hotel.
The country, however, was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel has been eliminated and eradicated?
Wrote Lanzmann.
Instead, the Kempinksi Bristol offers an opportunity to select Israel through its own call center.
After an explanation, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The reply he received there "shocked him," as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said the measure was an "intentional decision of the management of the Kempinski Hotels."
The reason behind this sparked more anger in the director.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have requested that the area code be deleted," the clerk of Lanzmann was quoted.
The Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great disgrace," reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
We were horrified and shocked by this event.
This is really very shameful.
The fact that this has been the case in Germany in this hotel chain is even an even greater disgrace.
This does not require any explanation.
We expect the hotel "to draw the right conclusions," said the official.
The incident triggered a fairly large response on the Internet, where the people called it a scandal.
Some accused the Kempinski Hotel of having "surrendered" the alleged demands of Arab guests.
"Shame on you," said another contribution, pointing out that the hotel, which is located on the noble Kurfürstendamm, is near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly rejected all the allegations and called the incident an "oversight" and "apologized" at Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reported.
"There was never a direct instruction" to not include Israel in the shortlist, "the Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman for the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the country code has now been added.
