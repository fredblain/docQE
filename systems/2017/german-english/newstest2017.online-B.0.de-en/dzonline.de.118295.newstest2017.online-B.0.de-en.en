Olympia: Dreist fraud in doping test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary committee on the case.
Kenya's light athletes face unfavor after the second doping affair at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.
After a fraud attempt in a doping control in the Olympic village, Kenya has sent a coach home.
The International Olympic Committee announced its intention to establish a disciplinary commission as soon as possible to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official had indicated that the former sprinter and today's coach, John Anzrah, had given a urine test in the Olympic village under the name of the 800-meter runners Ferguson Rotich.
This had been reported to the team leadership of Kenya by the doping controllers.
The IAAF World Federation has asked the IOC for information on the case to investigate its own, an IAAF spokesman said.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent measures of the IOC, the IAAF will carry out an assessment," said an IAAF statement.
"He (Anzrah) has gone to the doping control station and has given himself as Ferguson Rotich, gave the test and signed it," declared Kenya's chief deputy Stephan Arap Soi.
He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete, who was on the list for the training checks of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
In 2015, Ferguson Rotich had become world champion fourth in 800 meters.
Four days before, the Kenyan athletics delegation chief, Michael Rotich, had been withdrawn from the Rio Games.
He is supposed to have informed the athletes of his country about doping tests.
According to media reports, he was arrested on his return to Nairobi airport.
Kenya has been under special scrutiny at the IOC for a long time after numerous doping offenses.
In announcing the more than 2,000 doping control controls launched by the IOC before the Rio Games, it was unusual to note that athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system before the summer games in Brazil.
The law was passed a few weeks before the start of the Olympic Games.
As a result, WADA took Kenya from the list of countries whose doping control is compliant with the WADA rules.
Kenya is considered a great runner nation.
The athletes of the country won the most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.
In a series of television reports of the ARD, accusations have repeatedly been raised that in Kenya doping means are easily accessible and there should be a considerable mentality of the sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound recently requested a similar investigation in Kenya as he had done in Russian athletics.
It could be shown that this type of sport was doped and systematically doped.
Russia's athletes were then excluded from the summer games.
