NASA Klimamodell: Venus was once habitable
According to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably once habitable.
Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere could have once exposed earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously pointed out that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus might have had a thin Earth-like atmosphere, but still slowly turned.
The model also illuminated the topography of early Venus.
The planet probably had more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to shelter lives and protect from rapid evaporation.
The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent dull.
"In the GISS model simulation, Venus's slow rotation exposes her daytime of the sun for almost two months," explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.
This heats the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a lot of the sun's heat.
The result is average temperatures that are several degrees cooler than those of the Earth today.
The model produced a history of Venus, which resembles the evolution previously suspected by planetary scientists.
Although it was once probably inhabitable, Venus was subjected to excessive heat and ultraviolet light for billions of years.
Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burnt by the ultraviolet light.
When their hydrogen escaped, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect remained - the Venus, as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.
