Treats wants naked calendars for "women and for men"
The Treats magazine collaborates with the photographer David Bellemere to bring out a 1970s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muses calendar for 2017.
The editor-in-chief of Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude magazine of Oldschool playboys distinguish, since "Playboy for men".
I do it for women.
Apparently he is of the opinion that the calendar also does.
"We have to return to the portrayal of timeless and classic nakedness in which both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a female body," Shaw said in a press release on the publication of the calendar.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a wonderful work of art.
Models can submit their pictures online or in person at open casting calling in Los Angeles and New York.
