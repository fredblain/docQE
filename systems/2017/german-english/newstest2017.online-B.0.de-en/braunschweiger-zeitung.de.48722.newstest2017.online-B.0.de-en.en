Who builds Braunschweig's cheap apartments?
The SPD and Greens believe that investors will be much more involved in the future.
How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years?
The SPD is proposing a "Housing Action Plan" at the next Council meeting.
But dispute is programmed.
First and foremost, the question is: Who is to build the cheap apartments?
A regulation is missing so far.
SPD parliamentary group leader Christoph Bratmann said: "We agree with the Greens. If you want to build on urban areas, you will have to show 20% of all apartments as social apartments."
The cheap apartments can however also arise in the stock.
However, Bratmann says, "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private land?"
"We want investors to build at least 10 per cent, but as much as 20 per cent of the apartments as social apartments on such areas."
A new urban housing development program, which will cost millions and still needs to be financed, is intended to provide incentives.
The problem, according to Bratmann: "There is currently no agreement between the political groups."
The CDU wants to make investors as few regulations as possible.
The left still wants tough conditions for investors.
Irrespective of this, Bratmann said that the situation on the housing market was exacerbating.
If the action plan is implemented, this will provide additional tasks in the construction management.
More staff is required.
It is unclear whether we will get the specialists.
But the program is not yet complete: the 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.
How, however, is the loss of a further 1,300 low-priced apartments, which will be phased out in the coming years?
Alone by the year 2020 there will be 500 apartments.
In order to prevent this, according to the planning-political spokeswoman Nicole Palm, now expiring bonds should be purchased from the city.
In addition, it would have to be thought about bringing apartments back into price.
This is possible in Weststadt.
The problem could be solved in one fell swoop.
In the Weststadt deadlines expire at the end of the year.
Around 1800 apartments could be brought back into the price-fixing for cheap apartments.
The owners, the housing associations, do not want that.
For the number of social apartments in the Weststadt is once again drastically increased, one moves away from the goal of so-called intermixing.
There should be no concentration of social weakness in only a few districts.
The Greens expect that there will be movement in the discussion.
Holger Herlitschke, President of the Swiss parliament, said: "The CDU must be involved in the boat for a broad majority."
It had concentrated on more building sites for single-family houses.
But what does not mean that a compromise can not be found.
