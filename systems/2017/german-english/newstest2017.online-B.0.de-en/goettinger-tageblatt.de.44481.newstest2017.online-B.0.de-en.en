The Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee demands a lot of savings from future savers - as the second institute in Germany.
Bank chief Josef Paul said on Thursday: "It is only about 139 customers, who park 40 million euros on giro or day money accounts".
The Federal Association of German Banks speaks of a single case and does not see any signal: Normal savers would "not have to pay penal rates for their savings".
When banks spend money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they must pay their 0.4 percent penalty.
From September, Raiffeisenbank Gmund will demand this fee from private and corporate clients for deposits of more than EUR 100,000 on giro or daily money accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
"The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year," said Paul.
He has been guarding for some time 40 million euros, which could be lifted from one day to the next and which he could not recycle.
"They lie with me in the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent costs," said the bank chief.
"I can not lay down 4000 euros for every million."
The costs are now passed on according to the polluter pays principle.
To leave the cash simply in the Raiffeisenbank vaults would be much too dangerous: "I've already experienced four raids, I do not want to be the fifth!" Said the head of the bank.
Most customers would understand and switch to other forms of investment.
Only a few migrated to other banks.
The Cooperative Association of Bavaria stated: "The extreme monetary policy course of the ECB causes considerable costs for all banks".
To bear them alone is "permanently unworkable".
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for bank accounts, credit cards or bank transfers.
The Thüringer Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land, with its Skatbank branch in 2014, had made headlines with interest on penalties for deposits of more than three million euros.
Michael Kemmer, chief executive officer of the banking association, said: "We do not expect private customers to pay flat-rate charges for deposits, but the competition in Germany is far too strong among banks and savings banks."
A banker said there is "a clientele that is more lushly endowed with assets" at Tegernsee.
"This can become a problem for a small bank", if they are free of money.
Founded in 1911, the Genossenschaftsbank Gmund has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
In the region famous actors, sportsmen and entrepreneurs live.
The cooperative association of Bavaria "currently no other banks are known, which charge a reimbursement of expenses for deposits of private customers," said spokesman Ernst.
The President of the Federal Association of German People's Banks and Raiffeisen Banks (BVR), Uwe Fröhlich, declared at the end of June: "The threshold to go negatively towards the private customer is very, very high."
The competition is tough, and it threatens the migration of investors to the competition.
The customers in Germany will not be pleased with the width.
