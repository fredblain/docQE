Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes Internethit
The Olympics or world records do not always determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.
This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte during the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.
At the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that he was temporarily out of sight in the TV pictures.
He simply disappeared - no matter how far the section was selected.
In the social networks, Habte subsequently became a viral interneethite.
In fact, the 24-year-old finished his lead with a lag of 48 seconds and finished 59th place with 59 starters.
But it was more of a non-athletic figure that drew the attention of the international media.
Why does the 24-year-old take part in the Olympics?
The Ethiopian got a special start right from the international swimming association.
This is distributed to promote swimming in underrepresented countries.
Since in Ethiopia most athletes are running, Habte simply wanted to do something different.
Preparation is everything: Robel Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.
The first nicknames quickly made the rounds.
Some media called him "Robel the Whale".
The English tabloid "The Sun" made fun of "Dad Bod" on the basis of a "prosperous belly".
His time, he did not hit the 100 meter free-kick with a minute and almost five seconds, did not matter.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.
At the Sydney Olympics in Sydney, Eric Moussambani's run ensured media attention.
Unforgettable was the appearance of the floater from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to compete in a prelude over 100 meters of Freistil alone.
Frenetically, Moussambani was fired at the time.
The then 22-year-old learned to swim only eight months before the Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.
