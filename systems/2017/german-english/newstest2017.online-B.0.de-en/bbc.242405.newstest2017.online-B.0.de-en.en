Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available to customers outside of Scotland
According to the board of the bank, the RBS brand is only to be reduced to a backoffice role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank has since distanced itself, when it had almost collapsed and had to be saved eight years ago.
During this time, branded "RBS" brands have been used to protect other end-consumer financial brands.
She supported international sports with millions of pounds of sponsorship, from the Six Nations Rugby to the Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now it has decided to focus more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralized headquarters and the stock exchange listing will switch to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller brands for the retail business that will get more importance - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed by customers and employees in Inverness-shire during an inspection tour.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RSB brand will become our investor brand and the brand under which our employees will be employed, as we are now becoming a bank of brands."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I now say that we are not pursuing global goals but local objectives.
Each of these brands will be completely different in their own communities, and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already said that it will not continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the perceptibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship.
"It is time for us to develop into the Bank of Brands, because how do we focus on the internal (we have asked) to make it a better bank for customers," said the CEO.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think you will see many changes.
We can launch these brands again, so I think the time has come.
