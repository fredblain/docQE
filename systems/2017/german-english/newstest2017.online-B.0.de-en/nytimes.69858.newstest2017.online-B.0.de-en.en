Donald Trump explains his allegation that Obama ISIS had been "sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump attempted to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign on Friday by stating that his repeated assertion that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the terrorist group Islamic State were not serious.
This clarification raised new questions about the communication skills of the Presidential candidate of the Republicans as to whether he was in a position to communicate clearly with the American public.
It also brings his co-workers, who strive to protect him during an eventful period, into the peculiar position of explaining statements which he could not have meant at all.
After making the hint at an electoral event on Wednesday night Mr. Trump rowed back on Thursday's assertion and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to imply that President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic.
The tweet was the opposite of the previous day, when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the accusation was quite serious.
When the conservative Radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to mitigate the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know about it.
The last storm of criticism rages down on Mr. Trump, while he has tried to focus his campaign on the economic situation due to falling surveys.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton gave speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump again tried to return to the subject.
Reporting on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes, and that he had found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already presented sarcasm for his defense.
At the end of July, he drew strong criticism when he said that the Russians were supposed to hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but he later declared, "Of course I meant the sarcastic."
This method allows Mr. Trump to shift the linguistic boundaries in politics and then row back as needed.
"I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans, how they arrive, and then" clarify "depending on how the reaction goes wrong," said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates.
I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has assumed a more corrosive tone since his polls have fallen further.
A new survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, published on Friday, showed a lead with a great lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump is generally trying not to apologize for his provocative remarks, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humor.
But while he is increasingly focused on attention in the last few months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps jokes have brought his loyal supporters into the uncomfortable situation of facing him, no matter how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps' most prominent advocates, took great pains to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview on Thursday.
"I believe what he says are legitimate political comments," said Mr. Giuliani, so he was questioned about the truth of Mr. Trump's statements as to whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic state.
It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backbanks, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, where Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread by blocking the situation in the Middle East aggressively.
Prior to the electoral campaigns in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of being bored with each of his words and being biased against him.
He mocked the "poor, miserable" TV wizards who tried to understand him and said, "You can not!".
Some of the Democrats scoffed at Mr. Trump's apology as just another proof that he was unsuitable for the presidential office.
