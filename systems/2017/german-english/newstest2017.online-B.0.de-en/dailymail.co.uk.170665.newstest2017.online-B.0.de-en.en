The £ 2 per day drug that can lower heart attack risk
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 per day drug after being recommended by the authorities to administer this more people for a longer period of time.
The anticoagulant drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with a heart disease.
The medication is administered for 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of stroke or further heart attack.
The NICE regulatory body of the NHS has recommended a four-year-long dose to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.

Around 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or a stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulation of fatty material in the arterial walls that form deposits.
When the pad breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot that clogs blood flow to the heart causing a heart attack.
As the blood clot dissolves, it can flow through the bloodstream and block blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who already had a heart attack are at a higher risk of having a further one.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots less likely.
NICE's guidance, published today, recommends taking 90mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60mg with twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Center said: "Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have a further heart attack or a stroke - often with disastrous consequences."
The fear of a new heart attack can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
Experience shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who already had a heart attack.
Through a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
Information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years. The guidance draft does not recommend treatment beyond this period.
