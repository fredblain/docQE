Russia's Putin fires staff chief Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed his staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of Putin's closest circle of trust for many years.
The 63-year-old was appointed Special Envoy for Environmental and Transport Affairs.
In a statement from the Kremlin it is stated that Putin had ordered "the dismissal of Ivanov from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration, without stating reasons."
Anton Vaino, who had been Ivanov's deputy since 2012, was appointed his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital of Tallinn, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo.
On the Kremlin's website (in Russian), he was later to be the secretary of the government and the head of the government.
On his appointment he told Putin: "Thank you for your confidence."
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your work as a state secretary with regard to draft legislation and controls to implement your instructions.
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Convince the smiling faces?
This step has made Moscow mysterious.
Sergei Ivanov was for a long time one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidants and works for the Soviet Intelligence Service, the KGB.
He was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, broadcast on television, both men claimed that the chief of staff would resign at his own request.
But despite the smile for the cameras, few are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of a kind of power struggle?
Nobody knows this at the moment.
But the official assertion - that a man who was once praised as a potential president, at once to lead the Russian environmental policy - met with great skepticism.
In his remarks to Putin quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said "it is true that I asked you in early 2012 in a conversation to entrust this very complicated post - you could almost say - to cumbersome posts for four years.
As it turns out, I have been the chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took the post in December 2011.
Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB State Security Service.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), replacing the KGB, Ivanov was appointed deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov as one of five people to whom he most trusted.
Once it was assumed that Ivanov might become President of Russia after Putin's second term of office, since Putin's third term of office would have violated the constitution.
But this post was taken by another close friend of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister before becoming president again three and a half years later.
