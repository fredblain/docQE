Escape: "Every fugitive woman has experience with sexual violence"
Sexual violence is almost everyday life for women who are fleeing alone.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house provides refuge.
Four women are sitting in a large kitchen.
Each has a baby that is at most one year old.
One has put her little son in the arm.
He looks curiously into the room with big eyes.
His mother is staring at the table.
Until she realizes she's being watched.
She smiles briefly and kisses the little one.
The scene is normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is the area manager of Condrobs, a social aid provider in Bavaria, and is also concerned with women on the run.
The four women in the kitchen are fugitives.
They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralized accommodations for all-women and their children in Bavaria.
In January, Condrobs set up the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid.
Recently, it was officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men - neither as visitors.
The exception is a guardman outside the door.
"It is no exaggeration to say that every woman who arrives here has had experiences with sexual violence on her flight," says Bahr.
"Men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they face torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as a hope-bearer," she says.
In women, there are other reasons for the escape: "Many steal themselves stealthily because they see no other way out".
In their homeland, they have had experience with sexual violence, forced marriage, honor murder, slavery, or compulsive prostitution.
This drives them away.
On the run, this continues.
"That tugs, for example, demand a sexual action for a bottle of water is not a rarity," says Bahr.
And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Who believes that the end, as soon as they arrive in Germany, is wrong, says Bahr.
Again, single women in refugee shelters would often be regarded as inferior and, at worst, abused.
As a result, around 90 percent of women living in the north of Munich are traumatized, she says.
"Some of the children have certainly not been born voluntarily".
Many women are so accustomed to saying nothing.
"Or they do not dare to speak openly about the experience, because the shame is too great."
Since they often would not be able to help, they need more accommodation only for them, Bahr asks.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for housing refugees.
When asked whether they knew about a project similar to that in Munich, some responded with no.
In Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in government accommodation.
Even in Swabia alone fled women are not separately housed, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press secretary of the government.
In Oberbayern, Unter- und Mittelfranken, there are floors or houses in some community accommodation only for single women and their children.
The exception is Niederbayern, where there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be placed separately from men.
In a study published for the Committee, "It is very important that men and women are housed separately."
"If the privacy is lacking, or if men and women are brought together, there can be - ongoing" violence against women ".
Especially the washrooms should be separate and accessible to women, is the study.
The extent to which women feel this need for protection can be seen in the rush of the house in Munich.
"Since we got around, we have a long queue," says Bahr.
You could easily open a second house.
