Doctors want to organize further strikes after they have rejected Jeremy Hunts proposal
The ministers had hoped to put an end to the dispute over the amendments by accepting a reformed treaty with the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 medical assistants who voted in an election declined.
In July, Hunt had revealed plans to compulsorily enforce the contract, saying the NHS was in a "Niemandsland" and any further delay would be detrimental to employees and patients.
The first assistants are to receive a new contract, which includes changes to night and weekend work, in order to improve care at inhospitable times.
Dr Ellen McCourt, the chairman of the BMA Committee for Medical Assistants, reported last night in a communication: "Doctors continue to have serious concerns about the proposed treaty, in particular that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and refuse to treat all doctors fairly."
With only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new treaty, progress must be made and time is running out.
Efforts on the part of the BMA to resolve the disputes through discussions met with the government to take part in repugnance and sometimes to deafening silence.
This happened to a promise that Jeremy Hunt had just made about last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt must now act, lift the imposition, and address the concerns of the assistants."
If he does not do so, the doctors have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further work-fighting measures.
The last strike At the end of April, there were a delay of almost 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and specialists were included to cover the strike population.
The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by accepting the reformed treaty with the British Medical Association officials.
The BMA would like a better weekly wage for the 54,000 assistants who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, general manager of the NHS staff, called on the assistants to end the strike.
Mortimer said, "Labor policies do not do very well, but they are already burdened by overburdened teams and service providers, and they only give patients, carers and their families worry, distress and interruption."
In the past two months, we have been talking to the Committee of Medical Assistants and responded positively to the concerns about guardianship and whistleblowing with the Ministry of Health and other ministries.
The employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important issues such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from work, training, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training leave and gender pay gap in medicine were a sign of how serious the employers, health education England and the Ministry of Health were in respecting the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.
