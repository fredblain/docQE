Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have been inspired by the trainer's cancer to ride the helm
There will be no more emotinal gold than with these games and that will mean something.
From the first helm to the last, 220 hard hieve that go down in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Even if they were only the two who were at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. Robin Williams' echo was all-rounder as they rowed to the second Olympic gold medal in the second without the helm, the first women in the history of British sport.
Their dominance was absolute, after all their unbeaten run, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes who glide over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the kind of triumph to the full.
Behind every gold in the row is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental advances that make the difference and no one was more helpful than the trainer who did not know 30 months ago if he would ever survive the day when cancer was diagnosed.
As he said, he was risky.
I had bladder cancer that is operable and they did.
If you do not, it spreads everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes the view somewhat.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was lucky to be able to start treatment in early 2014, off-season, which would keep the interruption to a minimum, if that is the right term under such circumstances.
I needed money, so I had to get better soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps would suffice.
This is how it begins.
Rowing itself is a challenge, but it makes it even bigger.
In the immediacy of the victory their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve-racking morning talking more than usual, trying to deal with his own fears.
Stanning, who was the main man at the Royal Artillery Regiment in Afghanistan, said, "I was an emotional wreck this week, which is perhaps something extreme, but it means so much."
It only repeats how much it means to me how much I and Helen and Robin have worked.
There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we would be no one, so a massive thank you to him. He is the best coach in the world.
I could not have asked for a better person to train or a better coach.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the past five years.
The pair had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to unlock, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very caught right now.
Helen cried "stay in the process, stay in the process".
It is really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we were not looking to make something great.
We did not want a fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, which we did.
The couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about their future.
Glover must appear next week at a wedding, her own with TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I did not want to say that was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympian winner.
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes.
It feels so much better, "she said.
