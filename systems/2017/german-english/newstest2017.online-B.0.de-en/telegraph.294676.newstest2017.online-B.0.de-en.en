England must steer the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was the biggest attraction of Heathrow, just as it was in London in 2012, when we were doing a great deal to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for locals and businesses near Heathrow.
For our local communities, we will already create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs, and put an end to the youth unemployment in the airport environment.
As we were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of expanding Heathrows is too great.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games, and that we will embarrass ourselves on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question asked.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project.
Enlargement is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £ 211 billion in corporate growth, and leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team in Heathrow that has implemented an £ 11 billion infrastructure investment program in terms of time and budget from the T5, which has been voted the world's best airport terminal five years in a row, to the T2 that was built in the middle of the two busiest catwalks in the world.
Now they are ready to deliver a third catwalk, which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment.
The 2012 London Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.
It is time we steered this Olympic spirit and expanded Heathrow, securing our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.
