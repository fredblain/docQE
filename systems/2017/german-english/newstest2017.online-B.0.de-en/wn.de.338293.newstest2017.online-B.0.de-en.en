Intercultural travel: cultural offers for schools
The international class of the forest school visited the play "The Invisible House".
The association Nima's and the Junge Theater are now planning a music project.
Nima's association allows young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "International Class" of the Waldschule Kinderhaus has attended a performance of the award-winning play "The Invisible House" by the Junge Theater Münster.
In the context of the "Intercultural Journey" initiated by Nima's association, 19 pupils from eleven to fifteen years attended the production in the Kleine Haus.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which has set up the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background, offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster during this project.
Most young people in the class came to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 from among other things from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria and speak little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, scenic pictures and video animations, they were able to follow the course of the action nevertheless, according to the press release of the Boys Theater Münster.
The association Nima's, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel, and the Junge Theater will cooperate in the coming season as part of a musical theater project.
From October to December, young people with and without an escape and migration background between 14 and 20 years should be given the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the areas of singing, dancing, acting and music.
Offers for children and families in the area of theater play and theatrical language teaching are in the planning stage.
The project "Intercultural Journey" continues.
In view of the increased number of refugees, the association expects many classes who want to participate.
