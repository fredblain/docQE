Bombenterror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Several dead
The Austrian embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, said the speaker of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Thomas Schnöll, Freitagfrüh.
She had suffered cuts and had been treated in the hospital, but she had already left her.
She planned her return home for the beginning of September.
Whether the further explosions on the tourist island of Phuket, as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon also Austrian citizens are affected, is still unclear.
The foreign ministry is in constant contact with local authorities, says Schnöll.
In the Hua Hin, about 200 kilometers south of the capital Bangkok, two bombs exploded in a nightlife area on Thursday evening.
According to police, a Thai woman was killed and some 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutchmen and three Italians.
On Friday morning, another two bombshells went up again, according to the authorities, another person was killed.
A bomb explosion was also reported in the morning from Phuket.
At the detonation near the Patong beach, which was popular with tourists, a taxi driver was injured.
In Surat Thani on the southeast coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing an urban employee.
According to the authorities, the blast gun had burst into the air in a flowerbed in front of the police station.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwest coast as well as in Chumphon on the southeast coast demanded several injuries.
They are talking about a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, they said.
"The bombshells carry the same manuscript," said army general Danai Kritmethavee Friday morning before journalists.
"We assume that this is a coordinated attack."
It was too early to comment on possible motives - but probably the deeds of Muslim rebels.
In the attacks, Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern typical of the bombing of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the assassinations were not related to the Islamic uprising movement or to international terrorism.
"This is only local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces," said a spokesman in Bangkok.
Rather, it is assumed that the bombs were placed by opponents of the ruling military junta.
The authorities had received intelligence in the past few days about the impending attacks in the south of the country, but they had not been informed of the exact date and places.
It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.
The police instructed their officials across the country to strengthen security around important government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment areas.
In Thailand there are always small bomb attacks, but they are mostly not directed against tourists.
In Hua Hin lies a palace, which was used for years by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
After the recent bomb explosions, the Austrian Foreign Ministry on its website recommends that the Thai security authorities strictly follow the instructions.
High security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and the surrounding area.
After disputes between the security forces and the Muslim population, it is advised not to travel to these provinces.
Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution prepared by the military junta.
This will also give the military great influence in the coming years.
Junta chief and prime minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs had been an attempt to create chaos as the country moved towards stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.
The militia, which had taken power after a period of bloody unrest in 2014, has benefited itself in having restored the kingdom to stability and order.
However, the military has not succeeded in getting to grips with the rebellion of Muslim rebels, which has been smoldering for years in the far south.
In the conflict, more than 6500 people have already been killed.
Just over a year ago, 20 people were killed in a bombing of a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.
It was the most bloody attack on the country's recent history.
