Violent rains, flooding give rise to rescue operations in Louisiana, Mississippi
Violent rains and large-scale floods in Louisiana forced the governor to call the emergency on Friday, with more rainfall all Saturday.
Numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and the south of the Mississippi flooded their shores and threatened with large-scale floods after extreme rainfall, the National Weather Service reported.
John Bel Edwards, Governor of Louisiana, said that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and that assistance to the affected communities is already underway.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said the number of inquiries for floods, boats, and sundresses increased.
Steele said that the municipality of Tangipahoa alone had requested ten thousand sandbags.
A flood warning system is being deployed across much of southern Louisiana until Saturday.
The weather service announced that there might be an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain in this area.
In the south of Alabama, an early flood warning system was deployed on Friday while it continued to rain in Mobile.
The River Comite near Baton Rouges and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, are likely to reach record levels over the weekend.
The metereologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a downstream flooding in Ascension Parish is a danger because they will flow slowly over the river into Lake Maurepas.
The River Tickfaw, south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest score ever recorded on Friday at 09.00.
Rescue teams still plucked people from the flood waters in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife, and his step-son were among those who were rescued on Friday near Gloster.
Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 400 feet from his house, rose sharply overnight.
He said that another stepdaughter who lived nearby had warned him.
"We have woken up and the water poured and poured in," said Hansford.
It reached my waist.
His wife told Hansford that in the 48 years she lived there, she had never seen such a high rise in the river.
Hansford said that he and his family members had all the disabilities and that he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said emergency aid had rescued all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they were lodged until Friday.
Krautmann said the flooding had spread "quickly", as there were still heavy rains and that the authorities were considering evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livingstone reported a rain of 13.75 inches from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said that the ground had been drastically affected by the rainfall since Wednesday.
The authorities said heavy rainfall and street flooding caused the rescue of residents from their houses in Tangipahoa Parish and school failure in five school districts.
The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that a deputy in Tangipahoa ruled over 200 flooded houses.
The inhabitants were evacuated in two churches, which were now both flooded.
The head of the community, Robby Miller, said the authorities had rescued 72 people and seven domestic animals flushed by the flood.
In the cities of Amite and Hammond emergency accommodations were set up to accommodate the evacuees.
"As soon as the water begins to return, they will be able to return to their homes," he said.
In the town of Hammond, Tangipahoa, almost two dozen roads were closed due to the flood, and sandbags were provided for the residents, who were hoping to keep the water out of their homes and shops.
"The last major flooding we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum from the city administration.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississipp, the emergency manager Rupert Lacy of the Harrison County said it was raining on the Gulf Coast.
According to his data, a handful of houses were reported to have been flooded on Thursday, but no reports have been reported on Friday.
Keith Townson, manager of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I have seen water in places where I have never seen it before," said Townson, "and it still comes."
