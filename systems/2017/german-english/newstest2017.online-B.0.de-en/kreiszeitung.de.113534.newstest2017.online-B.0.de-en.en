Podolski takes "Gala" after Supercup
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.
A warrant of arrest has been issued in Turkey against former footballer Hakan Sükür.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time after the coup attempt an important football game takes place in Turkey.
Before the match between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul for the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: "Business as usual" is announced.
Even in the imposition of the state of emergency after the coup attempt in July, the government argued that the everyday life of ordinary citizens should not be impaired.
But this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is responsible for the coup attempt.
Even before the football is not stopped.
Against the former Starkicker Hakan Sükür, the prosecutor issued a warrant for arrest.
Accordingly, the South Sudan now living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
Sükür is supposed to be a supporter of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is blamed by the President of the Republic, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, for the coup attempt.
It is true that the state of exile, which was initially imposed for 90 days, still applies until October, but in fact this has almost no effect on the lives of most Turks.
The nightly "democracy guards" in public places across the country has declared Erdogan on Wednesday for finished.
The sport, like the whole country, is divided into the followers and opponents of Erdogan.
Especially fans of the Besiktas workers' club traditionally do not belong to the president's friends.
However, the majority of the Turks are united by dramatic experiences in history, which is the strict rejection of military putsches.
Even the fans agree - no matter if their hearts beat for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
At the Pokal winner "Gala", Lukas Podolski will be particularly keen to return.
His sporting achievement proved the Cologne in the past season: With 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions, the 31-year-old finished his first season as top scorer of his club.
In the final against Fenerbahce he scored the 1: 0-winner.
The newspaper "Fanatik" cheered him: "He was the best in the square."
He finished the season in an excellent way and secured his trophy for his team.
Thanks to "Poldi" the disappointing season for the record champion was a conciliatory conclusion.
After the preliminary knockout knockout in the Champions League, the "Löwen" departed early in the Europa League.
In the Süper Lig it was only sixth.
The season was not good.
The trophy was the only way to win something.
"We did it and that's the most important thing," said Podolski.
For Master Besiktas, the year went better.
Above all thanks to Mario Gomez, who laid the basis for the 14th title with 26 Sais matches as a Süper Lig goalkeeper.
This is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31-year-old.
The Gomez, who was under contract at the AC Florence and only loaned to Besiktas, had announced after the coup attempt that he would not return because of the political situation in the country after his EM-holidays.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say it," quoted the specialist magazine "Kicker" Clubchef Fikret Orman.
However, the striker would have to be prepared to forgo a third of his annual salary worth 7.5 million euros, Orman said: "We can not pay his salary in Florence".
