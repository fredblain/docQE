Schorndorf: Burglar with helicopter wanted
The police helicopter flew several areas for about an hour - unsuccessfully.
Two unknown men were forced into an apartment in a multi-family house on the Lindenweg at 8:50 am on Friday morning.
The resident surprised the two and struck the monster into flight.
The two men were about 1.65 to 1.70 meters tall, well masked, wearing both blue jeans and black hoodies.
They fled downtown.
The police used several strip crew as well as a police helicopter.
The search was unsuccessful.
Possibly, the unknowns fell before the action near the apartment or during their flight.
