B27-Restructuring: Restaurants suffer from blocking
The speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated, there is nothing to complain about.
For those responsible for the construction works, which start at 5.30 in the morning and end only around 8 pm, there is praise everywhere.
"They made everything quite jagged," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the Jet petrol station.
This is a superteam.
There is also no delay.
The construction site could be moved to the south at the beginning of the week at half-time, by the end of October everything should be ready.
We also commend the meeting of those who are responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to the setting up of makeshift entrances.
Since the construction site on Monday migrated to the south and also the blocking of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was lifted and thus also the connection to Rottenburg again exists, the traffic situation within the place has relaxed.
From Ofterdingen the citizens can now ride the B 27 on both sides again.
The evasion traffic through the village seems to go back.
"There were sometimes significant complaints," says Deputy Chief Executive Officer Florian King, responsible for traffic management management.
The residents of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because many crawls were looking for and more familiar with their navigation than the signs.
Which led to the fact that some trucks were fraying in residential areas.
Since the speed limits were not met, the municipality increasingly demanded the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.
"There have been significant overruns," says King, who himself knew about the situation on the spot.
Since two to three per minute have been flashed.
The fastest was traveling with 77 km / h in the Tempo-30 zone.
Since the construction site has moved on, however, it has become quieter.
For the businessmen on the B 27, it is only a small consolation that the road is now open again for customers from Rottenburg.
Businessmen do not like to look at the cards.
But the fact that the B 27 renovation has led to sales slumps has left anyone you wondered through.
However, some are more affected and some are less affected.
If you have less to do with the "end customer", that is for other companies produced, the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences.
Thomas Sulz also speaks of a "maximum slight decline" at the Autohaus Maier, but also admits that, of course, the "running track" is missing.
The most crowded are the restaurants along the street.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly crown, finds clear words.
This is already a threat to life.
Not only him, but all the restaurants "hit hard".
The customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.
We must be happy about every euro turnover.
The sales losses are estimated to be "well over 50 percent".
The road repair had "thrown back two years".
He had had to dismiss half of his staff.
If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, the policy would have reacted differently.
Instead, Jörg Schmidt, the President of the Government, responded to a question by Göhner about whether there could be a financial compensation, that the restaurant would benefit from the advantages of the situation at B 27. Now it must also bear the disadvantages that result from the renovation.
Göhner knows from other districts, where something more generous was handled.
In all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.
After all, the family business has been established here since 1715, he points to the long history.
The fact that other regular visitors are now less frequent, because of the complicated traffic management, can understand.
If you can not go, it is also beautiful elsewhere.
The fact that his regular clientele will return after the end of the reconstruction work has no doubt in this regard.
Despite the crises with BSE and bird flu, Göhner considers the impact of the B 27 construction work on his customers the biggest crisis his restaurant has experienced in its long history.
Six months of construction work is already brutal.
