Haigerloch: Pilgrimage to the Porte of Mercy
The ministers from the pastoral care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Together, four stages were completed.
In order to bridge the time until the next Rome pilgrimage of all the ministries in two years, the upper ministry of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a pilgrimage of several days.
Various pilgrimage destinations were tested and finally decided for the bishopric city of Freiburg, where a special pilgrimage destination was offered this year on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy with the open gate of mercy at the Freiburg Cathedral.
16 Minis from Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Heiligenzimmern set off.
The previous evening, Father Storost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrim crosses, and gave the pilgrimage.
From Horb it was by train to the starting point Villingen, where also a cathedral of Our Lady stands and thus the pilgrim way of the cathedral was entered.
The individual day trips were framed in the morning and in the evening by a short impulse with different prayers, songs and texts.
But also on the way, the Minis made a break at the crossroads, chapels or churches to sing together a song from a specially composed pilgrim songbook.
The parish homes of the local parishes were available for the overnight stays.
Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller were there for a tasty and strong dinner and breakfast.
On the second day we went over Furtwangen to GÃ¼tenbach.
The next day, the stage went to St. Peter, which was the most strenuous route, but had to be descended at about 500 heights and then climbed again.
The deserved reward was in the evening a common barbecue at Badweiher.
After the morning impulse on the fourth pilgrimage day in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter, we went to the final stage to Freiburg.
Visibly relieved and happy, the Minis arrived at the Freiburg Cathedral in the late afternoon and crossed the gate of mercy.
With a small impulse, God was thanked here.
At the evening fair in the cathedral the minis arrived at the pilgrimage destination were welcomed by co-operator Markus Obert.
After the service the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.
The next day there was still time for the marsh gourd.
In the afternoon we went by train back to Horb.
In the end, all participants agreed that the days were characterized by spirituality and a strong community experience.
