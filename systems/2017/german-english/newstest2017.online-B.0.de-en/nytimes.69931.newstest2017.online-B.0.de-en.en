The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a copious meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his rise to the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt had a taste for refined delicacies on Fifth Avenue such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland Turtle Turtle Soup.
His menu on this day was somewhat more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and as dessert a plum pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."
The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coe's last book, "Chop Suey", was about Chinese cooking in the USA, while Ziegelman told her about her life in a dwelling-house on the Lower East Side from the food perspective in her book "97 Orchard".
Their latest collaboration, "A decent meal," which will be released on Tuesday at the Harper Publishing House, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, snappy snack in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the Börsencrash in 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive bits while Coe, 57, ate turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered meatloafs, the pair found this to fit into a discussion about food in the era of the Great Depression.
"Rich foods were very popular," Ziegelman said.
There was peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.
They were made from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.
Coe grinned.
"It must have been like lead in the stomach," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table in an American household, especially in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Teams of women cooked for male field workers and freshly baked pate was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the first world war. "A Square Meal" marks the ways in which the country was no longer the landlocked land.
"It was a time when food became a central, tense subject for the Americans," Coe explained why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The new budget diet was just as tense as this: the mysterious food such as breads and casseroles became the basic foodstuffs, the Kasserolle as a "miraculous way to recycle food residues," noted Ziegelman, since cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which for many years was the centerpiece of American cuisine, became a rarely served luxury.
Strange mixtures were tried, as a calorie-rich and nutritious satisfaction had precedence over taste or even healthy cooking.
During her search for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from this era, baked onions with peanut butter.
"It was not a popular addition at midday," says Coe.
Ziegelmann continues: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter and baked onions do not match each other.
It was typical for many of the housekeeping recipes.
As never before or since, budgetary economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - were driving the eating habits of the country so much.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "household policemen" and meet the challenge of transforming Pampe like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
"A Square Meal" is a feast of historical delicacies.
In particular, the reports of the government's response to the starving citizen, such as President Herbert Hoovers's Lass-mich-Kuchen-Essen attitude, are palatable.
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen, he dined like the million-strong man of the world to whom he has become.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He ate in an almost gilded dining room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was terribly unrealistic.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not asked him to set an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, the hiring of a housekeeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs. Roosevelt led to the White House bringing the dullest food in Washington, but also one of the most dreary. "
Many of the species from the era of the Great Depression, dealing with food, were rejected as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy lies on our continued focus on calories and food, Ziegelman, as well as on how science was applied to foods.
The couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother-in-law when writing the book - for example, how she could not throw away food.
"She had a real fear of wasting food," Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, "She actually made people sick."
There was the windbag incident.
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, they and Coe pulled out a dessert that they had prepared at home: the Pflaumendessert, which President Roosevelt ate at noon.
"It's called Prune Whip," said Ziegelman, adding that it was a common trick to give a modest name to modest recipes.
There was no whipped cream, just plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone dipped a spoon into the tough, brown glibber.
Amazingly it tasted not bad.
Coe drew himself up three times.
Like a can-do buddy, he told his wife, "A few chopped walnuts would help."
