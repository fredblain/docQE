Clintons and Trumps Economic Policy Compared: It's all about the money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing the trade agreement TTP - this is what both Clinton and Trump want.
However, the two US presidential candidates are in the tax and energy policy as well as in a principle question.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical, difference.
The, about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep the doubt small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and to death, he says.
He himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, says Trump.
He will massively cut back on regulations, and he is making a strong tax reform with lower tax rates strong - for private individuals and for businesses.
Clinton, on the other hand, says: "The state has certain tasks, it has to open up disadvantaged opportunities and needs money for it.
That is why the tax would be increased for the rich, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure.
Trump and Clinton say almost word-for-word.
The Democratic candidate even announced the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.
State investment programs in infrastructure are classical democratic policy and are strictly rejected by the state-critical Teaparty wing of the Republicans.
At Trump, there might be party-internal discussions.
The differences in energy and climate policy are clearer.
Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and boost coal production in the USA.
Oil subsidies should also be possible in protected areas so far, he wants to terminate the Paris climate protection agreement.
Clinton, on the other hand, wants to expand renewable energy with its investment program and calls: "A country will be the supermarket of clean energy and create millions of jobs."
"It will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be us."
But not only in terms of infrastructure, but also in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart.
TPP, the transpacific trade agreement, does not want to sign either.
At the same time, however, both do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply protect American jobs better.
They are also to be paid for better, says Clinton.
The current minimum wage of $ 7.25 is a hunger wage.
It wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.
What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: The minimum wage has to go up, then he says he should not be changed.
But the great discussion of the coming months is probably more about the tax policy of the two camps.
On the one hand there is Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens, to boost growth.
Its critics insist that the budget deficit would be even greater.
On the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least the rich to demand that they pay more taxes, and their critics say: More taxes are not the solution.
