More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of the Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner clan Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US Vogue.
Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and running at Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced Thursday the news on her Instagram account.
"In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry," wrote Kendall.
The reunion of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians?), Scripted reality video showing the entire Kardashian Jenner family (with the exception of the Rob and Caitlyn problems and in the presence of the most popular showbiz uncle and producer of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest).
This is the stereotype of almost every birthday episode of a children's song (Seacrest brought the sentence "You thought we'd forgotten you," with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit on a broadcasting slot at 8am), but Kris had to let her other girls somehow participate in this publicity.
With regard to the September edition of the Vogue has certainly begun a new era of Kardashians.
Kendall's big sister, Kim, likes to hit on the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were to be seen in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league of its own.
The September edition is the most sold edition of the year for Vogue.
With a volume that is more like an image book than a fashion magazine, the output attracts a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista were 615 pages of advertising from the 832 pages of the WÃ¤lzers).
The revelation of his coverstar is so eagerly awaited that in the last two years, pictures of the magazine had leaked before the official announcement.
Women already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there were clearly more "celebrities who model" than "models that are celebrities" on the cover.
Oscar-winner and Dior-Markenbotschafterin Jennifer Lawrence was 2013 on the cover, one year after Lady Gaga had the honor.
But even with the small chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the former category, she is in good company.
These celebrities are not related to famous characters or reality stars or teenagers of today who know how to make a good snapchat video (even if it all applies to Jenner).
They are truly talented women who are distinguished in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, Jenner's success does not appeal to everyone.
With her reality TV story, Jenner's position in the fashion world was always a bit tense.
In June, the former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid and called her "the bitches of the moment."
These feelings boiled again as the news came out with the appearance of Jenner on the Vogue cover.
But to ride around on the disgust seems to have passed at the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue.
It is literally a supermodel.
She is running for Marc Jacobs.
It makes advertising for your foundation by Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective Paywall apps.
She sells her pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, she is on Reality TV, probably to see her sister Kourtney and her children.
