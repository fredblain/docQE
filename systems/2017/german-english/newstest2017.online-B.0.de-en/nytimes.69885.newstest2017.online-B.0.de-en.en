Once pushed over the price from the market, Café returns in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby cafe in Williamsburg, where you could pay only cash, which had no Wi-Fi, but served for 15 years good coffee.
Of course, by the prices from his Bedford Avenue, shopfront was crowded.
The business soap Cherie replacing verb in the summer of 2014 sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Locals mourned it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change, but I still can not believe CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel except and Verb is now a soap business."
But if New York is change, then it is also reinvention.
A revitalized verb cafe opened in Greenpoint last November, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similar unpretentious atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the old cafe, which is owner and managing director of the new cafe.
He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a customer offered him to provide funds for a new outsource, he was excited to do so, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, maintained much.
Verb used the same distributor for the Bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said that he also wanted to experiment.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnishes like capers and sautéed onions.
There are natural tear-bowls.
The café no longer serves beer, but there are fresh juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regulars.
"Many old customers were also ousted by Williamsburg," he said.
Recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, lived in Williamsburg before and visited the verb regularly.
Even after she had moved to Greenpoint, she would take the road.
After the verb had closed, she gave up coffee drinking for a while, she said.
"I realized it was the coffee and the culture that I liked," she said.
Now she is drinking coffee again, even if she ordered a Blended Chai Tea on this day instead of her usual Iced Coffe, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal has been a long-standing and faithful customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.
He went there before the work and ordered inevitably always the same.
"I came quarter past seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch, and they prepare my Everything-Bagel with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu.
Nowadays Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his Everything bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said that he had no grudge about the fact that the soap business had taken over the old business premises.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for verb with the cold-boiled coffee of the cafe as an ingredient.
"I think we'll go into their offer," Rodriguez said.
And the traditional, Polish inhabitants of Greenpoints have also accepted the cafe.
A new customer translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said he plans to exhibit it soon so his new neighbors feel welcome.
The site also has other advantages.
A local juice locale would like to fill the cold-boiled coffee into the bottle and sell it.
There is a chance that the café will expand to an adjacent building.
For many customers, a new verb is sufficient to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said he was devastated when the cafe closed.
When the new cafe opened, Whitt said the entering of the pub and ordering a new coffee felt like a homecoming.
"I had to smell that," he said.
