28-year-old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old cook, who recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in the stairs of a local shopping center.
The victim's brother said that he could not imagine anyone who wanted to harm him. "At last he went uphill again."
The corpse found in the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as the twenty-eight-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, said the San Francisco court medical department.
The San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as murder and the investigation is ongoing.
The brother of the victim, Louis Galicia, informed the ABS transmitter KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a chef in Boston, had managed his dream job as a chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokesman for the Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and devastated" about his death.
"We are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss him painfully," the speaker continued.
Our thoughts and condolences are with Frank's family and friends during this difficult time.
Louis Galicia stated that Frank initially lived in hostels, but that "things were finally going uphill for him."
"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend," Louis Garcia said.
Louis Galicia said that he could not imagine anyone who wanted to harm his younger brother.
He was a friendly person with a big heart.
Combining his style with his family has always been to cook us something for us, "said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to participate in any kind of argument.
He was the brother who swam with the stream.
"In everything that goes wrong in the world, he was this unpolished diamond that shone brightly every day," he said.
Anyone who has information on the case will be asked to call the SFPD telephone number at 415-575-4444.
