Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
This is what I am imagining in the gymnastics of women's gymnastics, and for more than one reason.
Firstly, I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant.
And secondly, this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who were inspiring for many young girls of different skin color.
The structure of this team, which is Aly Raisman, the Jewish woman, and Madison Kocian, the Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the United States.
It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
In the last four years, the number one female gymnast was an African-American.
Last year were Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2.
This shows strength.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion and America cheered.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected but masterly Gymastikroutinen.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American woman to win gold at an individual multi-match event for women.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We are experiencing the top of this sport, but it does not look like a gymnasium in the whole country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.
They are the "last five" because the next Olympics will have only four gymnasts in the team, as well as last year with Marta Karolyi as a coach.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and Turner is primarily used in private gymnasiums maintained by parents who are responsible for the training, equipment, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnasts and families).
The majority of these gymnasiums are located in affluent suburbs, which can support the business.
In these clubs the gymnasts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We must allow a more affordable and accessible gymnastics to the communities of countless young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded my own founding of 20 years.
At my events, we offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youngsters (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
In September, we will be expanding to Detroit (my hometown) to offer high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination provides life-long benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.
It is the inspiration of this team that makes thousands of young girls get interested in gymnastics and that is great.
It is so important to participate in sport, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby, and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by bringing the Olympic team-mate and thank you, so many young girls with different backgrounds motivate her to start her way to becoming healthy, strong and successful young women.
