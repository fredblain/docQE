Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it
It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, but prefer to spend their free time staring at screens has been mourned by many in the last decade.
Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.
The time on the screen was initially limited to television, then to video games, and most recently to smartphones.
Therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.
I'm referring to the Pokémon Go Madness, an app based on the characters created for the video games in the 1990s (later a series of characters, playing cards and other spin-offs).
Like many phenomena of pop culture, the interest decreased before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
Market launch in other countries was shifted by massive demand, which overloaded the servers.
Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, the players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokémon tracked with a GPS and once captured they can be "photographed" (captured on a mobile phone screen) or "captured".
A generation who played the game when she was younger, joined the delusion and jumped for the search from the sofa.
In the US, the game led to a considerable increase in the number of steps the "average" person spent every day.
Cardiogram, an app for AppleWatch that tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of launching the game, the number of tracked people who train 30 minutes every day is 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go - it just sees the raw data to increase performance.
Many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to "take 30 minutes to get off the couch" and "be active every day" have fallen on deaf ears because many public messages are boring to health and come from people who look miserable.
Nevertheless, the importance of sport can not be overstated.
People who exercise regularly exercise their chances of getting cancer or depression.
Physical exercise helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here.
But the great thing about Pokémon Go is that it makes people do something outdoors that they enjoy.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.
Some people even make new friends on the hunt.
As always, there are sullen game shooters, who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could run against a door.
What is it?
A breakthrough has occurred.
Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to do sport as this game does.
The new will lose its charm and the use will subside over time.
However, due to Pokemon's success, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with real-world action, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.
