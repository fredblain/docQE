Rain instead of shooting stars: Hope for weather improvement
The weather has made a dash for the shooting stars in the south-west of Germany in the night to Friday - but there is still hope.
The night had been badly suited to watching the sky spectacle because of clouds and rain, said the chairman of the Sternwarte Welzheim, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.
Our hope is on the night of Saturday.
The weather should be good, then we can see many shooting stars in the sky.
The star sheds are Perseids, which at 216000 kilometers per hour belong to the fastest shooting stars.
They have their name because they apparently come from the constellation Perseus, which rises in the northeast.
