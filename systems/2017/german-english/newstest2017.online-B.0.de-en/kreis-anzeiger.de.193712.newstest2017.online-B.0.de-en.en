Community, spirit, health: Singing is good for seniors
Ursel Kipp has been involved in singing her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, she studied music in her lehramt studies, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.
"Singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she says.
After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and altogether livelier, she says.
By the way, she does something good for her health and her spirit.
Singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler from the German Senior Citizens League.
Most seniors sing in chorus and share the joy of the music with like-minded people, describes Hackler.
Through the regular gathering, seniors can socialize and cultivate social contacts.
Because social and family structures often disappear in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
This experience has also been made by Ursel Kipp in her choir: "To be able to talk and to organize, to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of cooperation".
Singing can be strenuous in the positive sense, says Hackler.
For this, seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.
If you regularly ask for your lungs, you do not get so fast out of your daily routine.
Even when it comes to keeping the tone of the voice in old age, singing is an ideal hobby.
Singen has often had a very special effect on the elderly, says Ursula Lenz from the Bundesarbeitsgemeinschaft der Senioren-Organisationen.
In the older generations the singing together had a much higher priority, it was part of everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, she explains.
Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in the elderly arouses many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.
Through song texts and particularly melodies, even dementia patients recall long-standing events.
When singing, the head is also called for a special performance, explains Lenz.
At the same time, concentrating on one's own voice and on a given rhythm while adapting to the other singers is a great cognitive challenge.
Older people, who live alone, practice not only to concentrate on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition one gets through the singing in a choir, says Hackler.
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.
Self-esteem also grows through singing in a choir.
To show oneself: When I practice for a long time, I become better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens.
Good reasons to start singing, there is enough.
Anyone who wants to try out a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he means to have little talent, advises Lenz.
One does not sing alone - in 50 singing people, who is listening to it when a sound goes wrong?
In the search for the right offer, seniors have different possibilities, says Hackler.
If someone from the circle of acquaintances sings in a seniors' choir, one can simply join.
Many cities also offer surveys on the choirs in the area.
If you want to sing in a church choir, you can go directly to the church or the church head.
Many seniors choirs can also be found on the Internet.
If you do not have access to the Internet, you can ask the family, friends or neighbors for help with internet searches.
If you want to sing, you should definitely join a choir, Hackler advises.
Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that is true for all ages.
