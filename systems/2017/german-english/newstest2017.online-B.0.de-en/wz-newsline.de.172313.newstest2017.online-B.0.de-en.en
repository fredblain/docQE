What the jungle camp has with missing medals in the swimming
The former German swimmer Markus Deibler has expressed his opinion on the disappointing performance of the DSV team at Olympis.
In December 2014 he had won gold for the first time in the short-track world championships in Doha and at the same time set his first world record.
Now the former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has made a protective of his former team-mates.
"In a country where an Olympic player wins € 20,000 and a € 150,000 jungle king, no one should wonder about missing medals," the 26-year-old wrote in the night to Friday on his Facebook page.
The promotion system in the swimming sport was bad, the doping controls on the other hand very good.
This means that we can not compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look so closely at the topic of doping or even operate it.
"I am not saying that the controls should be discontinued," he continued.
If he wanted to make a comeback, Deibler would have to be reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).
This is exactly how it should be with countries.
"If you can not be controlled by WADA / FINA independent controllers for a certain time before WM / OS, you can not participate," says the Hamburg-based, who now runs an ice cream parlor.
