Donald Trump admits "huge problems" in the election campaign
The leadership of the US Republicans is plagued by massive worries, even in traditionally conservative federal states, to lose their majority.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump now gave weaknesses to his election campaign in the Republican High Court of Utah.
A rare moment in which the multitillionaire, who is usually cocky and self-assured, expressed some kind of concern, as correspondents reported.
After throwing out 16 rivals within his own Republican camp, the doubts about his success in the fight for the White House are growing.
"We have tremendous problems in Utah," said Trump before evangelical Christians, asking for support in important states like Ohio, Florida, or Virginia.
According to him, false reports of his candidacy were due, he resumed his well-known media scolding.
Republican fortresses wiggle
Utah is usually a safe bank for the Republicans.
According to a survey conducted by SurveyUSA in June, Trump and his competitor were equated by the Democrats, Hillary Clinton.
Other institutions see Trump ahead, but not with the distance that is common to Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also at risk.
In an interview with CNBC, Trump responded to the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton's advance: "Just as I've done so far."
And postponed afterwards: this will either be "successful" or I will make a very very nice, long vacation ".
He did nothing else than "tell the truth".
If, in the end, he did not succeed for political reasons, Trump continued.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the party Trump has threatened to cancel funds in support of his election campaign should he can not present better survey results.
Instead, the Republicans' candidates for the congress would be more involved.
