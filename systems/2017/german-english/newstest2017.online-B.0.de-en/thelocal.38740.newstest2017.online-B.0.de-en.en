Woman crossing presumed suicide on Swiss highway
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police call witnesses after a woman was crossed on a highway in the early morning hours on a presumed suicide of several vehicles.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.
A woman lay down in the dark "in an act of despair" and were hit by several cars, the police said in Vaud.
It is obvious that a Swiss woman, aged 49, who was crossed by several vehicles, including a truck, herself wanted to kill herself.
She still died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, the police said, calling on them and any witnesses of the incident to report.
An investigation was opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed.
Was a clash avoidable?
This is something the prosecutor must decide, "Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not held responsible.
In each of the two cases - where a person was running on the highway in the dark - it was decided that the car drivers would not have to assume that a pedestrian would run on the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper said.
Last year, a policewoman was released from negligent killing after she had killed and killed a man who was staying one night on the A1 near Payerne in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and became unconscious on the street, the court heard.
The court noted that the policewoman - who had responded to an emergency call - was driving in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a "completely exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
