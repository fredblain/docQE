Assistants' strikes: demands for new labor measures
Representatives of the medical assistants have called on their trade union to approve new labor measures in their disputes regarding a new treaty.
The British Medical Association's (JDC) Junior Doctors Committee (BMA) has called on its entire Council to approve more work measures from the beginning of September.
The JDC said that ministers had neglected to address concerns about the Treaty.
In July, medical assistants and medical students voted on the rejection of a contract, which was agreed with the BMA.
He was rejected by 58% of his members, who voted in the elections.
In a letter to the members, which was published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government had remained "persistently calm" to problems, which led to the contract being rejected.
She said, "In view of this, the JDC Board has voted to completely reject the proposed new treaty and to request official renegotiations for all your concerns."
In response to the silence of the government, the JDC Board has today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing program of escalating workflights, which begins in early September.
The disputes led to the fact that medical assistants were striking six times this year, the first total failures in the history of the NHS.
The head of the BMA's assistant physician Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed terms of the contract, which had been recommended by the BMA.
He informed BMA members during the meetings, which were held before the vote by 54,000 assistants and medical students, that the contract should be advantageous and accepted.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for doctors in England would be compulsorily introduced.
