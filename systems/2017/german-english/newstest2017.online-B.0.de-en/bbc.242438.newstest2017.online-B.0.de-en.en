Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson fired after beating producers
Gibson was involved last month in a physical controversy on the set of the series in Los Angeles.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which are producing the series, announced their dismissal in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played the special agent Aaron Hotchner, publicly apologized on Thursday before announcing his dismissal.
At the set, there were artistic differences and differences of opinion.
I regret the incident, "he said in a statement.
Details of how the character of Gibsons from the series, following a team of FBI agents, will be released, are expected to be released later, according to the ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios opinion.
The 54-year-old, who previously played in the sitcom Dharma & Greg, had been there since the first season of the series in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds, and I've been collecting all my heart blood for the past twelve years," Gibson said in a statement released on Friday.
I was hoping to be there until the end, but it will not be possible anymore.
I would like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and, above all, the best fans you can wish for a show.
The planned broadcast of the twelfth season is scheduled for September 28th.
