Amidst the rage of the Olympics, the Zen of the trampoline
Wherever you are, whatever time it is, it is the Olympic Games.
The events in Rio de Janeiro are a constant and inevitable one, a fast-paced relay race between competition and aspirations.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself were a burning stick, which is passed from the crossbow gun to the swimmer to the gymnast to the triathlete.
You can not turn on the TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbors' conversation in the queue, without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the quarrel between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there is Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is part of the Olympic Games for the first time, and a swarm of women with dimples, could well have been among these well-known names broadcast at prime time by sponsors and well-being TV advertisements if he were a swimmer, gymnast, or even fencer.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is struggling for gold in the Olympic trampolines.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event alike.
Further from the center, partly in shadow are the sports, which are not generally accepted: air gun shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always have the breast-float and may it be long.
But if I could make modest arguments for my particular favorite, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although trampolining has been an Olympic event since 2000 when it debuted in Sydney, it has been so scantily perceived for the last 16 years that many of whom I interviewed did not know that it was an Olympics sport at all.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the USA sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in trampolines, and by 2012 an athlete has made it to the finals.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women to share.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
The trampoline jumping has a certain outsider charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for a clown school than for the Olympics for the unsupervised ear.
At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert but only a ground-based enthusiast.
It has humorous potential - the cartooning trembling of its never-ending impact - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that essentially unite it.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means "jumpboard."
Emerging winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and have a series of falling movements (turning, pikes and somersaults) before they land on their feet.
They are rated according to official Olympic program after execution, difficulty and "flight time".
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.
The most common olympic vector is straight.
In their pursuit of gold, medalists have to go farther, faster, up and over, sometimes up to the goal, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground.
They hunt not only the target line or the exit wall, but also another sarcastic goal in television broadcasting: the world or the Olympic record.
The purposeful pursuit is classy, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to stir even a spectator to tears.
But it is also what I feel when watching these games as a bit tiring.
The trampoline offers an Atempause.
The vector of the trampoline pringer is up.
A forward movement is not the goal.
He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless as an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
Here, too, there is competition, not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no vaulting into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant elimination of time and power.
It is as Zen as competition in the Olympics can be.
Women's qualification and finals will take place on Friday afternoon, streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time, and the men's on Saturday, also at 13.00.
NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00.
In the midst of the Olympic mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is generally troubled.
If the raising of consciousness can only be achieved by the assertion and the objectification of male athletes - as the male US gymnasts according to The Wall Street Journal recently suggested - then Mr. Dooley expects his air-confronting, new fan base.
