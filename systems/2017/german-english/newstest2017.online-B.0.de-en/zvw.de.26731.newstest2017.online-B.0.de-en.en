Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a new refugee commissioner
Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organization.
She is also a social worker.
Since July, Annika Deuschle has been the refugee commissioner for Urbach.
The social pedagogue supports the Achim Grockenberger administration team.
It sees itself as a contact for all stakeholders: refugees, work group refugee aid, administration, authorities and who else is involved.
Regine Kunde from the work circle indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful, that Deuschle is now there, the egg laying wool milk, which is mainly a problem.
Thus, a few - less mocking than the many desired areas of the problem - had meant, as the administration wanted to advertise the position.
An administrative expert with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-time experience in the field of social work, was looking for an egg-laying woolen milkau.
But administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deuschle.
Above all, it is about organization, working with people on the ground and also behind the scenes, as well as networking activities.
The 31-year-old has been around for six weeks.
It has limited a 50 per cent point to three years.
"It was high time," says Regine Kunde, that Annika Deuschle supports honorary and full-time actors.
There are big and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems.
Soon there will be new containers in the Wasenstraße
A serious problem has been finding homes for the follow-up refugees who have been recognized for some time.
The local authorities are responsible for the connection.
They must place the refugees in their own or rented premises.
The costs of building, renting or renovating these accommodations must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
Responsibility changes from Landratsamt to municipalities and job centers.
Problem: There are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been very difficult for some time.
De facto, the administration does not find any private dwellings.
It does not work so far, but one is dependent on private apartments, according to Deuschle.
Therefore, municipal housing must be upgraded as it is so beautiful.
So soon new containers will be set up in the Wasenstraße.
But only with apartments is it not done.
Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to a permanent place, there are placements, training places, school places, one-euro jobs and assistance for refugees and migrants who have to be found or established.
"More places would be good," reports Regine Kunde.
Many work in the construction yard or help housemasters, do non-profit work - and that motivates and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports.
It hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external effect.
This is "no occupational therapy".
But work does not just mean work.
The day needs a firm structure, says Deuschle and customer.
People would have to develop a sense of belonging.
So it needs such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
So here, too, administration and honorary officials are taking part.
It is central that the refugees feel that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.
The long duration of the proceedings is a problem.
They have to explain to the refugees that it is just taking time and that they can bridge the time meaningfully, for example with language courses.
Anyone who develops the feeling that he can not help anyone in Urbach, should not work and be useless, will never integrate.
The clear majority is motivated.
But there are also problems, says the customer, "people who do not mind." The work of Deuschle and the customer is therefore always to motivate others.
This is already a "mammoth task".
A difficult question: do they have fear of radicalization after the recent occurrences, even in a small municipality like Urbach?
"No," says Regine customer clearly, "what may be called naive", but a residual risk can not and does not exclude it.
The helpers were already sensitized.
These incidents are also the subject of refugees.
They are afraid that the assassin will bring them completely into disrepute.
"They want to show that they have nothing to do with it," Regine says.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
So the main and honorary officials have to look for activities on the ground and in the region.
They always have in the background that a new blow to refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.
Does Germany need an upper limit?
To answer this question clearly, the policy shies.
Actually, it is unfair to hire helpers on the ground.
"In Urbach, we have not yet arrived where we are going," says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would relax the location.
Reginekunde also makes it clear that the Urbacher are already fully utilized to integrate the existing people sensibly.
At present there are about 100 people, mainly young men.
But when people are in need, they need help, both women agree.
The political world situation is so complicated, since there are no simple answers.
