Baden-Wuerttemberg: police determined after rocker attack on snack
After an attack on an Ulmer snack, the police investigated six suspects from the Rockermilieu because of a serious country break.
The police reported on Friday that they had been given evidence and drugs in the course of searches.
Around 20 masked men of a rocker-like grouping had thrown bottles and stones against the window pane of a snack in July.
After that, they attacked two guests and injured one easily.
Then they fled.
At the snack bar and on the adjoining building a damage of 10000 euros was incurred.
According to the investigators, there is a dispute in the Ulm Rockermilieu between a Kurdish and a Turkish passage.
