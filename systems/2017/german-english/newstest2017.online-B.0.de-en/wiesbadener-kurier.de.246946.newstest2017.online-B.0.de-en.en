Airline is not liable: crash on passenger bridge
An airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
According to Oberlandesgericht DÃ¼sseldorf (Ref .: 18 U 124/14), liability is only conceivable for hazards typical of air transport.
The plaintiff had broken a knee-joint during the fall.
However, the accident could have happened anywhere - it was a general risk to life, according to the court.
The airline did not have to pay the man any damages.
