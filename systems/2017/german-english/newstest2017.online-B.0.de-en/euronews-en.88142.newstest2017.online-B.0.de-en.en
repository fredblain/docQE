London schoolgirl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British school girls who left London last year to join the IS, reportedly died in Syria.
The lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said that her family learned a few weeks ago of her death in Raqqa, Syria.
It was believed that she was killed by a Russian air raid in Raqqa, the bulwark of the group in the country, ITV News reported Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died shortly after she planned to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
"One can only hope that the only good is - as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to keep people from ever making that decision," said Akunjee.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from the East of London boarded a plane to Turkey and then boarded a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told that she had married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months.
