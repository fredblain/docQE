Patrick Roy returns as a coach of the avalanche
Patrick Roy resigned as a Colorado Avalanche coach and vice president of hockey operations on Thursday, leading to too little co-determination in the team's decision-making process.
Alternate President / General Manager of Colorado Joe Sakic confirmed this decision, noting that the club will immediately look for a new coach.
"In the last three years, I have fulfilled my duties as Cheftrainer and Vice President of Hockey Operations of the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," said 50-year-old Roy in an opinion.
In the course of the summer, I have been thinking a lot about how I could improve this team, to give it more depth, to take it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the coach's vision and vice president of hockey operations must be perfectly aligned with the organization.
It must also have a right of co-determination in decisions which influence the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me today about this decision," said Sakic.
We appreciate all that he has done for our organization and wish him the best for the future.
Roy was named the best coach of the league during his debut season at the Avalanches 2013-14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards.
He led the club to 112 points and first place in Central Vision, but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the playoffs of Minnesota and missed the post-season in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 mark in the 2015-16 season and fell five points behind the Wild for a second wildcard spot in the Western Conference.
As the Hall of Fame goalie, Roy won four Stanley Cups - two pieces with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
