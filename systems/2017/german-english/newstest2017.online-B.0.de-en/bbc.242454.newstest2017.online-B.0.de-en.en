Puzzles about fish that landed in garden in Banff
A resident of Banff called for help identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks the 75 fish could be sand eels spit out from a fountain.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, published on Periscope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two inch long fish.
