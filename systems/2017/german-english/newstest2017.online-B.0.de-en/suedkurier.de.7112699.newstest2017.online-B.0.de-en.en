Berlin / Schwerin: Survey before country elections: SPD and CDU lose
In the forthcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (September 4) and Berlin (September 18), considerable losses are expected for the SPD and CDU government departments.
This was the result of representative surveys conducted by the opinion research institute INSA for the "Bild" -Zeitung (Friday).
While the red-black government coalition in the north could be just a little further, this is not possible according to the polls in Berlin.
In both states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would thus have a good chance of continuing to head the government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD fell from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
According to the poll, the party would therefore be just ahead of the CDU, which could again reach 23 percent.
The third place is controversial between the left and the AfD.
The left would come to 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented for the first time with 19 percent in the state parliament.
Despite the slight losses, the Greens returned to the Schwerin Landtag with 6 percent (previously 8.7 percent).
NPD and FDP would not be represented in the state parliament with 3 per cent each.
According to the poll, the SPD would only reach 23 per cent (election 2011: 28.3 per cent) in the Berlin parliamentary elections.
The CDU only reached 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
It would thus still be behind the Greens with 19 per cent (2011: 17.6 per cent), but before the left with 15 per cent (previously 11.7 per cent).
At 14 percent, the AfD would be represented for the first time in the House of Representatives.
With 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, but the pirates, contrary to 2011, would miss the entry.
