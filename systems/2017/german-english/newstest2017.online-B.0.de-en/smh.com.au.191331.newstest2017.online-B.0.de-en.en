Donald Trump's election campaign prosecuted after employees allegedly pulled gun
New York: Donald Trumps's campaign has been prosecuted for allegedly inaction after she was told that her North Carolina campaign leader had shot a gun at an employee in February while she was in a jeep in February.
The incident is described in a prosecution filed on Wednesday in the county court of Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in that state.
Bordini stated that he had waited months before the matter would be settled internally before he realized that "that would not happen."
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, "pulled a pistol, put his right-hand index finger on the trigger, and rammed the barrel in Vincent's knee-throat," Bordini stated in his accusation.
After complaining to local and regional campaign leaders, Bordini noted that at least four others had already had the same experience with Phillip, he stated in the complaint.
"Weapons do not have to be fired to inflict damage," Bordini said.
The prosecution comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused a turmoil when he told a North Carolina human being that the "Secondary People" gunmen and weapons friends should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton were to be elected and appointed judges.
Trumps campaign made it clear that the media had torn out his words and that he would not incite violence.
Bordinis complaint requires damages from the campaign for the violation of due diligence and from Philip for personal injury and permanent mental damage.
Trumps press contestant Hope Hicks could not be reached for an opinion.
Attempts to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local news service in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer a campaign worker.
On calls to his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, was not responded.
The Republican Presidential Candidate Donald Trump has hitherto conducted a controversial campaign.
The procedure is Bordini by Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
