Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
E-mail and Internet in Slow Motion: Nokia Communicator came onto the market 20 years ago.
The successors dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it was not good in the hand.
On the contrary, it was quite chunky.
The built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which would today be enough for about two high resolution self-help.
An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" arrived exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, in the shops - and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euro lovers can buy the devices still on the Internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet.
Twenty years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair Cebit in Hanover as "office in the Western pocket format".
In fact, the new mobile phone could be a lot for then standards: SMS and emails could be sent and received, even by fax the communicator could be reached.
Even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browser, although tormenting slow.
A pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be opened like a laptop.
Then found a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.
Pretty proud was the price: 2700 D-Mark, thus about 1400 euro.
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany in 2015 was 392 euros.
No one could have guessed in August 1996 that the communicator would be the beginning of the smartphone era.
Since then everything has changed.
The smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.
The mobile phone division of the Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster, was eventually sold to Microsoft and handled.
The market now dominate providers, which all came much later than Nokia.
To be online always and everywhere, this is everyday life for a lot of people.
In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.
It sold approximately 1.4 billion units, and Samsung and Apple alone account for 555 million units.
Worldwide sales of the devices are around 400 billion euros.
In addition, the well-running business of the numerous app providers and the telecommunication companies.
Around the smartphone, a whole industry has emerged.
The decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007, then Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced on the Mac-World the introduction of the iPhones.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a telephone and an Internet communicator, all easy to use via touch screen.
The triumphal procession of Apple began, still today the iPhone is the most important product of the group.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who dominated the market, had the look.
They finally disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.
The saying now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung.
The smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention.
On average, today every German looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone.
"We must all learn to put the smartphone away," said Janina Kugel, responsible for personnel at Siemens.
Permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time.
