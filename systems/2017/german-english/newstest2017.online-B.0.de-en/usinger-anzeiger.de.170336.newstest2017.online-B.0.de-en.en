A controversial baseball star is leaving
The tears ran faster with Alex Rodriguez than the US baseball star in base days from base to base.
After his emotional resignation announcement, the 41-year-old pro will be wearing the jersey of his New York Yankees for the last time against the Tampa Bay Rays.
"I love this game and this team."
"I say 'Goodbye' to both," said the 14-time all-star game participant of Major League Baseball (MLB).
Three times, Rodriguez was voted the most valuable player in the league, in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees.
His signing under a ten-year contract has earned him $ 27 million annually since 2007.
Until the end of the contract on December 31, 2017, he will act as advisor and youth coaching agent at full salary.
As a player, it paid Rodriguez a long time with performance.
He made some milestones with 696 homers, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("Runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and since 2005 the Yankees.
With Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two other baseball players show similar values in the most important stats.
But the 41-year-old should not be accepted into the hall of fame of the baseball.
Because Rodriguez, nicknamed "A-Rod", was so successful in the field, his controversy is out of place.
Already in 2009, the superstar at "ESPN" gave up to have forbidden steroids between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013 he was closed for 211 games by the end of 2014 due to a complication in the biogenesis scandal.
Rodriguez is considered to be the main suspect for years to have received an anti-aging clinic in South Florida.
After a legal dispute the lock was reduced to 162 encounters.
"The league could have done me a favor for the year 2014, because I've been playing for 20 years without a break," said Rodriguez at the time, smugly.
Even his farewell days do not run silently.
While many baseball legends once again get the big stage in their last games, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench.
"My job does not include a farewell tour."
"My job involves trying to win every game," said Yankees coach Joe Girardi.
After all, Rodriguez, who was married to the actress Cameron Diaz and is credited with the pop star Madonna and the actress Kate Hudson, received sympathy from the fans of the Yankee arch rival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod," the supporters sang in the 4: 9 defeat against the Rodriguez team.
