Here comes the Enforcement Trailer
Germany's racers have to adapt to the next generation of speedometers: New flash units are being tested in different federal states, including in Hesse and Brandenburg, which are supposed to transfer tempo faders particularly effectively.
The futuristic Enforcement trailers of the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used, for example, at major areas of accidents where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, at motorway construction sites or temporary bridges with temporary tempolimit, there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide a stationary speed camera for speed limitation.
However, a permanent mobile structure can be too dangerous or complicated.
The Enforcement Trailer is self-sufficient: its battery keeps five days with continuous measuring operation, the case data is transferred encrypted over a modem.
With laser measurement technology, all vehicles can also be recorded simultaneously over several tracks.
Variable speed limits as well as transit restrictions by time, lane and vehicle class can also be monitored.
In the high state you can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with any car with trailer coupling.
So that it is not simply stolen, it is lowered in the measuring mode, so that the wheels in the armored and by the way also shuffle-safe outer cover disappear.
In addition, a built-in alarm system to protect the speed camera from vandalism.
Since 2015, the trailer has been tested and used in several federal states, according to Vitronic.
Also foreign authorities are flashing with the new technology: Recently, France has ordered 100 pieces, after an order of 150 pieces last year.
