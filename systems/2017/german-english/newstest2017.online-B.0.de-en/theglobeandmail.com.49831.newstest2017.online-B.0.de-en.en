Adblock Plus, Facebook in the "cat and mouse game" regarding ad blocking
For companies that earn money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to bypass ad blocking, a "cat and mouse game" equal.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad blockages on its desktop, AdblockPlus released a blog post stating that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising on the social network.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the coding for its advertisements to make it difficult to recognize ad blockages to determine which part of the page is advertising.
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.
In a blog post, the spokesman for Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this sort of back-and-forth battle between the ad-blocking open source community and the evaders has been ongoing since the invention of ad blockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of how worrying ad blockers have become for the industry.
According to a study conducted last year by Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people use ad blockers around the world, nearly four times as much as 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook through their mobile devices, mobile advertising makes up 84 percent of Facebook's advertising revenue.
The company has focused on ad blockers on desktop PCs because mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a spokesman said.
Advertising on desktop PCs accounts for a large portion of the revenue, making Facebook the investment of such a step as worthwhile.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update its "ads preference tool" to give people more control over them targeted advertising.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters would be worrying because they would also block content on the site that is not advertising.
"This is not a positive experience for users, so we are planning to address the problem," a Facebook spokesman said in an e-mail message.
Ad blockers are a dull means, so instead we've focused on developer tools like Ad Preferences to put more control in the hands of people.
