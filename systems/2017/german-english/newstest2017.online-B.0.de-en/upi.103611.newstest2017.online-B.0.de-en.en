North sea workers are again taking up talks, and are striking out
The labor battles regarding the compensation for North Sea workers are being suspended as all the parties are putting themselves to the table for a new round of talks, said negotiators.
Strikes against the oilfield service provider Wood Group were carried out sporadically on platforms in the North Sea, operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Woodgroup, as well as Unite and RMT unions, can confirm that we have agreed to restart the settlement process of the current dispute," says a joint statement.
We will hold a few full-day meetings over the next few weeks, which will begin early next year to tackle the problems again.
The unions said their last strike, the first in over 25 years, is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group has reduced the rates to its contractors in the North Sea by about 9 percent this year due to negative market pressure.
The company's rate cut follows a 10 percent decline for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said that additional cuts give the company the space it needs to get through the market downturn.
Shell has dismissed thousands of people for its part, announcing plans to abandon its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries, as it is streamlining its business activities as a result of its merging with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of the lower crude oil prices, an economic situation that had been reinforced by the decision of the British in June to leave the European Union.
Scottish parliamentarian Dave Anderson met with workers leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest disputes that have taken place in the North Sea since a generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for many and not just a few," he said in a statement.
2016, less than $ 1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion over the past five years are expected.
