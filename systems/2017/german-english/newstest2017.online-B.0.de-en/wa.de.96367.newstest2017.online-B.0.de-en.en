Olympia 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
Caught: Due to a positive doping test, weightlifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland can not start in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.
An accomplished athlete would have won almost a medal.
Before the seventh day of the competition, the first official doping events became known to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000 meter obstacle runner Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were positively tested and excluded in Brazil - just before the start of the already critically acclaimed track and field athletics competitions, these news come untimely.
The diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, which is used as a masking agent for dopant substances, was already demonstrated by Chen last Sunday.
The International Court of Sports Court CAS confirmed their exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old had finished fourth in the final over 100 m butterfly, only 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.
On Friday Chen would have participated in the preliminaries over 50 m of free time.
Chen has applied to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for the opening of the B-sample and a hearing.
The national association takes the matter "very seriously and demands full cooperation from Chen," Xinhua quoted from a statement: "We will work with the International Court of Justice, CAS, and will accept the verdict."
For the first time in history, the CAS is no longer responsible for the sanctioning of athletes with positive cases.
Also on the night of Rio, the news about the positive rehearsal at Danekowa seeped through, the 33-year-old went thus even on the offensive.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive." This was "an incredible shock," she told the Bulgarian TV station BNT.
She is innocent, "the only explanation could be food supplements," explained the Leichtathletin.
According to the report, the prohibited substance is to be the blood doping agent EPO.
Danekowa has been provisionally suspended, according to BNT, the B-sample has already been positive.
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bojko Borissov spoke up immediately with criticism of the athlete.
"I do not understand why the athletes do not draw the right conclusions," he said, "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."
For example, all weightlifters from the nation who are chronically doping can not participate in Rio.
The event "Adrian Zielinski" was announced on Friday and the London Olympian winner in the class of up to 85 kg was tested three days earlier for the anabolic steroid Nandrolone, just like his brother Tomasz.
Both dispute the intake, but both may not start in the class up to 94 kg.
Before the start of the athletes, the Danekowa case is another major blow to the reputation of the entire sport.
The IAAF World Federation had banned the entire Russian team except for one exception for systematic doping, and the Kenyan runners-up race also produced numerous bad news in Rio.
In the swim sport, the previous offense in China had also caused violent clashes between the athletes.
Thus Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympian Sun Yang harshly.
"Sun Yang pisses purple."
"If I see the podium over 200 m of free-range, I will surrender," said Lacourt on French radio.
Sun was also at the center of an argument with the Australian Mack Horton.
"I have no time and no respect for doping scammers," he said.
Sun had been tested positively for the stimulant trimetazidine at the Chinese championships in 2014, but had only a three-month suspension.
