How to protect yourself with Krav Maga
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a bit safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a Grandmaster of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from behind, this video will show you how to turn the tables for your robber.
If you approach them from behind, you should turn around first so that you can see your attacker and "get out of the shot," says Mizrachi.
Then grab the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder before you hit it with your free elbow in the face.
Then strike him with the knee in the groin and twist the weapon out of his hands as the attacker collapses in pain. Hit him with the barrel in the face and move backwards while they are pointing the gun at him.
For attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the firing line, grab the weapon and twist it so that the attacker can not shoot.
At the same time, relocate the weight to the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then twist the gun out of its handle before moving backward and directing the gun toward him.
Sounds difficult?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi is doing it.
But remember that if you are not a Krav Maga Grandmaster, it is safest to hand over your money to a robbery.
