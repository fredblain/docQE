City Council decides unanimously: No kiosk building on the St. Goarer Rheinufer
Normally the St. Goarer investment projects by tradesmen with Kusshand accept - the retail trade in the core city is considered to be significantly expandable.
However, the city council now rejected the application for the construction of a sales center on the banks of the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rheinbalkon under construction.
"In principle, we welcome new traders, but this kiosk does not fit into this exposed location on the banks of the Rhine," said Michael Hubrath for the CDU Group.
