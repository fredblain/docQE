Buyers in Primark indignant about woman who tried shamelessly underwear in the shop
The buyers did not know where to look when a woman took off her clothes in the middle of a primark to try underwear.
In order to aggravate the situation, she looked as she saw it, pulled it out and put it back into the shelf.
She continued to rummage through and tried four pairs of underwear in a store at the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone.

A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was at the same time in the store, said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear, "she dressed again and left the shop without buying anything."
She said, "People could not believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the sales floor, she took a pair of pantyhose out of the display, took off her own tights and trousers and tried them on.
"She did not even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, cheeky like Oskar."
"Everyone stared as she took off the underpants, which she obviously did not like, as she put them back on the shelf."
She repeated it with three more underpants, before she finally decided that she did not like, dressed again and went out.
"She did not seem to mind watching anyone-or thinking about the person who might buy the underwear she'd tried on."
Mrs. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said, "How disgusting to think that someone taking home pants with another person who was not washed and who was not washed."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms Davidson added, "As I've noticed, the employees have tried to pull the garments out of the sale after they went - which is just as good."
"I would hate to go home with a new pair of underpants and find out that another woman was wearing them and going out again and not washing them."
A spokesman from Primark said, "Primark is aware of the incident that happened in our branch in Folkstone on Tuesday, August 9."
All eligible products were withdrawn from the sale.
