The military administration distorts ISIS secret service information, establishes the Congress committee
United States Central Command militants changed news intelligence to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic state in Iraq and Syria than would have permitted the actual conditions on the ground, a Congressional Review Committee reported in a Thursday report.
The preliminary report, prepared by a Task Force of the Republican members of the Armed Forces Committee, the Secret Service Commission, and the Wehrbud Commander, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic state.
The Central Command, or Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"News-related information typically typed by high-ranking Centcom commanders typically drew a more positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism than would have allowed the actual conditions on the ground, and were more positive than the analysis of other news services," a newspaper article quoted.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyzes are presented to our political leaders," noted Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The management errors in Centcom reach to the highest point of the organization.
The ten-page report shows in detail consistent problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyzes of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi armed forces.
Although there is no direct evidence that government leaders under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts were exposed to pressure from their superiors to draw a more optimistic picture of the Islamic state's threat, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before the Congress were much more positive than the facts," the report noted.
For example, a Centcom official publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic state.
"After months of investigation, so much is clear," said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in an opinion.
From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the Central Command leaders changed the intelligence reports to reduce the risk of ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans launched the task force after they were told that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic state.
The report, published on Thursday, will be completed by more detailed findings, while the investigation will continue.
In addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports are underway by the General Engineer of the Ministry of Defense.
Democratic members of the intelligence community published their own findings on Thursday, which coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"In 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly limited process for the preparation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," the top-ranking Democrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Schiff, announced in an opinion.
This process, Mr. Schiff said, "delayed the publication of news reports," harmed the morale among analysts, and "gave too little space for dissent."
But Mr Schiff and the Democrats said they had not found any evidence of White House intervention by the Centcom analysts regarding a "particular political opinion".
The preliminary results of the congressional investigations were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast".
Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon's General Investigator, who were received after complaints from Centcom analysts.
Patrick Evans, a press officer of the Pentagon, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on any reports from the Congress while the investigator's investigations were still in progress.
But he also stated that "experts sometimes have divergent opinions about the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense."
The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful American-led air campaign in Iraq and Syria (a claim now made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).
However, last year's accusations have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crises.
The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic state is reminiscent of more than ten years ago, when a centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document on how the then government under George W. Bush opposed the recommendations of many analysts to a small occupation group in Iraq and little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the insurrection against the current coverage of the Islamic state.
Last year, according to government officials, the team around Mr. Hooker notes that, contrary to the government's statements, the air raids against the Islamic state's refineries had no significant impact on the financial position of the terrorist group because these provisional refineries were commissioned to sell oil on the black market.
This finding, however, was not published, the Times reported in September.
Centcom's former commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the Legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced at the Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
