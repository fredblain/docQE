This was the moment when frightened tourists started panicking after a low-flying jet fell over a full beach.
Dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft flew over the sunsets almost on the beach in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers jumped on their feet as they began to worry about the noise of jet engines without first seeing what was passing through the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many vacationers who posted videos of the dramatic fly-by in the social media, said, "It really flew twice very deeply and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash."
Nuno Arroja added, "I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was falling down on me."

The Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast, flying so low that this was the only way to recognize them.
The spokesman said that due to the poor visibility, the jet flew a bit deeper than usual due to nearby fires, but the air forces insisted that the safety was never compromised at all.
This summer, fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland, where four people died on the island of Madeira.
