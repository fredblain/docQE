Reid says Clinton will remain a candidate for the Supreme Court in the event of an election victory at Garland
Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
The Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland's confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
The majority leader in Senate Mitch McConnell is of the opinion that the next president will nominate the successor of the late Judge to the Supreme Court, Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expected Clinton to select Garland "with a certain degree of certainty".
A spokeswoman from Reid later said that he had not yet talked to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland and he speculated.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team would not worry about a new candidate.
Garland is the highest judge for the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Raid said Republicans blocked the Garlands nomination, were lackeys and helpers of Republican Presidential Candidate Donald Trump.
He also noted that Donald Trump was unsuitable for the presidency.
