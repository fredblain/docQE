Constitutions are constantly being made in the name of terrorism.
After the latest attacks, Minister of the Interior de Maizière now presents a thick security package.
But what does a toleration status have to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say to all this?
Thomas de Maizière gives the reconciler.
All his proposals are "politically reasonable" to the coalition partner, says the Federal Minister of the Interior at the presentation of his new security package.
They do not overwhelm anyone.
Other, wider points were initially discussed within the parties.
I also participate in it.
As interior minister, however, he was concerned with results and a "achievable consensus" within the coalition.
De Maizière, after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, let a little time pass before he presented his conclusions on security in the Republic.
But they are all the more extensive.
Some are already known, announced, targeted: That a new security authority should take care of the cracking of encrypted communication is not new.
Nor is the fact that Germany has to implement several EU provisions on passenger data and arms legislation.
The call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is also not surprising.
In part, de Maizière is launching a second run for proposals that the SPD has so far failed to do: he wants to punish sympathy for terrorist groups and jihadists with dual citizenship unbutton the German passport.
"These will be difficult points for the SPD," admits the CDU man.
He considers this to be reasonable and does not call for anything that does not have any chances with the coalition partner anyway.
De Maizière also presents a few new ideas.
They have a part in themselves: they are planning rapid procedures for deportations and more possibilities for the imprisonment of people before deportation.
Refugees who are targeted in the country should first check their smartphones and reveal social media accounts for a security check.
In the case of toleration for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some worse than before - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately discard their papers in order to conceal their identity.
Some of this is politically and legally delicate.
There are also things that are still unsung and leave questions open.
And on some points - in the case of the uneven treatment of the tolerated, for example - the question arises: What actually has to do with security and terror?
Yes, de Maizière says it is important to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terror.
But it can not be denied that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people were worried about security because of the high numbers of refugees.
And things that people were deeply concerned about could not be excluded even in election times.
The internal security is enormously in the focus.
Only the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The uncertainty is great.
And yes, there are election campaigns.
The Union and the SPD are therefore becoming more and more active in the area of internal security.
In the past few days, the two parties have been high.
Only a nasty dispute over the equipment of the federal police, then on a security policy collection of some interior ministers of the interior, in which the heads of departments also demand a Burka ban and a departure from the dual citizenship.
De Maizière is also concerned here with conciliatory tones.
He did not think anything of a departure from the double pass.
We have pacified the discussion in Germany.
Reopening it is not useful.
And in the case of a Burka ban, he had constitutional concerns.
Whether his own package at all corners is constitutionally determined and whether it is actually "reasonable" for the coalition partner, must first show.
There is a lot in it, which could cause dispute.
But the SPD is also currently trying to shape the issue of internal security.
"The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security", says Sigmar Gabriel.
