Frankfurt is benefiting from Brexit
As a result, the City of the Main has the best chances to attract jobs and companies from London, in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg.
"It is very likely that Frankfurt will profit most from the Brexit vote," says Michael Voigtländer, head of the financial services and real estate markets of the IW.
After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether financial institutions are allowed to continue to operate London financial transactions throughout the EU.
For the so-called EU passport, they have been granted authorization in Great Britain.
This is being used by large US banks.
Several banks have already announced to relocate jobs.
The lobbying association "Frankfurt Main Finance" expects 10000 new jobs on the Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, according to the IW, the seat of the European Central Bank (ECB), which is responsible for the monetary policy and supervision of the largest eurozone banks, and other important authorities such as the European insurance supervisory authority EIOPA and the ESRB Risk Board.
Although the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is based in Paris, it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.
"The proximity to the bank is important for banks, as they can communicate directly with the supervisor," says IW-Professor Voigtländer.
Although Luxembourg is home to a large fund sector, it is worse off than infrastructure in Dublin.
Thanks to the large airport, Frankfurt is much easier to reach.
The city also scored points with easily available commercial properties.
"In Paris it is not so easy to find free high-quality offices," says Voigtländer.
On the Seine, rents for first class commercial properties are 50 percent higher than on the Main.
Frankfurt also offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime.
Mercer's ranking was ranked number seven, Luxembourg ranked 19th, Dublin ranked 33th and Paris 37th.
Even if quality of life is a question of preferences: "With its already strong position as financial center for the European single market, Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors," concludes the IW.
Despite the Brexit vote, London will remain the most important financial center in Europe, according to economic researchers.
This is also reflected by the economic situation. According to the Landesbank Helaba, around 144,000 people were employed in the banking sector at the end of 2015, while in Frankfurt they were 62500.
