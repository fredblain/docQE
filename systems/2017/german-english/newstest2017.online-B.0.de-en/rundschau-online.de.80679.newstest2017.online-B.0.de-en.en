Witnesses sought: beverage market in Waldbröl invaded
A robbery attack was committed on Thursday night to the drink market of Rewe XXL at the Waldbröler Gerberstrasse.
Under the guise of a firearm, three dark-haired persons, who had masked their faces, demanded cash from the employee of the drink market and then escaped on foot and then presumably with a silver-colored VW Golf.
The police do not tell how much money was taken.
The perpetrators should have been between 1.60 and 1.70 meters large, thus relatively small.
The drink market is directly accessible from the parking area of the Rewe market and is difficult to see.
After the attack, the perpetrators had to run in the direction of Gerberstrasse, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg, and had fled from the car park opposite the car park entrance with the silver-colored car, possibly in the direction of B 256 (Schladernring).
Anyone who has made observations at the time of the crime (around 7:45 pm) in connection with the robbery is to report urgently to the police.
