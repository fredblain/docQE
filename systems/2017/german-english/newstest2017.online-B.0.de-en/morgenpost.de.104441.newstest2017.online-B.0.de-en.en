Post is entering the trade with electric transporters
An electric delivery vehicle of Deutsche Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the vehicle is evidently great.
The Post plans to sell its electric vehicle StreetScooter also.
The Group intends to start trading with the transporter shortly.
The Post wants to offer its electric transporters from the coming year also on the free car market.
"We want to go into the sale to third parties," said a post-speaker on Friday.
The company has been checking for months whether to sell its own StreetScooter, with letters and parcels, to other companies.
Post CEO JÃ¼rgen Gerdes had said there were always questions, for example by craftsmen.
According to information from the news magazine "Der Spiegel", the Bonn Group will soon be entering the mass production of the vehicles.
In post-production, the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift.
Gerdes had announced that the group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and set a long-term goal for a complete changeover to environmentally friendly vehicles.
"We will make a very, very robust step towards 2020," he said at the end of July.
I can imagine that we will change the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on Germany's roads since 2014.
