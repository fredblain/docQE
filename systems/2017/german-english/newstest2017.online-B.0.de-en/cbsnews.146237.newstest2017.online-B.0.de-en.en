Police: 3 casualties in series murder case when listening to music in the car
According to police reports released on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl who had been killed in one of the deadliest attacks for a decade in Phoenix's first serial murder case were shot while they were talking in the car and listening to music.
Angela Rochelliner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis's daughter Maleah were shot dead on June 12, while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said.
The perpetrator fired eight shots from a hand-held firearm while he was standing on the passenger's side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, to be read in the report.
The police said the three-man murder had not been the result of a robbery because the attacker did not take the handbags or the $ 2,900 that were owned by one of the adult victims.
The police officer of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said the shooting caused the investigators to take a closer look at whether it was connected to four previous attacks.
In total, seven people were killed and two others injured in nine instances, mainly in Hispanic districts.
"It happens in a residential area in front of a house," Howard told the KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, earlier this month.
It is assumed that the suspect used several vehicles, including a brown Nissans from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990ern and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were linked and committed by the same murderer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for her injuries and died later.
Liner, 31, and Ellis's daughter, Maleah, died on the spot.
A witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting that was aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the three-killing, and is said to be the work of the serial murderer.
Investigators found cartridge sleeves and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment.
