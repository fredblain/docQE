31 years of exemplary clarity
The managing director of the Wasserzweckverband "Veitensteingruppe", Ruppert Göller, retires.
The association is regarded as "exemplary in Bavaria".
A small Franconian drinking water association as a model for the large water producers.
So it was called some time ago in the original sound in a contribution of the Bavarian Rundfunks.
A little later, the government's water forum paid tribute to the government of underfiles.
The work of the Veitensteingruppe was "exemplary in Bavaria".
Behind all this, Rupert Göller, who has been a member of the Employees' Association for 31 years, has 28 years as Managing Director.
Now he was retired at the age of 65.
The Drinking Water Purification Association of the Veitsteingruppe, headquartered in Kottendorf, municipality of Bretbrunn, promotes about 150000 cubic meters of water annually and supplies 32 villages and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants.
The communities Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach are members of the municipality.
Water supply contracts exist for other cities and municipalities.
The current chairman, Breitbrunn's mayoress Gertrud Bühl (FW), reminded that Rupert Göller was hired as water manager in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Special Purpose Association in 1988.
"His tasks have been very diverse, ranging from water pipeline construction and maintenance to office and organizational activities, budgeting, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency situations on weekends," the chairman said.
In 1994, the company announced that it had commissioned and inaugurated the new wells (1994), land purchases in the area of the new wells (1998) and compensation for farmers, refurbishment of high containers (1999), new acquisition of a central computer control system (2004) and partial renewal of water pipes.
There has been no standstill at all, and innovations have been introduced since water is life and drinking water is the most important food.
In her laudation she praised Göller's faithful, reliable and correct service for over 31 years.
He has worked with a lot of Herzblut for his Wasserzweckverband and he has lived the Wasserzweckverband rightly, as if it were his own enterprise.
Just a few weeks ago, he had been able to present the success concept of the group of companies for nitrate reduction before the water forum of the district of Unterfranken.
For this he received a lot of recognition and praise.
Rupert Göller praised Wasserwart Alfons Griebel, who had worked with him for 28 years.
He is the best water keeper and he was a faithful squire.
Together we were an unbeatable team.
As highlights from his point of view, he described the well construction and the restructuring of the purpose organization.
However, the biggest challenge and the most difficult application were the pipe break at the Hochbehälter near Kirchlauter on 3 January.
Here they had to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night, so that the localities could be supplied with water.
Also the supply of Neubrunn could only be maintained, because one filled the high container of Pettstadt with hoses.
The management of the Trinkwasserzweckverband was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who succeeded Rupert Göller.
