Asocial family destroyed before deloging social apartment in Saltash, Cornwall
An asocial family left her social home after a delay of £ 50,000, because she had terrorized her neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in Saltash, Cornwall.
After being forcibly removed from their homes, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an irreparable state.
The walls had gaping holes, wooden boards were torn open, garbage was scattered on the floor, and graffiti was smeared to the walls.
The family was relocated and it is assumed that she now lives in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for the Housekeeping Department at Cornwall Housing, said she feared that the apartment could no longer be repaired.
She said, "It was an absolute nightmare for people here and I believe that people do not have to live this way.
There are many things to consider, as this property will probably be viewed as not so nice part of Cornwall.
The family is notorious and its reputation is the same.
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime, and the police said the terror that the family had inflicted on street fighting with baseball players, intimidation of local residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive cries, quarreling and cursing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an order for antisocial behavior in June.
In some rooms of the house, which may be demolished, old rubbish was found
There were drifts in the property, where drugs were traded in the past
Neighbors said they saw them fighting on the street and had to be called regularly to the police
Cornwall Housing delighted her and her partner this week by force from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily undress.
The delogation was cheered by facilitated neighbors who said their lives were made the hell.
One said, "They did not care for anyone."
We lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad.
The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.
"This morning we could not sleep."
We stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it!
Now that they are finally gone, it will be beautiful.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighborhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said the family had neglected to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house, to which the police was called at regular intervals, for 20 years
On the overgrown side of the town hall rubbish and old toys were thrown down
He added, "It is a shame that the tenant neglected to accept any responsibility for their behavior and that of their family, as delogation is always the last step that Cornwall Housing takes into consideration.
This was a very difficult case because the behavior was extreme and their deeds had to be terribly watchful for their neighbors.
I appreciate all the work my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and provided us with the information.
I hope that this development will provide comfort to some neighbors and convey the message that antisocial behavior is not tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress left in one of the bedrooms of the house after the delogation on the floor
Workers of the house administration will now have to clear the garbage dumps surrounding the house
In 2014 the police carried out a raid in the house and found over 70g cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash in the amount of £ 1,700.
Skeldon was fined for having been guilty of possession of a Class B drug in commercial practice.
She claimed that the money was for a grave of her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After they were without shelter, Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many room walls of the house were smeared with graffiti.
The police say that they will deliberate tenants who do not follow the rules of the house
Angela Crow, from the Devon and Cornwall police, said the delogation was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not follow the rules of the house.
"This goes to those who think that they can behave without self-reproach, as well as those who have been harmed by such behavior," she said.
The Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and antisocial behavior, which will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
