Relaxing night: tips against sleep disorders
In the evening you waddle around forever, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning is far from the alarm rattling not to think of sleep.
This is anything but relaxing.
After all, you are in good company with such problems: According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not restful.
How do sleep problems or sleep disorders manifest themselves?
There are several forms of sleep disorders, and they can be caused by a variety of causes, stresses Hans-Günter Weeß, Member of the Board of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
What one understands commonly under it, however, is the insomnia, thus a Eingang and Durchlaufstörung.
The caring-mindedness feels many people as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, board member in the German House of Physicians Association with practice in Lower Saxony Varel.
What is sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
Behind this, organic, psychological or behavioral factors, as well as drugs, can be found.
Not infrequently, the sleep disorder expresses another disorder.
"Very early waking is particularly common in depression," says Weeß.
And it may be that different factors condition each other.
For example, if you have an intervertebral disc, you may be ill, wake up every two or three hours, and perhaps start thinking about everyday problems and nursing, says Weeß.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
When should you go to the doctor with sleep problems?
Anyone who does not sleep well for a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is impaired the day should go to the doctor, Weeß advises.
The impairment can be quite different: one is repulsive, tired, has no sleep, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical discomforts such as stomach or headaches.
In order to relieve sleep disturbance, it is important to find out their causes.
Possible treatment options include behavioral changes, cognitive behavioral therapy or medication - classic sleep apneas only in exceptional cases and for a maximum of two weeks.
There is hardly any sleep-doctor in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, director of the Interdisciplinary Sleep Medicine Center of the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.
That is why we should go to the family doctor in the case of sleeping problems, Weeß advises.
The investigator can investigate whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should go to the Schlaflabor, and what happens?
For examina- tion in the sleep lab, doctors advise, for example, in cases of snoring with respiratory exacerbations, in case of sickly fatigue, sleepwalkers, or if one does not find the cause of a sleep disorder, Fietze explains.
You do not have to prepare yourself for the examination.
You should spend the day normally.
"Just do not make a mid-day sleep," says Fietze.
After cabling, you go to bed at your normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose-glasses, a chest-belt and a feeler on the finger.
In addition, a camera on the ceiling records the sleeping.
How can people affected the problems?
There are quite a lot of set screws, which can be used for a better sleep.
Weeß counts: regular sleeping and resting times, not lying too long in bed, not sleeping in the day, not watching TV to sleep, avoiding alcohol and not looking at the clock at night - then you start to calculate immediately, and that is not at all beneficial.
