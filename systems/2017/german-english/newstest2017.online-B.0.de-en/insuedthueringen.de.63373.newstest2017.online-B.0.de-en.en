The soprano Anna Netrebko is openly discussing the autism of her son Tiago - and turns to other affected parents: "You must have the courage to talk about it."
"Medicine has made great progress," said 44-year-old Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.
When the disease had been recognized by her son, she had thought she must die.
The now eight-year-old Tiago, however, had come along well and now learn privately in New York, where there are the best therapists.
"To give an example: If I ask him something, which is two years ago, when I sang at the Milan Scala, he does not remember anything," said Netrebko.
But he is the happiest man on earth.
Tiago is from Netrebko's connection with the bass baritone Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to the tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
