French court denies offer of demolition of transactions in the jungle refugee camp
A French court has refused an offer from the authorities in Calais to kill dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, home to thousands of refugees.
At a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be allowed to break down 72 provisional deals in which people within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.
The Calais Prefecture argued that these places should be demolished because they would constitute a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would pose a fire and sanitary risk.
Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important, as the free meals offered by the government-backed association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They also claimed that the provisional shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of the 72 provisional businesses, but acknowledged that the concerns of the Calais prefecture were "absolutely comprehensible."
Judge Jean-François Molla said that the food, cafés and restaurants would play a much greater role than merely to feed people "living in extremely precarious conditions."
He said the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by tearing down was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the Camp, which is run on a non-profit basis, offering 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as advice on asylum matters for the hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to protect the Kids' Café.
In a letter to the Guardian, it was said that the closure "for these children would be a disaster, of which the recent eight years are old."
The two aid organizations, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle had risen to more than 9,000 people, the highest number so far, following a steep increase in new arrivals during the summer.
