Jennifer Aniston: I am always stuck in drawers
Jennifer Aniston does not always have to be perfect or successful.
The Hollywood star has now made it clear in an interview.
"I'm always stuck in drawers or get labels from outside, which have little to do with me and the reality."
"I do not want to be perfect and successful."
"Honestly, these things are more of a snap to me."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh at the fact that she is considered a "Miss Perfect", as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan".
The actress likes to spend her time at home, in front of television with a loose dump and Mexican food, says the magazine.
To the incandescence, she asked the question: "We women do not have to be married or have children to be perfect," the Hollywood star said.
In her new film "Mother's Day", Aniston is seen as a single mother of two sons.
The film will take place from August 25th.
