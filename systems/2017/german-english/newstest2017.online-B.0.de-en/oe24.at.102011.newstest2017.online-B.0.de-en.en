He was the hero of Aleppo
He put his own life on the line to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar devoted his life to the people of Syria.
He risked everything to save the lives of others.
Now the 30-year-old has died even in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the "White Helmets", a civil protection group, which, according to Bild newspaper, saved nearly 60,000 lives.
2900 volunteers put their own lives at risk, to pull people out of bombed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: A video of the civilian protector, showing him an 11-hour rescue of an infant from the rubble of a house, went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrian a luminous symbolic figure in the horror of war.
As a hero, however, he never saw himself, said the picture: "For me this is the real jihad."
"If I die with saving lives, I think that God sees me as a martyr."
Shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack, he had spoken in a video about the last bomb attacks in Syria.
The helicopters dropped four barrel bombs over the Alzadia district, one was filled with Chlorgas.
One woman and two children died, seven people are suffering from shortness of breath.
"We are now removing the toxic remnants of the bomb so that children can not play with it," the picture quoted his last words before he died.
The deadly bomb of the Assad regime was supposed to hit terrorists.
