Ma Long in his own league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympian winner.
The 27-year-old defeated his countryman and "title defending champion" Zhang Jike 4: 0 (12,5,4,4) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro.
The World Grand Prix first won the "Golden Grand Slam" with successes at the World Cup, World Cup, World Tour Finals and Olympics.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
The two Chinese have made it as expected in the final and made the title among themselves.
This made it clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would bring the single title to the Five Rings.
The last non-Chinese on the top Olympic podium was former SVS-NÖ legionnaire Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left alone on the record, between the sets and at time-outs they had no coaches with them.
They had retired to the grandstand and let their proteges loose in a fair competition alone.
"The matches up to here I have played for my country."
"In the finals I play for myself," Zhang had said, meaningfully.
After the game gold and silver medal winners posed with the China flag.
The match itself was unexpectedly one-sided.
Ma had to fight with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first set really.
Then he determined the tempo on the record and left Zhang as only 13 points.
The superiority of Ma did not evolve into what was to be expected.
But there was nothing to see enough breathtaking ball changes.
Mizutani won the game for bronze against the 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4: 1.
The Weißrussse had suffered a rib injury in his quarter-final against the German European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov, was then in medical treatment, "finally" had to content himself with sheet metal.
The Swedes Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008), by the way, had become Olympic-fourths in a similarly high tabletennis age.
