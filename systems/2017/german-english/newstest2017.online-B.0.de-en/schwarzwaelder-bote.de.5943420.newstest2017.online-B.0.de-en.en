Nagold: Fun and games during summer holidays
Eight beautiful and happy days were spent by the children and adolescents of the social educational group / social group work of the child protection association Nagold with their caregivers at their summer leisure in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
In the quiet Freizeitheim Hardtwäldle the lively group was quartered during the first school holiday week.
Several full-day excursions were on the agenda.
On the one hand, we went to Bretten to visit the petting zoo.
On the other hand, to Maulbronn, where there was a special children's guide in the world-famous monastery.
The third excursion took us to Pforzheim.
In the Celtic Museum in Hochdorf the group learned a lot about the everyday life and food of the Celts.
On the hot days the group at the Tiefensee in Maulbronn, which invited to jumping, swimming and splashing.
Culinary, children and carers were pampered with their own prepared meals such as Sauren Spätzle, Seebronner Pfännle, Iselshauser-Bloff, the English-Breakfast and Tübingen Bolognese.
In workshops it was dyed, beautiful jewelery made of pearls and stones, or made of wood a Roman-mill-game.
Other highlights were the fishing in a nearby pond, the evenings at the fire and the final "Colorful Evening".
On the day of the journey home the sun was laughing, and the children and young people returned home satisfied.
