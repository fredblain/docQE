Greenland Shark: The oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old
Rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually only reach the surface in winter.
This shark was allowed back into the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel Sanna.
He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.
Greenland sharks do not get offspring until 150 years.
The greenland shark swims slowly along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it reaches an average of 1,220 meters.
Only when it comes to it, the five-meter-long animal accelerates to a full 2.6 km / h - and is at this top speed half as fast as a seal.
This lifestyle, however, characterized by slowness, seems to be a patent for a high age.
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the magazine "Science" from a Greenland shark, which could be 392 years old.
"Insanity", Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock comments on this life span, which means a world record for vertebrate animals.
The evolutionary biologist has for a long time assumed that Greenland sharks are becoming stale.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland sharks are hard to observe, after all they live mainly in the Arctic Ocean off the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in winter.
Little is known about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks.
Their time-lapdog measured them when, before Spitzbergen, they equipped six animals with a transmitter.
However, these sharks are still prey: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, while another had swallowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear.
They may hunt sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice and seek carcasses staggering from higher water levels.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland sharks, which caught fishermen from Greenland or Spitzbergen between 2010 and 2013 as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest measured 502 centimeters.
In order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the shark core of the sharks using the carbon-14 method.
This center of the eye lens is created before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein are not renewed again later.
The two smallest sharks had strikingly much carbon-14 in the lins core.
Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons attempted to throw larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
In the 220-centimeter-longest third, the Linsenkerner contained a small excess of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons tests, so it should have celebrated its 50th birthday in its investigation in 2012.
All larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 levels in their lime core, caused by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon 14 o'clock for a 493 centimeter long Greenland shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimeters is even 392 years old.
It is known that Greenland shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters.
Now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length.
Since one of the animals at 392 centimeters was probably on the threshold of sexual maturity and its age was determined to be 156 years, Greenland shark with the increase is evidently at least one and a half centuries.
This is also likely to be a world record for invertebrates.
It is no coincidence that such Methuseums live mainly in icy waters.
Also the previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale, in whose bacon on the neck a 120-year-old harpoon tip was stuck, was caught off Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there also often runs on a spar flame.
So they mature later - and age slower.
To keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often also particularly large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses warmth.
The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much greater than a gram of elephant.
Another advantage is that you have fewer enemies.
"A smaller animal is therefore more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many descendants as possible as early as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.
A very large animal, on the other hand, should invest his resources in a long life.
