Trump does not see the impending election defeat so closely
The Republican Presidential Candidate Donald Trump speaks at an election campaign in Florida.
If it were not for the election to the US president, Donald Trump already has an alternative idea.
He just went on vacation.
If Donald Trump loses the US presidential elections in November, he would not care about it: "Ultimately, it will either work out, or I have a very, very nice, long holiday," said the Republican candidate in a telephone interview with the US television station CNBC.
If, in the end, he did not succeed for political reasons, Trump said this was all right.
Thus, he designated US President Barack Obama and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, founder of the Terrormiliz Islamic State (IS).
Within his party, more and more resistance has been formed.
