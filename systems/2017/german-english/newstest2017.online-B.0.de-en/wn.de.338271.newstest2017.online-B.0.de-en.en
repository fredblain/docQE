Better traffic flow on the highway
It regularly juts down the road - here is a picture of November.
But this is to change: the right turn lane is to be extended.
This is a good news for all drivers who are in traffic on the road every evening when they drive over the motorway junction (A 43).
On the next Tuesday and Wednesday (16/17 August) the Landesbetrieb Straßenbau extends the right turn lane around 700 meters in the area between Hammerstraße and the Weseler Straße exit.
Drivers can then straight from the Hammerstraße turn right.
The big advantage is that traffic is split up at an early stage, which improves the overall flow on the busy section of Federal Highway 51.
The idea with the extended exit was the CDU faction in the district representation Münster-West.
The road narrowing on the feeder annoyed the drivers mainly between 17 and 19 clock.
On working days, the backwater reaches the bridge over the Albersloher Weg and sometimes even beyond.
The reason is the bottleneck on the B 51 just before the exit Weseler Straße.
From here the traffic is only one-lane over the motorway bridge.
The second lane had to be reconstructed well over three and a half years ago.
The reason: Static calculations have shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary load-bearing capacity, in particular to accommodate heavy-load traffic in two lanes.
How long this bottleneck and the associated workplace jam will last, can not say the responsible state enterprise.
However, it is to be expected that the bridge will have an official rest period until 2034.
For the extension of the right turn lane, the state enterprise deliberately selected the traffic-weaker time during the school holidays because disabilities were to be expected.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, the traffic will be lapped past the construction site.
