The USA win the fourth match in women's field hockey, a showdown with the UK is about to come
One day after shooting three goals during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American field hockey team of the women in a match against India on Thursday that the Americans won 3-0.
Five goals in two games should actually be a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she could not remember ever having done so.
"I have no idea," she said.
I do not belong to the people who keep their gates in mind.
But she knows this: the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the British in the first place, who remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan.
Great Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the match will decide which of the two will get the first and second place in each group of six teams.
The first place finishes the strong Dutch women a little longer out of the way, the other group lead.
Whatever the game may be, the Americans have triggered a surprising whirlwind through their success story, four years after landing at the last London Games on the last of 12 places.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Bluebell, Pennsylvania, and had a hockey stick in her hands for the first time at the age of three (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), at 16 she became a national player in the US, the youngest in the team's history.
She missed the Olympics in 2008 because she could not qualify for the squad.
Then came the year 2012, in which everything for her and her team went wrong.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, became the coach of the national team, and with that, things began to change.
"A cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.
We did not have the workspace in London that we now have.
We've been able to pull the helm completely.
On Thursday evening Bam opened the scoring in the first half of the game with a backhand stroke from the close range.
India had gone into the game without a win in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and held the game from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game in their hands.
She made a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then pulled the ball into the goal to get the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.
The Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the goalkeeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who had to score a goal in each of the previous games.
She has a run.
Just like Bam.
"We are in a good position," said Parnham, but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday.
