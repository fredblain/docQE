Rescue in the Moelfre Bay: Three men have "happiness still to be alive"
Three men are "lucky to be still alive" after being thrown out of their fishing boat off Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI Rescue Station bounced on Friday at 13:20 BST after a crew watched the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulties to swim in safety while their boat moved on on their own.
"We saw the boat turn around in their vicinity, and they presented the worst," said the head of the rescue station of Moelfre Vince Jones.
"Fortunately, the strong winds have blown the boat out of their reach, until we let ourselves into water," he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man, at the age of 60, was exhausted and found hanging from a buoy without a rescue vest.
They all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were taken back to the rescue station
Mr. Jones said, "The three men who were thrown into the water, happiness are uninjured and still alive.
The boatmotor had an emergency stop line, but this broke when the boat was capsized by the person who steered the boat.
Someone has watched over these men today.
