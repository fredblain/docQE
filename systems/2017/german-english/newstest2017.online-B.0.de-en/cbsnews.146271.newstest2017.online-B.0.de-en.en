Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It gets better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But like most of his contemporaries, Edmund has microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing about during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, I can not do it.
I can not do it.
I have not let myself go.
What is not at all true, of course, has been the case, "she said.
Her husband Vincent and her was informed that Edmund may never recognize them and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far as to suggest that they institutionalize it.
"My first answer was 'I did not know people were still doing it,'" Picciuto explained.
Edmund can walk with the help of a walking aid.
Edmund could neither sit nor crawl until he was three years old, and he still can not speak.
But he is making progress slowly.
He can run with support and bike riding.
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund has designed for "Please sing me something". "
"We're teaching him language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But it is not a typical sign language - she says. Edmund has invented some characters alone.
Microcephaly has a variety of causes: genetic as in Edmund as well as infections with viruses such as measles or the cicavirus during pregnancy.
The symptoms and prognosis may vary widely.
It is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the infected with the zikavirus.
Picciuto recalls the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I constantly asked what will happen?
What will happen?
And she still does not really know.
I have not asked for the prognosis for a long time, because I do not expect anyone to really tell me.
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zikavirus.
It gets better.
You know it will be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
