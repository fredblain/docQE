Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected with Fife
The £ 1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have linked the Norddeck of the Queensferry Crossing to the viaduct, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four closures of the "deck fans" approaching the completion around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 sloped cables.
The £ 1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017.
Minister of Economy Keith Brown paid a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to get on the bridge from the country.
He said, "This is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic measure in this project with over 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity which requires extremely precise tolerances for the fit.
In total, almost 79% of the entire bridge deck is in place, and the last section of the deck now receives a concrete bet for the deck in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted onto the bridge.
Michael Martin, Project Manager at Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said, "The first shutter is a significant milestone in any bridge project.
This fantastic project represents the closure of future-oriented civil engineering and civil engineering.
After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the Nordturmdeck, we had to close the remaining gap on the north or land side.
This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.
Massive, as the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and has to be pulled upwards at an incline of about 3%.
The problem was that the tolerances to which the team was working were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters.
Fortunately everything went very well.
