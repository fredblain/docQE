Despite the disappointment of the Olympics: Martin remains combative
Despite his disappointing appearance in the Olympic season, cyclist Tony Martin does not want to be left behind.
"I keep my eyes on the World Cup, remain confident and continue to fight," wrote the 31-year-old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro at Facebook.
He has no explanation for his miserable twelfth place on Sugarloaf.
"It is hard for me to comment on yesterday's time trial," Martin said.
He had to analyze what reasons led to the debacle.
At the World Cup in Qatar in October, Martin wanted to fight for the title.
"I'll look at everything we've changed in the past."
"This also includes my position," wrote the three-time world champion who had lost on Wednesday to the 54.5 km more than three minutes to Olympian winner Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland).
