Kepler measures the rate of rotation of stars in the Pleiads
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of rotation rates among the stars of the Pleiad stars.
The new data will help astronomers understand why stars are rotating at different rates in the star cluster, as well as the relationship between the rotation periods and the planetary evolution.
"We hope that by comparing our results to other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age, and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center, Pasadena, in a press release.
The stars of the Pleiads are 445 light years away from the earth.
Many stars in this star cluster, which originated around 125 million years ago, now reach the adult age.
They are now turning the fastest.
At peak rotation rates, these ripening stars emit large amounts of star winds.
Since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.
As a star ages, its rotation rate begins to decelerate.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by detecting the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot, such as solar spots.
The latest catalog of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars spin more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with larger stars rotating slower than small ones.
"In the" Ballet "of the Pleiads, we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, while faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," said Rebull.
Since the stars of the Pleiadians are so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates.
"The Pleiad's star cluster offers an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.
There is still a lot in front of us that we would like to learn more about how the How, When and Why stars slow their rotation rates and, so to speak, hang their "dancing shoes".
Rebull and her colleagues have reported extensively in three newspaper reports on their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Pleiades, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
