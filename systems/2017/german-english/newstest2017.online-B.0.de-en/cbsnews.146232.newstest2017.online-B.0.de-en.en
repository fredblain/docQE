Simone Biles creates gold in his name
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamic on the jumping horse.
Effortless on the beam.
Breathtaking on the floor.
On the whole brilliant.
And now finally also Olympiasiegerin.
The 19-year-old American gymnast climbed on Thursday to a multi-task title and magnified the gap between himself and the rest of the world before the eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.
Their total score of 62.18 was clearly ahead of Silver Medal winners and "Final Five" team mate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.
The American women Simone Biles will play on the suspension beam during the women's singles tournament in the artificial summer at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American to win a multi-combat title and the fifth overall as she consolidates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.
She burst into tears when her end result was shown and her long journey ended at that moment.
This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who have brought their sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated her sport over the past three years, winning 15 World Champions medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the 1984 Olympian Mary Lou Retton said she was "the best gymnast I've ever seen."
She expected a final test in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations.
Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas would be viewed as disappointment.

Biles won the first medal on Tuesday while she served as an exclamation mark at the farewell party of retired team-mate Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles insisted on having never planned the future during her long journey to the top, this is not really true.
Part of their practice - which includes their typical Tumbling Pass - is matched to Latin music, which would fit at home on the street outside the Olympiaarena in Rio.
This is no accident.
This girl, who was adopted by her grandparents as a small child and was discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the gym, where Boorman trained, became a force.
Since the summer of 2013, she has lost no more competitions, a victory that will last as long as Biles wishes.
Even though Mustafina easily led by two twists, the picture bore.
Suspension beams and bodynesses - in which Biles holds the world title.
She picked up again with 15,433 on the suspension beam - and with a 15,933 on the ground put another on it.
Raisman gently embraced her as she awaited her ultimate grief-a pure formality-and tears streamed on Bilene's brilliant red, white, and blue eyeliner as the vision she once described in her collection book became a reality.
The performance Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a tiebrake.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, who is called "grandma" by the Americans, had a lead.
After her exercise, she threw kissing hands at the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes seemed dubious.
As for Biles, the fast-spreading tweet of the 19-year-olds from the beginning of this week has a whole new meaning:
