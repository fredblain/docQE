Turkey: Kurdish community expects crowds
"Those who do not adjust themselves and praise Erdogan sit on packed suitcases," says the chairman of the G端len-based Foundation Dialogue and World, Ercan Karakoyun.
The Kurdish community of Germany expects ten-thousand refugees to flee from Turkey to Germany.
In the medium term it could even be "a few hundred thousand", believes the chairman of the association Ali Toprak.
Because of the harsh Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's move after the coup attempt, the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass curse to Germany.
"In the short term, I am counting on tens of thousands, in the medium term with several hundred thousand refugees from Turkey in Germany, if the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," says Ali Toprak.
Because the government had already overdue Kurdish strongholds with criminal acts months ago, 500,000 Kurds are fleeing within Turkey.
After the defeated coup, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks were added.
Many will want to start anew in Europe if they are further suppressed in Turkey.
"It can not be that a state that takes refugees themselves produces refugees in their own country," Toprak said.
The association commissioner complained about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish and also in Alevi cities.
With this Erdogan wants to increase the pressure to the remaining Kurds.
"They are the last major minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been exterminated or expelled for the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member.
The prosecutor demanded that the federal government be positioned "as sharply as Austria against Erdogan and its supporters".
Also in Germany a "witch hunt" takes place against Erdogan critics instead.
I do not feel safe in Germany for the first time in recent months.
The German branch of the G端len movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and Oppositionals.
Branding as a G端len devotee destroys teachers 'and other academics' professional existence.
"Those who do not adjust themselves and praise Erdogan sit on packed suitcases, as well as the Kemalists and secular ones," said Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the G端len Foundation for Dialogue and Education, the "World".
According to the newspaper, citing figures from the German Ministry of the Interior, the Turks were the largest group of asylum-seekers recognized for political persecution in Germany before the coup.
As of the reporting date of June 30, 11,386 people were thus and almost 29 per cent of all asylum seekers (39,625).
This survey does not contain those who have fled from war, poverty or lack of perspective.
Asylum seekers who are entitled to asylum under the Basic Law are exclusively persecuted, ie, politically, ie from the state side.
