Police use teargas & gummigges against protesting Brazilian students
Students met in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo with the police on Thursday, when they gathered to demonstrate against the government's reforms for the public education system.
The police used tear gas and gummy shots against the demonstrators.
The difficulties began when police officers tried to drive the students apart, causing the police to use gummy guns and tear gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their consternation about the plans.
According to the proposals of the Governor of the State of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, slightly less than 100 public schools are closed, while 300,000 students are being implemented to save money.
Some of the protestants saw Graffitits spray against the provisional president Michel Temer on walls.
The latest protests took place a few days after demonstrators were massively on the streets to support the suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been removed from office by a Senate vote.
