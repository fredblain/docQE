Future of the smelting of Portland due to the abolition of the energy contract questionable
The future of the Portland aluminum smelter in Victoria, as well as hundreds of workplaces, are at stake, as the plant operator will terminate the energy supply contract and thus cancel all supply contracts, as the supplying energy company reported.
This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria earlier this year, no further subsidies to the operation of the plant to be awarded.
A subsidy for 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa facility in Portland are at stake.
No less than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could be endangered in the event of a closure.
In addition, Dominoeffects could occur because the smelter consumes about 10 per cent of Victoria's total electricity production.
In 2014 Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa's smelter in Portland loses money and risks closing it down.
This step follows the many years of speculation about the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and, most recently, the electricity price for the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminum smelting plant with its Loy Yang A power station in Latrobe Valley, announced that it expects three other owners to terminate their contracts.
The plant is majority owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
"AGL expects that the plant in Portland will continue to operate, which means a further physical demand for electricity through the smelter," the company said.
AGL also said that the contracts were so-called "hedging transactions", which should have come into effect from November 2016 onwards.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will end in 2017.
"Therefore, AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenues in fiscal year 17," said the electricity supplier.
All potential impacts on revenue on AGL as of FY 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the major markets for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL stated that it had written off the value of the contracts already in its annual financial statements of $ 187 million in "expectation of a termination".
Alcoa said that the decision to deregister the contracts, "the ability of Alcoas ... to operate the smelter or to ensure the power supply to the smelter."
The US company said it had completed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which should have come into effect from November this year, even though it still owes an explanation of why it has resigned from the contract.
Analysts are warning that the Portland smelter will be shut down in Victoria and the Tomago facility near Newcastle due to the poor economic conditions in the industry.
Referring to analysts' statements earlier this week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes about 600 megawatts of electricity per year and that Tomago consumes about 900 megawatts of electricity.
If both systems disappear from the market, this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the [electricity market].
And it would not be good for us as an electricity producer, "he said.
