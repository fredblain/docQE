Snapchat "anime" effect criticized as an Asian cartoon
Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races.
With its filter tool, Snapchat allows around 150 million users daily to change reality and play with identities in such a way that already borders the absurd.
You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The filters are blunt, proprietary twisting tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfs per day.
All the missing parts are released to the public.
Snapchat filters have been criticized in the past by accusing the app of promoting Blackface or propagating white skin as a beauty ideals.
When this week a few users suggested a filter that gave them slit eyes, false teeth and puffy cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - "yellow face".
They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a bigger problem that the company has with diversity.
The news and indignation were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat communicated that it would have disabled the feature.
The company offered an apology: the filter was intended to be an homage to anime characters and not as a caricature of Asians.
But outsiders who have experienced racism reminded the filter of injurious stereotypes.
Others rejected the anime comparison.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student, whose tweet about the photos were widely spread, wrote that the filter was "hurtful and uncomfortable."
She added that "it is difficult to argue with the contrast of a very disgusting Asian cartoon and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellowish, but the yellow face has been pulled into the depreciating extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural tripping wires.
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the equipment we all hold in our hands.
And Snapchat's large audience of young people, who are more diverse than their older counterparts, might be more likely to expect sensitivity.
When one of Snapchat's filters creates an image that is offensive to a user, "it's much harder that such things go unnoticed than they used to be," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, a product manager and engineer for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account, asking others to do the same.
In an essay for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said that she believes race-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in recruitment practices at Snapchat.
Zhu criticized the largely white, only male leadership, and ended her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"Either they do not have a diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with different skin colors working there but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say what."
Others share their opinions, a complaint that left Snapchat largely unanswered.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural background of his staff, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a personnel manager focusing on underrepresented population groups and on internal integration efforts.
Zhu said that she will close her Snapchat account and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that is not O.K."
