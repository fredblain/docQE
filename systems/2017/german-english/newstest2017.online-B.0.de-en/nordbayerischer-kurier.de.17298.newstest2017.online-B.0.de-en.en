The charges per cubic meter of wastewater will be 3,36 Euro (previously 2,26 Euro) for Zulndberg / Lindenberg / Lopp and for Azendorf 3,64 Euro (previously 2,18 Euro) for the sewage system Neudorf / Reuth / Welschenkahl 3.44 instead of 2.10 Euro.
At the plant in Azendorf the waste water charge will increase again at the latest, if appropriate improvements are necessary.
According to a rough calculation, the wastewater price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic meter.
As mayor Bernd Steinhauser (CSU) reported, during the approval of the budget by the Landratsamt Kulmbach, it was found that these wastewater systems were subject to underfloating.
According to legal grounds, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the plants on a cost-effective basis.
From October 1, 2016 the citizens, as well as the commercial and industrial enterprises from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to dig deeper into the money bag.
The charges are between 48 and 67 percent.
As the manager Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the committee, a re-calculation of the fees for the sewage systems of the market community was necessary.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, overlays and undercoverings from the previous calculation period should also be offset.
The grave fee increases justified Schmidt that all three sewage plants are relatively small facilities with a very low wastewater incidence ranging from 6800 to 12000 cubic meters per year.
For example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact, due to the small distribution base.
In addition, the wastewater volume in all three plants declined slightly.
Furthermore, in the course of the last calculation period, renovation and repair expenditures had to a considerable extent been incurred for all three plants, not least because of their age.
The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the facilities for Welschkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp nearly 20 years.
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the Azendorf sewage plant because of a damage.
The nearly 20-year-old conveyor system had to be completely overhauled in the pumping plant Welschkahl. After nearly 20 years of operation, the first clarification plant had to be excavated, the sewage sludge was disposed of and an additional ventilation option was installed in order to comply with the water legislation.
Schmidt: "These extraordinary expenses were attributable to the continued maintenance and maintenance costs, which must be taken into account accordingly in the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs, which were significantly below the present level in the previous calculation in 2011/2012.
Steinhäuser made it clear that in the case of the low level of waste water in the three plants the expenses for the operation and maintenance "fully durchschlag".
At the same time, added Schmidt, the market community had spared major maintenance costs in sewage plants in the past 20 years.
According to Steinhäuser, the situation for the above-mentioned plants will continue to remain precarious in the long term, especially since the supply areas of the Friesenbachtal sewage disposal network can not be extended by these facilities because they are deficient facilities.
