Gilead receives legal costs from the Hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A US court judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to the reimbursement of the legal costs arising from the Hepatitis C litigation with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released from $ 200 million damages for the infringement of Merck's two patents related to Gilead's blockbuster drugs, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after a US judge revealed a pattern of misbehavior on the part of Mercks, including perjury and other unethical acts.
When the lawsuit was filed on Thursday, US Treasurer Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead is entitled to the costs incurred during the defense of the case.
Merck is trying to match Gilead, which dominates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case goes back to the year 2013, when Gilead and Merck were suing each other and took ownership of laboratory work based on Sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead.
