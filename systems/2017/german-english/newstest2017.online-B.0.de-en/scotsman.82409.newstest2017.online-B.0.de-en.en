Scout Callum Skinner storms home as Brite earns gold for cycling
Scotland's Callum Skinner raced to fame last night at the men's team sprint in the Velodrome in Rio, when the British team defended the 2012 title.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role his countryman, Sir Chris Hoy, had taken as his own. The boys' pound made the legend proud when he stormed home to take a win from favorites New Zealand.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympiagold medals.
They repeated the trick after taking a modest sixth place at the London World Championships in March despite the resignation of Hoys.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the starter Jamie Staff.
They did so in time as Hindes appeared.
Hoy's retirement produced a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton were trying to close.
Skinner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the Scot that has now unfolded.
Hindes, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but the New Zealanders won in the first round in the standard rounds.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
Hindes were close behind his turn, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.
A change of strategy made a big part of the transformation, with Hindes driving in a higher gear to slow him down and to allow Kenny and above all Skinner to keep the pace.
Hoy looked aside from his position as a BBC expert, and Skinner, Kenny and Hindes appeared as they climbed onto the podium.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We have set an Olympic record in the finals and defeated the world champions.
It was just unbelievable.
There is no better way to win this.
After the triumph of 2012 at the side of Kenny and Hoys, Hindes admitted that he was deliberately on the track after a weak start.
He withdrew this statement later and there was no opposition from England's rival.
With such an outstanding victory there was no such problem this time.
Hindes said: "It feels with all the GB flags on the grandstand like London."
We have teamed up in the last three months.
We've gone so badly with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win again at the Olympics.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which won seven out of ten titles in both Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect a successful five days in the Velodrome.
With the form of Kenny, it is within the scope of the possibility that he will repeat Hoys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.
This would be Kenny - exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23rd (an apparently sacred date for British sport, that day also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.
That would be the same from Hoy.
Kenny is next in the sprint, which starts today and will go for three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I just enjoy this for the moment."
The team event is always the best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels somewhat lonely to win alone.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be knighted."
It was the only medal contest of the day, but there were more good news for England.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-four-kilometer race.
They arrived at the finish line in 3: 51.942.
The world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was 3: 51.659.
The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will certainly be the focus.
Yesterday, he had met with commissioners before the qualification, when officials called him to measure his body size.
Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker, and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in World Rector's time at 4: 13,260 in the corresponding women's contest that will be continued and finished tomorrow.
The GB team is relying on its strong railroad team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to bring a host of medals.
After a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were reduced.
There were dramas in the background, including the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amidst sexism and bullying accusations as well as the retirement of greats like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrome, it looks as if the now legendary reputation of GB, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, can be repeated again.
