The UK is bringing silver in the 7-rugby after Fiji brings Masterclass Gold
The impressive performance of Great Britain in the 7th rugby came in the final on Thursday evening to an abrupt stop at the last hurdle in the form of the Fijis, when they were beaten with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave a masterclass in handling, side stepping, tracking, running, and raw strength to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was sweetened by the not so bad trophy of the silver medal - the UK's fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semifinal on the same day might fall back on them in the final.
But regardless of this, Fiji would have hit a 15-man team in the best form.
It could be a consolation for GB - but probably not - that at least a British will have a gold medal hanging around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's chief Ben Ryan, the former head for England from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult road behind it.
Eight years ago, they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens under Ryan.
Here they lost only one.
This blow will hurt, but the progress is amazing.
Fiji started wonderfully and let GB's attacks bounce off for fun.
It felt like the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. were running in the running buses. The World Series winners went 5-0 up as Osea Kolinisau rushed in the corner.
With another four minutes of play, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner, which he converted.
12-0 and GB has hardly tackled the ball.
A prominent tackle from Mitchell stopped the mountain from Man Leone Nakarawa to score a third goal, but it has stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua leveled a touchdown in the right corner and it was 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the re-start and there was still a one-minute game time ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou broke through the GB team's weak tackle and went to the line to score a goal.
The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.
It is as if Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB is still there.
So it is.
GB made major changes at half time, closing the Fijian gap ... for a full four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half until Josua Tuisova went through after a brilliant interim play from Fiji.
Dan Norton started a test for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game had long gone in favor of the South Seesulians whose fans were singing, waving flags and dancing in the stands.
It was not hard to admire Fijis' playful approach.
Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds.
The whistle sounded, the Fijis embraced each other and GB kicked killingly into the lawn.
Earlier in the day Fiji Japan had defeated 20-5 in the semi-finals and the United Kingdom pushed South Africa in a tight semi-final match - Britain's transformation of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the Boks forward in the first half but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal under the post in the second half.
A brilliant late tackle by Marcus Watson, brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.
