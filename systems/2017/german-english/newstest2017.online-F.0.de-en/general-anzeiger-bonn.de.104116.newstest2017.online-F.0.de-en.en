Still Volkswagen comes through mildly.
Despite Diesel scandal the distribution numbers rise world-wide.
But not in all markets it runs approximately.
With the recall action there is eddy around a term.
Volkswagen starts with the distribution more with restraint into the second half-year.
Of Europe of largest car makers can show in the past course of the year despite the Diesel affair owing to his many brands and some well running markets of a far plus.
But in July the core brand VOLKSWAGEN slacked off particularly in Western Europe and loaded with again the total sale as the enterprise noted in the DAX communicated.
World-wide the brand VOLKSWAGEN sold 1.8 percent of fewer vehicles than in July with 449100 cars the previous year month.
However in Western Europe, to China the second most important market, the sales were 14 percent under the previous year month.
In the domestic market the distribution sagged Germany around nearly a sixth.
Brand distribution boss of Jürgen Stackmann led back the weaker numbers from July particularly to two sales days less into Europe.
Besides it gave a consumer resistance in some nuclear markets by “changed economic basic conditions”.
Apart from the situation around the putsch attempt in Turkey also the British vote loaded approximately to the withdrawal from the European Union, described a spokeswoman.
In the USA, where the exhaust affair escalated first, it is located a likewise far minus to beech.
Large support for VOLKSWAGEN is the Chinese market.
Altogether the own brand mainly concerned that comes Lower Saxony anyway further mildly by the Diesel scandal: After the first seven months only a distribution minus from 0,9 percent stands to 3.37 million vehicles to beech.
Company distribution boss of Fred Kappler could show from January to July of far sales sale.
1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen in this time, world-wide 5.904 million.
Volkswagen had manipulated exhaust tests with a software.
Alone in Germany VOLKSWAGEN calls approximately 2.5 million car for re-equipment into the workshops.
In the course of the re-equipment VOLKSWAGEN affirmed that the change of the cars does not have negative effects.
After the re-equipment of the vehicles give it during fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance to no degradation.
The car maker issues the customer after the re-equipment a “warranty-same” certificate, speak however not of a “warranty”, as it meant on Friday in company sources.
Reason are legal intricacies.
“Focus” had reported, Volkswagen grants to its German customers now nevertheless a warranty for reequipped Diesel models.
On past Monday Volkswagen representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport would have confirmed this.
From the Ministry of Transport it was confirmed that there was this meeting.
“VOLKSWAGEN has to fulfill the editions of my commission of inquiry and the KBA at full extent.”
“Deviations from it are not accepted”, explained Federal Ministers of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to Ministry.
VOLKSWAGEN took over the warranty that at fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance after the re-equipment no degradations to take place and all type-approval-relevant vehicle values invariably existence to have.
Volkswagen does not use the term “warranty” however, as it meant in company sources.
With the far term “warranty” sees the possibility to Volkswagen the fact that customers come for example a half year to the re-equipment for instance with a damage to the engine into a workshop - and to the new software to attribute could do this, even if the damage thereby has to do nothing.
Also in the interest of customer is important it to avoid that it comes with any other damage, which does not have to do nothing at all with the exhaust scandal to disconcertion regarding possible guarantee regulations, as it meant.
Therefore do not use VOLKSWAGEN the term “warranty”.
