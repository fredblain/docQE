Escape: “Each fled woman has experiences by sexual force”
Sexual force belongs for women, who flee alone, nearly already to the everyday life.
If they arrive at Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers refuge.
In a large kitchen four women sit.
Everyone has a baby, who is old at the most one year.
One put its small son into the arm.
It looks with large eyes curiously into the area.
Its mother stares at the desk top.
Until it notices that she is observed.
It smiles briefly and kisses the small one.
The scene works normally.
Until one speaks with Katrin Bahr.
She is a range range from Condrobs, a carrier for social offers of help in Bavaria, and concerns herself among other things with the topic women on the escape.
The four women in the kitchen are fleeing.
They live in Munich the north in one of the few decentralized accommodation for alone-fled women and their children in Bavaria.
In January Condrobs opened the facility as well as pro Familia and that Munich for women's aid organisation.
Recently it was officially opened.
There 60 people live - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are men none - also not as a visitor.
The exception is a guard before the door.
“It is not to be said exaggerated: Each woman, who arrives here, made, says experiences by sexual force on her escape” Bahr.
“Men flee because of wars, because they are politically pursued, because torture or death threatens them or because they send, tell their families as hopes to Europe” them.
With women other reasons for the escape outweigh: “Many steal themselves secretly of it because they do not see other way out”.
In their homeland they made for experience with sexual force, forced marriages, honour killings, slavery or forced prostitution.
That chases away it.
On the escape that continues.
“That tractors demand for example for a bottle of water a sexual action, are no rarity”, say Bahr.
And the women are alone, them not by their families are protected.
Who believes that end, as soon as they would arrive at Germany, err, tell Bahr.
Single women in refugee accommodation were often regarded also here as inferior and abused at worst.
That leads to it that about 90 percent of the women, who live in the accommodation in Munich the north it is traumatized, estimates it.
“Did not develop surely some the children voluntarily”.
Many women are so used to it that they do not say anything.
“Or they dare not to speak openly about the experienced because the shame is too large”.
Since they would often not know to help itself, need it more accommodation only for them, demand Bahr.
In Bavaria the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.
To the question, whether they would know from a similar project as in Munich in their scope of responsibility, it answers some with no.
In Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia about there is not something like that in accommodation of the governments.
Also in Swabians alone fled women are accommodated separately, say Karl-Heinz Meyer, Pressesprecher of the government.
In Upper Bavaria, under and middle Franconia there are floors or own houses in some community accommodation only for single women and their children.
The exception is Lower Bavaria, there gives it to two central of accommodation exclusive for women.
Also the committee of “rights of the woman and equality of the sexes” in the European parliament demands that women must be accommodated separately from men.
In a study, which was published for the committee, it means: “It is very important that men and women are separately accommodated.”
“The privacy is missing or men and women is together accommodated, can it continually - force against women come”.
Above all the wash rooms should be easily accessible separately and for women, stand in the study.
The how very women feel this protection need, one can read off from the crush, which there is on the house in Munich.
“Since itself got around that there are us, have we a long waiting list”, says Bahr.
One could open easily a second house.
