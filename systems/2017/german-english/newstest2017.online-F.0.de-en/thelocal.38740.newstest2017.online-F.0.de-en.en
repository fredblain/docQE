Woman with supposed suicide on Swiss motorway run over
The victim lay in the middle in the night on the motorway.
The police calls witnesses, after a woman became to run over in the early morning hours on Thursday with a supposed suicide from several vehicles on a motorway.
The incident occurred on the A1 in close proximity to Morges in the canton Waadt shortly after midnight.
A woman put in the dark one “in an act of the despair” on the road and by several cars was met, stated the police in Waadt.
It is obvious that a Swiss at the age of 49 years, who became to run over from several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to even kill itself.
She died still locally.
Several drivers were already heard, but were not identified some yet, said the police, which requests these as well as each witness of the incident to announce itself.
A preliminary investigation was opened, what a step is “more logical” in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter communicated to the Le Tribune de Geneve.
It remains awaiting however whether one will be shown the driver.
Was a collision avoidable?
That is something that the public prosecutor must decide,” said Hofstetter.
Two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers are not pulled for responsibility.
In each of the two cases - with those a person in the dark one on the motorway ran - it was decided that the drivers do not have to assume a pedestrian runs in the middle in the night on the motorway, as it meant in the newspaper.
Last year was acquitted a police woman of the negligent homicide, after it had run over and had killed a man, who was appropriate in August 2014 the night on the A1 in close proximity to Payerne.
The 22-year old victim had drunk and on the road unconscious became, heard the court.
The court stated that the police woman -- to an emergency call had answered -- in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the road was a “perfectly unusual and unforeseeable situation”, said the judge drove.
Everyone, which has further information to the incident on Thursday in close proximity to Morges, should announce itself at the police under the number 021 to,644 83 46 or 021,644 44 44.
