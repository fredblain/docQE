Future of the Schmelzerei of Portland due to abolition of the energy contract questionably
The future of the aluminum melt of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - stand on the play, since the plant operator the energy supply contract will waive to quit and thus all supply contracts, as the supplying energy company communicated.
This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria Anfang of this year to assign no further subsidies for the enterprise of the plant.
For 20 years a specified subsidy runs out in November.
Up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Alcoa in Portland stand on the play.
Less than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could not be endangered with a locking.
Beyond that it could come to domino effects, since the Schmelzerei uses approximately 10 percent of the entire generation of current of Victoria.
2014 closed Alcoa the POINT Henry Schmelzerei, which led last year to a locking of the Anglesea of power station.
The Schmelzerei of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a locking.
This step follows the speculations for many years regarding the future of the plant, originally as consequence of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity tariff for the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large Aluminiumschmelzerei with its Loy Yang A power station in Latrobe Valley, communicated that it assumes three further owners will quit their contracts.
The plant is in the majority possession a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, about which the Chinese enterprise CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller portions.
“AGL assumes the plant in Portland is further operated, which means a further physical demand for river by the Schmelzerei” communicated the enterprise.
AGL stated further that the contracts were so-called “safeguard business”, which should have stepped starting from November 2016 into force.
The contracts have a 12-month term of notice, so that they will end to 2017.
“Of from there it AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute in the financial year 17 to the incomes,” said the current supplier.
All potential effects on the incomes on AGL starting from the GJ 18 are at present limited by the prognoses of the strong option markets for wholesale electricity tariffs.
AGL communicated that it had already copied the value of the contracts in its Jahresabschlus at a value of $ 187 million in “expectation of a notice”.
Alcoa said that the decision to write the contracts off which does not impair " ability Alcoas… the Schmelzerei to operate or the current supply to the Schmelzerei not ensure”.
The US enterprise said that it had locked 2010 a 20-annual contract with Loy Yang, which from November this year on to go in effect should, even if it still another explanation is guilty, why it from the contract withdrew.
Analysts warn Schmelzerei in Victoria and the Tomago plant due to bad economical conditions of the industry before the possible locking the Portland in close proximity to Newcastle.
In reference to the statements of the analysts Anfang of the week the Head OF said operation Stephen Mikkelsen that Portland and Tomago approximately 900 megawatts at river use annually approximately 600 megawatts.
If both plants of the market should disappear, a substantial decrease of the demand would mean on [electricity market].
And for us as generators that would not be good,” said it.
