The USA win fourth match in the Feldhockey of the women, a showdown with Great Britain are approaching
One day, after she during 6-1 a victory over Japan had shot three gates, Katie Bam made also the first two gates for the American Feldhockeyteam of the women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans with 3-0 won.
Five gates in two plays should actually represent a memorable achievement, but Bam (27) said, them can not remember to have ever done.
“I have no idea.” she said.
I do not belong to the people, which keep their gates in the memory.
She knows however: The Americans are about 4-0 in the olympic match and are dead even in their group with the British at the first place, who remain after their 2-0 victory against Japan unbeaten.
Great Britain and the United States will meet one another on Saturday in the last play of the first round.
Both crews qualified themselves for the quarter final, the play will already decide, which of the two will attain first and the second place in each case within their group from six teams.
The Erstplatzierte will go to the strong Dutchwomen somewhat longer out of the way, who would start the other group.
However the play on Saturday to go out likes, the Americans by their success story a surprising eddy released, four years after it with past London Games on the last of 12 places landed.
Bam was part of this team.
It buildup in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey stick in hands (its two older sisters played the sport at the Drexel university), with 16 years became them national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.
It missed the Olympiad in the year 2008, since she could not itself qualify for the cadre.
Then the year 2012 came, in which for it and its team everything went wrong.
In the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, became coach of the national team and thus began himself the things to the better to turn.
“A cultural change, a mental change and a physical change”, said Bam.
We did not have the work load in London, which we have now.
We could to pull around the rudder completely.
On Thursday evening Bam opened the gate round dance in the first half of the play with a backhand stroke from close range.
India had gone without victory in the tournament into the play, but the team appeared surprisingly toughly and held the score from 1-0 into the third quarter, until Bam took the play into its hands.
It full-led a sprint with the flat ball across the left flank, pulled then into the center and lifted the ball into the gate around the Americans 2-0 a guidance to provide.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the center of the last quarter.
The Shutout was first of the whole tournament for the goal keeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who had in each case to book so far a gate in everyone of the previous plays.
It has a run.
Exactly the same as Bam.
“We are in a good position” said Parnham, but will depend as well on the result of the next play on Saturday.
