Cats react more sensitively than tomcats to cries of the young animals
Biologists examined in Hanover, calling cat babies has which effect on adults of animals.
To their surprise the miaow did not let also the males cold - however they always behaved in contrast to the females equal.
Female cats can recognize the excitation degree of cat babies by the miaow of the small ones.
They react by ten percent faster to sounds of kittens, which believe themselves in large emergency, as scientists of the veterinary university and the medical university found Hanover out (MHH).
Tomcats react also to the calls of kittens - however always same.
“Obvious are important the acoustic differences between the miaow of less and strongly excited young animals for the males either not perceptibly or not”, said the biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
It is Erstautorin of the study, which was published on this Friday in the specialist journal “BMC Evolutionary Biology”.
In a previous investigation the researcher team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the kitten cries with the urgency of their assistance neediness differ.
Altogether nine adults tomcats and eight Kätzinnen from the animal husbandry of the MHH were observed.
Them on the one hand calls were played by small ones, which were taken for three minutes from the throw box and separated from mother and brothers and sisters.
On the other hand they were confronted with cries by more strongly excited kittens, which were additionally raised.
The researchers consider their results despite the small sample meaningful.
“All females, even those, which had still no own new generation, reacted differentiated to the cries”, said Konerding.
They turned faster to the loudspeaker, if these calls of the very much more excited kittens played.
This ability is possibly innate or develops with sexual maturity.
“A surprise was that the males reacted, said at all” the biologist.
In the past scientists already several times examined the reactions of women and men with humans for baby noises.
Also with it some studies that women reacted more sensitively to babies, showed completely equal whether it mothers already were or not, reported the biologist Marina Scheumann.
