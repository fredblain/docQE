Frankfurt profits from the Brexit
The city at the Main has therefore in the competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg the best opportunities to attract from London shifted jobs and companies.
“It is very probable that Frankfurt at most says profited from the Brexit vote”, Michael Voigtländer, Leiter of the competence field of financial markets and property markets of the IW.
After the Brexit referendum it is uncertain whether financial institutions of far from London financial transactions in the entire European Union may operate.
For the so-called European Union-passport so far the permission in Great Britain is enough to them.
Straight large US-banks use.
Several banks already announced to shift jobs.
The lobby combination “Frankfurt Main Finance” counts on 10000 new jobs at the Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, as the IW, speaks the seat of the European central bank (EZB), which responsibility for the monetary policy and supervision about the largest banks the euro zone unites, as well as further important authorities as European insurance control EIOPA and the risk advice ESRB.
In Paris the organization for economic cooperation and development (OECD) has its head office, but this is less important for the financial sector than the EZB.
“The proximity to the issuing bank is importantly for banks, there it so directly with the supervision to communicate can”, says IW-professor Voigtländer.
Luxembourg beheimate a large fund sector, fares however just like Dublin with the infrastructure more badly.
Frankfurt is clearly easier owing to the large airport to reach.
Furthermore the city scores also easily available trade real estate.
“In Paris it is not at all simple so to find free high-quality offices”, says Voigtländer.
On the Seine are besides the rents for first-class trade real estate around 50 percent more highly than at the Main.
In addition offer to Frankfurt a higher quality of life than the competition owing to good medical supply and infrastructure as well as less crime.
In a ranking of the management consultation MER cerium stand the city on place seven, Luxembourg on place 19, Dublin on place 33 and Paris at 37. Place.
Even if quality of life is a question of the preferences: “With its already strong position as financial location for the European domestic market Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors”, concludes the IW.
London will remain however despite Brexit vote most important financial center in Europe, means the economic researchers.
But also the balances of power speak: In London Helaba at the end of 2015 approximately 144000 humans in the bank industry, in Frankfurt worked were it 62500 in accordance with numbers of the Landesbank.
