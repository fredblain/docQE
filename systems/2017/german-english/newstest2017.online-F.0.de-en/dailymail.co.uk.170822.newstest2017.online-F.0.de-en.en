Antisocial family destroys subsidized low-rent housing in Saltash, Cornwall before Delogierung
An antisocial family left its subsidized low-rent housing after a Delogierung with a damage at a value of £50.000, because it had terrorized her neighbours.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list at complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall.
After they were removed by force from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in a irreparable condition.
The walls exhibited gaping holes, timber floor boards were broken, garbage on the floor scattered and graffiti to the walls lubricated.
The family it was resettled and is accepted that she lives now in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, which works for the housing management at Cornwall housing, said that she feared that the apartment beyond repair is.
She said: “It was for the people an absolute nightmare and I am here the opinion that people do not have to live in this way.
There are many things to consider, since this property will be probably viewed as not so beautiful part of Cornwalls.
The family is notorious and their call is it likewise.
The pair had three sons, who lived in the meantime in the apartment and which police said that the terror, which had added the family covered street fights with baseball bats, intimidating adjacents resident, drug abuse, drug trade and excessive crying, controversies and swearing.
Skeldon, 47, its name on the lease was located, received in June an arrangement for anti-social behavior.
In some areas of the house, which will be perhaps torn off, old garbage was found

Neighbours stated that they saw fighting them on the road and regularly the police to be called had
Cornwall housing delogierte it and their partner this week by force from the property, after her them an extended eke out from 11 weeks gave, in order to take off voluntarily.
The Delogierung was cheered by relieved neighbours, that said that their life was made hell.
One stated: “You bothered about nobody.”
We lived 20 years beside them and it were always bad.
The innumerable marks, which we say here the police, are unbelievable.
“This morning we could not sleep.”
We rose, because it was here so calm - we are not used to that!
Now, where they finally away are, it will become beautiful.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement manager of Cornwall housing, stated that it would have neglected the family with the local authorities to cooperate.
The family lived 20 years in the house, to which the police in regular intervals was called, long
On the side of the community center over-rampantly grown garbage and old toys were thrown down
It added: “It is a dishonor that it neglected the tenant to accept any responsibility for their behavior and that their family since a Delogierung is always the last step, which considers Cornwall housing.
That was a very difficult case, since the behavior was extreme and their acts for their neighbours had to be terrible to watch.
I estimate all the work, those my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall as well as members of the community, which went courageously toward us and the information has us to send to have, carried out.
I hope that this development will donate and the message to some neighbours comfort mediated that anti-social behavior is not tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons would have lived at different times in the house, but that they all were over 20.

2014 accomplished the police a raid in the house and found over 70g cannabis as well as balances, Paraphernalien and cash at a value of £1.700.
Skeldon received a fine, after she admits herself the possession of a drug of the class B with commercial intention guiltily had.
It stated that the money for a gravestone of its son Lee Skeldon was, which died 2013 with a car accident.
After they were without shelter, is assumed Tanya and their partner live now in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many room walls of the house were smeared with graffiti.
The police say that it will delogieren tenants, who do not adhere to the house regulation
Angela Crow of the police of Devon and Cornwall communicated that the Delogierung was a clear warning to the other tenants, who do not adhere to the house regulation.
“This goes to those, which imagine that they can behave themselves without self-reproaches as well as to those, which were damaged by so a behavior” told them.
The police of Devon and Cornwall will tolerate never criminal and anti-social behavior, who will co-operate further with partners, in order to protect our communities.
