Steel - ray of hope for German steel industry
The crisis-shaken and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared by additional costs in million height.
Financial burdens, which threatened the industry from the green electricity promotion, are from the table.
It remains with the liberation from the renewable energy allocation with the inventory plants for so-called own electricity production in the German steel industry, said Federals Minister for Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) to the “West German general newspaper” (WAZ, Friday edition).
“I am really glad over the fact that we could reach after two years of tough negotiations finally.”
The European commission had therefore first planned, the steel manufacturers, which use gases from the blast furnace for generation of current for own consumption to ask to the cash.
The steel industry threatened according to the German branch federation additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.
Gabriel said the WAZ, it gives now a principle agreement with the European Commission after discussions with competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only if the generators in the steel plants are replaced, result an EEG allocation of 20 percent.
In addition, this is not raised in the steel industry.
The IG metal welcomed the agreement of Germany with the European Commission for own power generation.
Thus one fix to the status quo of the past regulation to a large extent.
Special meaning has the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry.
“Regarding our campaign 'steel is future' is that a first step.”
“Further ones must follow.”
“Also with the reform of the emission right trade climatic and occupation goals are to weigh”, explained IG Metal boss Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
The steel industry in Europe suffers since the financial crisis 2008 under over-capacities and a substantial price pressure.
Last year the situation continued to intensify, than the world largest producer country China threw domestic demand in great quantities in view of that slacking off steel on the world market.
European manufacturers accuse price dumping to Chinese steel concerns.
In the course of this spring the situation relaxed somewhat.
On the one hand imposed import duties point to import steel effect, on the other hand the economic prospects in China became brighter.
Is unclear, how lasting the price recovery is.
The German top of the line Thyssenkrupp remained careful on Thursday.
The prices would have again rather stagnated last.
The industry reacts to the difficult situation with further reductions of costs.
Thyssenkrupp did not want to exclude thereby last also locking of individual works.
In the German steel industry at the end of 2015 approximately 86000 humans was busy.
In July the German steel manufacturers remain careful despite rising prices and increasing orders.
They produced well six percent less rawsteel than in with 3.4 million tons the previous year month, as the trade association communicated steel on Friday.
After a short increase in May the manufactured quantity decreased now the second month one behind the other.
Since beginning of the year production is by two percent under the previous year's value.
The federation counts in the coming months owing to an improved situation concerning orders on a rising output.
