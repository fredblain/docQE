The right “Identitäre movement” is in its sights the federal office for protection of the constitution guessed/advised.
After several offices of a federal state also the Verfassungsschützer in the federation placed the group under observation.
“We see reference points for efforts with the 'Identitären movement' against the liberal democratic constitutional structure”, said protection of the constitution boss of Hans-Georg Maaßen of the German press agency in Berlin.
Thus immigrants of Islamic faith are defamed or from the Near East in extremist way.
Therefore we observe the movement now also.
The “Identitäre movement” is a grouping with French roots, which is active since 2012 also in Germany.
It turns against “Multikulti illusion”, “uncontrolled mass immigration” and the “loss of the own identity by foreign infiltration”.
Verfassungsschützer in nine Federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-Wuerttemberg, North-Rhine/Westphalia, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - observe the “Identitären” already.
Maaßen said, its authority with the decision with the offices of a federal state had closely come to an agreement.
“Groups like the 'Identitäre movement' try to fetch their target audience where it stands, said” the protection of the constitution boss.
Extremists generally try to address it with youth-fair language often with trendy music.
Islamists would do that just like right-wing extremists.
That is not fussy advertisement for the own thing.
Propaganda is to address the people emotional.
Young people are there in special way susceptible.
That is dangerous.
It had last given reports from several Federal states over contacts of the “Identitären” to AfD politicians.
Maaßen said, in addition he did not have realizations.
For the protection of the constitution possible contacts of this kind are only relevant starting from a certain point.
It depends on whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - by certain people, who are extremist, change their objective and become so extremist.
Decisive it is thus whether such people have steering influence on the party.
This is not recognizable.
With view of the clear increase of right-motivated criminal offences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee accommodation Maaßen, it said in this context not yet again to right terrorism would speak.
But we stated in the past years that there can be rechtsterroristische structures.
There was the group 'old School Society' or the Freitaler group.
It can quite be that further rechtsterroristische groupings or Kleinstgruppen form, which plan attacks against asylum-seekers, against refugee homes or attacks from other right-extremist motives.
A Germany-wide or European-wide control of right terrorism is however not recognizable.
The past groups developed on the regional level or in social nets.
Procured Maaßen expressed itself over the fact that many encroachments went on the account from humans, who had not stepped before in the right scene into feature.
That is the causing concern.
Many the suspects with attacks on asylum accommodation are before not as criminal ones, politically motivated offenders or supporters of the right scene do not admit been.
“Many people committed thus criminal offences, which did not have nothing at all before with right-wing extremists at the hat, who were perhaps politically indifferent or for example CDU, SPD or link to have selected, which tendency-makes itself then however by right-extremist radicalized”.
