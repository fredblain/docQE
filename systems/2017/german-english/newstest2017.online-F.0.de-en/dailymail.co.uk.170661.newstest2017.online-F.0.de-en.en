Assistant physicians would like to organize further strikes, after they rejected Jeremy Hunts's proposal
The Ministers had hoped to be able to terminate the controversy over the changes by acceptance of a reformed contract with the functionaries that British Medical Association but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistant physicians, who co-ordinated with a choice, rejected it.
In July Hunt Pläne had revealed, whom contract said obligatorily to introduce and the fact that in a “no man's land” would be NHS and each further delay for the employees and patient would be harmful.
The first assistant physicians are to receive a new contract, which contains changes to night and weekend works, in order to improve the care to inhospitable times.
Dr Ellen McCourt, the chairman of the BMA Kommittees for assistant physicians divided last night in a report with: “Assistant physicians have serious doubts to the suggested contract still to treat all physicians fairly in particular that it will neglect the present staff crisis to heat up and it.”
At only eight weeks, which still remain, until the first group of physicians under the new contract fall, must progress are made and the time runs out.
Efforts on the part of the BMA for the solution of the disputes by discussions encountered at the government on aversions to take part and sometimes deafening silence.
That happened the one promise, which had made Jeremy Hunt only last month over the fact that its door would always be open.
“Jeremy Hunt must now act, which waive imposition and which concerns of the assistant physicians address”.
If he should not do this, then the assistant physicians made it clear that they are ready to accomplish further forms of industrial action.
The last strike at the end of April planned a delay of almost 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 dates, since nurses and specialists were included, in order to grant physicians on the picket line covering.
The Ministers had hoped to be able to terminate the controversy over the changes by an acceptance of the reformed contract with the functionaries that British Medical Association.
The BMA would like a better Wochendentlohnung for the 54,000 assistant physicians, who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, general manager of NHS of the employees, requested the assistant physicians to terminate the strike.
Mortimer said: “Forms of industrial action reach nothing the only few, load however teams and service providers already over-burdening and prepare the patients, male nurses and its families only concerns, emergency and interruption.”
In the last two months we spoke me the committee of the assistant physicians and with the Ministry of Health as well as other Ministries positively to the doubts regarding the guardianship and the Whistleblowings answered.
The employers hoped that the continued positive commitment about other important - like delegation, flexibility with training courses, additional training courses for those, which return from a vocational time-out, Schulungsksten, mutual acknowledgment of the curriculum, study leave and the gender pay gap in the medicine - an indication of it were, like seriously it the employers, which was Health Education England and the Ministry of Health concerning the adherence to the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.
