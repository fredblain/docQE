Traveler Ian Wright scrapes his tongue at the dirtiest places of Europe for a travel guide
A British traveler submitted its immune system and choking reflex of a serious examination - by licking some the dirtiest and most disgusting places of Europe.
The moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk scraped its course on a euro-light, a railing at the Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing button of a course toilet as well as a public telephone in Russia, in order to prove the ruggedness of its immune system.
Before licking each object it used a Luminometer, in order to appear and us, in which it will get involved.
But the experiment, which was filmed under the title “The Lickhiker's Guide ton internal Strength”, brought some surprising results to the daylight.
The thought to lick the rinsing button of a course toilet which already by thousands of others one used, may be completely repulsive, but more bad bacteria actually are in a kitchen rinse.
On his travel by Europe Mr. Wright with physicians and medical specialists spoke about the promotion of intestine bacteria as well as about his own health.
Fortunately nothing that he licked, left more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.
Mr. Wright became admits to test the ruggedness of its intestine by traveling by the world and strange as well as wonderful things ASS.
From public railings at stations up to rinsing buttons of toilets, the task placed its immune system definitely under a sample
In the film it told: “As a child I was relatively unconcerned already, which concerns my health and I have all possible things put into my mouth, earth, worms and mud water.”
In the film it became in any case fair its call.
The only one which it rejected, was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
Its sample reduction showed a Luminometerzahl from over 4000 units.
In the comparison to it the Luminometerzahl of freshly washed hands amounts to less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to lick, after their Luminometerzahl over 4000 units amounted to, while freshly washed hands exhibit one of less than 60
Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio produced the travel film “The Lickhiker's Guide ton internal Strength”, which shows the bacteria number at different places like the bathroom
In the film he says: “Approximates the worst one, which I smelled in a toilet.”
There is nothing dirtier than that!
I will lick here nothing, because it is disgusting here inside.
“The Lickhiker's Guide ton internal Strength” was produced in co-operation with the Finnish manufacturer by milk products Valio.
The enterprise equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D, in order to support the promotion of intestine bacteria and the immune system.
Valios senior Venice President for snack, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: “We wanted to really offer something new to the consumers.
Something, which is fascinating for looking at and at the same time the advantages by Probiotika explained.
We accomplished moved brainstorming, which ended with the fact that we said “let us leave us Ian to call.”
They maintain that the interest in intestine health becomes a global phenomenon
In place of only about the products to talk, we wanted to place them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the meaning of the intestine health and like it is linked with the immune system.
The increasing interest in the intestine health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary film could we to the consumers available over it more information in an interesting way make.
I think also that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, which led the direction of the film, added: “Leaving it me to say in such a way - I would have mean respect for Ian lost, if he had licked some the things, I it instructed to lick, as the disgusting Russian toilet, those in the film am shown.”
Naturally there were things to bring with which it was simpler, Ian to it to lick and others, with which this was rather difficult.
I am glad that we took up some these dirty treats on film.”
In a survey accomplished by Valio from the year 2015 it associated 84 percent of all asked lactic acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestine and 58 percent stated that they use at least occasionally products, which contain attached lactic acid bacteria.
