Royal Bank OF Scotland for customers outside of Scotland no longer available
The brand RBS is to be reduced according to the chief executive of the bank only more to a Back Office role.
Royal Bank OF Scotland for customers outside of Scotland no longer will be available.
Ross McEwan communicated Scotland to the BBC that the brand RBS with the global ambitions of the bank were connected.
The bank dissociated itself since then, when it before eight years nearly collapsed and had to be saved.
In this time brand strategists used “RBS” to protect other final consumer financial brands.
It supported the international sport with millions pound at sponsoring, of the Six nation rugby up to the Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now it decided to move more national brands into the focus.
Royal Bank OF Scotland only for customers in Scotland will be available, but one will not initialize.
In England and Wales all PUCB becomes references, which changes decentralized head office and the stock exchange quotation to NatWest.
The brand Ulster bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There is other one, smaller brands for the private customer business, which will receive more meaning - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military bank.
McEwan was interviewed during an inspection tour by customers and employees into Inverness shire.
It divided the BBC Scotland with: “The brand PUCB will become now our investor brand as well as the brand, under which our employees will be employed, there we more a bank of brands.”
When the bank became a global brand, RBS became the global brand.
I say now that we do not pursue global goals, but local of goals.
Each of these brands will be located somewhat perfectly in their own communities for different one and our employees will become under these brands with the customers to work.
RBS already stated that its Six nation sponsoring any longer it would not continue becomes and that it will increase the perceptibility of the different brands in its sport sponsoring.
“It is time for us to develop to the bank of the brands because as we concentrate on the inside (we have in demand) to make this a better bank for customers?” the chief executive said.
It would have been before three years very cynical, if we had said that we will be for our customers a great bank and these brands would have launched.
But with our work, which on customer needs and our not own, I think focus, one many changes will see.
We can launch these brands again, from there think I that the time came.
