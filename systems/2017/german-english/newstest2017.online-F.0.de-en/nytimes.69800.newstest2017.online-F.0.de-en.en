In the midst of rise up the Olympic Games, the Zen of the Trampolins
Where always you are also, as late it is also, there is the Olympic Games.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel steadily and inevitably, a racing relay race between competition and props.
It is, as if the olympic torch would be a burning staff, that is handed of crossbow contactors to the float to the gymnast to the triathlete.
They cannot switch the television on, read a newspaper or listen with the discussion of your neighbour in the queue in the Coffeshop, without hearing over Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the controversy between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then it gives still Logan Dooley.
Dooley, which is for the first time with the Olympic Games thereby and a woman swarm with dimples, could have been quite under this well-known names, which are sent to the Prime time, developed by sponsors and Wohlfühl TV advertisement, if he were a float, a gymnast or even a fencer.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights in the olympic Trampolinturnen for gold.
The olympic flame does not light up each equal event.
Of the center, partly in the shade continue to be the kinds of sport, which are not generally appreciative: Airgun-shoot, sheet shooting, bath min tone, taekwondo.
We will always have and may the breaststroke swimming it for a long time prevail.
But if I modest-prove arguments for my certain favourite to make were allowed, then you let me steer the attention on the discrete charm of the Trampolins.
Although the Trampolinspringen is already since 2000 an olympic event, when it had its debut in Sydney, it the last 16 years so meagerly noticed that those, I had asked many, did not know that it is at all an olympia kind of sport.
That could be also regional ignorance.
Although the USA to the match sent athletes, it won never a medal in the Trampolinspringen and had to 2012 an athlete, which created it up to the final round.
The Chinese and the Russians bend to divide the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend this year their gold medal from London.
The Trampolinspringen has a certain outsider charm, partly because it for the unexplained ear more suitably for a clown school than for the Olympic Games sounds.
Here I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a ground-based enthusiast.
It has humoristic potential - kartoonhafte trembling of its to never end wanting impact - in addition, the grace of doing gymnastics and dipping, the two kinds of sport, which it essentially unites.
The word “Trampolin” comes from the Spanish El Trampolin, which means so much like “springboard.”
Rising winners jump on a gigantic Trampolin, shoot nearly up to 30 foot into air and must a row at falling movements (tricks, pikes and somersaults), before they land on the feet.
They are evaluated according to official olympia program after execution, degree of difficulty and “flying time”.
Zweiundreißig athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will begin against each other in Rio.
The in accordance with-loneliest olympic vector is straightforward.
Medal-hoping must go in their striving for gold further, faster, upward and over it, sometimes up to the goal, sometimes back and forth, upward and downward on the playground.
They hunt not only the target line or the output wall, but in the television transmission also a further scornful goal: those the world or the olympia record.
Purposeful striving is noble, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough, in order to agitate even a spectator to tears.
But it is also what I feel when watching these plays as something fatiguing.
Of it the Trampolin offers a breathing space.
The vector of the Trampolinspringers is above.
A forward movement is not the goal.
It or it reflects, apparently weightlessly like an astronaut, goes upward, then downward, then easy again upward.
A competition, naturally not without difficulty, prevails also here but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no curving to the distance, only the dreamy, elegant abolition of time and gravity.
It is like that Zen like the competition with the Olympic Games to only be can.
The qualification and final rounds of the women will take place on Friday afternoon, in the Streaming around 13.00 Eastern time; those of the men on Saturday, likewise around 13.00.
NBC will radiate the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days starting from 14.00.
In the midst of the olympia mania they promise a calm, nice moment, one, which will probably ignore generally tumult.
If the consciousness increase can be achieved only by gaping and the Objektifizierung of male athletes - how the male US-gymnasts suggested it according to the The Wall Street Journal recently - then its, new fan club struggling for air expects Mr. Dooley.
