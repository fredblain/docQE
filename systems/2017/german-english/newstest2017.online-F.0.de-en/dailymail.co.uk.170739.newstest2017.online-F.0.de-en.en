As one protects oneself with Krav Maga against weapon attacks
Die Welt outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make it somewhat safer for you.
We spoke with Rhon Mizrachi, a grand master of the Krav Maga of federation in New York, in order to find out, how one deals with armed robbers on close distance.
Independently of whether one approaches you from the front or from the rear you this video will show, how you turn the tables for your robber.
If one approximates you from the rear, then you should turn as the first, so that you can see your aggressor and “from the line of fire gone”, Mizrachi says itself.
Seize the weapon then between your front arm and your shoulder before you it with your free elbow in the face strike.
Strike it then with the knee into the ledge and rotate you, while the aggressor before pain together-curves, the weapon from its hands. Strike it with the run in the face and move you backwards, while they direct the weapon toward it.
With aggressors, that approach from the front, the technology is similar - move your body from the line of fire, seize you the weapon and rotate you them, so that the aggressor cannot shoot.
If you shift at the same time the weight on the weapon and if you strike the aggressor on the chest, then you rotate the weapon from its grasp, before they move backwards and direct the weapon toward it.
Sounds with difficulty?
View yourselves the video, in order to see exactly, how it fools Mizrachi.
But you think for presenting to it that it is safest with a robbery, your money - if you are not Krav Maga grand master.
