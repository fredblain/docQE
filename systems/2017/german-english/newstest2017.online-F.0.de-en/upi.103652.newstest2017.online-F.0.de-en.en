Kepler does without rotation rate of stars in the heap of star of the pleiads
The newest mission with the Kepler space telescope helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalog at rotation rates under the stars of the heap of star of the pleiads.
The new data help to understand the astronomers, as well as why stars in the heap of star rotate themselves to different rates in which connection the rotation periods with the planet emergence.
“We hope that we experience more by comparing our results with other heaps of star, over the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system,” said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared processing and analysis center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The heap of star of the pleiads lies 445 light-years remotely from the earth.
Many stars in this heap of star, which originated in approximately 125 million years ago, reach now the adult age.
They turn now fastest.
To point rotation rates these maturing stars discharge large quantities of star hoists.
Since this hoist by the magnetic fields of the stars travel, they have a braking effect on the stars.
If a star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler does without the rotation rate of each star, by he the time between the appearance of a recognizable star mark -- like sunspots -- recognizes.
The newest catalog of rotation rates points out that more solid stars turn more slowly than less solid stars.
Rebull compares the stars with dancers, whereby larger stars of slow pirouettes turn as smaller.
“In “clench” the pleiads see we that slow rotors tend to be more substantial whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright of stars” said to Rebull.
Since the heap of star of the pleiads is so close, it serves as ideal cosmic laboratory, in order to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates.
“The heap of star of the pleiads offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older,” said Rebull.
It lies still much before us about what we gladly to learn more wants, how how, when and why stars slow their rotation rates down and hang their “dancing pumps up” as it were.
Rebull and their colleagues reported in detail in three newspaper reports on its newest analysis of the rotation rates of the pleiads, which will appear soon in the Astronomical journal.
