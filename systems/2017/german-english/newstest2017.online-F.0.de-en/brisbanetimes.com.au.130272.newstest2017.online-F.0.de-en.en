Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and luck, which are worthwhile themselves
It is to be watched fascinatingly, how the world changes.
The fact that teenagers and child do not go to no more to playing to outside was deplored but it rather to prefer to spend their spare time thereby at screens to stare, in the last decade by many.
With Pokemon Go goes it around getting and become more active letting people from the sofa to.
The time at the screen was at first limited to the television, then to video games and last to smartphones.
From there it is to be seen greatly that technology and activities in the free one are not mutually exclusive.
I refer thereby naturally to the Pokémon Go-illusion, an app, which is based on the characters, those first for the video games into the 1990ern to create (later developed from it an indication trick series, playing cards and other spin Offs).
Like many phenomena of the popular culture the interest before the publication of the play sank in the USA, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July somewhat.
The introduction on the market in other countries was shifted by the substantial demand, which overloaded the servers.
Within a few days Pokémon Go of more users than Tinder and nearly so many had like Twitter.
How does it function?
Briefly said the players with their smartphones go looking for outside and for Pokémons, which are after-pursued with a GPS and, as soon as they were once found, “photographed” (over a screenshot on the mobile phone) or to become “imprisoned taken” to be able.
A generation, which played the play, when it was still younger, followed the illusion and jumped for the search of the sofa.
In the USA the play led to a considerable rise at steps, which the “average” person puts back each day.
Cardiogram, app for Apple Watch, which after-pursues 35,000 users, communicated Washington Post recently that within two days after introduction on the market of the play, which started number of of the after-pursued people, which train each day 30 minutes, from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The enterprise does not know, who plays of it Pokémon Go - it sees only the raw data for increase in output.
Many public clearing-up campaigns to the health, the people to it to bring want “30 minutes time to take themselves,” “from the sofa to come” and “each day be active” discovered deaf ears, because many public messages are boring to the health and come from people, which look miserable.
Nevertheless the meaning of sport cannot be overestimated.
Who drives regularly sport, reduces its opportunities to get sick with cancer or depressions.
Physical manipulation helps with weight control to state high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list at advantages, which too long are, in order it here.
But the wonderful at Pokémon Go is that it brings the people to do something in the free one that them joke makes.
Thus three columns of the health are taken off - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as joke.
Some people close even new friendships on the hunt.
As there are always also grumpy spoilsports, who must always weight about something.
And yes, someone could run against a door.
What is it?
A break-through occurred.
Even if smartphones apps could after-pursue such as fit bits already in former times our activity, they did not give us a reason to drift sport as it does this play.
The new will lose its attraction and will leave the use with the time.
Due to Pokemons success will give it however more plays, which will unite apps and virtual reality with in the real world and will help many people on the hunt, more actively, to be more fitter and healthier.
