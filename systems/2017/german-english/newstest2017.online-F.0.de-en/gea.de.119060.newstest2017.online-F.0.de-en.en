B27-Sanierung: Restaurants suffer from blockage
At the speed, with which B 27 one reorganizes, it gives to grumble nothing.
For the responsible persons of the construction work, which begins in the morning at 5.30 o'clock and ends only around 20 o'clock, there is everywhere praise.
“Those made, tell everything rather jaggedly” Elvira Tetzlaff of the jet gas station.
That is a superteam.
There is also no delay.
The building site could be moved at the beginning of the week to the half time according to plan after the south, to at the end of Octobers should everything be finished.
Also the obligingness for the construction work of the responsible persons is praised, about if it concerns the facility from auxiliary entries.
Since the building site hiked on Monday after the south and also the blockage of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was waived and so that also the connection exists to Rottenburg again, the traffic conditions relaxed within the place.
The citizens can drive on now from Ofterdingen from B 27 again reciprocally.
Alternate traffic by the place seems to decrease.
“There it gave partial substantial complaints”, says for the traffic-technical management of the redevelopment responsible person deputy municipal managers to Florian King.
The adjacents resident of brook sentence road, stone salmon route, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because many secret means looked for each other and rather trusted their Navi as the sign-posting.
Which led to the fact that some truck in populated areas verfranste itself.
Since also the speed limits were not kept, demanded the community strengthens the measuring vehicle from Mössingen on.
“There were substantial excesses”, say King, which made itself well-informed over the situation times locally.
There two to three per minute were already flashed.
The fastest one was with 77 kilometers per hour in the Tempo-30-Zone on the way.
Since the building site moved on, it became however calmer.
For the businessmen at B 27 it is only a small comfort that for customers from Rottenburg now the road is again open.
Into the cards to look businessmen do not leave themselves gladly.
But that with them to revenue break-downs led B 27-Sanierung, it lets see through everyone, which one asks.
However some more are less concerned and some.
Who has to do with the “end customers” less, thus for other companies produced, for that the redevelopment has hardly consequences.
In addition, also with the car dealership Maier speaks Thomas Sulz of a “at the most easy decrease”, grants that naturally “irregular customers are missing”.
At the strongest shaken the restaurants are along the road.
J. Albert Göhner, Inhaber of the Steakhouse, before times crown, finds clear words.
That already is existence-threatening.
Not only it met it, but all restaurants “hard”.
The customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.
We must be glad over each euro revenue.
It numbers the turnover losses on “far over 50 percent”.
The road redevelopment threw its enterprise back “by two years”.
It half of its employees had to dismiss.
If I had a company with 4000 employees and half were to dismiss, had the policy differently reacted.
Instead head of the provincial government Jörg Schmidt answered to a request of Göhner, whether there could be a financial reconciliation, with the reference, the restaurant profits otherwise from the advantages the situation at B 27. Now it must carry just also the disadvantages, which arise as a result of the redevelopment.
Göhner knows from other districts, where something so more generously one handled.
With all complaints Göhner is sure itself that its restaurant will continue.
Finally the family business is settled already since here 1715, refers it to long history.
That other regular customers look in now because of the complicated traffic management less frequently, he can understand.
If one cannot to drive here, it is also elsewhere beautiful.
That its master clientele returns after the end of the repair works again, to it Göhner does not have doubts.
Despite the crises with BSE and bird flu Göhner regards the effects of B 27-Bauarbeiten its customers as the largest crisis, which experienced its restaurant in its history of many years.
Six months construction work, that is already brutal.
