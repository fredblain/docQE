Russia and Turkey: A “alliance of outsiders”?
It was a gesture, which terminated a crisis.
The leaders Russlands and Turkey met on Tuesday, in order to give themselves the hands and to announce an official end of the eight months long persisting war of the words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish opponent in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburger of palace in receipt, I cannot refuse myself the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation at most.
There was the handshake, yes.
But of Putin smile worked schmallippig and he radiated hardly warmth, even for his reserved conditions.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan however spoke repetitive of its “dear friend” Putin - according to a report whole five time.
I could not count it any longer.
He promised also the fact that the relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis will even still improve but.
On the next day a newspaper that Erdogan would have behaved in such a way, described as if something bad would have never happened.
Its enthusiasm seemed to suggest rather the opposite to me.
But, a lasting coolness radiating from Putin showed that head of state Russlands had not forgotten the anything.
Rather the cause of the crisis was first, which it mentioned in its introduction words: the firing of a Russian combat aircraft at the Syrian border by Turkey.
Moscow reaction at the time was inflamed with rage.
Putin distributed and accused Ankara of, Russia in the backs pleases to be.
Offence was even still larger, since it was committed by an alleged friend.
The Vetrauen will again construct with difficulty, if become not even impossible.
The public opinion in Russia changed itself for November.
Months long implemented the state-controlled mediums a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.
At once it seemed, as if the Turks for everything would carry the debt.
The accusations were most serious from leading officials that Erdogans own family would have profited from the illegal oil trade in areas of Syria, which are controlled by the so-called Islamic state.
It denied this vehemently.
But in St. Petersburg the official message that it was time read, to look forward.
Finally this meeting took place only, because Putin received the apology, which it wanted to hear from president Erdogan.
Russia could book a kind victory.
For Ankara the advantages of an armistice are clearly obvious.
Erdogan needs primarily all friends, whom he can get, after he was relieved last month with a failed coup d'etat nearly of his office.
Repetitive terrorist raids on Turkey likewise shook it.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions met Turkey hard - in particular the prohibition of charter flights, which bring each year usually several millions Russian tourists to the Turkish coast.
The number decreased around nearly 90%.
In Russia tour operators and charter companies will be relieved, if the flights are again taken up.
They count on a lateseasonal attack to the Mediterranean.
This week prognosticated public television cheaper fruit and vegetable, as soon as the Turkish agrarian imported goods are again permitted.
A report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows: “Tourists there long, tomatoes here long.”
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is furious on the west, since it regards its reaction to the tried seizure of power as weak answer.
In addition continuous resentment over the snail speed of the EU accession negotiations and the Putin come - which are eager to pull from the cool tendency benefit and to reduce the relationship of Turkey with the west.
The Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara with security for the fact that he demanded support for the selected state organs after the tried coup d'etat.
That is for Moscow mind you a matter of course, which has even a low-sitting fear of regime changes.
The summit in this glossful palace at the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey to represent one, as it described me an analyst once, to “alliance of outsiders”: two countries, of the west offended and badly treated feel and now groups.
Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, exist between the two still large differences.
The largest difference is Syria, where Moscow gave itself recently the role as a peacemaker, but where opposite sides support Russia and Turkey.
It could be characteristic that after nearly three hours at Erstgesprächen both presidents to the press conference stated that they would not have even touched the topic.
The president of Turkey avoided to answer it intentionally to a question over its differences, during Putin itself in addition decided these to stress.
No clear consent is present over it where a common denominator can be found to Syria.
But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect Disaster, when the NATO member Turkey shot the Russian fighter plane - it is surely better that the two heads of state talk again with one another at least.
