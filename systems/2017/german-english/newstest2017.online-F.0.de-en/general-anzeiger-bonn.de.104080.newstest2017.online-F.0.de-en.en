Constantly in the name of the fight against terror at laws one screws.
After the recent attacks Minister of the Interior de Maizière submits now a thick safety package.
But which has a tolerance status with terror to do?
And which says the coalition partner to all that?
Thomas de Maizière gives the Versöhner.
All its proposals are “politically reasonable” the coalition partner, say the Federal Minister of the Interior with the conception of its new safety package.
They do not make excessive demands of anybody.
Others, large points were discussed first within the parties.
Also to it I take part.
As a Minister of the Interior is however at results been to it and because of a “attainable consent” within the coalition.
De Maizière let little time elapse after the recent attacks in Wuerzburg and Ansbach, before he presents his conclusions for security in the republic.
Fail for it now however all the more extensively.
Some is already well-known, announced, focused: The fact that a new security authority is to worry about cracking coded communication is not new.
Also not the fact that Germany must convert several European Union-defaults to aircraft passenger data and gun law.
The call to more closed circuit television and staff for the security authorities does not come just as surprisingly.
Partially de Maizière starts a second approach for proposals, which were not to be made with the SPD so far: It wants sympathy advertisement for terrorist groups under punishment to place and to jihadists with double nationality the German passport unbutton.
“That difficult points will be for the SPD”, grant the CDU man.
It hold this nevertheless for reasonable and demand also nothing that has no opportunities at the coalition partner anyway.
De Maizière presents a few new ideas also.
Those have it partly in itself: It plans shortened proceedings for deportation and more possibilities for the arrest of humans before the deportation.
Refugees, who are gotten purposefully in the country, are to let their smartphones check before and Social Media accounts for a security examination to reveal.
With tolerances for rejected asylum seekers it wants to place some still more badly than so far - for instance such, which commit criminal offences or throw their papers away consciously, in order to mask their identity.
Some of it is politically and legally delicate.
Some works also still ill-considered and leaves questions open.
And at some points - with the discrimination of waited one for example - the question arises: What has to do actually with security and terror?
Yes, de Maizière, says is important to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terror.
But it cannot be placed in agreement that the assassins of Ansbach and Wuerzburg were refugees.
In addition many humans worryd themselves in view of the high refugee numbers around security.
And things, which employed humans deeply, did not let themselves exclude just also in election campaign times.
Internal security moved enormously into the focus.
Only the attacks in the neighbourhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Wuerzburg and Ansbach.
The disconcertion is large.
And yes, election campaigns line up.
Union and SPD position themselves with the topic internal security from there increasingly.
In the past days it worked between the two parties highly.
Only a mean controversy over the equipment of the Federal Police, then over a security-political idea collection of some union Ministers of the Interior, in which the department heads demand also a Burka prohibition and a break with the double nationality.
De Maizière strives itself also here around conciliatory tones.
From a break with the double passport do not think it anything.
We pacified the discussion in Germany.
It to open again, is not meaningful.
And with a Burka prohibition it has constitutional doubts.
Whether its own package at all corners is verfassungsfest and whether it is actually “reasonable” for the coalition partner, must itself only still show.
It puts some in it, which could provide for controversy.
But also the SPD tries at present to form itself with the topic internal security.
Party chief Sigmar Gabriel signaled only times carefully willingness to have talks and says: “the SPD is ready to talk about everything which contributes to it, security further to increase”.
