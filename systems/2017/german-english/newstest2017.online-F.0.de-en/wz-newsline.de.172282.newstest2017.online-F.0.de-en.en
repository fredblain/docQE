Rain instead of meteors: Hope for weather improvement
The weather made the meteor Guckern in the southwest of Germany at the night Friday a line by the bill - nevertheless there is still hope.
The night was badly suitable because of clouds and rains to observe the sky spectacle said a chairman of the observatory Welzheim, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.
Our hope is on the night to Saturday.
The weather should be good, then see we determines many meteors in the sky.
With the star sheds it concerns Perseiden, which belong at 216000 kilometers per hour to the fastest meteors.
They have their name, because they come apparently from the constellation Perseus, which comes up in the northeast.
