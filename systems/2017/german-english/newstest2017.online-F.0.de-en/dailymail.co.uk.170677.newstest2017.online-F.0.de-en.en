Culture of the Political Correctness lets electoral fraud in Muslim areas blossom
The former mayor von Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed last year on reason of a government report because of corruption from the office
A culture of the Political Correctness led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is knowingly ignored like a destroying government report today revealed.
The former cabinet member sir Eric Pickles attacks verbal the police, election observer and city halls proofs of choice abuse due to “hypersensitivenesses concerning ethnicity and religion” to have ignored.
The former Minister for integration and local government, which are now a Antkorruptionskönig, it said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that it should be permitted the police to furnish shut-off volumes outside from polling booths in order intimidated voters to protect.
It recommends that voters should lead a document of identification with itself, in order to prove with elections their identity.
At present a voter must call only its name and address.
The report suggests laying not removable ink on on the finger of a person if they deliver their vote, in order to prevent that someone selects twice.
Whistleblower should receive more protection, say sir Eric.
It demands that the press more entrance to community documents and decisions of not official Kommittees or working groups should have.
“Also the local government before the broader corruption and finance fraud culture, which accompany with it, does not only serve protects,” said it against electoral fraud, but is.
The report was arranged of the Downing Street as consequence of the Tower Hamlets of choice scandal in the east of London.
Last year decided a special choice court that the acting mayor Lutfur Rahman should be relieved after a litany at corrupt and illegal practices of his office.
The court found that Rahman the religious feelings of its Muslim community would have perverted " in cynical way” and that it would have hushed its critics with racing SiS mash and Islamophobienanschuldigungen.
Rahman is to have led “its campaign on the basis that it is the religöse obligation of Muslims, it to select.”
Up to 300 voices were either doubtful or the consequence of an imitation, with which a person selects as someone else.
Sir Eric said that there would be generally speaking country of proofs for fraud.
He expressed himself in particular alarming to the fraudulent absentee voting - at older members would have made the Muslim community pressure on people to select a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, shown, made several recommendations, in order to clean the choice system, including leading documents of identification, in order to prove the identity

“There were doubts that… national institutions would knowingly have ignored such a behavior due to “politically correct” hypersensitivenesses concerning the ethnicity and religion.”
Sir Eric expressed 50 recommendations, in order to clean the system to stop including the prohibition that political activists works on absentee voting documents, in order “choice elections”.
The report, which is considered by Theresa May, requires also harder registration examinations, in order to prevent that the choice listing is used for immigration and social fraud purposes.

Intensification of the training, in order to guarantee that the employees implement the rule that voters go alone into the polling booth.
Sir Eric falls over the metropolitan policy and finds it “amazingly” that after the Tower Hamlets case a charge one did not place.
“The choice court explained,” said Lutfur Rahman and its deputy for due to a litany at corrupt and illegal practices as unfit it.
It became due to a set of reasons for sufficient - in accordance with the high requirements in the criminal procedure - guiltily admits.
He criticizes also ineffective “checking off controls” of the choice registration elections of the city halls.

Our country carries a proud inheritance, but the causing concern and covered propagation of electoral fraud and denying some authorities as the mother of the parliaments threatens this good reputation.
