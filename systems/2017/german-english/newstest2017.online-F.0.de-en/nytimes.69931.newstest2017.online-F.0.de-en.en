The depressing meal of the economic crisis in “a plentiful meal”
In March 1933, shortly after his ascent to the president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch in the oval Office.
As a gourmet president Roosevelt had a weakness for refined delicacies of Fifth Avenue such as Pâte de foie grass and Maryland water turtle soup.
Its menu on this day was somewhat more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and as dessert a plum pudding.
“It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people,” said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, “it was also a message to the Americans, like her to eat should.”
The married couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and is both food historians.
Coes last book “Chop Suey” acted of the Chinese kitchen in the USA, while “about the life in a house to the Lower East Side from the food perspective tells Ziegelman in its book 97 Orchard”.
You newest co-operation, “a decent meal”, which will appear on Tuesday in Harper Verlag, illustrate the history of the American kitchen during great depression.
They showed culinary solidarity, when them sand-yielded themselves with a reporter in the Eisenberg's shop with dinner meet, a small, straightforward lunch in the Flatiron District, which is already since the stock market crash 1929 in the business.
Ziegelman, 54, cream cheese-sand-yielded with olive bits, during Coe, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ordered 57 ASS.
When the reporter ordered chopping roasts, this found the pair suitable for a discussion over the meal in the era of great depression.
“Rich food was much likes”, said Ziegelman.
There was peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.
They were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap one, which stretches the ingredient.
Introduce yourselves to eat so many peanuts that they serve them as dinners.
Coe grinned.
“It must have put in the stomach such as lead,” said it.
In the years before great depression the table in an American household, particularly in rural areas, was a universe You CAN Eat Buffet.
Crews of women cooked for male agricultural labourers and it freshly baked pie for breakfast, for the lunch and dinners were served.
Were the Americans, who sent Europeans on during the First World War food being hungry. “A Square Meal” notes the ways, with which the country dealt with it, no more the paradise to be.
“It was a time, in which meal for the Americans became a central, strained topic”, begündete Coe, why it and its wife over it to write wanted.
The new budget diet was just as strained: Mysterious meals such as bread and casseroles became staple food, the casserole as “wonderful kind of recycling leftovers” marked Ziegelman, since cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a kremigen sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper drying fruit.
Meat, which was for many years the center of the American kitchen, became a rarely served luxury.
Strange mixtures were tried out, since a calorie-rich and feedful satisfaction had priority before taste or even healthy understanding of kitchen.
During its search for the book, which covers also recipes, a court prepared Ziegelman baked bulbs with peanut butter from this epoch.
“It was not a popular additive at the Mittagstsich,” says Coe.
Brick man continues to implement: “It was surreally.”
Peanut butter and baked bulbs do not fit to each other.
It was typical for many of the housekeeping recipes.
Like never before or since then, household businesspeople - under it Louise Stanley, Leiterin federal office of the OF Home Economics between 1923 to 1943 - propelled the eating habits of the country so.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged to become women “budgetary policy gutters” to become fair and the challenge to transform Pampe like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
“A Square Meal” is a celebration of the historical delicacies.
In particular tastily the reports are being hungry over the answer of the government to those citizens, like president Herbert Hoovers letting me cake meal leaving.
While it praised publicly simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of its kitchen, he fed like the worth millions man of world, whom he became.
“He liked continental kitchen such as fish with cucumber sauce,” said Coe.
He ate in a nearly gilded dining-room and wore a tuxedo.
It was wonderful out of touch with reality.
Perhaps president Roosevelt would have committed the same error, if not his Mrs. Eleanor had requested him to set with his stomach an example.
As in the book descriptive hiring a lady housekeeper with no interest in flavors led by Mrs. Roosevelt to it that the white house brought the most boring meal out in Washington, but also one at the most hopeless prepared one.”
Many of the kinds from the era of great depression of dealing with meal it was rejected, as soon as the country came the legs.
The legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as whereupon, how science was applied to food.
The pair gave to have better understood on during the writing of the book the eating habits about Ziegelmans mother-in-law - for example like it food not to throw away could.
“A genuine fear of the wasting of food had you,” said Coe.
Ziegelman remembered: “You made people actually suffer.”
There there was the cream puff incident.
After the plates were cleared with Eisenberg's, they and Coe pulled out a dessert, which they had at home prepared: the plum dessert, the president Roosevelt to noon ASS.
“It is called Prune Whip,” said Ziegelman and added that it was a usual trick to give to modest recipes a fancy name.
There was no struck cream, only plums, something flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone immersed somewhat unwillingly a spoon into the tough, brown Glibber.
It did not taste surprisingly badly.
Coe got itself three times a consulting.
Like a CAN DO Budgetierer he said a few chopped walnuts to his wife, “would help.”
