Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee-assigned
Annika Deuschle is the partner in things integration and organizer.
In addition it is social female worker locally.
Since July Annika Deuschle is the refugee-assigned for Urbach.
The social teacher supports the team of the administration around Achim Grockenberger.
She sees herself as a partner for all participants: Refugees, working group refugee work, administration, authorities and who otherwise still mixes together.
Regine Kunde of the working group suggests that the honorary ones are than grateful more that Deuschle is now there, the egg-laying woolly milch sow, which has above all a problem.
Thus some - less scoffing than rather on the variety on desire fields of application aiming at - had meant, when the administration wanted to write the place out.
An administration employee was looked for with a talent for languages and humans, connected with an experience of many years within the range of the social work, just an egg-laying woolly milch sow.
But clerical work is not their central range, means Annika Deuschle.
Above all go it around organization, work with humans locally and also behind the scenes as well as to network activity.
The 31-year old participates for approximately six weeks.
It limited a 50-Prozent-Stelle on three years.
“It was high time”, says Regine Kunde that Annika Deuschle supports honoured and full-time participants.
There are large and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems.
Soon new containers are located in the which road
A serious problem is it for some time to find apartments for the connection refugees who were recognized.
For the connection accommodation the municipalities are responsible.
They must accommodate the refugees in own or rented dwellings.
The costs of the building, the rent or the renovation of these accommodation must carry the municipalities themselves.
The responsibility changes from the district administration office on municipality and job centre.
Problem: There are free objects, but not each landlord wants to offer its apartment.
The search turns out for some time as very difficult.
De facto the administration does not find private apartments.
It does not function so far, one is dependent on private dwellings, like that Deuschle.
Therefore gemeindliche apartments must be trained, as it is called so beautiful.
Thus soon new containers in the which road are set up.
But only with apartments it is not done.
Perspective is the keyword, is itself Regine Kunde and Annika Deuschle united.
Beside a firm lodging there is internship places, apprentice positions, school places, one-euro-jobs and temporary jobs for refugees and Migranten, who gefundnen or must be furnished.
“Would be good more places”, reports Regine Kunde.
Many work in the building yard or help caretakers, settle non-profit work - and motivates and very properly, as Annika Deuschle reports.
She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect.
That is not “occupation therapy”.
Activity does not however only mean work.
The day needs a firm structure, says Deuschle and customer.
Humans would have to develop a sense of belonging.
Thus need it offers such as sport, contacts with native ones and above all language courses.
Professional courses are RSR.
Thus administration and honorary ones substitute also here.
It is central vision that the refugees get the feeling, it is desired and welcome in Germany.
The long duration of the procedures is a problem.
They must explain to the refugees that it lasts just and it meaningfully can bridge the time, for example with language courses.
Who develops the feeling sometime, he can in Urbach nobody help, may not work and is useless, which will never integrate itself.
The clear majority is motivated.
There are cases of problem in addition, say, customer honestly, “people, at which nothing at all does not go”. The work of Deuschle and customer are always also to motivate others.
All this is already a “giant task”.
A difficult question: Do the two have fear of radicalization after the recent occurrences, also in a small community such as Urbach?
“No”, Regine Kunde says completely clearly, “which some naively call may”. A residual risk can not exclude and does not want it however.
Sensitized however already are the aides.
These incidents are also topic with the refugees.
Those would have the fear that the assassins bring them completely in disrepute.
“You want to show that they have to do thereby nothing”, say Regine Kunde.
Many would remain gladly in Urbach.
Thus head and honorary ones must hold locally and in the region after activities look out.
They have always in the background that soon a new impact at refugees and Migranten could come to Urbach.
Does Germany need an upper limit?
This question clearly to answer, is afraid the policy.
Actually it is unfair to place it to aides locally.
“In Urbach we arrived not yet, where we would like”, say Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, which would ease the situation.
Regine Kunde makes likewise clear that the Urbacher is working at full capacity already to integrate past humans reasonably.
Those are at present approximately 100 people, predominantly young men.
But if humans are in emergency, one must help them, is itself both women united.
The political international situation is not so complicated, there gives it simple answers.
