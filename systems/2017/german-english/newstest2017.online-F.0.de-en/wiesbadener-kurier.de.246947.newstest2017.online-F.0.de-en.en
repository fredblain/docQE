Medical case: When the organizer pays
Gotten sick holiday-makers get back money after their travel only if the cause of the illness is to be found free of doubts in the hotel.
That is however the case only if more evidentially the same symptoms show than ten percent of the guests.
In the case negotiated a family was on the second day of its Turkey vacation heavily at diarrhea and vomiting gets sick.
She spent nearly the entire vacation in the room.
The holiday-makers attributed their illness to a defective purification plant, which had gotten allegedly the sea water dirty.
The family was the opinion, the travel thereby unsatisfactorily was - and complained against the organizer.
In court the plaintiffs did not have a success.
The purification plant was indeed defective.
But the organizer experienced only shortly before departure of the plaintiffs from it.
It had to assume by then the sea water was correct.
It did not injure its duties to supply information thus, so the judgement.
Particularly since in the samples of the water no impurities were found.
The illness of several hotel guests - possibly by infection among themselves - belongs to the general life risk.
Were from 691 guests only 38 gets sick.
