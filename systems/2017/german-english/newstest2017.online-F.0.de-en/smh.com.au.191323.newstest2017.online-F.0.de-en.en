More than only a Kardashian Reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September edition Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian Jenner of clan Kris are on the cover of the September edition in demand of US Vogue.
Kendall, which is brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and on the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York ran, announced the news on its Instagram account on Thursday.
“In an area of full people, which I love, the sight of this cover brought me to crying,” wrote Kendall.
The exposure of cover a bizarre (or simply Keeping UP with the Kardashians something similar?) followed, scripted Reality video, which shows the entire Kardashian Jenner family (with exception of the cases of problem Rob and Caitlyn as well as in presence of the all-side popular Showbiz uncle and producer of Keeping UP Ryan Seacrest), as they forget covers of their sister and with a classical idiom ends: they planned all a surprise party.
That represents the plate-afflicted action to almost any birthday episode of a child transmission (Seacrest brought the sentence, “you thought that we would have forgotten you? ,” with the honesty of an indication trick rabbit on a time slot at 8 o'clock), but their other girls had to somehow let Kris in the morning participate in this publicity.
With view to the September edition Vogue began a new era of the Kardashians with security.
Kendalls large sister Kim likes it, what concerns Vogue covers, struck (they and her man Kanye West were on it in April 2014 to see), but covers of the September edition of the magazine is a league for itself.
The September edition is for Vogue to usually most sold edition of the year.
With an extent, which resembles rather a book of pictures as a fashion magazine, the edition draws a large number on on advertisers (sound Fashionista were from the 832 pages of the tome 615 pages advertisement).
The exposure of its cover star is so longingly expected that in the last two years pictures of the magazine oozed still before the official publication.
Women, who already were on cover, cover Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In the last years clearly more was “famousnesses, those models” than “model, the famousnesses is” on cover.
OSCAR winner and Dior Markenbotschafterin Jennifer Lawrence was 2013 on cover, one year after lady Gaga the honour had.
But even with the slim chance that Mrs. Jenner - of the magazine as the “break-through model” of her generation is described - falls under the earlier category, it is it in good society.
This famousnesses is not related to famous people or Reality of star or young people today, that knows, like one a good Snapchat video turns (even if of it everything applies to Jenner).
They are really talented women, who are characterised in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, which appeared on last cover, had one of the most successful years of its career with the publication of Lemonade.
Naturally Jenners success does not please everyone.
With its Reality TV history Jenners position was always somewhat strained in the fashion world.
In June the former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized and called it “the muck malice of the instant.”
These feelings cooked, when the message with the appearance Jenners on Vogue cover came out.
But seems to pass on the moroseness to harp on the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition Vogue.
It is in the true sense of the word a supermodel.
It runs for Marc Jacobs.
It makes advertisement for your priming of Estee Lauder.
They and all their sisters sell pictures of itself on its respective Paywall apps to you.
It sells made pictures of Cindy Crawfords's daughter from it to the magazine LOVE.
And in their spare time it is to be seen in the Reality TV. Probably only, in order to see their sister Kourtney and their children.
