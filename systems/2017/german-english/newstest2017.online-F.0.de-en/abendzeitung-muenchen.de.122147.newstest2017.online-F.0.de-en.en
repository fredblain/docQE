Jennifer Aniston: I always am into drawers
Jennifer Aniston does not have to be always perfect or successful.
That made now unmistakably clear the Hollywood star in an interview.
“I am put always into drawers or get from the outside label glued on, those with me and the reality usually to do to have little.”
“I do not have the desire to be always perfect and successful.”
The “Ehrlichs said, are me these things rather schnuppe.”
Jennifer Aniston (47) can laugh only at the fact that she is considered as “Miss Perfect”, as she explains in the current “Cosmopolitan”.
Most of all the actress spends her time at home, before the television with loose Dutt and Mexican meal, is called it in the magazine.
To the incandescence bring it the question about the desire to have children: “We women must not be married or have children, to be over perfect”, so the Hollywood star.
In its new film “Mother's Day - love is not children's game” is Aniston as a single mother of two sons to be seen.
The film runs with us starting from 25 August.
