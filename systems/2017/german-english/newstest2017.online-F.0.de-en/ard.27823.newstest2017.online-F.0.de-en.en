Clintons and Trumps economic policy in the comparison: It's all about the money
In infrastructure and the trade agreement invests TTP prevents - both Clinton and Trump want that.
In disagreement itself the two US president shank applicants are however with the tax and energy policy as well as in a matter of principle.
The differences in the economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton a fundamental, rather philosophical difference is the basis.
That, over the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep rather small in the doubt and warns before it, like the state of the economy to harm can - with taxes and adjustments.
Clinton wants to tax and to death adjust the economy to death, says it.
It against it would completely different be, maintains Trump.
It will go back adjustments substantial, and he makes himself strong for an extensive tax revision with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for enterprises.
Clinton against it says: The state has to fulfill certain tasks, it has disadvantaged opportunities to open and needs for it money.
Therefore the taxes for the realms were increased, say them.
Interestingly enough itself both very close with the topic infrastructure is.
Into those, nearly says Trump and Clinton must be invested.
The democratic applicant announces the largest investment into new jobs since the Second World War.
National investment programs into the infrastructure are classical democratic policy and for instance by the state-critical Teaparty wing of the republicans are strictly rejected.
To Trump thus still internal party discussions could come.
The differences are clearer in the energy and climate policy.
Trump wants to build coal-fired power stations and the coal promotion in the USA again for raising.
Oil production should be possible also in areas protected so far, which Paris climate protection agreements wants it to quit.
Clinton against it wants to develop the renewable energies with its investment program expressly and demands: “A country will become the superpower of the clean energies and millions jobs will create.”
“It becomes probably either China, Germany or America its - I want that we are it.”
But not only with the infrastructure - also with international trade agreements the two competitors are not too far from each other distant.
TPP, the transpazifische trade agreement, want not to sign both.
At the same time both want to isolate however the USA not from the international trade - to separate simply only American jobs better to protect.
Those are to be also better paid then, demand for instance Clinton.
The present minimum wage of 7,25 US Dollar is a pittance.
It wants to increase it to 15 dollar per hour.
Which wants to do Trump in this question, is not completely clear: Once he says: The minimum wage must up, then it, he says may not be changed.
But the large discussion of the coming months might develop probably rather around the tax policy of the both bearings.
On the one side stands Trump, which wants to relieve the economy and the citizens, in order to set growth in motion.
Its critics reproach to it, thus became the budgetary deficit only more largely.
On the other side stands Clinton, which wants to require at least of the realms that they pay more taxes, and their critic to say: More taxes are also not the solution.
