Mother of a 6-year old with Mikrozephalie: “It becomes better”
Like most 6-year old Edmund Picciuto loves a singing, toys and naturally its mother.
But like the few its age comrades has Edmund Mikrozephalie, who result of a genetic disturbance, about which his mother Elizabeth Picciuto did not know anything during her pregnancy.
When he came the first time home, my first thought was not, I creates that.
I do not create that.
Whereupon I did not admit myself.
Which is not correct at all -- naturally one admitted on it,” said themselves her.
And their it was communicated to its husband Vincent that Edmund will perhaps never recognize it to be able and that it will not possibly even survive.
Some physicians went even so far that they suggested institutionalizing him.
“My first answer to it was not 'I knew that people make that still,'” explained Picciuto.
Edmund can run with the help of a going assistance.
Edmund could sit up to his third year of life neither nor crawl and he can yet speak.
But it makes progress slow.
It can run with support and bicyclings.
He loves it also to play and sing with its two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language, the Edmund for “please sings itself to me somewhat forwards” invented.”
“We teach sign language to him,” told Picciuto CBS news.
But it is not a typical sign language -- she says. Edmund invented some indications alone.
Mikrozephalie has a variety at causes: genetic as with Edmund as well as infections with viruses such as measles or the Zikavirus during the pregnancy.
The symptoms and prognoses can vary strongly.
It is to be said still too early, how infected it the life with the Zikavirus will affect.
Picciuto remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I constantly asked, what will happened?
What will happen?
And it does not know it yet really.
I did not ask already for a long time no more for the prognosis, because I do not expect that she can really say someone to me.
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of babies with birth damage, which was caused by the Zikavirus.
It becomes better.
They know that it will become better for you.
They will love your child and become your child you to love.
