Simone Biles creates gold in the lady doing gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget hype.
Simone Biles is immune on all that.
Dynamically on the vaulting horse.
Easy on the bar.
Breath-taking one on the ground.
On whole line brilliantly.
And now finally also olympia winner.
The 19-year old American Turnerin ascended on Thursday to the multi-combat title and increased the gap between itself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the searchlight beam of the Olympic Games.
Their total result of 62,198 was appropriate clearly before the silver medal winners and “final Five” - for crew companion Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.

Biles is the fourth heterosexual American, some multi-combat title wins and altogether the fifth, while she strengthens her call to be the best one of their generation or even at all.
It broke out in tears, when their final result was shown and their be enough for travel in this moment an end found.
This success places it into the same league as singular athletes as Michael Phelps, which brought their kinds of sport to new heights:
Biles won the last three years their kind of sport dominated, 15 world champion medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises, which contain a mixture from ambition and precision that the olympia winner said Mary Lou Retton of 1984 of it that it is “the best Turnerin, which I ever saw.”
It expected it a last examination in Brazil, a competition, which did not go so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between it and a load of oversized expectations.
Not with a handful of gold back to the family in jump, Texas return, would be as disappointment to be viewed.

Biles got the first medal on Tuesday, while she served herself on the parting celebration of the crew co-ordinator Martha Karolyi committing in retirement as exclamation mark.
Although Biles insisted on it, during its long way on the point, the future to have never planned, is not really true that.
A part of their ground exercises - which contain its typical Tumbling passport - is co-ordinated with Latin American music, which would fit at home on the road outside of the olympia arena in Rio.
That is not coincidence.
This girl, who was adopted of its grandparents as a small child and discovered of coach Aimee Boormans mother during a school trip into the gymnasium, in the Boorman trained, became the strength.
It lost no more multi-combat competition since the summer 2013, a winning streak, which will so for a long time continue, as it wishes Biles.
Even if Mustafina led by two turns easily, the picture trügte.
Balance beams and floor exercises - in those Biles the world champion title holds - lay in wait.
It got again with 15,433 on the balance beam - and set with 15.933 on the ground still a one on it.
Raisman embraced it gently as it their Endergbnis expected - a pure formality - and tears flowed on Biles shining red, white and blue Eyeliner, when the vision, which described it once in her collecting book, became the reality.
The achievement Raismans was a revenge for the last mark before four years, when it fought for the third place, but the bronze medal in a Tiebrake at Mustafina went.
This time the 22-year old captain, who is called by the Americans “granny”, had a lead.
After its ground exercise she threw kiss hands to the audience, overwhelmed from a comeback, which appeared doubtful sometimes.
Which concerns Biles, then the fast spreading Tweet of the 19-year old has earlier this week a completely new meaning of:
