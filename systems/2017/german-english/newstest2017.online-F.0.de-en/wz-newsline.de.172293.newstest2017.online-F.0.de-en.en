Restful night: Hint against sleep disturbances
In the evening one turns over eternally, at night lies itself one awake for hours, in the morning is already far before that bell bells no longer of sleep to be thought.
That is everything but restful.
One nevertheless is with such problems in good society: According to Robert Koch-Institut about a quarter of the adults sleep disturbances and more do not have their sleep as ten percent to feel frequently or permanently than restful.
How do sleep problems or sleep disturbances express themselves?
There are several forms of sleep disturbances, and various causes can be the basis for them, stress Hans-Günter Weeß, Vorstandsmitglied of the German society for sleep research and sleep medicine.
Which one understands popularly by it, are however the Insomnie, thus an in and a Durchschlafstörung.
Many humans feel straight sleeping through as unsatisfactory or say insufficient, Jens Wagenknecht, Vorstandsmitglied in the German family doctor federation with practice in the Varel of Lower Saxony.
What is behind sleep disturbances?
The causes of sleep disturbances are complex.
Behind it organic, psychological or behavior-conditioned factors, in addition, medicines can put.
Pretty often the sleep disturbance is expression of another illness.
“Very early waking up is particularly frequent with a depression”, says Weeß.
And it can be that different factors cause each other.
Who has for example a herniated disc, can lie badly, wakes up all two to three hours and possibly begins, over everyday problems and - to brood, give Weeß ensure an example.
That leads to strain, and sleep is not possible any longer.
Starting from when should one with sleep disturbances to the physician?
Who sleeps during one period of one month at least three nights per week not well and is impaired on the day, Weeß should go to the physician, guesses/advises.
The impairment can look completely different: One is reduced, tired, unausgeschlafen, has difficulties with the attention and the concentration, is easily attractionable, has changes in mood or physical complaints such as stomach or headache.
In order to alleviate the sleep disturbance, is important it to find their causes out.
As treatment options are applicable among other things changes of behavior, a cognitive behavior therapy or also medicines - classical sleeping pills only in the exceptional case and at the most for two weeks -.
The established sleep medical profession it hardly gives, stresses Leiter of the interdisciplinary sleep-medical center of the Charité university University of Berlin in Germany Professor Ingo Fietze.
Therefore one should turn for sleep problems first to the family doctor, guesses themselves Weeß.
That can clarify with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should in the sleep laboratory, and which happens there?
To the investigation in the sleep laboratory the medical profession guess/advise for example when snoring with breath dropouts, with diseased daily tiredness, with sleep-walkers or if one does not find the cause of a Durchschlafstörung, Fietze explains.
For the investigation to prepare one does not have itself actually.
One should spend the day normally.
“Only please” Fietze make, say no midday sleep.
To wiring one goes to its normal time to bed.
Beside the electrodes at the body one carries nose glasses, a chest belt and a feeler at the finger.
Besides a camera at the cover notes to the sleeping.
How can concerning the problems get into the grasp?
There are rather many set screws, at which one can set for a better sleep.
Weeß enumerates: Regular sleeping and rising times, not too long in bed are, because of the day do not sleep, do not watch television for falling asleep, alcohol avoid and on the clock do not look at night - then one begins to count immediately, and that is not favorable at all.
