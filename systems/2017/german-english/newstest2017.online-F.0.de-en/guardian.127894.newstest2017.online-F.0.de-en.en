Destination plates: who actually buys records?
Lonely men of middle age love plates.
Before you rush to the comment part, in order to scatter it under the alias NichtAlleEinsamenMännerMittlerenAlters with rough offenses, this statement is derived from current data.
According to YouGov the much-discussed rerising of records is on one does not boom in Millennials, which want to welcome the news of physical articles to attribute but to Midlife nostalgia.
Those, which bought recently a plate, are in all probability in the age between 45 and 54.
Indeed the age group of 18-24 is the most improbable buyer category.
It is also no hordes through hobby collecting tanks - it has an emotional meaning: older disk buyers keep their feelings rather for itself (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it spending alone time (69% vs. 66%).
But the results of YouGov are correct?
If these blogs a news report on TV were, the camera would follow me, while I run in the midst of a busy road in Soho, a modest grey suit carries and wildly gestuliere, before I stop, my hands to hold and something determining said how: “Thus, you let a closer look on it throw us.”
Thus, you let a view of it throw us.
Even if the heart Sohos loses slowly at its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices fill now the buildings, in which once independent salespersen resided - still gives it a handful of fantastic disk special firms.
I would probably ask the cameraman to switch the camera off for the next part in which I am located and tried in direct proximity to different men in such business to estimate their age and mind by observation.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I of Sister Ray (data's number: two young women, three men of middle age) in the Reckless record (data's number: eight men of middle age, a woman, probably in order the 20) follow, is long one day because of a meeting into London and goes through the business, in order to fill those few hours.
Is it a collecting tank, asks I?
“I estimate already,” say he.
I have approx. 3,000 or 4,000 plates.
These records, above shown (it sent the snapshot to me by email, did not follow I it home), line the walls of its living room.
The reason, why it possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of its available income: he now is able to buy plates which it could not afford to buy as it published and again articles which it sold, when it was young and broke.
“Many things, which I buy, are from the late 60ern, early 70ern, which appeared, when I was 11 or 12. ” He says things, with which I was too young probably somewhat, in order to buy her to me.
It agrees that and it adds those, which buy plates, rather introverted are and gladly alone time spend: “I do not smoke and I drink not very much.
That is my vice.
Wez, 25, which works at Sister Ray, believes also that many customers, whom it meets apply to the YouGov profile.
He noticed however also a new wave at people, which are affected by the Medienhpe, people, which heard over the comeback and itself arranges to see to buy again their old plates.
From the discussions, which I led, people got rid of their collection usually in such a way around 1998 or 1999.
Customers, who sold once their plates, in order to buy CDs, sell now their CDs, in order to buy again their plates,” say it.
That will boom at supporters of the disk revival of a certain age to explain.
But which is with the alleged emotional meaning of plates?
It takes only some seconds in a business such as Phonica, in order to recognize that a reassuring community of like-minded ones offers disk business.
According to Wez took some the older customers impact at the contactless payment system.
Some disk fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to withdraw itself to stability from familiar record coverings, from articles, which evoke happy youthful memories.
“I think, sometimes can it filling an emptiness or the possession of material properties as a kind comfort be,” say Wez.
That is with me as collecting tank like that and I thinks that it is at many people like that.
It is a simple way to be occupied mentally.
“We are like their social workers!” an employee from a disk pack pipes.
A survey of the ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of the people, which bought last month a plate did not belong it yet.
The survey also found out the fact that 41% possess a record player, which they never use, while 7% those, which buy a plate, does not possess a record player.
At this time the news report I to look probably very anxious, while I leaf by a pile at Bossa new facts compilations.
Jonny, 42, that with sounds OF the university Universities of (data's number: three men of middle age), “aspect of trophy” of the revival works noticed.
“Someone came in only recently here and said: “I do not possess a record player, but I would buy gladly a Radiohead record, so that I can place her in the shelf,” say he.
This is not a large percentage, but it happens definitely.
More produktlastig, less musiklastig.
We have people, which say: “I do not have a record player.”
Those are younger people, not older, which come in only slowly.
Tease, which dedicated nearly a whole floor to the records, a more multicolored audience has, than I go in.
It gives pairs around the 70, tourists, who make photos, tea-gnaw-young and to women of middle age.
Even if the atmosphere roars somewhat less relaxed than into that to business managing specified actual game Beasts of more newly synthesizer and sexbepackter Pop in place of experimental jazz from the loudspeakers - it to see is good, such a diversity at the customers.
None of them looks particularly lonely, but gnawing psychological traumata can be recognized with difficulty, if one stands beside someone 30 seconds long.
Elanora, 27, runs around for some minutes in the business and regards the variety of the plates standing to the sale.
It makes rather one shop window-strolls as a bulk buying.
She does not earn much, therefore collecting plates is not a real option, says it.
It costs much.
It is to be heard easily music by a computer or on other way, but the beauty of plates is…” it drives off with a sigh fallen in love.
I do not know, as I it to explain am - it is really singular.
My last stop is a business, by which it is said that a new generation of disk lovers is to have inspired: Urban Outfitters.
While I give the appearance to examine the jeans hot pant I observe a group of young tea gnawing girls, who group themselves for one moment around Polaroid cameras, before a father and its daughter consider themselves, a Crosley record players to buy.
To linking is a stairway, a wall of full plates of ennobles, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classical authors, the essential plates for an average collection.
Nobody sees itself it to on perhaps, because they are only purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch her.
It is pure “disk art”.
But considering its that for the industry it means each attraction for these articles more funds and into the depths Sohos for more fancy would know some customers, it does not give it to anything, in order to weight.
It is not a surprise that a subpopulation, which has more time and money than others is also that, which spends at most on luxury articles such as plates.
Even if my investigations showed that results of YouGov are correct, leave it, at least in disk business in Soho, which large number of female collectors and disk lovers, which exist in the reality, disk business and in online forums, unconsidered.
These humans work probably hard at school or in offices.
They do not spend their Thursday tomorrow with security with strolling by disk business of Berwick Street and leafing by plates, while they avoid the staring view uncanny, 30-year old wrong moderator, which rises over the shoulders nothing suspecting men of middle age.
