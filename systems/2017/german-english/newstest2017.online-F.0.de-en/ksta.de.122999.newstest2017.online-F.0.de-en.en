Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes the Internet hit
Always the Olympians or world records do not determine the headlines with the Olympic Games.
That points the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte with the summer games to Rio de Janeiro.
In the Aquatics center swam the easily overweight float from Ethiopia so slowly that it was not to be seen occasionally no more in the TV-pictures.
It disappeared simply - no matter how was far the cutout selected.
In the social networks Habte became following the viral Internet hit.
The 24-year old with a residue of 48 seconds its advance actually terminates and occupied the 59. Place of 59 starters.
It was however rather its not straight sporty figure, which drew the attention of the international media on itself.
Why does the 24-year old at the Olympic Games participate nevertheless?
The Ethiopian got a right of kind of separating from the international swimming federation.
This is distributed, in order to make a swimming in underrepresented countries more well-known.
Since in Äthopien most sportsmen run, Habte wanted to make just something else.
Preparation is everything: Robel Kiros Habte makes itself finished for large running.
The first nicknames made the round fast.
Some media called it “Robel the whale”.
Following a “prosperity belly” the English tabloid made itself “The Sun” with “Dad Bod” over it hilariously.
His time, it fastened only with one minute and nearly five seconds over the 100 meters freestyle, played there no role.
Comparisons with “Eric the Eel” were drawn likewise.
With the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney the run of Eric Moussambani provided for medial attention.
The appearance of the float from Equatorial Guinea was unforgettable, when it had to begin in an advance over 100 meters freestyle alone.
Frenetically Moussambani was encouraged at that time.
The at that time 22-year old learned to swim only eight months before Olympia and before the match never a so long distance had completed.
