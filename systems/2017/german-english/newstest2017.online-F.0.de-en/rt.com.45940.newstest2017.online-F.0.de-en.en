Jewish director smashes citizen of Berlin hotel, because Israeli preselection was removed for blank news after “Arab” request -
A French director with Jewish roots provoked a medium riot, after he had betrayed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli preselection, there it Arab guests according to an employee “would have requested”.
Claude Lanzmann, Autor of the Holocaust documentation “Shoah” omitted his annoyance in the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During its last stay Lanzmann Israel on the land preselection list of the hotel tried to find.
The country was not listed however between the countries, which can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in the year 2016 in Berlin, for the capital of new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and deleted?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead the Kempinksi Bristol offers a possibility of selecting Israel over its own call center.
Looking for an explanation the director turned to the hotel reception.
The answer, which it received there, “shocked it”, as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said that the measure was a “intentional decision of the management of the Kempinski hotels.”
The reason, which stood behind it, released more rage in the director still.
“The majority of our guests Arabs and they have required that the preselection is deleted,” the employee by Lanzmann were quoted.
The Israeli Ambassadors in Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a “large dishonor”, reports the newspaper Süddeutsche.
We were frightened and dismayed of this event.
That is really very embarrassingly.
The fact that this happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain, is even a still larger dishonor.
That does not require an explanation.
We expect that the hotel draws “the correct conclusions,” said the office-holder.
The incident released a rather large resonance on the Internet, with which the people called the whole a scandal.
Some subordinated hotel to the Kempinski that it would have given way to the alleged requests of Arab guests “”.
“You,” meant it is ashamed in another contribution, in which it was pointed out that the hotel, which is at noble Kurfürstendamm stands in the proximity of a synagogue.
The hotel pointed fast all accusations from itself and called the incident a “mistake” and “apologized” with Lanzmann, reports Der Spiegel.
“There was never a direct instruction” not to take up Israel to the speed calling list” quoted the newspaper Süddeutsche a spokesman of the Kempinski hotels.
It adds that the land preselection was now added.
