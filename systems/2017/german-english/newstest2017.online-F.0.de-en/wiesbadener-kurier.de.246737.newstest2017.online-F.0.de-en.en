One for all cases
Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for daily use
Into the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: little SUV, little coupé and also still the versatility of a minivan.
Sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, which was designed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves in the everyday life as expressed flexible.
Although only the 1.60 m work high HR-V rather small, the passengers have both in the front row and in the fund much place, works nowhere closely.
The materials of the interior are well finished and work pleasantly, only the cockpit top side drop there somewhat.
More versatile than comparable vehicles the HR-V is with the reservoir.
A trunk is not only available highranking and 1026 l of 453 l at with turned down backrests, but there are the “Magic Seat”.
That is less magic, than it sounds: The seat faces of the back bank can be lifted up and offered like cinema armchairs thereby reservoir, which is high from the ground to covering 1.24 m.
The trunk can be loaded well, however loading height with 650 mm is somewhat higher than with comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1,6-l-Diesel with 88 kW/120 HP accelerates the HR-V owing to the torque of up to 300 Nm in far speed ranges very strong.
He might perform its work however somewhat more quietly.
The everyday life consumption of 4,7 l/100 km is pleasing.
There is still another further motorization: a 1,5-l-Benziner with 96 kW/130 HP.
An all-wheel drive is not offered.
The handling is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
The steering element might be somewhat more direct however.
The equipment does not leave desires open in the tested Top variant “Executive”.
To the safety systems belong the town center emergency brake assistant (works to speed 32), the collision warning system and the trace retaining assistant.
The Kollisionswarner irritates sometimes, because it evaluates many obstacles when ranking as “approaching objects”.
The high beam assistant works very reliably.
And the intelligent speed controller reacted to the road sign recognition and throttles if necessary the speed.
Full connectivity gives it however only for the Top equipment: 7-Zoll-Touchscreen, Navi, app integration and more.
Two USB and a HDMI socket are under the arm rest and are somewhat pedantic therefore to reach.
Those approximately 29000 euros for the well equipped Top Diesel are correct.
Who does not want to invest so much, receives the gasoline-driven car starting from 20000 euros, the Diesel starting from 23000 euros.
The engines fulfill the Euro-6-Abgasnorm.
With the HR-V Honda offers a versatile and suitable for daily use car.
