Community, spirit, health: Sing do seniors well
Singing already accompanied Ursel Kipp their whole life: As a young girl it was in the school choir, in the teaching profession study occupied it the subject music, and today the 78-year old in a senior choir sings.
“Singing moves me - emotional and physically”, it describes.
For a sample it feels balanced, merrily and altogether more alive, says themselves it.
Completely besides she does thereby to her health and her spirit of something property.
Because singing is directly from several perspectives a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler of the German senior league.
Most seniors sing in the choir and divide with like-minded ones the joy in the music, describe Hackler.
By regular gathering seniors can social contacts attach and maintain.
Because frequently social and family structures at the age dissolve, a choir are then an ideal opportunity, in order to spend time with other humans.
This experience made also Ursel Kipp in its choir: To deny themselves “and organize to be able and from each other learn to rely on the others - a choir is a completely special form of gathering”.
To sing Hackler can be arduous in the positive sense, means.
Because seniors train a deep and controlled respiration.
Who demands its lung regularly, does not come also in the everyday life so fast from the breath.
Even if it concerns, the sound of the voice at the age too received, singing is an optimal hobby.
On older humans singing has often a completely special effect, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Association of Labor of the senior organizations.
In the older generations common singing had a much higher value, it belonged to the everyday life, both at school and in the spare time, explains it.
Lenz observes frequently that singing or hearing songs wakes many memories with older humans, often connected with positive feelings of their youth time.
By song texts and melodies dementia-gotten sick humans particularly remember themselves for a long time past events.
When singing the head besides a special achievement is demanded, explains Lenz.
To concentrate at the same time on the own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt thereby to the other singers - that is a large cognitive challenge.
Straight older humans, who live alone, practice in such a way, not to only concentrate on itself.
Another positive aspect is the acknowledgment, which one experiences by singing in the choir, means Hackler.
An enthusiastic audience is great praise.
Also the self-esteem grows by singing in the choir.
To be it shown: If I practice for a long time for something, I become better and exceed over me - this experience strengthens.
, In order to begin with singing, there are good reasons thus enough.
Who wants to try a new hobby out, should not hesitate - even if he means to have little talent guesses/advises Lenz.
One does not sing alone - with 50 singing humans, who hears there already, if times a tone goes beside it?
In the search for the suitable offer have seniors different possibilities, says Hackler.
If someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a senior choir, one can follow simply.
In addition many cities offer overviews of the choirs in the environment.
Who would like to sing in a church choir, can contact directly the community or the church chief.
One finds many senior choirs also over the Internet.
Who does not have an entrance to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbour can ask for assistance with the Internet search.
Who has desire to sing, should themselves absolutely a choir attach, guesses/advises Hackler.
Sing does to the soul well and has something release - is valid for each age.
