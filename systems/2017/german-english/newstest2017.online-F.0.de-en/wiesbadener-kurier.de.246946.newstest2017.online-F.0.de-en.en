Airline does not cling: Fall on aircraft passenger bridge
An airline is not responsible for the fall of a passenger on the aircraft passenger bridge.
Because a liability is only with dangers conceivably, which are typical for air traffic, argued the higher regional court Duesseldorf (Az.: 18 U 124/14).
The plaintiff had broken with the fall a kneecap.
The accident could have however everywhere happened - so the court concerns a general life risk.
The airline did not have to pay compensation to the man.
