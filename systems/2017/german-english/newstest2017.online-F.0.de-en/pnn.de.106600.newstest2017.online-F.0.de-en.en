Greenland shark: The oldest vertebrate animal is nearly 400 years old
Rare sight.
Greenland sharks come usually only in the winter to the surface.
This shark was allowed after an investigation on board the research ship Sanna in the sea back.
It was born 1624 and swims with well 1 km/h by the North Atlantic - until today.
Greenland sharks get only with 150 years new generation.
Leisurely the Greenland shark swims at the reason of the North Atlantic along, in one hour comes it on the average straight 1,220 meters far.
Only if it depends on it, accelerated that five meters long animal on full 2.6 km/h - and is half as fast with this maximum speed as a seal.
This lifestyle coined by tardiness seems to be however a ready-made solution for a great age.
Julius Nielsen of the university of Copenhagen and its colleagues anyhow report in the technical periodical “Science” of a Greenland shark, which could be 392 years old.
“Insanity”, commentates Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life-span, which means a world record for vertebrate animals.
The evolution biologist assumed for a long time that Greenland sharks become aged.
The proofs were only missing.
Greenland sharks are difficult to observe, finally live them particularly in the polar sea before the thinly settled coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they emerge at the surface usually only in the winter.
About the lifestyle of the Greenland sharks researchers know according to few.
They measured their slow-motion, when they equipped six animals before Spitzbergen with a transmitter.
These sharks make booty nevertheless: In the stomach of an animal researcher found the remnants of a seal, another the jaw bone of a young polar bear had swallowed.
Possibly they hunt sleeping animals or patrol at the reason of the polar sea and look for carcasses, which stagger downward from higher water layers.
Julius Nielsen and its colleagues examined now 28 Greenland sharks, which got Fischer between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spitzbergen as by-catch from the depth of the North Atlantic.
The smallest shark was straight 81 centimeters long, while measured largest 502 centimeters.
In order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens core of the sharks with the Kohlenstoff-14-Methode.
This center of the eyepiece develops already before the birth of the sharks, which become therein contained proteins later no more renewed.
The two smallest sharks had remarkably much Kohlenstoff-14 in the lens core.
Their birth should lie from there after the early 1960er years, when nuclear tests hurled larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
In the animal third-smallest with 220 centimeters length contained the lens core against it a small surplus of Kohlenstoff-14 from the nuclear tests, it might when its investigation in the year 2012 thus its 50. Birthday celebrated.
All larger Greenland sharks had normal Kohlenstoff-14-Mengen, which results from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere in their lens core against it.
The Kohlenstoff-14-Uhr for a 493 centimeter actually showed long Greenland shark an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimeters might be even 392 years old.
The fact that Greenland shark females get only then new generation if they are longer than four meters, was well-known.
Now the researchers could assign an age to the length.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold to sexual maturity and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland sharks with increase leave themselves obviously at least one and a half centuries time.
Also that might be for vertebrate animals world record at present.
That such Methuselahs live particularly in icy waters, is no coincidence.
Also the past record holder, a 211 years old bowhead whale, into whose bacon at the neck 120 years an old harpoon point was, became imprisoned before Alaska.
By the low temperatures frequently also the organism of the there living animals runs on low flame.
They mature thus later - and age more slowly.
In order to keep itself warm in the cold water, the animals become besides often particularly largely.
Because the volume grows many faster than its surface, by which the animal loses warmth.
The calorific loss of a gram of mouse is much larger from there than with a gram elephant.
A further advantage: They have less enemy.
“A smaller animal lives thus more dangerously and should concentrate as early as possible as many as possible descendant to have”, explains the evolution biologist Scheuerlein.
A very large animal should invest against it its resources rather into a long life.
