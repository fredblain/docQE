Which has the Dschungelcamp with missing medals in swimming too
The former German float Markus Deibler expressed itself by Facebook for disappointing cutting of the DSV team off with Olympis.
In December 2014 it had gotten and set up gold with the short course world championships in Doha for the first time thereby its first world record at the same time.
Now the former DSV athlete placed itself Markus Deibler via Facebook protecting before its ex-Teamkollegen in the criticism.
“In a country, in which an olympia winner gets 20.000€ premium and a jungle king 150.000€ should themselves surprise nobody at missing medals”, wrote the 26-year old at the night to Friday on his Facebook side.
The haulage system in swimming is badly, doping controls however very good.
With it we cannot compete with countries, which promote very much and with the topic doping do not look so exact or it to even operate.
“I do not say that controls are to be stopped here”, explained he further.
If it wanted to start a comeback, Deibler would have to be announced already nine months before its first start of the national Anti-doping agency Germany (NADA).
Exactly the same one should hold it also with countries.
“Who can be controlled not a certain time before WM/OS by independent testers of the WADA/FINA, may not participate”, demands for that choice elections, which operates meanwhile an ice-cream parlor.
