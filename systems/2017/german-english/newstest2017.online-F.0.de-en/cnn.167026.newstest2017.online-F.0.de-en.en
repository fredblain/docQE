Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That is, which I introduce myself under the woman Olympic team in doing gymnastics and which from more than one reason.
First of all I participate since 1984 with each Summer Olympic Games and the USA was never so dominantly.
And secondly: This crew has three turn gutters, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren “Laurie” Hernandez, which worked for many young girls of other skin color inspiring.
Structure this crew, which Aly Raisman, which is Jew and is Madison Kocian, the catholic, round off, make everyone proudly.
This crew reflects finally the USA.
It solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the point of this kind of sport.
In the last four years the number one was under the female turn gutters an Afro American.
Last year were Simone and Gabby #1 and #2.
That shows strength.
With the last Olympic Games a Gabby Douglas's was surprising olympia winner and America was jubilant.
Now the world in the position, a witness of the unbelievable achievement of the three-way world champion Simone Biles was to be Douglas and Laurie Hernandez like it unexpected, but masterful Gymastikroutinen supplied.
On Thursday Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American, who won during an individual multi-combat event for women Gold.
Crew member Aly Raisman won silver.
We experience the point of this kind of sport, but turn classes do not look generally speaking country in such a way.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie knocked all the same way as Aly and Madison, in order to create it into the olympic team.
They are the “last five”, because the next Olympic team will have only four turn gutters in the crew. In addition that is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a coach.
But the reality looks in such a way that doing gymnastics an expensive sport is and gymnasts are responsible primarily in private gymnastics clubs, which will maintain from parents those for the training, facility, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the coaches and their gymnast and families). The list can be continued at will.
The majority of these gymnastics clubs lie in wealthy suburbs, which can support the business.
In these clubs the gymnasts receive their entire training and that are for the families an expensive and long-term commitment.
Aimee Boorman, Trainerin of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, Trainerin of Laurie Hernandez, have both their athletes to have trained, since then her with doing gymnastics to have begun.
We must make aun innumerable, young girls, who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, for the communities possible a leistbareres and more easily accessible Turntrainung.
I created my turn foundation of 20 years.
With my events we ordered free and affordable doing gymnastics in Harlem for over 15.000 urban young people (above all black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown), in order to offer to the youth high-quality doing gymnastics, which earn the possibility of learning and of profiting from this great olympic kind of sport to.
Do gymnastics develop strength, flexibility and co-ordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and certainty for the spirit.
This combination offers lifelong advantages for the health as well as for school and vocational success.
The inspiration of this crew, which thousand young girls bring to it, is to be interested in doing gymnastics and that is great.
It is so important to participate in the sport particularly for girls.
That is a in such a way stretching time.
Thank if Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this genuine representation of “Girl power” by getting the olympic crew gold and, if barrel it thanks so many young girls with different background motivated to become in order to begin their way, healthy, strong and successful young women.
