Treats wants Nacktkalendar for “women and for men”
The Treats magazine co-operates with the photographer David Bellemere, in order to bring 1970's an Pirelli inspired Kalendar out for 2017.
But in place of famous naked humans they would like to find for its NU Muses Kalendar for 2017 the next generation of top model.
The editor-in-chief von Treats Steve Shaw told us beginning this year that its naked magazine differs from Oldschool Playboys, there “Playboy for men is”.
I make for women.
Apparently is it the opinion that it also does the Kalendar.
“We must return again to the representation of timeless and classical Nackheit, with which both women and men feel well and inspired by these pictures of a female body feel,” said Shaw in a press release to the publication of the Kalendars.
Women will want to participate in this project, because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit their pictures online or personally with open casting call in Los Angeles and New York.
