The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, “I white, New York is change, but I cannot believe yet that CBGB is dead, Chelsea Hotel now exceptionally and verb a soap business.”
But if New York is change, then it is also reinvention.
A revived verb cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but has still some the same employees and a similarly simple atmosphere.
The coffee is also still good.

There are brown rice dishes.
The café serves no more beer, but there are fresh juices.
After nine months Rodriguez said that he had noticed a constant river at old regular customers.
“Many old customers were displaced likewise by prices from William castle,” said it.
On one Sunday Rebecca Oliveira such a customer was recent.
