Datenklau: So perfidiously hackers extort their ransom money
Programmers von Erpressungs-Malware seize up-to-date aimed enterprises on and are successful thereby.
According to a current survey of the malware defense specialists malware bytes under 540 enterprises in North America, Great Britain and Germany 40 percent of the asked companies became at least once, partly repeated in the past twelve months victims of an attack with blackmailer software.
In Germany scarcely 20 percent of the companies was already once a goal of an Ransomware extortion.
Readily the ransom money demanded by the perpetrators paid 40 percent of the victims, in order to be able to use the attacked systems and data again.
The perpetrators specialize their blackmailer software appreciably according to the observations of malware bytes in attacks into firm networks.
If they are there successful, that fails potential ransom money which can be extorted clearly more highly than with private users.
“We observe up-to-date a terrifying fast evolution of the malware”, explain malware byte boss of Marcin Kleczynski in the discussion with the “world”.
2008 was appropriate most malware programs still to send advertisement away.
Then the perpetrators discovered extortion software for itself.
First private users were the goal, but the change to firm attacks took place in the past months alarmingly fast.
Ransomware works after a simple sample: Once on the computer of a victim actively, it looks for purposefully after recently changed files as for instance Word, Excel or database files as well as after archives of pictures and videos.
These files code the Ransomware and delete the originals effectively.
Subsequently, the software presents the demands of the blackmailers.
In order the final key code to the files too gotten, the victims money - usually in form of the Cryptowährung Bitcoin - must transfer.
But where with private users the personal photo database stands on the play, it concerns at companies sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production stands still.
Accordingly more highly the damage fails, if a Ransomware slams shut.
22 percent of the German companies concerned turnover losses announced by Ransomware, to 13 percent had even the business activity completely to interrupt, to a case were humans in mortal danger.
In Germany hospitals victims of attacks, whose patient can be threatened by the loss of patient documents acutely, were already repeated.
“We always say to the victims: Does not pay, if you promotes thereby only the problem”, Kleczynski explains.
But 80 to 90 percent of the companies, which pay, gets their data back.
For managers it is difficult to reject in view of stop in the enterprise the demand of the perpetrators.
The hackers again know that and try everything, in order to develop a good reputation.
In a current study the safety researchers of F-Secure examined the user surfaces and the contact with the blackmailers and to come to the result: The perpetrators actually try to develop a kind customer service in order to take more funds.
They explain to their victims by chat, how they can pay by Bitcoin, furnish freely accessible support websites or decode in vain example files.
And private individuals are released after payments by few hundred euros, must negotiate enterprises partly hard and pay sums of five figures, in order to get back their data unencrypted.
In view of the potential high and profits relatively without risk from the Ransomware extortion the hackers ever more professionally and to divide the work, explains itself security expert Chester Wisniewski of the anti-virus provider Sophos: “Individual person can write a Ransomware about within one week.”
More probable is it however that it concerns three or four people.
The programmers sell their malware then in form of a software component system to the actual blackmailers.
The past malware kits developed, as the malware, consultation and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollar were bought.
“Adjustment tools are contained in the scope of supply, so that smaller configurations, appearance and development of brands can be changed”, say Wisniewski.
The blackmailers look for each other then further hackers, in order to spread the freshly bought software among the victims.
We live in a service economy.
One logs oneself thus into one of the forums in the underground, buys the set of a criminal one and assigns a further to install the software on as much as possible PCs.
The payment takes place per infected computer.
“Usually the criminal ones assign then spammer the spreading”, explain Wisniewski.
The risk of Ransomware is meanwhile well-known with many enterprises, which secure their data better.
Over 50 percent trust the company IT responsible person in the malware byte survey to be able to repel Ransomware by means of file baking UPS and Scannersoftware.
Accordingly the perpetrators pursue already new strategies.
“If the encoding of data alone no sufficient threat for successful Erpessung more is, threatens the perpetrators instead with the publication of sensitive data as for instance, malware byte boss of Marcin Kleczynski explains customer master lists or price estimations”.
Thus the damage potential is higher depending upon kind of the data still around a multiple than before.
Also the perpetrators could take in the future completely new goals on the Internet the things on the grain.
To the conference of hacker Defcon demonstrated safety researchers, how they could get a connected thermostat with the Internet under their control.
In the middle in the winter de-energizing of an in such a manner blocked heating so some victim could quite be worth a ransom money.
If the perpetrators block a whole production line in a factory then instead of the heating in the future, Ransomware could become also in the industry 4,0 a topic.
