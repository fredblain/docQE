Salzburger “west Side story” with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare year the Salzburger of festivals presents the “west Side story” with Tony and Maria as tragic lovers, similarly as Romeo and Julia.
Also with it a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: the “west Side story”, Leornard of amber masterpiece.
The artistic chief Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple the classical period and fulfilled themselves with the role Maria a youth dream.
In the orchestra pit Simón Bolívar orchestra under line of the venezonalischen conductor Gustavo Dudamel: “This music is full rhythm”, swarms it.
We always say that them are very Latin American coined.
There are many Latin American ingredients in its speed and its melody.
It is a marvelous mixture, the perfect the recipe for our orchestra.
I would say that we have amber music really in our blood!
In this production Bartoli plays older Maria become.
It remembers with nostalgia its affair with Tony, while younger Maria plays and dances.
The role Maria always fascinated me.
First of all because it is in music unusual!
And then there still Marias would be personality.
She says it in her song: “I feel pretty, oh pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright in such a way”.
It is thus intelligently, naturally also naively, and very passionately.
“Resembles you me much, my Italian character, which I have as a Roman”, laugh Bartoli.
Dudamel is full of the praise for the opera singer: “Cecilia is a marvelous artist.”
It is to be worked so an honour for us with it.
She is tremendously generous humans.
And Bartoli returns the radix complement: “Dudamel is very passionate such an unusual artist and!”
Directs is for it a necessity.
One sees it in everyone its movements, in its views, it is its life!
It is to be able to divide so an enormous opportunity this musical experience with it.
We have both a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a merry approach to the life, that are at all very important!
For the American director Philip Wm. McKinley is topical the “west Side story”: “In this piece it concerns prejudices and fanaticism.”
Today we have the refugees, at that time the Puertorikaner to New York went, and the New Yorker inhabitants did not want them.
There is the same topics, and they are today just as meaningful as at that time.
59 years later the piece is still relevant.
