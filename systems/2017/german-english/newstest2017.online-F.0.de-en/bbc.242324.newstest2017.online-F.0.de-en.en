Assistant physicians strike: Demands for new forms of industrial action
Deputies of the assistant physicians called their trade union to approve new forms of industrial action with their disputes concerning a new contract.
The Junior Doctors's Committee (JDC) that British Medical Association (BMA) demanded its entire advice to approve starting from at the beginning of September more forms of industrial action.
The JDC stated that it Ministers would have neglected to deal with the concerns concerning the contract.
Assistant physicians and medical students co-ordinated in July on the refusal of a contract, which was agreed upon with the BMA.
It was rejected of 58% of its members, that co-ordinated with the elections.
In a letter to the members, which was published on Thursday evening on Twitter, the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government would have remained “persistently calm” to problems, which led to the fact that the contract was rejected.
She said: “Considering its JDC executive committee co-ordinated to reject the suggested new contract completely and to all your concerns requested official renegotiations.”
When the JDC executive committee has today a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA of advice placed answer to the silence of the government, in order a current program of escalating forms of industrial action, at the beginning of Septembers begins to approve.
The disputes led to it that assistant physicians struck this year six times, the first blackouts in the history of NHS.
The director/conductor of the BMA of assistant physicians Dr. Johann Malawana withdrew after the choice for the refusal of the agreed upon contractual conditions, which had been recommended of the BMA.
It communicated BMA to members during the meetings, which took place still before the vote by 54.000 assistant physicians and medical students, that the contract was favorable and should be accepted.
After the vote the minister of health Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for physicians would obligatorily be introduced to England.
