“A generation protests” in Ethiopia, Long an allying of the USA
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators, who demand political changes in Ethiopia, encountered violent resistance of the government.
Witnesses state that tens of protesting was killed during the collisions with the police with shootings.
Is to be broken down Ethiopia about?
In the last ten years it was one of the sturdiest countries of Africa, a solid allying of the west with a fast growing economy.
But in the last months protests shook the country against the government and expanded into more and more areas.
Last week stormed thousands of people on the roads and required fundamental political changes.
The answer the government was merciless according to human rights organizations.
Witnesses indicated that policemen shot and killed at tens of unarmed demonstrators.
In the circulation videos present over the protests, which are supposed from the latter or at the beginning of this year, show up like security personnel young people with sticks strike, while these were forced to make a handstand against a wall.
The boss of the un agency for human rights requires now a detailed investigation.
“It was always difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even still more difficult,” said Rashid Abdi, the project manager the horn of Africa that internationally Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is to Nigeria the most densely populated country of Africa and its stability becomes estimated from the west.
American Militär-und of secret services co-operates closely with the Ethiopians, in order to fight dangers of terrorism beyond the region, in particular in Somalia. Only few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much western assistance.
Of Ethiopia economy expanded in the considerable speed.
Its infrastructure improved drastically - it gives a new commuter course in the capital to Addis Abeba.
The roads are usually calmly, safe and clean.
Even if Ethiopia everything else were as a model for democracy - human rights organizations stated sequentially the suppression by the government - the opposition in the country became reduced, whereby dissidents were effectively hushed.
Many were sent, killed into the exile or into the prison or floated into the widths of the desert.
But that could change.
“If you people suppress and this no other options have except to protest, break it off,” said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia.
The entire youth protests.
A generation protests.
There are numerous complaints, which take everything off of the use of land up to the stranglehold regarding power of the governing coalition.
After an extensively criticized choice the governing party and control its allied ones the last seat of the opposition received last year and now 100 percent of the parliament.
At the same time the tensions rise along the border to Eritrea; a fight for this jagged, disputed line demanded hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo liberation front or the national liberation front of the Ogaden, which was more or less defeated in the last years, which could turbulences use and again arm themselves.
Several factors explain, why feelings of the embitterment explode after years before itself of the Hinköchelns under the surface now.
First seems harmless: Smartphones.
Only in the last years a great many Ethiopians in the position were to communicate by means of the social media since cheaper smartphones became ever more frequent and improved the Internet services.
Even if the government closes the entrance to Facebook and Twitter, which does it in regular intervals, particularly with protests, many people can communicate still over Internet Proxies, which hide, where they are.
Several young Ethiopians indicated that they met in such a way to protests.
The second factor is the fact that it more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas which, gives two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
Since Äonen prospered the Amharas, which come from Äthopiens predominantly Christian highlands, in which politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, from which many Muslims are and live in flat country areas.
In addition, changes.
“We are about to coordinate under a screen” said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The largest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia unfair-proves by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray is dominated, those approximately 6 percent of the population to constitute and in the military, in the secret services, in the trade and the policy dominantly are.
The third reason for the riots is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was 2012 17 years long up to its death at a not publicly made illness in the year of Ethiopia prime minister.
It was viewed as a tactical genius, a man, who could think around corners.
To analysts say that it was particularly experienced to notice early signs of discontent and use particular agents, in order opponents to work on and it innocuous make.
“It is missing to the present regime at this basic fate,” said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Of Ethiopia of new prime ministers, Hailemariam Desalegn, for relatively obscure reasons was selected, in order to take the position of Mr. Meles.
Differently than Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of north Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say that it does not enjoy the confidence from the Tigray controlled security agencies.
Many fear that the result more bloodshed will be.
The last mark that Ethiopia experienced such a riot was 2005, after thousands protested against elections, which bungled according to information of analysts apparently from the government and were afterwards stolen.
During the raids following on it many protesting were killed, even if than in the last months were less and this time of the riots passed relatively fast.
Development experts praised of Ethiopia leader for their visionary infrastructure planning, like the new commuter course, as well as for its measurable progress with the fight against poverty.
But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal disfavor of the Ethiopian government.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Protesting in Gondar, a amharischen city, of Tigray led business attacked last month and the hate opposite the Tigray become ever more usual in the social media.
Analysts say that the protests bring the USA and other western allied one into their own position.
The American government used Ethiopia as basis for Dronenflüge over the neighbouring Somalia, even if it communicated recently that she closed this basis.
While the west wants to support clearly the democracy, it does not want that its allying in an already volatile area breaks down.
“This,” said Mr. Abdi, “is a very thin tightrope walk.”
