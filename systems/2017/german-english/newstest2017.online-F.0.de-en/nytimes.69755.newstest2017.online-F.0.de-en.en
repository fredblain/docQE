Military guidance falsifies ISIS Geheimdienstinformationen, determines committee of the congress
Military personnel of the United States cent ral COMMAND would locally have permitted, announced changed intelligence information to draw over a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic state in Iraq and in Syria than it the actual conditions a committee of inquiry of the congress in a report on Thursday.
The provisional report, provided by a task Force of the republican members of the Streitkräftekommitees, Geheimdienstkommitees and the Wehrbudgetkommites, reports of large discontent under cent ral COMMAND secret service analysts, which reported, how superiors changed their estimates to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic state.
The cent ral the COMMAND, briefly Cencom, is military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which steers the American military operations in the Near East and central Asia.
“Intelligence information, which of high-ranking Centcom commanders were typically nodded through, drew regularly a more positive picture of the American efforts against the terrorism as it the actual conditions would locally have permitted and was constantly more positive than analyses of other intelligence services”, quoted a newspaper article the report.
“Which happened, is with the Centcom unacceptable - our soldiers suffer, if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders”, determined Ken Calvert, republican member of the house of representatives.
The guidance errors in the Centcom reach up to the highest point of the organization.
The ten-page report shows details steady problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi armed forces.
Although it does not supply direct pointing out that tops of the government among Obama's gave instructions to change the reports shows it, like analysts the pressure of their Vorgesetzen suspended saw itself, a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic state, also well-known than ISIS or ISIL to draw.
“During the first half-year 2015 many cent ral COMMANDs press releases, statements and statements before the congress were clearly more positively than it the facts correspond” determined the report.
For example a Centcom of members announced publicly that a military recapture Mossuls could already begin in April or May 2015.
Mossul, second largest city Iraq, remains further under control of the Islamic state.
“After months of investigations, so much is clear.” Mike Pompeo, republican congressional representatives from Kansas, in a statement said.
From the center of the year 2014 up to the center of the year 2015 the points of the cent ral COMMAND changed the intelligence reports, in order to play the danger down by ISIS in Iraq.
The republicans brought the task Force into being, after them it was passed on that analysts worryd themselves regarding the manipulation from reports to the Islamic state.
On Thursday published report will be completed still by more detailed realizations during the investigations to be continued.
Further investigations of the Centcom of reports are additional by the general inspector of the Ministry of Defense under way.
Democratic members of the Nachrichtendienstekomittees published their own realizations, which agreed with some of the conclusions of the republican task Force on Thursday.
“In the years 2014 and 2015 the Centcom created an excessively limited process for the production from intelligence estimates to ISIL and the Iraqi security agencies”, announced the höchstrangige democrat in the committee, member in the house of representatives Adam B. Schiff, in a statement.
This process, so Mr. Schiff, “delayed the publication of intelligence reports”, damaged the moral under analysts and “excessively gave little area for deviating opinions.”
But Mr. Schiff and the democrats indicated, no referring to an intervention of the white house for the Centcom analysts regarding “determined political opinion” have found.
The provisional results of the investigations of the congress were published on Tuesday by “The DAILY Beast”.
In past August New York Times von Ermittlungen reported the Pentagon, who were accepted after complaints by Centcom analyst by the general inspector.
As per Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a press spokesman the Pentagon, indicated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not commentate reports of the congress, while the investigations of the general inspector were still under way.
But it also indicated that “experts have sometimes quite diverging opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversy discussion of these important topics of the national defense.”
The investigations have reactions over the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria outside (a statement, which is made in the meantime by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).
The accusations of the past year raised however the question, to what extent president Obama can rely on the cent ral the COMMAND for honest estimates of the military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis zones.
The criticism regarding the secret information about the Islamic state remind of disputes from more than ten years ago, than a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker wrote, a document over it, like the government at that time under George W. Bush against the recommendations of many analysts only a small occupation troop in Iraq planned and little time on it distorted, to make itself over the consequences of the invasion from 2003 thoughts to.
Mr. Hooker played also a key role with the rebellion against the present reporting over the Islamic state.
Last year the team places around Mr. Hooker according to government agencies firmly that against the statements the government air strikes would not have significant effects against the refineries thought of the Islamic state on the financial situation of the terrorist group, since these provisional refineries would have taken in enterprise, in order to sell oil on the black market.
This realization was not published however, reported the Times in September.
Centcoms of commanders at that time, gene. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislation because of its excessively positive estimate of the war situation with a hearing before the senate.
General Austin went in April into the retirement and became with the cent ral COMMAND by gene. Joseph L. Votel replaces.
