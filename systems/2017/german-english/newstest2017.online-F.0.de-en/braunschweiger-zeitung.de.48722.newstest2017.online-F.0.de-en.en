Who builds of Braunschweig favorable apartments?
The SPD and the Green mean: Investors are to be taken in the future much more strongly into the obligation.
How does one react to the bad message that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 favorable apartments in the next years?
The SPD suggests a “action concept living” for next council meeting.
But controversy is programmed.
Primarily it concerns the question: Who is to actually build the favorable apartments?
A regulation is missing so far.
SPD faction leader Christoph Bratmann means: “We are us with the Greens united: Who wants to build on urban surfaces, in the future 20 percent of all apartments than subsidized low-rent housings must prove.”
The favorable apartments can develop however also in the existence.
The large point at issue in the city hall is however, like that roasting man: “As one deals with investors, those on private surfaces to build wants?”
“We want that investors on such surfaces build at least 10 percent, but as 20 a percent of the apartments as possible as subsidized low-rent housings.”
A new urban housebuilding advancement program, which will cost millions and still must be financed, is to provide for incentives.
The problem, so roasting man: “There is momentarily still no agreement between the parliamentary groups.”
The CDU would like to make if possible few regulations for investors.
The left one wants still hardens editions for investors.
Regardless of its, so roasting man, is at hand an aggravation of the situation on the housing market.
If the action concept is converted, for additional tasks in the building authorities will provide.
More staff one needs.
It is unclear whether we will get the specialists.
Still the program does not stand completely: Because those approximately 1260 new apartments, which should anyway are built.
How however does one adjust the loss of further approximately 1300 favorable apartments, whose promotion will run out in the next years?
However up to the year 2020 there will be 500 apartments.
In order to prevent, so the planning-political spokeswoman Nicole Palm, connections of the city, running out now, should be purchased.
In addition would have to be thought to get apartments again back into the application of fixed prices.
That is possible in Weststadt.
At one blow the problem would let itself solve.
Because run out in Weststadt to the end of the year eking out.
One could get approximately 1800 apartments there back into the application of fixed prices for favorable apartments.
Only: The owners, housing associations do not want that.
Because the number of the subsidized low-rent housings in Weststadt is increased again drastically, departs one from the goal of the so-called mixing.
A concentration of socialweak in only few quarters is not to give it any longer.
The Greens count on the fact that it will give still movement in the discussion.
Leader of the parliamentary group Holger Herlitschke means: “For a broad majority the CDU must also in the boat.”
Those concentrated on more building sites for single family houses.
Which however it does not mean that still another compromise cannot be found.
