Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected with Fife
£ 1.35 billion the expensive project are to be finished until May 2017
Engineers connected the north deck of the Queensferry Crossings with the viaduct - which means that the bridge is connected with Fife now.
It is first of four locking the “cover blowers”, which approach the completion around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10.000 tons steel and 20,000 tons concrete as well as 46 inclined cables.
£ 1.35 billion the expensive project are to be finished until May 2017.
Minister of economics Keith Brown paid the building site today a visit and was one first, who went from the country on the bridge.
He said: “That is a historical and symbolic moment with the building of the Queensferry Crossings.
We are all witnesses of an engineer art of a indeed epic measure with this project also over 30.000 tons concrete and steel, which were used alone for this part of the bridge.
Despite the substantial size and weight the bridge, is the completion of the catch between the viaduct and the bridge deck a delicate activity, which require extremely precise tolerances for the fit.
Altogether nearly 79% of the entire bridge deck at their place and the last section of the deck are receive today in Rosyth a concrete casting for the deck, which meant that the entire deck is ready, on the bridge to its place to be lifted.
Michael Martin, Projektleiter von Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: “The first catch represents a substantial milestone with each bridge project.
With this fantastic project the catch represents to trend-setting high and foundation engineering.
After the installation of the last road cover section and its connection with the north tower deck in the development, we had to then close the still existing gap on the north or land side.
This was south reached by pulling the northern feeder bridge of 700 millimeters.
This was a substantial and at the same time very delicate activity.
Substantial one, since that is 222 meters long viaduct, weighs approx. 6,000 tons and had with an increase of approx. 3% to be pulled upward.
Delicately, since the tolerances, on which the team works towards, were tiny - on each side they amounted to only some millimeters.
Fortunately everything ran very well.
