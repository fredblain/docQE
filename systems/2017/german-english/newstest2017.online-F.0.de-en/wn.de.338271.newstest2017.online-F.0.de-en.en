Better flow of traffic on the feeder route
Accumulates regularly on the by-pass road - here a picture from November.
But that is to change: The right turn-off lane is to be extended.
That is a good message for all drivers, who in the rush hour on the environment road each evening in the back-up, if they drive over the feeder route (A 43).
The national enterprise road construction extends on coming Tuesday and Wednesday (16. /17 August) within the range between the hammer road and the departure Weseler road the Rechtsabbiegerspur around 700 meters.
Drivers can contrive then directly from the hammer road right.
The large advantage: Traffic divides itself more promptly, whereby the global process on the much-traveled section of the federal highway 51 is improved.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU parliamentary group in the district agency MÃ¼nster west.
The lane narrowing on the feeder makes the drivers nervous particularly between 17 and 19 o'clock.
The back pressure reaches sometimes also beyond that on workdays up to the bridge over the Albersloher way and.
Reason is the needle eye on B 51 shortly before the departure Weseler road.
Traffic only single-lane one is directed off here over the motorway bridge.
The second trace had to be back-built forwards for years well in-three-quarter.
The reason: Static calculations had showed that the bridge does not possess no more the necessary carrying capacity, in order to take up above all the heavy transport two-lane.
How long this bottleneck and the associated work-daily back-up will persist, the responsible national enterprise cannot say.
However is to be counted with years: Because the bridge has an official rest service life up to the year 2034.
For the extension of the right turn-off lane the national enterprise selected consciously the traffic-weaker time in the vacations, because on handicaps is to be counted.
Traffic is led past on Tuesday and on Wednesday single-lane at the building site.
