England must direct the olympic spirit and extend Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local municipalities and in all of London, but generally speaking country.
For me that represented the largest attraction Heathrows, exactly the same as at that time in 2012 in London, when we operated a large expenditure, in order to guarantee that all our nations and regions profited from the plays.
The Olympiad brought large advantages for Stratford and the East ends.
And that will again reach, as we for local men and companies create new possibilities in close proximity to Heathrow.
For our local communities we will create alone already 10,000 new training places, 40,000 new jobs and for youth unemployment in the airport environment an end will prepare.
As it us in London ahead 2012 were, it such will give, which will think that the challenge of the extension is too large Heathrows.
It was told me that England will be ready for the plays never and that we will disgrace ourselves on the world stage.
The sceptics had 2012 injustice and them also with Heathrow will wrongly lie.
There are always obstacles for overcoming, but Heathrow answers each question posed to him.
Like the Olympic Games Heathrow for many is and not for particulars an infrastructure project.
Extension is a possibility, in order to create up to 180.000 new jobs, £211 billion at witschaftlichem growth and to leave a legacy of abilities and occupation both around the airport and in completely GB.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget converted, of the T5 - which was selected five years in consequence to the world-best airport terminal, up to the T2, which was built in the midst of the two most frequented gangways of the world.
Now they stand ready a third gangway to supply, which is supported by £16 billions at private investments.
The London of plays of 2012 was a large success for GB and I am confident that the extension of Heathrow will likewise be one.
It is time that we direct this olympic spirit and extends Heathrow as well as secures our future trade and a legacy of talents and creates occupation, on which England be proud can.
