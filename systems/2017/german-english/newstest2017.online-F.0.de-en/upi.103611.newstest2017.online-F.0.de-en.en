Nordeseeölarbeiter take up again discussions, suspend strike
The labor disputes concerning the remuneration for North Sea oil workers suspended, while all parties to the dispute for a new round of talks sit down to the table, said negotiators.
Strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were accomplished sporadically on platforms in the North Sea, which are operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
“Wood Group as well as the Unite and FCS trade unions can confirm that we united us to begin the completion process of the present controversy again” are called it in a common statement.
We will hold some all day meetings in the next weeks, will begin at the beginning of next year, in order to concern the problems again.
The trade unions said that their last strike, which is first in over 25 years was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group shortened this year the rates to its Kontraktoren in the North Sea around approximately 9 percent due to negative market printing.
The rate shortening of the enterprise follows a 10-percent decrease for Onshore contractors in the year 2014.
The enterprise said that additional shortening the necessary area to the enterprise gives, in order to come by the market wing over.
Shell announced plans for its part thousand from people to dismiss and to give its oil and gas business activities up in up to 10 countries since it rationalizes its business activities as consequence of its megaunion with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are due to the lower crude oil prices under pressure, an economic situation, which itself by the decision of the British in June to leave the European union had strengthened.
The Scottish member of parliament Dave Anderson met earlier this week with worker leaders, in order to discuss one of the largest work disputes, which took place since a generation in the North Sea.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, said it.
“In the North Sea and generally speaking country we need an economy, which functions for many and not only for few,” said it in a statement.
2016 is expected on the average approximately less than $ 1.4 billion at expenditures for new projects in the North Sea compared with $ 7 billion in the last five years.
