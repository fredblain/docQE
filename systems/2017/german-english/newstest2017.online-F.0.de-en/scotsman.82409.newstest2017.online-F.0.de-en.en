Partition Callum Skinner storms home, when a Britisher achieves gold for cycling
Scotland Callum Skinner rests last evening in the man team sprint in the velodrome in Rio to the fame, when the British team defended the title of London 2012.
The 23-year old from Glasgow took the anchor role, which its compatriot sir Chris Hoy had made itself own. The Jungspund made the legend proud, when it stormed home, in order to rake a victory of the favorites New Zealand.
England claimed a shocking victory before four years, while Hoy got the fifth of six olympia gold medals.
They repeated the trick, after they got a modest sixth place in March with the course world championships in London despite the resignation Hoys only.
The problem between Peking and London was the replacement of the Anfahrers Jamie Staff.
They did this in time as Hindes emerged.
Hoys retirement produced a gap, Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man, with whom they remained, when they saw potential in the Scot, which now unfolded.
Hindes, Kenny - which triumphed before four years with Hoy - and Skinner set an olympia record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders in the first round triumphed.
And the British trio won the duel also gold.
Hindes was past after its round scarcely, but Kenny brought forward the team and to Skinner held it.
A change of strategy constituted a large part of the transformation, with which Hindes drove in a higher course to hold in order to slow it down and to make it possible Kenny and above all Skinner, the speed.
Hoy watched of its position as an BBC expert out and was noticeable to Skinner, Kenny and Hindes, when these rose to the landing.
The 23-year old Skinner from Glasgow said: “It is a flattering comparison.”
I am only here, in order to do and for me a name make my best.
We set up an olympia record in the final round and defeated the world champions.
It was simply unbelievable.
There is no better kind this to win.
After Triumph 2012 at the page Kennys and Hoys admitted Hindes that he fell after a weak start intentionally on the course.
He did not withdraw this statement later and it came an objection of England rivals.
With so an outstanding victory there was this time none such problem.
Hindes said: “It feels with the whole GB of flags on the grandstand such as London.”
We met in the last three months as a team.
We got away with so many world titles so badly that it was unbelievable to win again with the Olympiad.
That is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which seven were won by 10 titles both in Peking and in London.
If that is a barometer of our progress in the last five months that expect us successful five days in the velodrome.
With the form Kennys is it in the range of the possible one that he repeats Hoys victory of three olympic gold medals in a competition.
That became for Kenny - which is 12 years younger exactly than Hoy, likewise to 23. March was born (an apparently holy date for the British sport; on the day also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal to mean.
That would equal from Hoy.
Kenny participates next in the sprint, which begins today and will go over three days.
The 28-year old from Bolton said: “I enjoy this only for the moment.”
The team event is always best.
One can win it with its colleagues.
It feels somewhat lonely to win alone.
Hindes said: “If it two further gold medals wins, should be struck it to the knight.”
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there was further good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, OD Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified themselves with the fastest achievement in the quadripartite four-kilometer running.
They arrived at 3:51,942 at the goal.
The world record, which won 2012 in London gold, was with 3:51,659.
The first and final round (22.42) take place today on the second day of the Wettbewers, with which Wiggins with security will stand in the focus.
It had argued yesterday with assigned one before the qualification, when functionaries called it to itself, in order to measure its body size.
In the appropriate woman competition, which is continued tomorrow and terminated, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald OF Milngavie in world record time was promoted in 4:13,260.
The GB team relies on its strong course wheel team, in order to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a crowd at medals.
After a indeed unusual representation of absolute dominance in Peking and London expectations for Rio were driven down.
Drama in the background, as the resignation of the technical manager Shane Sutton in April in the midst of from sexism and bullying reproaches as well as the retirement took place from sizes as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
If one views oneself however the first evening of the competition in the velodrome, it looks whole like it, as if the legendary call GBs, which reached its high point to the perfect moment, could be repeated again.
