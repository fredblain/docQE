The fees per cubic meter waste water amount to starting from 1 October 2016 for the range of the sewage system Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl 3.44 instead of so far 2.10 euros; for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp 3.36 euros (so far 2.26 euros) and for Azendorf 3.64 euros (so far 2.18 euros).
With the plant in Azendorf the waste water fee will at the latest again increase if appropriate improvement measures become necessary.
After a rough calculation the waste water price in Azendorf about 4.37 euros per cubic meter will then be.
How mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, with the approval of the household by the district administration office Kulmbach was stated that for these sewage systems Unterdeckungen accumulate.
The market Kasendorf is obligated due to legal bases to operate the plants cost-hitting a corner.
Starting from 1 October 2016 the citizens as well as the trade and industrial companies from Welschenkahl, new village, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg more deeply into the purse will have to reach.
The increases in charges lie between 48 and 67 percent.
As administrative leader pointed Herbert Schmidt to the committee out, a new calculation of the fees was necessary for the sewage systems of the market community.
In the period of October 2016 until September 2020 also over and/or Unterdeckungen from the preceding calculation period is to be adjusted.
Schmidt justified the serious increases in charges with the fact that it acts with all three sewage systems around relatively small facilities with a very small waste water accumulation, which lies between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.
Thus due to the small distribution basis for example expenditures for necessary repairs would affect themselves several thousand euros seriously.
Besides the waste water arising is easily declining in all three plants.
Further in the past calculation period with all three plants not least due to their age redevelopment and repair expenditures to a substantial extent resulted.
The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the plants for Welschenkahl, new village and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp nearly 20 years.
Schmidt referred to the fact that in the sewage system Azendorf the mechanical ventilating system had to be exchanged due to a damage.
In the pumping plant Welschenkahl had to be overhauled those almost 20 years old conveyor plants by reason on and with the pond purification plant Lopp had after almost 20 years enterprise the first sludge pond excavated, the sewage sludge to be disposed of and an additional ventilation possibility inserted, in order to be able to keep the water-legal defaults also in the future.
Schmidt: “To these extraordinary expenditures the updated care and maintenance costs came to consider those accordingly in the new calculation period are.”
The same is valid for cost of electricity, to which with the previous calculation in the years 2011/2012 still clearly under the current level were.
It made stone houses clear that with the small waste water accumulation in the three plants the expenditures for the enterprise and maintenance pierce “fully”.
, Supplemental Schmidt remained exempted, the market community from large maintenance costs with the sewage systems in the past 20 years.
The situation for the plants mentioned will in the long term remain further precarious in opinion of stone houses, particularly since one will not extend the supply area of the waste water special purpose association Friesenbachtal by these plants can, because it concerns in deficit facilities.
