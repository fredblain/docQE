<seg id="15">He never wanted to attend any kind of clash.</seg>
<seg id="16">He was the brother who swam with the electricity.</seg>

<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer looked with some colleagues a bit of variation with an excitement on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old, it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: golden Sports Pyramid for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">After a few minutes, the horses remembered their feat night, they jailed in the fast gallop home to the fodder.</seg>
<seg id="7">A kilometre at this pace, I feared.</seg>
<seg id="8">It wasn't a good experience, "says Langer.</seg>
<seg id="9">And this ended the riding career then again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday, Germany's best golfer ever - 101 tournament wins - was back near horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He left with his family about the ALRV's plant, on a horse he didn't time for photo purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and therefore also at the CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">German sports help hit the man from houses in the context of a small gala Gala the Golden Sports Pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">Awards don't lack the sympathetic athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">Federal Service Cross, Silver Laurel, Champions Tour Player of the Year....</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen has already geared him.</seg>
<seg id="18">Langer is the 18th winner of the sports pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Aachen, he met Hans Günter Winkler's first award winner on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="20">"This award means to me very much," says Langer, because she will be forgiving not only for sporting successes, but also for social involvement. "</seg>
<seg id="21">For decades, Langer has been promoting the offspring.</seg>
<seg id="22">And so he also gave up the price of £25,000 right now.</seg>
<seg id="23">With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time US master winner was admitted to the Hall of Fame of German Sports on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="24">The excellence include the athlete Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the foxter Cornelia Hanish, Alexander Pusch and Arne Schmitt, the rusher Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob driver Meinhard Nehman, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the sprinter Alwin shock mill and posthumous handballer Erhard wonderful.</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sporting legends were coming to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton and Trump's economic policy compared: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade agreement - which wants both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, disagreements are the two U.S. presidential applicants in tax and energy policy, as well as in a fundamental issue.</seg>
<seg id="4">The difference in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is underlying a fundamental, more philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">The one, about the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep the doubt more small and warns about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate to death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He, on the other hand, would be quite different, claiming Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will massively return regulations, and he makes for far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for businesses.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton, by contrast, says the state has certain responsibilities to open up disadvantaged opportunities and needs money for it.</seg>
<seg id="11">That's why taxes for the rich would be increased, she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the issue of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">They have to be invested, saying Trump and Clinton almost worthless.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Democratic applicant announces even the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II.</seg>
<seg id="15">Government investment programmes into infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by Republicans' state-owned wings.</seg>
<seg id="16">So on Trump, partisan discussions could come.</seg>
<seg id="17">Clearers are the differences in energy and climate policy.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and ride coal production in the US again.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production is also expected to be possible in previously protected areas, the Paris Climate Change Agreement he wants to terminate.</seg>
<seg id="20">By contrast, with her investment programme, Clinton explicitly wants to expand renewable energies and calls for: one country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs. "</seg>
<seg id="21">It's going to be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be it. "</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - including in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the trans-Pacific trade agreement, don't want to sign both.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, however, both want the US not to isolate international trade - but just protect American jobs better.</seg>
<seg id="25">They are then to be better paid, calling for about Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 dollars is a hunger.</seg>
<seg id="27">He wants to raise it to $15 an hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do on this issue is not very clear: once, he says: the minimum wage must be running, then he says he should not be allowed to change.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is probably more likely to develop around the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On one side stands Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics stick to him so that the budget deficit would only greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who at least wants the rich to demand that they pay more tax, and whose critics say: more taxes aren't the solution either.</seg>

<seg id="1">Flight: "every fleeting woman has experiences with sexual violence.</seg>
<seg id="2">Sexual violence is part of women fleeing alone, almost everyday.</seg>
<seg id="3">When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatised.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house provides refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen, four women sit.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each has a baby, which is at best a year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son in the arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks with great eyes curious in the room.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother stared on the table plate.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until she notices that she is being watched.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles and kisses the little.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene acts normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you speak with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">She is an area managing director of Condrobs, a carrier for social aid offerings in Bayern, and employs, among others, the issue of women on the flight.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen have fled.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the Munich north in one of the few devolved shelters for their own women and their children in Bayern.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January, Condrobs have made the establishment along with Pro Familia and Munich women's aid.</seg>
<seg id="18">Recently she was officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">Men don't exist - even as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard before the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">It's not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here has made experiences of sexual violence on her flight, "says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="23">Men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they threaten torture or death or because their families send them as hope to Europe, "</seg>
<seg id="24">At women outweigh other reasons for the flight: "many steal themselves secretly because they don't see another way out."</seg>
<seg id="25">In their home, they made experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honour murder, slavery or forced prostitution.</seg>
<seg id="26">That continues it.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the flight, that goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">That smugglers, for example, for a bottle of water call for a sexual act, is not a rarity, 'says.</seg>
<seg id="29">And women are alone, they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">Who believes that's that once they arrived in Germany, mistaken, told Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here, too, single women in refugee shelters would often be viewed as inferior and at worst abuse.</seg>
<seg id="32">This means that about 90 per cent of women who live in accommodation in Munich North are traumatised, she estimates.</seg>
<seg id="33">Some of the children are certainly not voluntarily created. "</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so used to them saying nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">Or they don't trust themselves to speak openly about the experience because the shame is too big. "</seg>
<seg id="36">Since they often don't know they wouldn't need more accommodation just for them, demanding bar.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bayern, the seven district governments are responsible for accommodating refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the question of whether they know from a similar project as in Munich in their responsibilities, some respond with No.</seg>
<seg id="39">About there is something like this in government accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="40">Even in Swabs, fleeting women alone are not separated, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press secretary of the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Upper Bayern, Underground and Central Francs there are in some community accommodation floors or their own homes only for single women and their children.</seg>
<seg id="42">The exception is Niederbayer, there are two central accommodation exclusively for women.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Committee on Rights of Women and Equality of Genders in the European Parliament is also calling for women to be housed separately by men.</seg>
<seg id="44">In a study published for the committee, it said: it's very important that men and women are being separated. "</seg>
<seg id="45">'Missing privacy or getting men and women together, it can be - continually - violence against women. "</seg>
<seg id="46">In particular, the laundries should be separated and easily accessed for women, standing in the study.</seg>
<seg id="47">How much the women feel this need for protection can be read at the range that gives it to the house in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Since speaking around that there is, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="49">You could easily make up a second house.</seg>

<seg id="2">Deputies from the assistant doctors have called on their union to approve new labour measures in their disputes relating to a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called for its entire advice to approve more work measures at the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC said it had failed ministers to worry about the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">Assistant doctors and medical students voted on rejection of a contract in July, which was agreed with the BMA.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of his members who voted in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a letter to the members, published on Twitter on Thursday night, the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said the government would have been persistently quiet on problems, leading to the contract rejected.</seg>
<seg id="8">She said: "considering this, the JDC board voted to fully reject the proposed new contract and requested official new negotiations to all your concerns."</seg>
<seg id="9">In response to the government's silence, the JDC board today requested a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme of escalating labour measures beginning in early September.</seg>
<seg id="10">The disputes led to assistant doctors striker this year six times, the first overall outages in the NHS's history.</seg>
<seg id="11">The head of BMA assistant doctors Dr Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed contract terms recommended by the BMA.</seg>
<seg id="12">He told BMA members during the meetings that were still taking place before the vote by 54,000 assistant doctors and medical students, that the contract should be beneficial and adopted.</seg>
<seg id="13">After the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the contract for doctors in England would be forcibly being introduced.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an alliance of outsiders?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">Russia's leaders and Turkey met on Tuesday to give hands and announce an official end of the eight-month war of the words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But as Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the St Petersburg Palace, I can't deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handship, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile was narrow and he hardly radiated heat, even for his restrained conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke repeatedly from his dear friend Putin - according to a report entirely five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old levels before the crisis, but will even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have been so behaving like never happened badly.</seg>
<seg id="11">It appeared to me his enthusiasm rather to indicate the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin broadcast, sustainable cooling showed that the leader of Russia had nothing to forget.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the firing of a Russian warplane on the Syrian border by Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction at the time was augmented.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara to have fallen into the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offence was even bigger as it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Rebuilding the venture will be difficult, if not impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media led a fierce, unlimited attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At once, it seemed the Turks were to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">Most seriously, the accusations of senior officials were that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria, which will be controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He vehemently denied this.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia has been able to book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are clearly on hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan primarily needed all friends he can get after he was removed last month at a failed coup almost his office.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there is economic motives too.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - particularly banning charter flights that usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has dropped by nearly 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, travel organisers and charter companies will be relieved if the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They include a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, state television predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables once Turkish agricultural imports are allowed.</seg>
<seg id="35">A report in Vedemosti formulated as follows: "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an added political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious on the West as it considers its reaction to the attempted power takeover as a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">This comes to the continuing resentment about the snap of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is keen to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey's relationship with the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian leader won in Ankara with security a bonus that he called for support for the elected organs after the attempted coup.</seg>
<seg id="40">That's well noticeable for Moscow, which itself has a severe fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this lackluster palace on the seafront enabled it to Russia and Turkey, one as it once described me an analyst to depict an alliance of outsiders: two countries that feel violated by the West and feel badly treated and now allied.</seg>
<seg id="42">Still, despite public reconciliation, there are still big differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role as a peacekeeper, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after nearly three hours of first discussions, both presidents said at the press conference that they had not even striped the issue.</seg>
<seg id="45">Turkey's president avoided deliberately responding to a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasise them.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found to Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey fired the Russian fighter jet - it's certainly better that the two heads of state at least talk to each other.</seg>

<seg id="2">The brand RBS is expected to be reduced to a back-office role, according to the bank's chief executive.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ross McEwan told the BBC Scotland that the brand RBS was linked to the bank's global ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bank has since distanced itself when it had to be almost collapsed and rescued eight years ago.</seg>
<seg id="6">During that time, brand strategists used RBS to protect other end-user financial brands.</seg>
<seg id="7">She backed international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.</seg>
<seg id="8">But now she decided to put more national brands into focus.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.</seg>
<seg id="10">In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralised headquarters and the stock market listing will change to NatWest.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ulster Bank's brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are other, smaller brands for retail business that will receive more importance - Coutts, Adam Co, Drummond and Holt's military bank.</seg>
<seg id="13">McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire.</seg>
<seg id="14">He told the BBC Scotland with: "the RSB brand will become our investor brand as well as to the brand under which our staff will be employed as we now become more to a bank of brands."</seg>
<seg id="15">When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm saying now that we are not pursuing global goals but local goals.</seg>
<seg id="17">Each of these brands will be in their own communities for something completely different and our staff will work under these brands with the customers.</seg>
<seg id="18">RBS has already testified that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the perceptions of the various brands in its sports sponsorship.</seg>
<seg id="19">It's time for us to develop to the bank of the brands, because how do we inside (we asked) to do this to a better bank for customers? "The chief executive said.</seg>
<seg id="20">It would have been very cynical three years ago when we said we will be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands.</seg>
<seg id="21">But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think you'll see a lot of changes.</seg>
<seg id="22">We can launch these brands again, so I think the time has come.</seg>

<seg id="3">The jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British gain at Newmarket on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="4">He put on predilection, which will be trained by John Gosden, on his local circuit with his second profit of the night a landmark.</seg>
<seg id="5">The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey who reaches the milestone in the flat race.</seg>
<seg id="6">He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.</seg>
<seg id="7">The three-time winner Dettori, who won before Ghayaryar, said: "it's something special."</seg>
<seg id="8">I'm very emotional because my family is here too</seg>
<seg id="9">I'm very happy about it happening at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday evening with 20,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I'm relieved and very modest.</seg>
<seg id="12">Dettori takes the jubilator when he picks up the victory on predilection</seg>
<seg id="13">Two jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who reached more than 4,300 wins in a record-breaking career.</seg>
<seg id="14">Lester Piggott, the nine-time Derby champion had 4,493 career victories</seg>
<seg id="15">Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modernism and it's no surprise that he has reached that milestone that few have reached before him.</seg>
<seg id="16">He has style and strong, but it's his tactical intellect that differs from the others in weight control room.</seg>
<seg id="17">He's a fantastic ambassador for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma has been thrilling fans for years for this sport.</seg>
<seg id="18">I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he had already picked up 6,000 gains if he wouldn't just be just a weekend and great tournament jockey!</seg>
<seg id="19">Frankie has already ridden in GB nearly 30 years of winners, which is great.</seg>
<seg id="20">He has a vibrant personality, which is good for a British race, but beyond that, he is an incredible jockey.</seg>
<seg id="21">Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical flying dismount</seg>
<seg id="22">From Flying finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the hallmark of the British flat race for two decades.</seg>
<seg id="23">It was nervous.</seg>
<seg id="24">A whole range of big tournaments, including his famous glory Seven in 1996 in Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban.</seg>
<seg id="25">Three years ago he had difficulty initially when he returned from his six-month lock but he showed an impressive character strength to defy his doubters and return to his best form.</seg>

<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who has been Ivanov's deputy since 2012, has been appointed his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in the Estonian capital of Tallinn in 1972, made his degree at the renowned state Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the message in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">It says on the Kremlin's website (on Russian) that he was later log chief executive and chief executive of government staff.</seg>
<seg id="10">About his appointment, he told Putin: thanks for your trust. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it's the government's most important thing to support your activity as head of legislation and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This move has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov has long been one of the closest confidence Vladimir Putins and works like him for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As a chief of staff, he was one of the country's most powerful men.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed the Chief of Staff will resign on their own desire.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, only few are convinced - especially now, just before parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So here is the episode of a sort of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">No one knows that at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official claim - that a man who was once being toured as a potential president, wants to guide Russian environmental policy at once - had great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin, quoting on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said it's true that in early 2012 I asked you in a conversation to me to trust this very complicated post - you might nearly say - to trust an appealing post four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Before, he was deputy prime minister and defence minister.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and how Putin former member of the State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin got to power, Ivanov called Ivanov as one of five people he most familiarised.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once agreed that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin's second term, as a third term Putin had violated the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, almost ally Putin's ally, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became prime minister before becoming the president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35bn project is expected to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have linked the Norddeck of the Queensferry crossings with the viaduct - meaning the bridge is now associated with Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">It's the first of four closures of the blowers closer to completion around each of the bridge's three towers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete as well as 46 slopes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35bn project is expected to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Economy minister Keith Brown stated the construction site today and was one of the first to get to the bridge from the country.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said: "this is a historic and symbolic moment at the construction of the Queensferry crossings.</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnessing an engineering art from a truly epic measure of this project with over 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the bridge's massive size and weight, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for the adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="12">Overall, nearly 79 per cent of the total bridge decks in their place and the last section of the deck are getting a concrete concrete for the deck today, meaning that the entire deck is prepared to be raised on the bridge to its place.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "the first closure represents a significant milestone on every bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">During this fantastic project, the closure of forward-looking civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After installing the last road section and its compound with the expanding northern turkey, we then had to close the existing gap on the North or land side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was reached by pulling the northern feeding bridge 700 millimetres south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive as the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tonnes and had to be drawn at a slope of about 3 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="19">Thorny, as the tolerances to which the team worked were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters.</seg>
<seg id="20">Fortunately, everything was very good.</seg>

<seg id="1">Who is building Braunschwing's favourable homes?</seg>
<seg id="2">The SPD and Greens think: investors are to be much more duty in the future.</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you respond to the bad news that Brunswick will lose nearly 1300 favorable homes in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">The SPD proposes a's concept of action to the next council meeting.</seg>
<seg id="5">But dispute is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost about the question: who is to actually build the favourable homes?</seg>
<seg id="7">So far, a settlement is missing.</seg>
<seg id="8">SPD chairman Christoph Bratmann thinks: "we agree with the Greens: who wants to build urban areas in the future 20 per cent of all apartments as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="9">However, the favourable apartments can also emerge in the stock.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, the big point in City Hall is, according to Bratmann: how to go around with investors who want to build on private areas?.</seg>
<seg id="11">We want investors to build at least 10 per cent on such areas, but as much as 20 per cent of homes as social housing. "</seg>
<seg id="12">A new urban housing support program, which will cost millions and has yet to be funded, is expected to provide incentives.</seg>
<seg id="13">The problem, according to Bratman: "there's no agreement between the groups at the moment."</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants investors to make as few regulations as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left still wants tough conditions for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Regardless, according to Bratmann, a tightening of the situation on the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the action concept is implemented, this will provide additional tasks in construction management.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It's unclear whether we will get the professionals.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the program is still not altogether: because the around 1260 new homes should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how do you equal the loss of another 1300 favorable homes whose promotion will expire over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">It will be 500 apartments by 2020 alone.</seg>
<seg id="23">To prevent this, according to planning spokesman Nicole Palm, expiring ties should be bought from the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">Additionally, thought would have to be thought to pick up housing back into price returns.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the Western City.</seg>
<seg id="26">On one blow, the problem could be solved.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in the West Council, the year-end deadline runs out.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 homes could pick up there back into the price of favourable homes.</seg>
<seg id="29">Just: that's wanting the owners, the housing companies don't.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because the number of social housing in the West City is being raised drastically again, removed from the target of so-called mixing.</seg>
<seg id="31">A concentration of social weaknesses in just a few city districts is expected to no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens expect there will still be movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">Group chairman Holger Herlitschken thinks: for a broad majority, the CDU needs to be in the boot.</seg>
<seg id="34">While this was focused on more construction places for detached houses.</seg>
<seg id="35">But what doesn't mean that a compromise cannot yet be found.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worthwhile</seg>
<seg id="2">It's fascinating to see how the world changed.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenagers and children don't go out to games, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time to rig on screens has been complained by many over the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">At Pokemon Go, it's about getting people off the sofa and becoming more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">Time on screen was initially limited to the television, then on video games and more recently on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities don't exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">I obviously refer to the Pokémon Gown, an app based on the characters, which were initially created for the video games in the 1990s (later created a sign series, play cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many phenomena of pop culture, interest fell before the publication of the game in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">Market introduction in other countries has been postponed by the massive demand that the servers overloaded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within days, Pokémon had more users than tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, the players with their smartphones go out and search for Pokémons who are tracked with a GPS and, once they were found, can be photographed (over a screenshot on the phone) or can be captured.</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when they were even younger, joined the game and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US, the game led to a substantial rise in steps that return the average person every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which tracked 35,000 users, told the Washington Post post recently that within two days of market introduction of the game, the number of persecuted people who train 30 minutes every day, jumped from 45 per cent to 53 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company doesn't know who plays Pokémon Go - it looks only the raw data on performance increase.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public health campaigns, who want to get people to take 30 minutes to get off the sofa and to be active every day, met on deaf ears because many public messages on health are boring and coming from people who look miserable.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overstated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Anyone who regularly drives sport reduces its opportunities to disease cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the miracle of Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that they're fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Therefore, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people close on the hunt even new friendships.</seg>
<seg id="24">As ever, there is also murky gambling spoils who always have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against one door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What's supposed to be?</seg>
<seg id="27">It occurred a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps as Fitbit could already track our activity earlier, they didn't give us a reason to drive sport as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its allure and the use will leave with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because of Pokemon's success, however, there will be more games that will unite the apps and virtual reality with activism in the real world, while helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="2">Forget the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="3">Forget the hype.</seg>
<seg id="4">Simone Biles is immune to all that.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dynamically on the spring.</seg>
<seg id="6">Effortless on the beam.</seg>
<seg id="7">Breathtaking on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="8">On whole line brilliant.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now, finally, Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American Turner climbed on Thursday to multiple titles and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world all eyes under the headlights of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Her overall result of 62,198 was clearly in front of the silver medal winner and Final Five's team cameramen Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medallist Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Americans Simonen Biles turned on the balance during the women's individual campaign finale at the 2016 Olympic summer games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multiple title and overall the fifth while consolidating her reputation, being the best of her generation or even ever.</seg>
<seg id="14">She broke in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at this moment an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success puts them into the same league like unique athletes such as Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has dominated the last three years of their sport, winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises including a mix of ambition and precision that the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton said that she's been "the best turner I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">It expected a last examination in Brazil, a contest that went not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be seen as a disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Americans Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace gold and silver in the women's individual campaign final at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles picked up the first medal on Tuesday while she served on the farewell ceremony of the retirement team co-ordinator, Martha Karolyi, as exclamation mark.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although Biles insisted, during their long way to the top, never having the future planned, it's not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of their ground exercises - which include their typical tumbling passport - is voted on Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympics in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">That's not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, who was adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by coach Aimee Boormat's mother during a school holiday in the gym, was trained in the Boorman became strength.</seg>
<seg id="25">She hasn't lost an additional contest since the summer of 2013, a victory series that will last for so long as it wants Biles.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even though Mustafina led easily through two rotations, the picture.</seg>
<seg id="27">Sweeping beams and ground turbines - in which Biles hold the World Championship title - laughed.</seg>
<seg id="28">She picked up again with 15,433 on the floor beam - and put one still on the floor with a 15,933 on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman embraced them gently as she expected her final completion - a mere formality - and tears poured on Biles shiny red, white and blue eyeliners, when the vision she once described her in her collection book was to reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance of Raisman was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she struggled to third place, but the bronze medal in a Tiebrake went to Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="31">This time, the 22-year-old team captain, which is named by the Americans grandma, had an advantage.</seg>
<seg id="32">According to her ground exercise, she threw out to the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes appeared doubtful.</seg>
<seg id="33">As for Biles, the rapidly expanding tweet of the 19-year-olds from the beginning of this week has a whole new importance:</seg>

<seg id="2">According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot dead in one of the fatal attacks for the first time in a decade in the first serial murder of Phoenix, while heard in the car and heard music.</seg>
<seg id="3">Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis's daughter Maleah were shot dead on June 12 while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said.</seg>
<seg id="4">The offender fired eight shots from a hand firearm while he stood on the front side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, in the report.</seg>
<seg id="5">Police announced that the three-time murder did not appear to have been the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 who were in possession of one of the adult victims.</seg>
<seg id="6">Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard's police spokesman said the shooting led the investigators to be a closer look at whether it is associated with four previous attacks.</seg>
<seg id="7">Overall, predominantly in Hispanic residential areas, seven people were killed and two others injured in nine attacks in nine attacks.</seg>
<seg id="8">'s happening in a residential area in front of a house, "told Howard of KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, earlier this month.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is believed the suspect used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.</seg>
<seg id="10">Investigators refused to disclose the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and committed by the same murderer.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to her injuries and died later.</seg>
<seg id="12">Liners, 31, and Ellis daughter Maleah still died on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="13">One witness told police that it wasn't unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.</seg>
<seg id="14">The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which was aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before three-time murder and which will be expected that it was the work of the serial killer.</seg>

<seg id="18">We are woken up and pouring the water and pouring in, "said Hansford.</seg>
<seg id="19">It reached my waist.</seg>
<seg id="20">His wife told Hansford that she had never seen such a high of the river in the 48 years in which she lived there.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hansford said he and his family members had all disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim.</seg>
<seg id="22">Hansford said that emergency emergency rescued all three in a large military truck and they would have brought them to the next fire guard in Gloster where they were housed until Friday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Mahaj Brown, 6, of bullets through, survives shooting in Philadelphia</seg>
<seg id="2">Police agree that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, this week already the second time that a 6-year-old child will be shot.</seg>
<seg id="3">The boy's grandparents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.</seg>
<seg id="4">The grandparents said that Brown suffered several shot injuries, including in the lending, leg, arm and stomach, but that he was in awareness at his transport.</seg>
<seg id="5">He has gone through a lot, his little body was through bullets, "his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station.</seg>
<seg id="6">I just can't believe that.</seg>
<seg id="7">The state of the boy was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations.</seg>
<seg id="8">The boy's family told the station that he is expected to be recovered again.</seg>
<seg id="9">He should have begun the first class in a local primary school.</seg>
<seg id="10">Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.</seg>
<seg id="11">Also shot three men: two aged 29 and a 32-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="12">One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are stable, according to CBS Philadelphia.</seg>
<seg id="13">The boy was fired on the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old who is in a critical condition, the station reports.</seg>
<seg id="14">The other two victims were not in the car and police were just investigating whether they could be under one of the injured men of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="15">Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that apparently it had come to a crossfire between several shooters.</seg>
<seg id="16">Patrons for assault rifles, which were traced back to various assault rifles, oversaw the scene.</seg>
<seg id="17">It seems that this is clearly an ongoing battle.</seg>
<seg id="18">On the road, on both sides of the pavement, there were pulses.</seg>
<seg id="19">So it seems to have given several armed fighters here who were very actively involved, "police said Anthony Ginaldi told police in Philadelphia the station.</seg>
<seg id="20">Several homes and vehicles have also been hit in the area as well.</seg>
<seg id="21">There was no arrest and police are currently reviewing reports the surveillance video.</seg>
<seg id="22">On Tuesday, another 6-year-old girl was hit by a crossbreak at the arm when she played before her home in the residential area of West Oak Lane.</seg>
<seg id="23">She recovers and police are still looking for a suspect.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we Simone, Gabby and Laurie need</seg>
<seg id="2">That's what I present to me among the women's olympics in the turn and this is for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I have been involved in every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And second: this team has three turners, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who worked inspiringly for many young girls of other skin colours.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, which Aly Raisman, which is Jeding and Madison Kocian, which is Catholics, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the U.S.</seg>
<seg id="7">It solided the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">Over the last four years, the number one among the female Turner was an African-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year, Simone and Gabby were # 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">That shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America cheered.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez as they delivered unexpected, but masterful gym routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American who won gold at an individual multi-championship event.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We are experiencing the tip of this sport, but so don't look at getting classes across the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie struck all the same as Aly and Madison to create it in the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the last five because the next Olympic team will have only four turners in the team, and that's that last year with Marta Karoliy as a coach.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is likely that turns are an expensive sport and Turner primarily continues in private turn clubs, which are being maintained by parents, which raise for the training, facilities, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the coaches and their turners and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these turn clubs are in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, the Turner gets their entire training and that is an expensive and long-term engagement for the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, both have trained their athletes since they started with the guys.</seg>
<seg id="22">We need to allow the communities of innumerable, young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a more affordable and more easily accessible turnaround.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my trial of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events, we have trained free and affordable turns in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youngsters (especially black and hispan) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September, we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer the youth high-quality guys who earn the possibility of learning and benefiting from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turns develop strength, flexibility and coordination for the body, as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination provides lifelong benefits to health as well as for school and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It's the inspiration of this team to get thousands of young girls to get interested in the guys and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It's so important to participate in the sport, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">That's such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real portrayal of Girl Power by the occasion of the Olympic team gold and thanks, back her so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated to become their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="1">Assistant doctors would like to organise further strikes after they rejected Jeremy hunt's proposal</seg>
<seg id="2">The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 assistant doctors who voted on an election declined to do it.</seg>
<seg id="3">In July, Hunt plans revealed that the contract was forcibly introduced and said the NHS would be in a no-none land and would be damaging for any further delays for the staff and patients.</seg>
<seg id="4">The first assistant doctors are expected to receive a new contract, which contains changes to night and weekend work to improve care at incredible times.</seg>
<seg id="5">DR Ellen McCourt, the chairman of the BMA committee for assistant doctors announced last night in a communication with: assistant doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and be failing to treat all doctors fairly. "</seg>
<seg id="6">At just eight weeks still remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress must be made and the time is running.</seg>
<seg id="7">Efforts on the part of the BMA to resolve the disputes through talks met with the government on reluctance and sometimes on deafening silence.</seg>
<seg id="8">That happened to the one promise that Jeremy Hunt only made last month about that his door would be open.</seg>
<seg id="9">Jeremy Hunt now has to act, lift the imposition and address the concerns of the assistant doctors.</seg>
<seg id="10">Shouldn't he do so, so the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further work measures.</seg>
<seg id="11">The latest strike in late April saw a respite of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 deadlines, as nurses and specialists were involved in granting doctors on the strike poster chain.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by accepting the reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association.</seg>
<seg id="13">The BMA wants a better weekend wage for the 54,000 assistant doctors who will be subject to the contract.</seg>
<seg id="14">Daniel Mortimer, director of the NHS staff, asked the assistant doctors to end the strike.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mortimer said: "labour controversy doesn't reach anything little, but are already overburdened teams and service providers and preparing the patients, carers and their families only worry, distress and interruption."</seg>
<seg id="16">Over the last two months, we have spoken to the committee of assistant doctors and with the Department of Health as well as other ministries positively responding to the concerns about the guardian and whistleblowing.</seg>
<seg id="17">The employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important issues - such as sending, flexibility in training, additional training sessions for those returning from a professional time, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training leave and the gender pay gap - a sign of how seriously it was the employers, the Health Education England and the Health Department regarding compliance with the BMA in November, February and May.</seg>

<seg id="2">Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £2 per day drug after being recommended by authorities to administer this more people for an extended period.</seg>
<seg id="3">The polluting drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with a heart disease.</seg>
<seg id="4">The medication is administered for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="5">NICE's NICE has long recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.</seg>
<seg id="6">NICE's NICE has long recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.</seg>
<seg id="7">About 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of which suffer another heart attack or stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and strokes are caused by collections of fatty material in the arterial walls, forming surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="9">When the belonging breakdown, it can cause a blood island that causes blood flow to heart, causing a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="10">If the bloodstream solves, it can flow through the blood stream and clog the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="11">People who had already had a heart attack are subject to higher risk one more.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, which is manufactured by British company AstraZeneca and is displaced under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making it more unlikely to educate blood islets.</seg>
<seg id="13">The NICE's guidance draft, which was published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily income of aspirin for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre, said: "despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all those who suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or a stroke - often with disastrous consequences."</seg>
<seg id="15">The fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on a person's quality of life.</seg>
<seg id="16">The experience shows that Tigrelor is in combination with aspirin effectively in reducing more heart attacks and strokes among people who had already had a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">By a preliminary recommendation from Tigrelore, we are delighted that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="18">The information about the effectiveness and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the blood risk - is limited to a period of up to three years; the draft guidance does not recommend treatment that goes beyond that period.</seg>

<seg id="1">Culture of Political Correctness leaves voter fraud in Muslim areas</seg>
<seg id="2">The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed last year on prompting a government report for corruption from office</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of political Correctness has meant that widespread voter fraud in Muslim communities will be knowingly ignored as a damning government report disclosed today.</seg>
<seg id="4">Former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles attacks police, electorate observers and city halls for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse because of over sensitivities relating to ethnic and religion.</seg>
<seg id="5">The former minister of integration and local government, which is now a corruption king, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that police should be allowed to set up shutout bands outside electoral cabins to protect intermittent voters.</seg>
<seg id="6">He recommends voters should lead an ID to prove their identity in elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">At present, one voter must merely call his name and address.</seg>
<seg id="8">The report suggests that not remote ink on the finger of a person when they make their electoral votes to prevent someone choosing twice.</seg>
<seg id="9">Whistleblowers should get more protection, says Sir Eric.</seg>
<seg id="10">He calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions from non-official committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is not only serving against electoral fraud, but is also intended to protect the local government before the broader corruption and financial fraud culture, which is accompanied by it, "he said.</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlet election scandal in eastern London.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last year, a special election court decided that the acting Mayor Lutfur Rahman should be dismissed after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his office.</seg>
<seg id="14">The court found that Rahman would have perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community in a cynical way, and that he would have silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobia allegations.</seg>
<seg id="15">Rahman is said to have his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of Muslims to choose him.</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the episode of an imitation where one person chooses as someone else.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">He was particularly alarming to the fraudulent postal ballot - at the elderly members of the Muslim community to pressure people to choose a candidate of their choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including leading expectations to prove the identity</seg>
<seg id="20">In his report, it said: as evidence has been appropriate that pressure has been exerted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, particularly women and young people to vote, according to the will of the elderly, particularly communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds.</seg>
<seg id="21">There was concern that... state institutions have known such behaviour because of politically correct over-sensitivities regarding the ethnicity and religion knowingly ignored. "</seg>
<seg id="22">Sir Eric spoke of 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including banning political activists editing postal election documents to stop polls.</seg>
<seg id="23">The report, which is being considered by Theresa May, also requires tougher registration reviews to prevent the electoral directory of immigration and social fraud purposes.</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider asking voters before the election, according to your ID.</seg>
<seg id="25">Not removed ink on the finger of a person once they delivered her voice to prevent someone choosing twice.</seg>
<seg id="26">Systematic reviews on a person's nationality to ensure they are eligible.</seg>
<seg id="27">A three-year limit on requests for an automatic briefing.</seg>
<seg id="28">Ban that political activists edited full postal elections and envelopes of postal elections.</seg>
<seg id="29">The police are giving the power to settle shutouts around electoral stations.</seg>
<seg id="30">A legislative change that eases an indictment of intimidation according to the Representation of the People Act 1983 (People Representation Act 1983).</seg>
<seg id="31">Photography banned election stations.</seg>
<seg id="32">Requirement that only English be used in the election stations (with the exception of Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">Intensifying the training to ensure that staff rule that voters go to the electoral cabin alone.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it's amazing that according to the Tower Hamlet case, there was no criminal charge.</seg>
<seg id="35">The electoral court has explained Lutfur Rahman and his deputies for corruption and illegal practices as unsustainable, "he said.</seg>
<seg id="36">He was pleaded guilty because of a number of reasons for sufficient - according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="37">He also criticises the impact of the electoral registration departments of the town halls.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Eric said: "the court ruling in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.</seg>
<seg id="39">Our country, as the mother of parliaments, carries a proud heritage, but the worrying and disguised spread of voter fraud and denial of some authorities are threatening this good reputation.</seg>

<seg id="5">The hunter and the wolf: team member of the U.S. team in archery Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio</seg>
<seg id="6">Apart from Kate's doughnut on the cycling track, many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain archery could be the twin of A-Promi Leonardo DiCaprio.</seg>
<seg id="7">The team member of the U.S. team in archery Brady Ellison has caused a rush on Twitter after pictures on which he sees the Wolf of Wall Star incredibly similar.</seg>
<seg id="8">Indeed, the archery got the madness in the social media and admitted he had already been heard since his childhood that he looks like Leo.</seg>
<seg id="9">I myself don't see a big resemblance, with the exception of facial hair, "Brady told the Huffington Post.</seg>
<seg id="10">He's a guttering guy, so I probably catch this as a compliment on.</seg>
<seg id="11">One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly enter the center of this year: the dropped similarity between British vocal jumper Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.</seg>
<seg id="12">Russian Turner Aliya Mustafina, with her big, expressive eyes, is expected to go through as a double singer for Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.</seg>
<seg id="13">And in the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Glee Star Matthew Morrison for years.</seg>
<seg id="14">A gear higher: this user believes that Nathan is the athletic version of the inception actor</seg>

<seg id="16">Russian silver medallist Yulia Efimova points out more than just the sun-fired skin and blonde hair like the actress Annalynne McCord, while American Nathan Adrian was attested by fans to same an athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt.</seg>
<seg id="17">Strong women: football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar facial and eyes</seg>
<seg id="18">Not the only one: a Twitter user was very happy that others were also struck by the similarities</seg>
<seg id="19">Theory in the space: according to this user, there is perhaps a reason for the couple's similarity</seg>
<seg id="20">A Twitter user explained their satisfaction that the rest of the internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical.</seg>
<seg id="21">Indeed, U.S. Football Hope Solo and the Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar facial form and eyes.</seg>
<seg id="22">Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and their smile, which is nearly identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as the gold medal winner in the Turner Gabby Douglas, which has her own beautiful, broad smile that resembles that of Bring It star Gabrielle Union.</seg>

<seg id="5">Macdonald, who had been picked up in the CBS's commentary team on board to give more colour, could be heard: "this little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby."</seg>
<seg id="6">Too excited, went off like lead, died like a pig.</seg>
<seg id="7">Thanks for that.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Chinese swimmer in Yanhan, 14, swam the second stage of swimming season 1: 57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, which allowed Canadians to close the gap to China.</seg>
<seg id="9">Viewers across Canada quickly responded online after being shocked by the tone and the language</seg>
<seg id="10">Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, 'Has the CBC commentator just saying that the 14-year-old swimmer from China has died like a pig? "</seg>

<seg id="23">We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that it was allowed to be broadcast.</seg>
<seg id="24">We quickly got apologised to our spectators yesterday night and our followers in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="25">To clarify one, Byrons comments related to the performance of the swimmer and not on her as a person.</seg>
<seg id="26">Yet they were inappropriate and an unfortunately elected wording, Byron does what he said were very suffering.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologised in the broadcast and tried to justify his comment by testifying that it was not his intention to be designed as a personal attack.</seg>
<seg id="28">I would like to take a moment to apologise for the comment I made after the women's swimming room in the CBC Olympics, he said.</seg>
<seg id="29">I got myself on the performance of the swimmer and not on them as a person. "</seg>

<seg id="2">The buyers didn't know where they should look when a woman pulled her clothes amid a primark to try underwear.</seg>
<seg id="3">To worsen the situation, she mustered how she looked at it, pulled her and put her back into the shelf.</seg>
<seg id="4">They continued and tried four pairs of underwear in a business in the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkstone.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Primark business at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone, in which the woman tried underwear before she put them back into the shelf</seg>
<seg id="6">A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the business at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear, she pulled herself again and left the business without buying something. "</seg>
<seg id="7">She said: "people couldn't believe what they saw."</seg>
<seg id="8">In the middle of the sales surface, she took a pair of underwear out of the outage, pulling her own tights and pants and tried her.</seg>
<seg id="9">She didn't even try to find a slightly more discreet place to do it - they just stood there, cheeky like Oskar. "</seg>
<seg id="10">Everyone starred when they pulled the underwear again, which they obviously didn't like them as they put them back into the shelf. "</seg>
<seg id="11">She repeated the same thing with three other underwear before finally deciding that her nothing liked herself, attracted and rushed out.</seg>
<seg id="12">She didn't disturb it that they watched someone - or think about the person who would buy the underwear in circumstances they had tried. "</seg>
<seg id="13">Mrs Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: 'how disgusting to think that someone would take underwear with home that has another person and who weren't washed. "</seg>
<seg id="14">The incident occurred Tuesday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="15">Ms Davidson added: 'how I got to get the staff trying to pull the garments out of sale after they went - which is just as good.</seg>
<seg id="16">I'd hate it to go home with a new couple's underwear and figure out that another woman has handed her and returned and they weren't washed.</seg>
<seg id="17">A spokesman for Primark said: "Primark is aware of the incident, which occurred on Tuesday 9 August at our branch in Folkstone."</seg>
<seg id="18">Any products coming into question were drawn from the sale.</seg>

<seg id="1">How to protect yourself with Krav Maga of gun attacks</seg>
<seg id="2">The world out is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make him a little safer for you.</seg>
<seg id="3">We spoke with Rhon Mizraci, a grandmaster of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at near distance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you approach you from the front or behind you, this video will show you how you turn for your robber's turn.</seg>
<seg id="5">If you get closer to yourself from behind, then you should turn yourself first, so you can see your attacker and get out of the firing line, "says Mizrachi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Take the gun then between your front arm and your shoulder before beating him in the face with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Strike him then with the knee in the performance and twist you, while the attacker gathers together against pain, the gun from his hands, beating him with the run into the face and moving backwards while addressing the gun on him.</seg>
<seg id="8">In attackers closer to front, the technique is similar - move your body from the firing line, take the gun and twist them, so the attacker can't shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">Shift at the same time the weight on the gun and beat the attacker on the chest, then twist the gun from his grip before moving backwards and targeting the gun on him.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds difficult?</seg>
<seg id="11">Look at the video to see exactly how it makes Micraizi.</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveller Ian Wright scores for a travel guide to his tongue to the dirtiest places of Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller underwent his immune system and citizenship of a serious examination - by leaving some of Europe's most dirtiest and most energetic places.</seg>
<seg id="3">The presenter and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shadowed his train on a euro ticket, a railing at the Piccadilly Circus, a rink of a Zugtoilette as well as a public phone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before the divergence of each object, he used a luminometer to show us and what he will enter.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title: The Lickhik's Guide to Inner Strength, brought some surprising results to daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought of disconnecting the flush of a train toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repellent, but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen ring.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his trip through Europe, Mr Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about promoting bacterial bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing left what he dismissed, more than a bad afterthought in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Wright became known for testing the resilience of his intestines by traveling through the world and ate strange as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public railings to station stations to rinsing toilets, the job put his immune system definitely under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film, he told: "already as a child, I was relatively uncomfortable about what affects my health and I've had all kinds of things put in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film, he was definitely fair to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His trial showed a luminome number of more than 4,000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">In comparison, the luminometry number is freshly washed hands less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet he refused to strip after their luminometers were over 4,000 units while freshly washed hands one of less than 60</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio produced the travel film The Lickies Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the bacterial number in different locations such as the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">In the film, he says: "this comes the worst of what I've smelled in a toilet, close."</seg>
<seg id="19">There's nothing more dirty than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I'm going to leave nothing here because it's indoors here.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Lickner's guide to Inner Streggth was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company provides Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both milk acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of bacterial bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we wanted to provide really something new to consumers.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to watch, while at the same time explaining the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We led crazy brainstorming through which ended up telling Lass Ian to call.</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest is going to be a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a wider context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it's linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary, we have been able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who led the film's director, adding: "let me say it like that - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I have depended on him, like the echoed Russian toilet shown in the film.</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course, there were things where it was easier to get Ian to cover them and others where this was pretty difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad we've taken some of these dirty leaks on film. "</seg>
<seg id="33">In one of Valio's 2015 survey, 84 per cent of all respondents associated milk acid bacteria, particularly with the welfare of stomach and intestine and 58 per cent said they at least occasionally use products that include attached milk acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">An asocial family left her social housing after a delogism with a damage of £50,000 because she had terrorized her neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebiccock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After being violently removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls highlighted gaping holes on, wooden diets were torn up, rubbish was scattered on the floor and graffiti was shelled to the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family have been resettled and it is believed they live in a private accommodation now</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for home administration at Cornwall Housing, said she worried that the home was no longer repaired.</seg>
<seg id="8">She said: 'it was an absolute nightmare for people here and I believe people don't have to live in this way.</seg>
<seg id="9">There are a lot of things to take into account as this property is believed to be considered not so nice part of Cornwalls.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is infamous and their reputation it is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons living in the apartment in the meantime and police said that terror, which had inflicted the family, included road fighting with baseballs, intimidating residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screaming, disputes and curling.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skeldon, 47, whose name stood on the rental contract, got an arrangement for anti-social behaviour in June.</seg>
<seg id="13">In some spaces of the house that will be demolished in circumstances, old rubbish was found</seg>
<seg id="14">It was in the property in which drugs were traded in the past, the timber diets</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours said they saw them fighting on the street and regularly had to call police</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing deloged her and her partner this week violently from the property after they gave them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to pull out voluntarily.</seg>
<seg id="17">The delogist was cheered by facilitated neighbours who said their lives were made to hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">One said: "they shouted around anyone."</seg>
<seg id="19">We lived alongside them 20 years and it was always bad.</seg>
<seg id="20">The countless times we say police here are incredible.</seg>
<seg id="21">This morning we couldn't sleep. "</seg>
<seg id="22">We stood up because it was so quiet here - that's not used to!</seg>
<seg id="23">Now where they are finally gone, it's going to be nice.</seg>
<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said the family had failed to cooperate with local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house to which police were called at regular intervals, for 20 years</seg>
<seg id="26">On the municipal side of the community house, rubbish and old toys</seg>
<seg id="27">He added: "it's a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and that of their family as a delogism is always the last step to consider Cornwall Housing.</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case as the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be terrible.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall as well as members of the community who have been courageous with us and have provided us with the information.</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope this development will donate some neighbor to comfort and convey the message that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">Fitzpatrick said all three sons had lived at different times in the house, but that they were all over 20.</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress left behind in one of the house's bedrooms after deloging on the ground</seg>
<seg id="33">Workers of home administration will now have to waver off rubbish mountains that surround the house</seg>
<seg id="34">In 2014, police led a crackdown in the house and found over 70g cannabis, as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash amounted to £1,700.</seg>
<seg id="35">Skeldon received a fine after being familiar with the possession of a drug of class B in trade intention.</seg>
<seg id="36">She claimed the money was for a tomb stone of her son, Lee Skeldon, who was killed in a car accident in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="37">After they were without a shelter, it will be assumed that Tanya and her partner now live in a private accommodation in Plymouth.</seg>
<seg id="38">Many of the house's room walls were covered with graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">Police say they will delogize tenants who don't get to the housing rules</seg>
<seg id="40">Angela Crow by police from Devon and Cornwall announced that the delogue was a clear warning to the other tenants who don't keep to the house order.</seg>
<seg id="41">This goes to those who think they can behave without self-charges as well as to those damaged by such behavior, "she said.</seg>
<seg id="42">Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.</seg>

<seg id="8">The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.</seg>

<seg id="13">The spokesman said the jet flew slightly deeper than usual because of the bad visibilities nearby, but the air forces insisted that safety was not at risk of time.</seg>
<seg id="14">Land fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer, where four people on the island of Madeira came to death.</seg>

<seg id="2">The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary commission on the case.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kenya's athletes are threatened after the second doping affair at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a fraud attempt at a doping control in the Olympic village, Kenya has sent a coach home.</seg>
<seg id="5">The International Olympic Committee told to immediately set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case.</seg>
<seg id="6">A Kenyan official had told that the former sprinter and today's coach, John Anzrah, made a urine sample under the name of the 800-metre runner Ferguson Rotich's name.</seg>
<seg id="7">This has been reported by the team management of Kenya by the doping inspectors.</seg>
<seg id="8">The IAAF World Association has asked the IOC to inform the case to engage its own investigations, an IAAF spokesman said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Depending on the results of the investigation and the IOC's following measures, the IAAF will make an assessment, "it said in an IAAF statement.</seg>
<seg id="10">He (American) has gone to the doping control station and has spent themselves as Ferguson Rotich, the test made and signed, "explained Kenyan chief executive de Mission Stephan Arap Soi.</seg>
<seg id="11">He was in possession of the athlete's accreditation, which was on the list for training controls of the World Anti-Doping Agency.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ferguson Rotich was in Beijing's World Cup fourth over 800 metres in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="13">Four days earlier, Kenyan athletics delegation chief Michael Rotich had been withdrawn from the Rio Games.</seg>
<seg id="14">He is expected to be informed against money payments athletes of his country over upcoming doping tests.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to media reports, he should have been arrested in his return at Nairobi airport.</seg>
<seg id="16">Kenya faces IOC after numerous doping offences have been under special observation for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="17">When announcing the IOC launched more than 2,000 doping target controls before the Rio Games, unusually previously pointed out that particularly athletes will be targeted from Kenya and Russia.</seg>
<seg id="18">The World Anti-Doping Agency had played a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer Games, creating an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.</seg>
<seg id="19">The law was passed a few weeks before Olympic begins.</seg>
<seg id="20">In a row, WADA Kenya took off from the list of countries whose doping compliance is compliant with WADA rules.</seg>
<seg id="21">Kenya is considered a big runner nation.</seg>
<seg id="22">The country's athletes won at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing most medals.</seg>
<seg id="23">In a series of television reports from the ARD, allegations have been raised repeatedly that in Kenya doping funds are easily accessible and there should be a significant mentality of sports fraud.</seg>
<seg id="24">IOC member Richard Pound last called for a similar investigation into Kenya as he employed her in Russian athletics.</seg>
<seg id="25">In doing so, it was possible to prove that in this sport, it was covered and systematically doped.</seg>
<seg id="26">Russia's athletes were then ruled out from the summer games.</seg>

<seg id="1">Salzburg's West Side Story with Cecilia Bartoli</seg>
<seg id="2">In the Shakespeare year, the Salzburg Festival presents the West Side Story, with Tony and Maria as a tragic love couple, similar to Romeo and Julia.</seg>
<seg id="3">With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.</seg>
<seg id="4">A Musical captures Salzburg: the West Side Story, Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.</seg>
<seg id="5">Artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of the classic and met with the role of Mary a youth dream.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the orchestra, the Simón Bolívar orchestra, led by the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: this music is full of rhythm, he swarms.</seg>
<seg id="7">We always say it is very Latin American.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are a lot of Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="10">I would say we really have Bernst's music in our blood!</seg>
<seg id="11">In this production, Bartoli plays an older Maria.</seg>
<seg id="12">She remembers with hurt of her love with Tony, while the younger Maria plays and dances.</seg>
<seg id="13">The role of Mary has always fascinated me.</seg>
<seg id="14">First, because it's musically extraordinary!</seg>
<seg id="15">And then there would be Maria's personality.</seg>
<seg id="16">She says in her song: "I feel pretty, oh pretty, feel pretty and witty and bright."</seg>
<seg id="17">So it's wise, of course, naive, and very passionate.</seg>
<seg id="18">She resembles me very much, my Italian character I have as a Roman, laughs Bartoli.</seg>
<seg id="19">Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."</seg>
<seg id="20">It's such an honour for us to work with it.</seg>
<seg id="21">She is an immensely generous person.</seg>
<seg id="22">And Bartoli gives the compliment back: "Dudamel is such an exceptional artist and very passionate!!</seg>
<seg id="23">Conducting is a necessity for him.</seg>
<seg id="24">You see it in every one of his movements, in his looks, it's his life!</seg>
<seg id="25">It's such a huge chance of sharing this musical experience with him.</seg>
<seg id="26">We both have a more southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a happy approach to life, that's very important at all!</seg>
<seg id="27">For American director Philip World, McKinley is the West Side Story highly topical: this piece is about prejudice and fanaticism. "</seg>
<seg id="28">Today we have the refugees, then the Puertorians went to New York, and the New York residents didn't want them.</seg>
<seg id="29">They are the same issues and they are just as meaningful today as they are.</seg>
<seg id="30">59 years later, the piece is still relevant.</seg>

<seg id="2">Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join the IS, died reports in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="3">Lawyer Tasnime Acunnee said her family learned a few weeks ago from her death in Raqqa, Syria.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air strike in Raqqa, the bullet of the group in the country, told ITV News on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="5">Sultana was 17 years old and died shortly after she planned to leave the war-torn country and return to England.</seg>
<seg id="6">One can only hope that the only good is in it - as a reminder and warning to others that this is the risks associated with going into a war - people from ever to make that decision, "said Akunjee.</seg>
<seg id="7">In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London rose to an aircraft towards Turkey and then to a bus to the Syrian border.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sultana's family was told she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and within a few months to widow.</seg>

<seg id="2">Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the Democrats' presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton will nominate the judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="3">Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland's confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.</seg>
<seg id="4">The majority leader in the Senate Mitch McConnell believes the next president will appoint the successor of the late Justice Antonin Scalia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Reid said Thursday during a phone conference that he expects Clinton to select Garland with a degree of certainty.</seg>
<seg id="6">A spokeswoman from Reid said later that he had not yet spoken to Clinton she would nominate Garland and he speculated.</seg>

<seg id="8">Garland is the top judge for the U.S. Appellation Court for the District of Columbia.</seg>

<seg id="2">Who doesn't adjust and praise Erdogan, sits on packed suitcases, "says the chairman of the Gülen-New Foundation dialogue and world, Ercan Karakoyun.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Kurdish community of Germany reckons in the short term with tens of thousands of protections fleeing from Turkey to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the medium term, it could even become a few hundred thousand, believes the association chairman Ali Toprak.</seg>
<seg id="5">Because of the tough approach by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the short run I reckon with tens of thousands, medium-term with some hundred thousand protection seekers from Turkey in Germany, when the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the Democratic opposition, "says the Association of Association Ali Toprak of the World of Friday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Because the government already overcame Kurdish strongholds with penalties months ago, 500,000 Kurds were on the run within Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="8">After the thwarted coup added secular and opposition ethnic Turks.</seg>
<seg id="9">Many will want to restart in Europe if they continue to suppress in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="10">It cannot be that a state that includes even refugees produces refugees in its own country, "said Toprak.</seg>
<seg id="11">The association complained the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in alert cities.</seg>
<seg id="12">As a result, Erdogan wants to increase exit pressure on the remaining Kurds.</seg>
<seg id="13">They are the last major minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have been eradicated or displaced in the past hundred years, "said Toprak, who is also CDU member.</seg>
<seg id="14">The association's chief called for the federal government to position itself as sharp as Austria against Erdogan and his supporters. "</seg>
<seg id="15">Also in Germany, a witch hunt takes place against Erdogan critics.</seg>
<seg id="16">I don't feel safe in Germany in recent months for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="17">The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad.</seg>
<seg id="18">More Turks will look for asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and opposition officials.</seg>
<seg id="19">The fire mark as Gülen supporters destroys teachers and other academics the professional existence.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who doesn't adapt and praise Erdogan, sits on packed suitors, by the way, including the Kemalists and seculars, "said Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen near dialogue and education, the world.</seg>
<seg id="21">As the newspaper reported, citing figures from the Federal Interior Ministry, the Turks already posed the biggest group of asylum-seekers recognised in Germany because of political persecution.</seg>
<seg id="22">On the cut-off date June 30, this were 11,386 people, and therefore just under 29 per cent of all as asylum recognised (39,625).</seg>
<seg id="23">This survey did not find themselves fled to war, poverty or perspective.</seg>
<seg id="24">Asylum entitlements under the basic law are exclusively political, therefore by government side, individually persecuted.</seg>

<seg id="1">Mecklenburg power: 'going where it hurts</seg>
<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg powers: the locals get nothing back from the summer campaign with - and the holidaymakers from North North West West are not allowed to choose the country.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg, they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2021, the land election will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays, the heavy parliament has already decided earlier this year.</seg>
<seg id="5">Because than before, it's not about: summer holidays, heat and rural election campaign - biting.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals to be convinced by campaigners are on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most holidaymakers who are in the country on Usedom, Russia or Hiddensee are not locals, so they may not vote the country.</seg>
<seg id="8">These are practical problems: in the holidays, workers who hang posters hang up, blowing balloons, distributing flyers and counting at the end of votes, only painful to feature.</seg>
<seg id="9">By the time of September 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg Pomeranians once still have to campaign barely past themselves over.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot period, if you can say that ever, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, must fear for his office.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, since 1998's strongest party, is now clear in polls behind the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting, how strongly New AfD cuts down and what remains left on the end of the coalition.</seg>
<seg id="14">Celering, 66 years old and since 2008 chief executives, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign, seeing its big posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels through land, distributing roses and chatting a little with people, just as it also did his legendary worthy predecessor Harald Ringstorff.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise, sailoring has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel blamed on the bloom of the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their refugee policy, her we create that, have accelerated the rise of legal populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful office.</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its top candidate, Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when you make election campaigning at the wrong time at the right place.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has invited twice Chancellor Angela Merkel to big rallies; Merkel federal election constituency is in the Northeast.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine Westphalians, Berliners and Saxony than Mecklenburger and premeditation.</seg>
<seg id="21">As there was probably the majority from other federal states, Vincent cocktails, general secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg, recently in the NDR.</seg>
<seg id="22">But it is also a pity no one from other corners of Germany to listen once Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise, the northeastern CDU is largely renouncing the usual campaign standings on marketplaces and before shopping centres with sunshines and aerial balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">That, so thinks costume, play only a 'subdued role. "</seg>
<seg id="25">The union has also noted that on the country, it takes away the base that it needs to be very exhausted again to find a wire to people.</seg>
<seg id="26">You go like the left, the SPD, the Greens: barely available in the expansions of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the CDU campaigner's concern to his comrades is also self-defensive: "you have to go where it hurts, namely where people are: village festivals, Golden Weddings, every birthday party must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called on his SPD to a particularly committed campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In polls, the Social Democrats were last with 22 per cent behind partners CDU (25) and just before the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">At the 2011 election, the SPD had still clearly won 35.6 per cent before the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Greens, small party with seven per cent in the polls, are likely to create the jump in the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">They make out of holiday distress a modern virtue and move their campaigning largely to the internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">Online campaigning, calling it the country's chairman Claudia Müller.</seg>
<seg id="34">Otherwise, green campaigners are encountering lane search for domestic voting citizens among the holidaymakers.</seg>
<seg id="35">Silke Gajek, the top candidate, is straight with a houseboat through the mecklenburgic lakes and it also finds it still beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="36">Her impression: 'polling holidays in Mecklenburg is not a punishment. "</seg>

<seg id="1">B27 rehabilitation: restaurants suffer from blocking</seg>
<seg id="2">There's nothing to mean by the speed with which the B 27 is sane.</seg>
<seg id="3">For those responsible for the construction works, which start at 5.30am in the morning and only end up at about 8pm, there's allential praise.</seg>
<seg id="4">They've done everything pretty zacking, "told Elvira Tetzlaff of the Jet petrol station.</seg>
<seg id="5">That's a super super.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no delay either.</seg>
<seg id="7">The building site could be relocated to the south at the start of the week by the end of October, everything is expected to finish.</seg>
<seg id="8">It also praises the accommodation of those responsible for construction work, such as when it comes to setting up behind driveways.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site has migrated to the south on Monday, and also lifted the locking of the Asperstrasse in Ofterdingen and therefore the connection to Rottenburg again, the traffic situation within the place has relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="10">Citizens can now be on both sides from oftendons from the B 27.</seg>
<seg id="11">The extraction traffic through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since there was partially significant complaint, "says the deputy manager Florian King's responsible deputy management of traffic management.</seg>
<seg id="13">Residents of Beith Street, Steinschargstrasse, Hafnerstrasse and Weiherrain had been fighting with more traffic noise because many of the cruises were looking for and more familiar to their navi than the signage.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to some trucks fractured in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the speed limits were not complied with, the community increased the measuring vehicle.</seg>
<seg id="16">There were significant excesses, "says King, who made himself on the ground about the situation.</seg>
<seg id="17">There have been two to three per minute.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fastest was travelling with 77 hour kilometres in the pace 30-zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">Since the building site has continued, but it has become quiet.</seg>
<seg id="20">For businessmen at the B 27, it's only a small consolation that for customers from Rottenburn, the street is now open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people are not liked to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But that the B-27 remodeling has resulted in revenue growth in them, leaving everyone you ask.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more and some less affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">Anyone with the end customer has less to do, so for other firms, the clean-up has barely consequences.</seg>
<seg id="25">Even at the automaker Maier, Thomas Sulz speaks of a "maximum slight decline, but also acknowledges that, of course, the running story is missing."</seg>
<seg id="26">The most battered are the locals along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, owner of the steakhouse, foremost crown, finds clear words.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already an existential threat.</seg>
<seg id="29">Not only him, but all the restaurants hit it's hard. "</seg>
<seg id="30">There was a lack of customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil.</seg>
<seg id="31">We have got to be happy about any euro sales.</seg>
<seg id="32">The revenue loss is quanting on "well over 50 per cent."</seg>
<seg id="33">The roadblocks have dropped his operation by two years. "</seg>
<seg id="34">Half of his employees have had to dismiss.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 staff and half would have been dismissed, politics would have responded differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, government president Jörg Schmidt has responded to a question from Göhner, whether there could be a financial compensation, with the reference to responding that the restaurant will otherwise benefit from the benefits of the situation on the B 27 now, they also have to wear the disadvantages that result from the rehabilitation.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhners know from other counties where something like this has been handled more generously.</seg>
<seg id="38">In all complaints, Göhner is sure to continue his restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, family operations have been located here since 1715, pointing to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">That other regulars now look less frequent because of the complicated traffic management can understand.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't hear it, it's beautiful even elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="42">The fact that his regular climbers come back after the end of the remedial work, Göhner has no doubts.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises with BSE and bird flu, Göhner holds the impact of the B7 construction work on its clients for the biggest crisis that has experienced its restaurant history in its longstanding story.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six months of construction work, this is already brutal.</seg>

<seg id="1">It is constantly being screwed up in the name of combating terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="2">After the recent attacks, Interior Minister de Maizière now presents a thick security package.</seg>
<seg id="3">But what has a toleration status to do with terror?</seg>
<seg id="4">And what does the coalition partner say about all this?</seg>
<seg id="5">Thomas de Maizière gives the reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="6">All of his proposals were politically reasonable to the Coalition Partner, says the Federal Minister on the idea of his new security package.</seg>
<seg id="7">They don't overcome anyone.</seg>
<seg id="8">Other, further points would be discussed inside the parties initially.</seg>
<seg id="9">I'm also participating in that.</seg>
<seg id="10">As an interior minister, however, he was located in results and on a 'achievable consensus within the coalition.</seg>
<seg id="11">De Maizière has passed a little time after recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach before presenting his conclusions for security in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="12">The falls for this, though, are all the more extensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">Some is already known, announced: that a new security agency is to take care of the crackdown encrypted communications is not new.</seg>
<seg id="14">Nor does Germany have to implement several EU requirements on passenger data and gun law.</seg>
<seg id="15">The call for more video surveillance and staff for security authorities comes just as not surprisingly.</seg>
<seg id="16">Partly, de Maizière launches a second run for suggestions that have not been made with the SPD so far: he wants to punish sympathy for terrorist groups and punish jihadists with double citizenship off the German passport.</seg>
<seg id="17">This will be difficult points for the SPD, admits to the CDU man.</seg>
<seg id="18">He doesn't consider this to be reasonable and also demands nothing that doesn't have any chances at the coalition partner anyway.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few new ideas presented de Maizière as well.</seg>
<seg id="20">They have it partly in themselves: it plans to speed up quick procedures for deportation and more opportunities to determine people before deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees targeted in the country are expected to check their smartphones before and disclose social media accounts for a security review.</seg>
<seg id="22">In tolerations for rejected asylum seekers, he wants some even worse than previously - such as those who commit offences or throw away their papers to cover up their identity.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of this is political and legally delicate.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some are also still impossible and leaves questions open.</seg>
<seg id="25">And on some points - during inequality of tolerated for example - the question poses: what actually does this have to do with security and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, says de Maizière is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it doesn't conclude, yes, that the assassins of Ansbach and Werzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">Moreover, given the high refugee figures, many people were concerned about security.</seg>
<seg id="29">And things that people deeply employed now also didn't exclude even in campaign time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Internal security is enormous in the focus.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Wirzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The uncertainty is great.</seg>
<seg id="34">And yes, there are campaigning.</seg>
<seg id="35">Union and SPD are therefore increasingly in position on the issue of internal security.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the past few days, it was high between the two parties.</seg>
<seg id="37">Just a garden dispute over the federal police, then about a security ideas collection of some Union interior ministers, in which the residents "leaders also demand a burka ban and a departure from dual citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="38">De Maizière is also struggling here to be conciliatory tones.</seg>
<seg id="39">From a departure from double passport, he didn't have anything.</seg>
<seg id="40">We pacified the discussion in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">Remodeling them is not meaningful.</seg>
<seg id="42">And in a burka ban, he had constitutional concerns.</seg>
<seg id="43">Whether its own package on all corners is constitutional and whether it is actually reasonable for the coalition partner, has yet to show.</seg>
<seg id="44">There is something in it what could provide controversy.</seg>
<seg id="45">But the SPD is also currently trying to profit on the issue of internal security.</seg>
<seg id="46">Leader Sigmar Gabriel only signals cautious discussion readiness and says: "the SPD is prepared to talk about everything that helps to increase security further."</seg>

<seg id="1">Still, Volkswagen comes through.</seg>
<seg id="2">Despite diesel scandals, extradition figures rise worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="3">But not in all markets runs around.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the recall action, there's swirling about a term.</seg>
<seg id="5">Volkswagen launches behaviour in the deliveries in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="6">Europe's largest automaker can continue to provide a plus in the previous year despite the diesel effects thanks to its many brands and some well-running markets.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in July, the core brand VW weakened in western Europe, putting it back to the total sale, as the company noted in the Dax.</seg>
<seg id="8">Worldwide, the brand VW sold in July with 449,000 cars 1.8 per cent fewer vehicles than in the previous month.</seg>
<seg id="9">In Western Europe alone, to China the second most important market, sales were 14 per cent under the previous month.</seg>
<seg id="10">In Germany's home market, the deliveries slipped by almost a sixth.</seg>
<seg id="11">Brand distributor Jürgen Stackmann led the weaker figures from July, especially on two sales days less in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, in some core markets, by changing economic framework conditions, there was a buying retention.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition to the situation around the coup in Turkey, the British vote to leave from the EU has also explained a spokeswoman.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US, where the exhaust affair escalated first, it also continues to be a minuscule.</seg>
<seg id="15">Big supporters for VW is the Chinese market.</seg>
<seg id="16">Overall, the mainly affected household brand of Lower Saxony continues to come by the diesel scandal anyway: after the first seven months, only an extradition minus falls from 0.9 per cent to 3.37 million vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="17">Group sales chief Fred Kappler could continue to provide a sales plug from January to July.</seg>
<seg id="18">1.3 per cent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen at this time, worldwide 5.904 million.</seg>
<seg id="19">Volkswagen had manipulated with a software exhaust gas.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany alone, VW calls 2.5 million cars to convert into the workshops.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the wake of conversion, VW reaffirmed that the reconstruction of the cars has no negative effects.</seg>
<seg id="22">After converting the vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, carbon emissions or engine performance.</seg>
<seg id="23">The automaker presents customers after converting a "guarantee certificate, but don't speak of a" guarantee, as opposed to corporate circles on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="24">The reason is legal fine units.</seg>
<seg id="25">The focus had reported that Volkswagen is now granting its German customers a guarantee for revamped diesel models.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would have confirmed VW representatives in the Federal Department of Department last Monday.</seg>
<seg id="27">Confirmed from the Department of Transport that there was this meeting.</seg>
<seg id="28">VW has fully fulfilled the conditions of my investigative commission and the KBA. "</seg>
<seg id="29">Deviations of these are not accepted, "said Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), according to the ministry.</seg>
<seg id="30">VW has taken the guarantee that in fuel consumption, carbon emissions or engine power after conversion, there will be no deterioration and have all type-approved vehicle values unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="31">Volkswagen itself uses the term's guarantee but not as it did in corporate circles.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the vast term's guarantee, Volkswagen sees the possibility that, for example, customers could come into a workshop for example after conversion - and this could return to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.</seg>
<seg id="33">Even in customer interest, it is important to avoid the fact that any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust scandal comes to an uncertainty about possible warranty arrangements, as it does.</seg>
<seg id="34">That's why VU doesn't use the term's guarantee.</seg>

<seg id="2">Bank chief executive Josef Paul said Thursday: "it's only 139 customers who park 40 million euros on giro or daily accounts."</seg>
<seg id="3">The Federal Association of Deutsche Banks speaks of an individual case and does not see it as a signal: ordinary savers would not need to be afraid to pay for their savings criminal penalties.</seg>
<seg id="4">Camp banks money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), must pay their 0.4 per cent penalty.</seg>
<seg id="5">This fee requires Raiffeisenbank Gmund from September from private and corporate customers for deposits over £100,000 to giro or daily accounts.</seg>
<seg id="6">"The first £100,000 are free."</seg>
<seg id="7">The next 100,000 costs £400 in the year, "Paul said.</seg>
<seg id="8">He has been wary of 40 million euros for some time, which could be lifted from one day to the other and which he couldn't recover.</seg>
<seg id="9">"They are on the central bank account and cause 0.4 per cent cost," the bank's chief said.</seg>
<seg id="10">I can't hint for every million 4,000 euros. "</seg>
<seg id="11">The cost he now continues after the polluter principle is now.</seg>
<seg id="12">Letting the cash just be in the trespasses of the Raiffeisenbank would be far too dangerous: I have experienced four overs, I don't want to get the fifth of them!, "the bank's board said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Most customers would have understanding and changed to other investment forms.</seg>
<seg id="14">Few wandered to other banks.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Co-operative Association Bayern said: the ECB's extreme monetary policy course causes significant costs at all banks. "</seg>
<seg id="16">Carrying it alone is business permanently not possible. "</seg>

<seg id="19">Michael Kemmer, chief executive director of the banking association, said: "we don't expect private customers to have to pay coverage of charges for deposits, so the competition in Germany is far too strong in Germany under banks and savings banks."</seg>
<seg id="20">A banker said there's on the Tegernsee there's been a clientele that is slightly luxurious from the assets. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This can become the problem for a little bank's problem when they are wary of free money.</seg>
<seg id="22">The 1911 Co-operative Bank Gmund has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernese.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the region, familiar actors, athletes and entrepreneurs live.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Co-operative Association Bayern is currently not known any other banks that charge a replacement for deposits of private clients, "spokesman seriously said.</seg>
<seg id="25">The president of the Federal Federation of German People's Banks and Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), Uwe happiness, had explained at the end of June: "the threshold, into negatives towards the private client, is very, very high."</seg>

<seg id="3">Before rushing to the commentary to overturn him under the pseudonym non-selling men's age with rough insults, this statement is heading from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the much-discussed resurgence of records is not on a boom in Millennials who want to welcome the news of physical objects, but attributable to midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a plate are all predicted to be aged between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group.</seg>
<seg id="7">Nor is it hordes through hobby collectors - it has an emotional significance: older record buyers retain their feelings more for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending alone time (69% vs 66 per cent).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do YouGov's results vote?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would be a news report on television, the camera would follow me while I run amid a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest grey suit before I stand, keep my hands and say something definitely like: 'let's throw us a closer look at it. "</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let us look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm, hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were based - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialist business.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and trying to assess their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I do from Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three men's middle age) to the Reckless Records (data number: eight men's middle age, a woman, presumably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the business to fill the couple of hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">I'm already appreciating, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, above pictured (he sent me the snapshot by email, I didn't follow him home), dress up the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he owns such a significant number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: he is now capable of buying records that he couldn't afford when they appeared and once again buying items he sold when he was young and bust.</seg>
<seg id="19">'Many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s who appeared when I was 11 or 12, things I was probably too young to buy them, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy plates are more introverted and like to spend time alone, adding: 'I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.</seg>
<seg id="21">That's my last.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes many customers he meets on the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he has also noticed a new wave of people affected by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and prompting to buy again their old plates.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of the talks I have led, people generally relented in 1998 or 1999 of their collection.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy again their records, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to supporters of the record revival of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional significance of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realise that record business offers a soothing community of peers.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers took push to the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to withdraw to the stability of familiar records, from objects that recall happy youth reminders.</seg>
<seg id="31">I think sometimes it can be the filling of an emptiness or possession of material possessions than some sort of consolation, "WEZ WEZ.</seg>
<seg id="32">That's with me as a collector and I think it's happening among many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It's an easy way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">We're like their social workers!, a staff from a record stack.</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey by the ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who bought a record last month have not yet listened.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% own a record player they never use, while 7% of those buying a record do not own a record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would presumably look very concerned while I leave through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data number: three men of middle age), has noticed a trophy aspect of the revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"Someone only recently came here recently and said: 'I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a radiochead record so I can put them into the shelf," he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a huge percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More product, less music.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say I don't have a record player...</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older, who only slowly get in.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which devoted the record almost an entire floor, has a bungled audience than I get in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make the photographs, teenage and women of middle age.</seg>
<seg id="46">Although the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the aforementioned businesses - Wild Beast's latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz browns from the loudspeakers - it's good to see such diversity among customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them look particularly lonely, but nagging mental trauma are hard to determine when you're standing alongside someone 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around in the business for some minutes and considers the variety of the records on sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">She's more likely to make a story stroll than a major purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">It doesn't earn much, so the collection of plates is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to hear music from a computer or in other ways, but the beauty of plates is... "she drives with a lovely sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how I should explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business, which is believed to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I look at the appearance of patting the Jeans-Hottans, I watched a group of young teenagers who are grouping for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are considering buying a Crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">To the left, there is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one sees them - perhaps because they are just purely decorative, some so top that it's impossible to grab them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It's pure record art.</seg>
<seg id="59">But given that any attraction for these items means more money for the industry and could send some customers into the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">It's no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, is also the one who spends most for luxury items such as records.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my investigations showed that the results of YouGov vote, they let them, at least in plate shops in Soho, leave the large number of female collectors who exist in reality, record business and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard in school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday tomorrow with certainty not with the strolls through plate shops of the Berwick Street and leaves through records while avoiding the startling look of an unruly, 30-year-old's false presenter who appears over the shoulders of nothing middle-aged men.</seg>

<seg id="1">French court rejects offer on demolition of business in the jungle refugee camp</seg>
<seg id="2">A French court has rejected an offer by authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional stores and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a trial this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorized to deflect 72 provisional businesses in which people within the camp, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Calais prefecture argued that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and that there would be a fire and sanitary risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important as free meals offered by the government-backed association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing figures in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also led to the fact that the provisional business and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in distress.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there was no legal basis for expulsion of people who operate the 72 provisional businesses, but conceded that the concerns of Calais's prefecture were absolutely understandable. "</seg>
<seg id="8">The judge Jean-François Molla said that food businesses, cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than merely feed people who live in extremely precarious conditions.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places threatened by the riot was the Jungle Book kids "cafe of the camp, which is operated unnecessarily and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to keep the kids' cafe.</seg>
<seg id="12">In a letter to the Guardian, it said the closure would be "for these children of a disaster, of which the latest eight years old."</seg>
<seg id="13">The two aid agencies Help Refugees and L Auberge of the Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of those in the jungle camp had risen to over 9,000 people - the highest number to now - following a steep increase in new arrivals during the summer.</seg>

<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance at 7-7 rugby arrived in the final Thursday evening to an abrupt stop at the final hurdle in the form of Fiji, when it was beaten with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji issued a master class in handling, side stepping, neighbours, line and raw force to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any colour.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was sweetened by the not too bad consolation price of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could well be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall on them in the finals.</seg>
<seg id="6">But, regardless, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in best form in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for GB - but will probably not - that at least one Briton will hang a gold medal around his neck: Fijis chief coach Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult way behind.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, they lost under Ryan every game at the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">They lost only here.</seg>
<seg id="11">This slap will hurt, but the progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began wonderful and left the attacks GBs out of fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. as if you were going to run in travelling buses... the World Series winners went 5-0 up, when Osea Kolinisau rebounded in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With still four minutes of season, Jerry Tuwai still added another attack from the right corner he converted.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly covered the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A heavy tackle from Mitchell stopped stopping the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa a third goal, but it just stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute, JASA Veremalua in the right corner was a touchdown and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new since the replay and there was still over a minute of season... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou presented by further weak tacklings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a gateway.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's like Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB still learns.</seg>
<seg id="22">That's how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB conducted fundamental changes at half-time by and concluded the Fijian gap.... for a whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half well until Josua Tuisova gone through Fiji after a brilliant interim play.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game has long been in favour of the Southern Seanslaner, whose fans sweated flags and danced on the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">It wasn't hard to admire Fiji's playoff approach.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame set this in items with another attempt in the final seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The pepper, the Fijis embraced and GB damningly beaten into the lawn.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier in the day, Fiji Japan defeated Japan in the semi-finals with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a narrow semi-final match from the race - Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the boks in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive foot work and scored a gate among the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late tackling of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the gain - and therefore the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning through fight with the coach's cancer to run inspire</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no more emotional gold than these games and that wants to hot.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first row to the last, 220 hard Hieve, who go into the story, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an extra significance at their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though it was just the two that sat on the helm, there were three votes in the boat... The echo of the trainer Robin Williams was present as she rushed to the second Olympic game in the two without tax woman in a row, the first women in the history of British sport that set off such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolutely, after all, her 39th unbeaten use, which is also unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see is two brilliant athletes who slide across the surface with the elegance of swans, which doesn't reflect the kind of triumph all the time.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind each gold in the row, a battalion to willing helpers contribute to the incremental progress that make up the difference and it was no one more helpful than the coach who didn't know about 30 months ago whether he would survive that day at all than was diagnosed with him cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he was risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bubble cancer, which is operational and they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you don't, he spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little bit of the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he was able to start treatment in early 2014, outside the season, which kept the interruption to a minimum if this is the right term in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">That's how it starts.</seg>
<seg id="19">The rowing in itself is already a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the immediacy of the victory, their first thought to Williams, who spent an annoying morning spent something more than otherwise, trying to process his own anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="21">Stanning, who was a principal in the Royal Artillery Regiment in Afghanistan, said I was an emotional wreck this week, which is perhaps something extreme, but it means so much. "</seg>
<seg id="22">It's repeated just how much me meant how much I and Helen and Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin, we wouldn't be anyone, so a massive thanks to him, he is the best coach in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I wouldn't have a better person to train or want a better coach.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race over the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a tough rhythm with which their opponents couldn't keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 metres when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to close, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very captured at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "remains in the process, remain in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It's really important not to get involved.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not about to make something Tolles.</seg>
<seg id="33">We didn't want fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go beyond and win the race, what we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a time for a year before making decisions about his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover must appear next week on a wedding, her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that was my last race.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">In London, it took around six months to realise I'm an Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="40">It was all so new for me and I was so stressed.</seg>
<seg id="41">It took about four minutes here.</seg>
<seg id="42">It feels so much better than that, "she said.</seg>

<seg id="1">31 years exemplary for clarity</seg>
<seg id="2">The managing director of the Water Purpose Association, Ruppert Göller, goes into retirement.</seg>
<seg id="3">The association is considered a bay's exemplary. "</seg>
<seg id="4">A small French drinking water purpose association as a model for the big water producers.</seg>
<seg id="5">That's how it said some time ago in the original in a contribution of Bavarian broadcasting.</seg>
<seg id="6">Soon afterwards, the government's water forum praised the purpose association.</seg>
<seg id="7">The work of the Veitestern group applied bayerness as an exemplary. "</seg>
<seg id="8">Behind all this, Rupert Göller, who was 31 years in the purpose of staff, including 28 years as managing director.</seg>
<seg id="9">Now he was passed into retirement at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The drinking water purpose association of the village group, based in Kottendorf, community of broadbrunn, promotes about 150,000 cubic feet of water annually and supplies 32 places and hamlets with about 5,500 residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">Member communities are the communities of church, breadth, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.</seg>
<seg id="12">For more cities and communities there are water deliveries.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current chairman, Breitbrunn Mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller stopped as a waterway in 1985 and was appointed managing director of the purpose association back in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"His tasks have been very diverse and they covered water construction and maintenance work on office and organisational activities, budget planning, calculating fees and contributions to emergency responsibilities on weekends," the chairman said.</seg>
<seg id="15">As outstanding events called them the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells (1994), property purchases in the area of the new wells (1998) and compensation of farmers, the rehabilitation of the high-containers (1999), the re-creation of a central computer control (2004) and partial renewals of water lines.</seg>
<seg id="16">There has been no standoff and you have repeatedly recorded innovations because water lives mean and drinking water the most important food.</seg>
<seg id="17">In her laudation, she praised Göller's loyal, reliable and correct service over 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">He has used a lot of heart blood for his water purpose association and he has lived the waterproof association as if it were his own company.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he should be allowed to present the vein's track record on nitrate reduction before the district's waterforum.</seg>
<seg id="20">For that, he received very much recognition and praise.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rupert Göller, on the one hand, praised waterway Alfons Griebel, who worked with him 28.</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - Lightness for Deutsche Steel Industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-backed and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared an extra cost of millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens, which the industry threatened from energy support, are off the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">It remains in liberation from the renewable energy surcharge at the inventories for so-called equipment production in the German steel industry, said Federal Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the West General Newspaper (WAZ, Friday edition).</seg>
<seg id="5">I'm really happy that we could finally achieve that after two years of tough negotiations. "</seg>
<seg id="6">The European Commission, therefore, initially had planned to ask the steel manufacturers to use gases from the block to power generation for its own consumption.</seg>
<seg id="7">The steel industry threatened an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros a year, according to the German industry association.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel told the WAZ there is now a principle agreement with the EU commission after talks with competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is only when the generators are replaced in the steelworks, falling an EEG-pay of 20 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="10">But these are not going to be raised in the steel industry, too.</seg>
<seg id="11">The IG Metal welcomed Germany's agreement with the EU commission on standard production.</seg>
<seg id="12">As a result, the status quo of the previous settlement will be largely enshrined.</seg>
<seg id="13">Particular importance has Gabriel's successful efforts for the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="14">In terms of our campaign's stole, the future is this is the first step. "</seg>
<seg id="15">Others must follow.</seg>
<seg id="16">Even in the reform of emissions trading, climate and employment targets are weighing, "explained IG chief executive Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.</seg>
<seg id="17">The steel industry in Europe has been suffering from overcapacity since the 2008 financial crisis, and a significant price pressure.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year the situation continued, when the world's largest producer country threw China on the world market in the face of weakening domestic demand.</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers throw Chinese steel corporations price dumping.</seg>
<seg id="20">Throughout this spring, the situation has relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="21">For one, imposed import tariffs on import steel effect, to the other, the economic prospects in China have brightened up.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.</seg>
<seg id="23">German industry industry Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Most recently, prices were more likely to have stagnated.</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost cutting.</seg>
<seg id="26">ThyssenKrupp latest wanted not to exclude closures of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">Around 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry in late 2015.</seg>
<seg id="28">In July, despite rising prices and increasing orders, German steelmakers remain cautious.</seg>
<seg id="29">They produced with 3.4 million tonnes well six per cent fewer crude than in the previous month, as the Business Association told Steel on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="30">After a short increase in May, the manufactured crowd now went back the second month in a row.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since the beginning of the year, production is up two per cent below the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="32">The association expects increased emissions in the coming months thanks to improved orders.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, Spirit, Health: singing does seniors well</seg>
<seg id="2">The singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp already accompanying her whole life: as a young girl she was in school choir, in teaching studies she finished the complete music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior chorus.</seg>
<seg id="3">Singing moves me - emotionally and physically, "she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a sample, she feels balanced, happily and overall, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good about her health and spirit.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because singing is right from several perspectives a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler of Deutsche Seniorleniga.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the chorus and share with equalisers the pleasure of the music, describing Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through the regular connection, seniors can make social contacts and maintain.</seg>
<seg id="9">For frequently, social and family structures are solving age, a chorus then is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her chorus: 'to organise and organize yourself to leave on the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of combination. "</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, means Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">For this is where seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Anyone who regularly demands his lungs also doesn't get out of the puste every day.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice aged, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">On older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz of the federal working community of senior organisations.</seg>
<seg id="16">In older generations, common singing had a much higher importance, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and recreation, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz observes frequently that singing or listening to songs among older people raises many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth time.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through lyrics and particularly melodies, even demeaning people are resisting long back events.</seg>
<seg id="19">When singing, the head is also demanded a special performance, explains Lein.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time focusing on their own voice and on a predetermined rhythm and adapting themselves to the other singers - that's a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just older people who live alone are practicing, not only to focus on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition you learn through the singing in the chorus, thinks Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Self-esteem is also growing through the singing in the chorus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Showing yourself: if I long for something, I will be better and growing across me - strengthening that experience.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to begin with the singing, therefore, there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Anyone who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks little talent advises Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - at 50 singing people, who's listening already when a tone goes along?</seg>
<seg id="29">Looking for the appropriate offer, seniors have different possibilities, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">Singing someone from the acquaintance group in a senior choir, you can just join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities are also offering overviews about the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Anyone who wants to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the community or the church appearance.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs are also found over the internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">If you have no access to the internet, the family, friends or neighbours are asking for help in the Internet search.</seg>
<seg id="35">Who desires to sing, should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing the soul good and has something liberating - that applies to any age.</seg>

<seg id="4">Female cats can recognize the emotion of cat babies at the middle of the little.</seg>
<seg id="5">They respond to 10 per cent faster on lutters of kittens who were in great distress, as scientists have found out from the veterinary university and the Medical College Hanover (MHH).</seg>

<seg id="7">Apparently, the acoustic differences between the miaue of less and sharply hit young animals for the males either not perceived or not of importance, "said biologist Wiebke Conerding from the MHH.</seg>
<seg id="8">She is an author of the study published this Friday in the specialist magazine of BMC Evolutionary Biology.</seg>
<seg id="9">In a previous investigation, the research team had already found that the duration and pit of kitten shouting differs with the urgency of its need for help.</seg>
<seg id="10">Overall, we have been watched nine adult hangovers and eight kits from the livestock farming of the MHH.</seg>
<seg id="11">They were played for a call of minors who were taken from the burs for three minutes and separated by mother and siblings.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the same time, they were confronted with shouts of stronger kittens, which were additionally highlighted.</seg>
<seg id="13">The researchers hold their results despite the small sample for meaningful.</seg>
<seg id="14">All the females, even those who had not yet had their own offspring, responded differentiation on the cries, "said conversing.</seg>
<seg id="15">They turned up more quickly to the loudspeaker when this call of the more vulnerable kittens.</seg>
<seg id="16">This ability may be born or developed with gender maturity.</seg>
<seg id="17">"A surprise was that the males have responded at all," the biology said.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the past, scientists have already investigated responses from women and men on baby noise.</seg>
<seg id="19">Again, some studies showed that women responded more sensitive to babies, regardless of whether they were already mothers or not, the biologist Marina Scheumann reported.</seg>

<seg id="7">Even with the imposition of the state of emergency after the July attempt, the government pleaded not to affect everyday lives of ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="8">But this is not true for those suspected of addressing the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is responsible for the coup attempt.</seg>

<seg id="15">The sport is - like the whole country - divided into supporters and opponents of Erdogan.</seg>
<seg id="16">Especially fans of the working-club's Besiktas traditionally don't count to the president's friends.</seg>
<seg id="17">But what the bulk of the Turks unites in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military councils.</seg>
<seg id="18">In this is where even even the fans agree - no matter whether their for Galatasaray or Besiktas.</seg>
<seg id="19">At Cup winner Gala, it will particularly arrive at Lukas Podolski.</seg>

<seg id="4">Other overtaken athletics sinners can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">The issue of doping determines the headlines at the Rio Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="6">Russian swimmer Juliya Jefifowa, who had been charged with their starting law just before the Games, was mercilessly peaceful at her start (100 metres of chest).</seg>
<seg id="7">It offered a wrinkly scene: with an established smile, she was still prouded into the hall and provoked with her appearance.</seg>
<seg id="8">When they were not going to get gold, the audience broke into a jubilant storm.</seg>
<seg id="9">But there are still numerous other athletes who despite doping past go to the start at the Rio Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here's an overview:</seg>
<seg id="11">Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x1400-staffer / USA): the 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics.</seg>
<seg id="12">He was already closed twice because of doping (2001 and 2006 to 2010).</seg>
<seg id="13">Since his ban, the 2004 Olympic champion and ex-world champion runs even faster than before, he is over 100m in 9.80 seconds, the number one in the world and is considered to be the biggest challenger from Usain Bolt.</seg>
<seg id="14">Shelly Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100-Staffel / Jamaika): the two-time Olympic champion and seven-time world champion had to serve a six-month lock in 2010 after her taking off the painkiller Oxycodon was proven.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Austrian Embassy in Thailand are in contact with the woman, said the State Department's spokesman, Thomas Schnell, Friday morning.</seg>
<seg id="3">She suffered cutting edge and had been treated at the hospital, but this one can already leave.</seg>
<seg id="4">Her home trip was scheduled for early September.</seg>
<seg id="5">Whether from the further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket, as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon also affected Austrian citizens, were still unclear for now.</seg>
<seg id="6">The State Department is in constant contact with the local authorities, according to school.</seg>
<seg id="7">In about 200 kilometers south of the capital, Bangkok, Hua had initially exploded two bombs on Thursday night in a nightclub.</seg>
<seg id="8">In doing so, according to police, a Thai child was killed and about 20 people have been injured, including the Austrians, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.</seg>
<seg id="9">Friday morning then again took two explosives, with another person killed, according to the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="10">A bomb explosion was also reported in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the detonation near the popular beach of Patong, a taxi driver was injured after police claims.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Surat Thani on the country's southeast coast, another bomb then exploded, killing an urban employee.</seg>
<seg id="13">The explosives went into the air, according to authorities in a flower before the area of coastal police.</seg>
<seg id="14">Eventually, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south west coast, as well as in Chmphom on the southeast coast, called for several injured.</seg>
<seg id="15">You go from a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it said.</seg>
<seg id="16">The bomb attacks carry the same handwriting, said army general Danai Kritmethavee Friday morning in front of journalists.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We assume that it's a coordinated attack."</seg>
<seg id="18">It's too early to comment on possible motives - probably handle, though, around the deeds of Muslim rebels.</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern in the attacks, which is typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">Thai police, on the other hand, said the assassinations were not related to the Islamist insurgency movement or with international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is only local sabotage restricted to limited areas and provinces, "said a spokesman in Bangkok.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rather, the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta.</seg>
<seg id="23">Authorities have received intelligence indications of imminent attacks in the south of the country in recent days - but they were not informed about the exact date and places.</seg>
<seg id="24">Still, it's unclear which group behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">Police advised their officials across the country to increase security around important government buildings as well as airports, stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and pleasure quarters.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Thailand, there are always smaller bomb attacks, but they are usually not against tourists.</seg>
<seg id="27">In Hua is a palace used for years by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">According to the now bomb explosions, the Austrian State Department recommends its homepage, necessarily affording the instructions of Thai security authorities.</seg>
<seg id="29">High security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla, as well as Preah Vihear and surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="30">After clashes between security forces and Muslim population parts, there will be no necessary travel in these provinces.</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased safety risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday were made a few days after a controversial referendum on one of the constitution prepared by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This admits to the military's great influence in the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">Junta boss and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country moves towards stability, improving economic situation and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The military union, which had taken power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, keeps itself benefiting the kingdom back to stability and order.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, the military has also failed to get to grips with the insurgency of Muslim rebels for years.</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6,500 people have already been killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">Just over a year ago, in Bangkok, in an attack at a popular Hindu shrine, 20 people were killed - most of them foreign tourists.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was the bloodiest attack of the country's younger history.</seg>

<seg id="12">This would be Islamists as well as legal extremists.</seg>

<seg id="19">For constitutional protection, possible contacts of this kind were only relevant from a certain point.</seg>
<seg id="20">It depends on whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - by certain people who are extremist to change their target direction and become so extremist.</seg>
<seg id="21">So determining is whether such people have tax influence on the party.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is not recognisable.</seg>
<seg id="23">With a view of the significant increase in legitimate offences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelters, Maes said he would not speak of new right-wing terrorism in this context.</seg>
<seg id="24">But we have found in recent years that there can be right-wing terrorist structures.</seg>
<seg id="25">There was the group's Old School Society or Friday group.</seg>
<seg id="26">It may well be that other right-wing terrorist groups or small groups plan to plan attacks against asylum seekers, against refugee homes or attacks from other far-right motives.</seg>
<seg id="27">A Germany or Europe-wide control of legal terrorism, though, is not recognisable.</seg>
<seg id="28">Previous groups were created at the regional level or in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="29">Concerns expressed messages about the fact that many assaults went to the account of people who were not previously appearing in the right scene.</seg>
<seg id="30">That's worrying.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum shelters were not previously known as criminals, politically motivated offenders or supporters of the right scene.</seg>
<seg id="32">So many people have committed criminals who had nothing at all with right-wing extremists who may have politically indifferent or elected, for example, CDU, SPD or left, which then radicalised themselves through right-wing extremist mood.</seg>

<seg id="2">Not always determine the Olympics or world records the headlines at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows the courageous appearance of ROBEL Kiros Habte at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia is so slow that he was temporarily no longer seen in the TV images.</seg>
<seg id="5">He simply disappeared - no matter how far the selection was selected.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the social networks, Habte then became the viral internethit.</seg>
<seg id="7">Indeed, the 24-year-old finishes with a lag of 48 seconds his forward and finished 59 place of 59 starters.</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was more of his not exactly sporting figure that moved the attention of international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why the 24-year-old nevertheless participates in the Olympics?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopians got a special starting law by the International Swimming Federation.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming known in under-represented countries.</seg>
<seg id="12">As most athletes run in Ethopia, Habte just wanted to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="13">Preparing is all: ROBEL Kiros Habte makes himself ready for the big race.</seg>
<seg id="14">Quickly, the first nicknames made the round.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some media described him as a Robel of the Wal.</seg>
<seg id="16">In terms of a's welfare belonging, the English tabloid The Sun made with Dad Bod about him funny.</seg>
<seg id="17">His time, he only struck with a minute and nearly five seconds about the 100 meters free, playing no part.</seg>
<seg id="18">Comparisons with Eric Eel were also drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">At the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, the run of Eric Moussambani caused media attention.</seg>
<seg id="20">Memorable was the appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea when he had to take off alone in a lead over 100 metres of free style.</seg>
<seg id="21">Frenetically, Moussambani was fired at the time.</seg>
<seg id="22">The then 22-year-old learned only eight months before Olympic and had never gone for such a long distance before the competition.</seg>

<seg id="2">Consumer research company GfK exchanged its boss Matthias Hartmann.</seg>
<seg id="3">The resignations came suddenly - but not quite surprisingly.</seg>
<seg id="4">The difficult location of market research company GfK suggested that the chair of chief executive Matthias Hartmann will be all the more uncertain, the longer the successes they promised.</seg>
<seg id="5">Turbulence at the top of the Nuremberg market research company GfK: after again disappointing business figures and the resignation of corporate governance, the global number five of the industry is facing a personal new start.</seg>
<seg id="6">GfK board leader wants to leave the company at the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="7">The chairman of GfK's supervisory board Arno Mahlert already divorces with effect September 12 from the supervisory board.</seg>
<seg id="8">The leadership in the board is already taking place on September 1, the previous board member, Gerhard Haus-Ruckinger, told the company.</seg>
<seg id="9">He is to officially take over the function of a board spokesman until a successor was found for Hartmann.</seg>
<seg id="10">As a reason for the resignations, the company called different views on long-term business orientation.</seg>
<seg id="11">Details did not want to name a company spokesman on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="12">Who will be leading the market research company in the future is currently still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="13">In investor circles, on Friday, shareholders were most recently disappointed with the continuing restructuring of the restructuring launched years ago.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr Hartmann has been at the GfK top since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="15">But the fruits of restructuring are not yet to be seen after 5 years, "they said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Given the latest bad GfK business figures, every shareholder will eventually be troubled.</seg>
<seg id="17">If this would be the case with BMW, that would also make the Quands so much, "he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">The company had not been able to halt its loss journey after setbacks in the previous quarters in the second quarter of 2016.</seg>
<seg id="19">With €361.2 million, sales were up 6.1 per cent below the level of the same quarter of the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="20">Referred to the first half, sales shrank by $721.2 million by 3.4 per cent.</seg>

<seg id="1">The charges per cubic meter of wastewaters are starting from October 1, 2016 for the area of the wastelance plant's Neudoff / Reuth / Welschkehl 3.44 run for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp 3.33 euros (previously 2.26 euros) and for Azendorf's 3.64 euros (previously 2.18 euros).</seg>
<seg id="2">At the facility in Azendorf, the sewage charge will increase again at the latest, when appropriate improvement measures are needed.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to an overturned calculation, the water price in Azendorf will then be at 4.37 per cubic feet.</seg>
<seg id="4">As Mayor Bernd Steinheuser (CSU) reported, when approving the budget through the council's Office of Culmbach, it was determined that undercovers were running for these sewers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Casent Village market was committed to running the facilities coverage.</seg>
<seg id="6">From October 1, 2016, citizens, as well as the business and industrial operations from Welsh Kahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to grab deeper into the purse.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fee increases are between 48 and 67 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As administration leader Herbert Schmidt pointed out the panel, a recalculation of charges for the market community's wastewater plants was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over-related undercovers were also offset from the previous calculation period.</seg>
<seg id="10">The serious charge increases resulted in all three sewers plants around relatively small facilities with a very low sewage case, which lies between 6800 and 12,000 cubic metres a year.</seg>
<seg id="11">So because of the low distribution basis, for example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would be serious.</seg>
<seg id="12">Moreover, sewers are easily declining in all three plants.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, in the past calculation period, at all three plants were not last substantial because of its age renovation and repair expenses.</seg>
<seg id="14">The facility in Azendorf was nearly 30 years old, the facilities for Welshelle, Neudorf and Reuth, as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp nearly 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt pointed out that in the wastewater Azendorf, the mechanical ventilation facility had to be exchanged because of a damage.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the Pumpwerk Welchenkahl, the nearly 20-year-old funding facilities had to be overtaken by reason and, after nearly 20 years of operation, had to dig operations of the first plaintiff, the sewage mud will have to be disposed of and installed an extra ventilation possibility to adhere to the water rights guidelines even in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: "these extraordinary expenses came from advanced care and maintenance costs to take into account accordingly in the new calculation period.</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which were still significantly below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made it clear that in the three facilities, the expenses for the operation and entertainment in the three plants were fully running.</seg>
<seg id="20">In doing so, Schmidt, the market community of major entertainment costs in the wastewater facilities over the past 20 years, remained spared.</seg>
<seg id="21">The situation for the named facilities will continue to precariously remain precarious, according to stone homes, particularly since the utilities area of the sewage association Friesenschabach around these facilities could not be expanded because it's about deficit facilities.</seg>

<seg id="1">Snapchat's anime effect criticised as an Asian cartarian</seg>
<seg id="2">Snapchat says this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filter tool, Snapchat allows around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that borders absurdity.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are unsurprisingly, property tools that create more than 30 million improved selfies a day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All missteps enter the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have drawn criticism in the past, in which they were accused of promoting the app blackface or promoting white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When this week suggested a filter that gave them slits, false teeth and unseated cheeks, it called some critics a racist cartoon of Asians - being yellowed.</seg>
<seg id="9">They asked whether these repeated controversy pointed to a bigger problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and outrage were widespread on Wednesday, with reports of The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat told that it had disabled the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was thought to be a tribute to anime characters and not as a cartoon of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced racism recalled the filter to injuries clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others declined the animated comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an email, Grace Sparapani wrote, a Korean-American art student whose tweet over the photos were widespread that the filter was "violating and said to be uncomfortable."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that it's difficult to argue with the opposition of a very disgusting Asian caricature and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellow, but that the yellow face was drawn into the depressing extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural stumbling wires.</seg>
<seg id="18">American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration battle, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all keep in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchat's great audience of young people - who are diverse in terms of breed as their older opponents - could be more likely to expect sensibility.</seg>
<seg id="20">If one of Snapchats filters generates a picture that is insulting for a user, it's much more difficult for such stuff to stay unnoticed when it used to be the case, "said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to extinguish her Snapching account called on others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay for medium and in a phone interview, she said she believes that racial controversy reflects a lack of diversity in recruitment practices at Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticised the large part of white, only male leadership and finished her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">Either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colours in their workforce so they can make such decisions, "said Chinese-American Zhu, or they have people with other skin colours that are working there, but not in positions in which they are safe or comforting to say what to say about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint that left Snapchat mostly unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not release numbers on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his staff, but, according to a spokesman, the company has recently stopped a staff leader who focuses on under-represented population groups and on internal integration efforts.</seg>
<seg id="28">Zhu said, for its part, that she will let her snapchat account be closed and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that's not O.K. is."</seg>

<seg id="1">Military leadership distort ISIS intelligence information, presents committee of Congress</seg>
<seg id="2">Military members of the United States Central Command changed intelligence to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than it allowed actual conditions on the ground, an investigative committee of Congress reported in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The preliminary report, created by a task force of Republican members of the Armed Force Committee, intelligence committees and anti-budget committees, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed its assessments on the U.S. efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, briefly Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Intelligence information that was typically dismissed by senior CENTCOM commanders, regularly drawing a more positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism than the actual conditions on the ground were allowed and were more positive than analysis of other news services, a newspaper article quoted the report.</seg>
<seg id="6">What happened at CENTCOM is unacceptable - our soldiers are suffering when poor analysis is presented by our political leaders, "stated Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives.</seg>
<seg id="7">The leadership error at CENTCOM ranges to the top tip of the organisation.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-side report shows detailed consistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analysis of American efforts in the training of Iraqi armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct indication that government peaks have given under Obama to change the reports, it shows how analysts suffered pressure from their superiors to draw an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic state, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, opinions and statements before Congress were much more positive than it matches the facts, the report noted.</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a CENTCOM member publicly announced that a military recovery could begin Mossuls as early as April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mossul, second-largest city of Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic state.</seg>
<seg id="13">After months of investigation, it is so clear., said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, Central Command's leaders changed the intelligence reports to downplay the danger by ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">Republicans called the task force into life after playing that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will still be completed by more detailed findings while the investigation will continue.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigation is underway by CENTCOM reports by the Defense Ministry's general inspector.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the intelligence committee published on Thursday their own findings, which coincided with some of the Republican Task Force's conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="19">In 2014 and 2015, CENTCOM created an overly limited process for creating intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services, "admitted to the highest-ranking Democrat in the Committee, a member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, in an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="20">This process, according to Mr Schiff, delayed the publication of intelligence reports, damaging morality among analysts and gave overly little room for dissent. "</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr Schiff and Democrats said no evidence of an intervention by the White House at the CENTCOM analysts was found in terms of a particular political opinion.</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the Congress's investigation were published Tuesday by The Daily Beast.</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported investigation by the Pentagon's general inspector, which was included after complaints from CENTCOM analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon press secretary, admitted in an opinion that the Defence Ministry would not comment on Congress's reports while the investigation into the inspectorate was still underway.</seg>
<seg id="25">But he also admitted that's experts sometimes well have divergent opinions about the interpretation of complex data, and that the news services and the Department of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence. "</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigation has repercussions about the issue of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim that is now made by a growing number of members of the Department of Defence).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the accusations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can leave to the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism of secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of information from more than 10 years ago, when a CENTCOM analyst, Gregory Hooker, written a paper on how the then-government under George W. Bush contradicted many analysts only a small crew force in Iraq and little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against current coverage of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team around Mr. Hooker, according to government offices, notes that, contrary to the government's statements, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State had no significant implications for the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these provisional refineries operated to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, this finding was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcom's then commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature because of his excessively positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced at the Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="10">Whatever the game on Saturday, Americans have triggered a surprising swirling through their success stories, four years after they landed at the past London Games on the last of 12 places.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years of a hockey in hands (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), with 16 years she became national player in the US, the youngest in the team's history.</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympics in 2008, as she could not qualify for the cadre.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year in 2012, in which for her and her team, everything went wrong.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, trainer of the national team and things began to turn to better.</seg>
<seg id="16">A culture change, a mental change and a physical change, said Bam.</seg>
<seg id="17">We didn't have the workload in London that we have now.</seg>
<seg id="18">We can have the rudder completely around.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday night, Bam opened the torrent in the first half of the game with a backhand from close range.</seg>
<seg id="20">India had gone into the game without a victory in the tournament, but the team showed surprising and kept the game level from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">They fell a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then dropped into the middle and lups the ball into the gate around the Americans creating a 2-0 lead.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the goalkeeper of the US, Jackie Briggs, who has each had to book a goal in each of the previous games each.</seg>
<seg id="24">She has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">We are in a good position, "said Parnham, but well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amid the rage of the Olympics, the ten of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, it's the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel consistent and inevitable, a rampant staff run between competition and pursuit.</seg>
<seg id="4">It's as if the Olympic torch itself would be a burning staff, which is fed by the breakfast protection to the swimmer to the turner to the triathlete.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the television, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour's conversation in the queue in the coffee shop without listening to Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is still Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is there for the first time at the Olympics and a woman's swarm with greens, could have been well under those known names being sent to Prime Time, built through sponsors and feel-good TV advertising when he would be a swimmer, turner or even fox.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, struggles in the Olympic trampoline around.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event equal.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further away from the centre, partly in the shadows, the sports that are not generally recognised are air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwond.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast swim and may be long.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I likely make modest arguments for my certain darling, let me draw attention to the trampoline's discreet charm.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although trampoline jumping has already been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had his debut in Sydney, it has been so sparsely perceived the last 16 years that many of them, I had interviewed, didn't know it was any Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="14">That could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the US sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping and by 2012 an athlete that made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jumping has a certain outsider low, in part because it sounds more appropriate for the unexplained ear for a close school than the one for the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I'm not an expert but only an earthquake enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartoonage of his never-ending impact - but also the grace of the turn and diving, the two sports that essentially unite.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word trampoline comes from the Spanish el trampoline, which means as much as a springboard.</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging winners jump on a giant trampoline, shooting almost up to 30 feet into the air and must have a range of falling movements (turning, Hechten and Saltos) before landing on the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">They are being assessed, according to official Olympic programme after running, difficulty and flight flight.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two-term athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will join each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists need to go further in their pursuit of gold, faster, up and down, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and back, up and down in the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They don't just chase the finish line or the starting wall, but in television transmission also another goal: the world or the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="28">The targeted pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical - and it's enough to even touch a viewer to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I recognise myself at the viewing of these games as something tiring.</seg>
<seg id="30">This offers the trampoline a breathing space.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline jumper is up.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she collapses, apparently heavily like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up again.</seg>
<seg id="34">Even here there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise, there's no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It's so Zen as the competition at the Olympics can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">Women's qualification and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will broadcast the finals as part of an afternoon block on both days from 2 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="38">Amid the Olympic mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one which is likely to be overlooked in the general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the awareness increase can only be achieved by the angst and the objectification of male athletes - as the male US Turner proposed recently, according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr Dooley expects his struggling, new fancy community.</seg>

<seg id="1">'A generation protest in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the US</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Protesters who call for political changes in Ethiopia encountered violent resistance to the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that time protesters were killed during clashes with police in firing changes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia straight together?</seg>
<seg id="6">Over the past decade, it was one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a fast-growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months, protests against the government have been the country and expanded into increasing numbers of areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week stormed thousands of people on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government's response was ruthless, according to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses said policemen shot and killed on unarmed protesters.</seg>
<seg id="11">Circulating videos about the protests, which are presumably from the last or the beginning of this year, show security personnel beat young people with sticks while these were forced to make a handset against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Authority for Human Rights is now requiring an incoming investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will be even more difficult, "said Rashid Abdi, the project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services are working closely with Ethiopians to fight terrorist riding over the region, especially in Somalia, only a few countries in Africa, if anything, get so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopie's economy expanded at the considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved drastically - there is a new commute train in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was anything but an example of democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, with dissidents effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent to exile or prison, killed or driven into the expansions of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">If you suppress people and these do not have any other options except to protest, it breaks out, said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="23">All of the youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints covering everything from ground use to stranglehold in terms of power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a widely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the opposition's last seat and now control 100 per cent of parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions rise along the border with Eritrea; a fight around this trapping, controversial line claimed hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts worry that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogadine's National Liberation Front, which has been more or less forced in recent years, exploit turbulence and could arm again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness were now exploding after years of getting in front of the surface under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">It is only in recent years that very many Ethiopians have been able to communicate through social media as cheaper smartphones have been increasingly frequent and improved internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, which they do regularly, particularly in protests, many people can still communicate over internet proxies that hide where they stop.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians said they gathered to protest.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two biggest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since eons, the Amharas, who are mostly Christian highlights, have been prospering in politics and the economy while exploiting the oromos, many of which are Muslims and living in flat areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But that's also changing straight.</seg>
<seg id="38">We are in the process of coordinating under a screen, "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which accounts for about 6 per cent of the population and are dominant in the military, in the intelligence agencies, in trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr Meles, a former rebel leader, was until his death at a non-publicised disease in 2012 for 17 years of Ethiopia's prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think of corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say he was particularly savvy in it to perceive early signs of dissatisfaction and use special envoy to edit opponents and make them unharmed.</seg>
<seg id="45">"The current regime is missing from this fundamental skill," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst.</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopie's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegs, was selected for relatively obscuring reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say he is not enjoying the confidence of the Tigray controlled security services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time Ethiopia experienced such turmoil was in 2005, after thousands protested against elections, which, according to data from analysts, apparently botched and subsequently stolen from the government.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following raids, many protesters have been killed, even if it was less than in recent months and this time of unrest went over relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuting plant, as well as for their measurable progress in combating poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the Ethiopian government's internal miscarriage.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, protesters in Gondar, an amharic city, of Tigray's business and the hatred towards the Tigray will be increasingly common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a strange position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, even though they recently told them that it closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile area.</seg>
<seg id="59">This, said Mr Abdi, is a very thin gratitude.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his allegation Obama had founded ISIS was sarcasm.</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to disperse the latest controversy on Friday that surrounded his campaign by saying his multiple repeated assertion that President Obama and Hillary Clinton would not be serious about the founders of the terrorist group of Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification accused new questions about the Republican's communications skills, whether he was able to communicate clearly and understandably with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings to his fellow campaigners who are seeking to take him into protection during an eventful phase into the peculiar position of explaining statements that he couldn't mean at all.</seg>
<seg id="5">After making the hint at a campaign event on Wednesday night, Mr. Trump returned in relation to the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really didn't intend to indicate the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was the opposite of the previous day, where Mr Trump said in a series of interviews he meant the accusation was perfectly serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative radio presenter Hugh Hewitt wanted Mr. Trump to help weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate wanted nothing to know.</seg>
<seg id="9">The latest storm of the criticism praises Mr Trump, while attempting to steer the focus of his campaign because of falling polls on the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr Trump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return back to this issue.</seg>
<seg id="12">Speaking about Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr Trump has already presented Sarkasmus to his defence.</seg>
<seg id="14">In late July, he pulled strong criticism when he said the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but explained he later said, of course, I said that sarcastically. "</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the language boundaries in politics and then return back to need.</seg>
<seg id="16">I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive, and then, if appropriate, clarifying depending on how the reaction is out, "said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who observes the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Rather than defying the tone for presidential elections, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more corroborative tone as his poll ratings have continued to decline.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a lead with a great advantage in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr Trump generally attempts not to apologise for his provocative remarks, he frequently accused his critics of distorting his statements or wrongly understanding his humor.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he is increasingly in the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's joke brought his loyal compassion into the uncomfortable situation, regardless of how provocatively his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph P. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent advocates, gave great trouble to defend the candidate in a CNN interview Thursday today.</seg>
<seg id="23">I think what he says is legitimate, political comments, Mr Giuliani said, so he was interviewed to the accuracy of Mr. Trump's statements whether Mr Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that before Obama, ISIS, was an almost unknown, small organisation, he called them backbenchers, completely wrong and therefore happened because he dropped the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread by subjecting it to aggressively control the situation in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and threw them off on each of his words and being biased against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">He derided the "poor, poor television experts who try to understand him and said," you can't!. "</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the Democrats scored about Mr Trump's apology as just another evidence that he was inappropriate for the president.</seg>

<seg id="1">Once out about the price from the market, café comes back in Greenpoint</seg>
<seg id="2">Verb Cafe was a shabby cafe in Williamsburg, in which only to pay cash, which had no Wi-Fi, but for 15 years serving good coffee.</seg>
<seg id="3">Of course, it was pushed by prices from his Bedford Avenue shop front.</seg>
<seg id="4">The business Soap Cherie, which replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of Cupcakes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Locals mastered it as the last loss in a gentrificizing city.</seg>
<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabpapable wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change, but I can still not believe that CBGB dead, the Chelsea Hotel excluded and Verb is now a soap business."</seg>
<seg id="7">But if New York is changed, it is also reinvention.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good even.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime staff member of the old cafe, the owner and managing director of the new cafe.</seg>
<seg id="12">He began working at Verb in 2001 and remained there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When he offered a customer to provide funds for a new outfield, he was excited to do it, he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rodriguez, 36, reserved a lot.</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb uses the same distributor for the Bagels bought the same espresso machine model.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="18">He led new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the menu stand sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnishes like capers and saunted onions.</seg>
<seg id="20">There's natural bowls.</seg>
<seg id="21">The cafe serves no more beer, for that there's fresh juices.</seg>
<seg id="22">After nine months, Rodriguez said he noticed a steady electricity of old regular customers.</seg>
<seg id="23">Many old customers were also displaced by prices from Williamsburg, he said.</seg>
<seg id="24">Recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.</seg>
<seg id="25">Oliveira, 34, earlier in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after being drawn to Greenpoint, she would take the way.</seg>
<seg id="27">After the verb had closed, she gave a while the coffee drink, she said.</seg>
<seg id="28">I was clear that it was in coffee and at the culture in the verb that I liked, "she said.</seg>
<seg id="29">Now she's drinking again coffee, even if she ordered a bleed chai Chai this day instead of her usual ICED coffees, which is another new addition.</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Rosenthal has been another longtime and loyal customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="31">He went there before work and inevitably always ordered the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="32">I came quarter after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket clock and they prepare my Everything-Bagel with butter, "he said.</seg>
<seg id="33">Photograph Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and include new ingredients in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nowadays, Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his everything bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.</seg>
<seg id="35">Rodriguez said he had no resentment over that the soap business has taken the old business room.</seg>
<seg id="36">Indeed, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to produce a special soap for verb with the casual coffee of the cafe as ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="37">I think we will still go on her offer, "said Rodriguez.</seg>
<seg id="38">And traditional, Polish residents Greenpoints have also accepted the cafe.</seg>
<seg id="39">A new customer translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said he intends to issue them soon, so his new neighbours feel welcome.</seg>
<seg id="40">The location also has other merits.</seg>
<seg id="41">A local juggernaut wants to fill and sell the cold coffee into the bottle.</seg>
<seg id="42">There is a chance the cafe expands on a neighboring building.</seg>
<seg id="43">For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favourites.</seg>
<seg id="44">Joseph Witt was regular customer and said he was destroyed to the ground when the cafe closed.</seg>
<seg id="45">When the new cafe opened, Whitt said that entering the local and ordering a new coffee feel like a home return.</seg>
<seg id="46">I had to smell that, "he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">The depressing meal of the economic crisis in a rich meal</seg>
<seg id="2">In March 1933, shortly after his rise to the president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch in the Oval Office.</seg>
<seg id="3">As a gourmet, President Roosevelt had a fait for sophisticated delicacies of Fifth Avenue like Pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup.</seg>
<seg id="4">His menu this day was a little more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potato piracy and as a dessert a plum pudding.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people, "said Jane Ziegelman.</seg>
<seg id="6">Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat."</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">Coes's latest book Chop Suey acted from Chinese cuisine in the US, while brick man in her book's 97 orchard has been told about life in a housing at the Lower East Side from the food perspective.</seg>
<seg id="9">Her latest collaboration, a decent meal, will appear on Tuesday in the Harper publisher, illustrating the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="10">They showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a reporter in the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small, unnecessary snack at the Flatiron District, which has already been in business since the stock crash in 1929.</seg>
<seg id="11">Brick man, 54, ordered a freshest cherry with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, turkey with potato purges and vegetable mixture.</seg>
<seg id="12">When the reporter ordered reporters, this found this fitted the couple for a discussion of the food in the era of the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Rich groceries were very popular," said Ziegel.</seg>
<seg id="14">There was peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and slightly cheaper that stretches the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinners.</seg>
<seg id="17">CoE grinsten.</seg>
<seg id="18">It must have laid in the stomach like lead, "he said.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American budget, especially in rural areas, an all-y-can-eat buffet.</seg>
<seg id="20">Teams of women cook for male field workers and it was served freshly baked paste for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</seg>
<seg id="21">It was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War, a Square Meal distinguishes the pathways with which the country declined to be no longer the slate land.</seg>
<seg id="22">It was a time when food for the Americans was a central, tense theme, "endorsed Coe, why he and his wife wanted to write about it.</seg>
<seg id="23">Just as tense was the new budget diet: mysterious foods such as bread and casseroles have become basic foods, casserole rolling as a "wonderful way of recovering food rests," noticed brick since cooks could hide unappetitive ingredients under a creamy sauce.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meat, which was years at the heart of the American cuisine, became a rarely served luxury.</seg>
<seg id="26">Strange mixtures have been tried, as a calorie and nutritious satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy kitchen sense.</seg>
<seg id="27">During her research for the book, which includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a court from this era, baked onions with peak butter.</seg>
<seg id="28">It wasn't a popular addition at lunchtime, "says Coe.</seg>
<seg id="29">Brick man continues: it was surreal.</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions don't fit each other.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the home economic recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">As never before or since, budget economists - including Louise Stanley, director of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 to 1943 - drove the country's eating habits of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="33">By releasing prescriptions and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become budget policymakers and to meet the challenge of turning pamper like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.</seg>
<seg id="34">A Square Meal is a festival of historic delicacies.</seg>
<seg id="35">In particular, the reports of the government's response to the hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's lass-mich-cake food stance.</seg>
<seg id="36">While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farm kitchen of his kitchen, he dined like the millionaire man of world to which he has become.</seg>
<seg id="37">He moved continental kitchen like fish with cucumber sauce, "Coe said.</seg>
<seg id="38">He in a nearly gilted dining room and wearing a smoking.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was wonderfully realistic.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt might have committed the same mistake if not his wife, Eleanor, called him to state an example with his stomach.</seg>
<seg id="41">As described in the book, the hinters of a housekeeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs Roosevelt carried out that the White House produced the most boring meal in Washington but also one of the most prepared.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenlandai: the oldest vertebrae is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland sharks are mostly just in winter to surface.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark has returned to the sea following an investigation on board the research ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swimmed with good a 1km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland's shark will only get up to 150 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">Indeed, the Greenlandhai swim at the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour he comes on average just 1,220 feet.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just when it comes down, the five metre long animals are accelerating to satellite 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a robber.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, this long-standing lifestyle seems to be a patent recipe for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal Science, in any case, of a Greenlandhai, which could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Madness," comments Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock this life span, which means a world record for vertebrae.</seg>
<seg id="12">While the evolution biologist has long been suspected, Greenland sharks will become stone.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland's sharks are hard to watch, after all, they live especially in the ice cream in front of the thinly populated coastlines of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they mostly dive on the surface only in the winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers accordingly know about the lifestyle of Greenlandhais.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her timeless pace measures them when they equipped six animals with a broadcaster before Spitsbergen.</seg>
<seg id="18">Prey these sharks are still making: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a robbe, another had swallowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they are chasing sleeping animals or patrolling at the bottom of the ice seas and search caravers who torture from higher water layers.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues are now investigating 28 Greenland sharks that fishermen picked up fishermen between 2010 and 2013 ahead of Greenland or Spitzbergen as bycatches from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 inches long, while the largest 502 inches.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the sharks with the carbon 14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens arises before the birth of the sharks, which included proteins will no longer be renewed later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had strikingly had a lot of carbon 14 in the lentils.</seg>
<seg id="25">Her birth should therefore be following the early 1960s, when nuclear attempts made larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the country with 220 centimetres of third-seeded animals, the lentils contained a small surplus of carbon 14 from nuclear tests, therefore likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday during its investigation in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All the larger Greenland hair, by contrast, had normal carbon 14-foot quantities that emerge through cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">Indeed, the carbon clock for a 493 centimetre long Greenhandhandi showed an age of 335, while the record has been likely to be 392 years old with 502 centimetres.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenlandhai females were only getting offspring when they are longer than four feet, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now, the researchers were able to assign length an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres was probably on the threshold of gender tire and his age was determined with 156 years, Greenland sharks with the propagation obviously leave at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even this is likely to be world record for vertebrates at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such Methusaleme lives especially in icy waters isn't a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">Even the previous record holder, a 211 year old Greenwall whose bacon on the neck put a 120-year-old harpoint top, was caught before Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Through low temperatures, frequently, the organism of the animals living there also runs on savings flames.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and ageing slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">To keep warm in the cold water, the animals are also often particularly great.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume is growing much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much bigger than at a gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: they have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">So a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should be focused on having as many offspring as possible as early as possible, "explains the evolutionary biologist.</seg>
<seg id="42">By contrast, a very large animal should invest its resources into a long life.</seg>

<seg id="1">Frankfurt benefits from Brexit</seg>
<seg id="2">The city at Main therefore in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg has the best chances of attracting from London's relocated jobs and firms.</seg>
<seg id="3">It's very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit vote, says Michael Voigtlander, head of the IW's financial markets and property markets.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether funds may continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU.</seg>
<seg id="5">For the so-called EU passport, they have so far been enough to admit in Britain.</seg>
<seg id="6">These are just using large U.S. banks.</seg>
<seg id="7">Several banks have already announced to shift jobs.</seg>
<seg id="8">The lobbying agreement, Frankfurt Main Finance, expects 10000 new jobs on the Main within five years.</seg>
<seg id="9">For Frankfurt, according to the IW, speaking to the headquarters of the European Central Bank (ECB), combines responsibility for monetary policy and oversight of the eurozone's largest banks, as well as other major authorities such as European insurance supervision EIOPA and the ESRB risk.</seg>
<seg id="10">In Paris, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has its headquarters, but this one is less significant than the ECB for the financial sector.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Closeness to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision," says IP Professor Voigtlander.</seg>
<seg id="12">Luxembourg, while a large fund industry, cut as well as Dublin in infrastructure worse.</seg>
<seg id="13">Frankfurt was much easier to achieve thanks to the big airport.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also scored the city with easily available commercial properties.</seg>
<seg id="15">In Paris, it's not so easy to find free high-quality offices, "says Voigtlander.</seg>
<seg id="16">Additionally, the rents for first-class commercial properties are 50 per cent higher than at Main.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime.</seg>
<seg id="18">In a ranking of consulting Mercer, the city stands at seven, Luxembourg on No 19, Dublin to No 33 and Paris in 37th place.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even though quality of life is a matter of preference: "with its already strong position as a financial location for the European single market, Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors," conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="20">However, despite Brexit vote, London will remain in Europe, my business researchers.</seg>
<seg id="21">The power conditions are also talking about: in London, according to figures from Landesbank Helaba in late 2015, about 144,000 people in the banking industry, in Frankfurt, were 62500.</seg>

<seg id="2">Hillary Clinton published her tax return for 2015 on Friday, which resulted for the Democrats' presidential candidate and her husband's income of $10.75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.</seg>
<seg id="3">In 2015, the Clinton donated $1 million for charitable purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton generated almost $5.3 million in redemption rates; the former foreign minister gave an income of $3 million from the publisher Simon's Schuster for her book about her book at the foreign ministry.</seg>
<seg id="4">Clinton's candidate for the vice presidency, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, along with his wife, Anne Holton, posted his tax returns of the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="5">They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="6">Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to put standards on financial transparency, "admitted Clinton's campaign held Jennifer Palmieri in an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a stark contrast to this, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and retreating in relation to his previous promises to release his tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is common for US presidential candidates to release their tax returns, although they are not committed by law.</seg>
<seg id="9">Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have indicated a tax review by the tax authorities as a reason for his denial.</seg>
<seg id="10">They are on train, writing Clinton's campaign helicopter Ian Sams on Twitter, in terms of the publication of the Democrats' presidential candidate.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's special adviser, said to CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish something before the tax exams are not complete.</seg>
<seg id="12">Trump's critics, including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, have already announced that his refusal raises questions regarding assets, his donations for charitable organisations, its business and various other connections, particularly with Russia.</seg>
<seg id="13">Clinton has already toppled on the subject and posted a video on the Internet on Friday, in which high-ranking Republicans Trump urged his tax returns to publish.</seg>
<seg id="14">On Thursday, she also spoke to the issue during a speech on the economy in Michigan.</seg>
<seg id="15">He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and publish his tax returns. "She said to the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="16">Politico has reported that Trump has paid no or very little tax during the 1990s, and an economic journalist at the New York Times quoted a series of tax advisers and tax advisers on Friday, who said that could still be the case.</seg>
<seg id="17">Federal taxes have become an issue in the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="18">Clinton supports a regulation named after the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that people would pay the more than $1 million earning a tax rate of at least 30 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="19">President Obama also supports the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="20">During a campaign event for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate here has his seat here has Trump to exchange a meeting on their tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="21">Buffett said he was also undergoing a tax review of the IRS and Trump has "feared before voters and not before the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="22">Clinton's campaign has released tax returns by 2007.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Clintons, which now live in Chappaque, New York, paid on average an effective federal rate of about 32% between the years 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.</seg>
<seg id="24">The tax declaration by the Clintons of 2015 showed that this only USD 100 of its income was referred to as a wage, unlike most of all Americans.</seg>

<seg id="7">In particular, Russian imports in Iran increased by 91.5 per cent and amounted to $697 million.</seg>
<seg id="8">Russian imports from Iran rose 16 per cent to $158 million.</seg>
<seg id="9">The trade recovery has been reached by deliveries of machinery, land vehicles and guns, "the ambassador said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Scotted Callum Skinner stormed home when Britons scored gold for cycling</seg>
<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner rasted last night in the men's team sprint in the Velodrom in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role that had his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had embraced the boy... the boy made the legend proudly when he stormed home to introduce a victory from the favorites of New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while the fifth of six Olympic medals picked up.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after picking up only a modest sixth place in March at the rail championships in London despite the resignation of Hoys.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did so in time for a hind.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retirement generated a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man where they stayed when they saw potential in the Scot, which has now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - who win with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner put an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealander won in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hindes were just back after his round, but Kenny brought the team to the front and skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A strategy change made much of the transformation, where Hindes drove in a higher gear to slow it and allow Kenny and especially skinners to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked at his position as BBC expert and dropped skinner, Kenny and Hindes when these rose to the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">The 23-year-old skinner from Glasgow said: "it's a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make me a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up an Olympic record in the final and defeated the world champions.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just incredible.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the 2012 triumph on the side of Kennys and Hoys, Hindes admitted that after a weak start, he was intentionally on the track.</seg>
<seg id="21">He later pulled this statement back and there was no appeal from England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">In such an outstanding victory, this time there was no such problem.</seg>
<seg id="23">Hindes said: it feels like the whole GB flags in the stands like London. "</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have come so badly at so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which won seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If that's a barometer of our progress in the last five months that expects successful five days at the Velodrom.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form Kennys is in the area of the possibility that he reiterates Hoy's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (an apparently holy date for British sport; on the day there were also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the one of Hoy equals.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny is taking part next in the sprint, who will begin today and go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">The 28-year-old from Bolton said: 'I only enjoy this for the moment.</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels something lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">Hindes said: when he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to Knight. "</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal contest of the day but there was further good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometre race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at 3: 51,942 at the target.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, which won gold in 2012, was 3: 51.659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) takes place today on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will certainly be in focus.</seg>
<seg id="42">He had argued with representatives before the qualification yesterday when him calling for officials to measure his body size.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the relevant women's contest, which continues and finished tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibal of Milngavie in World record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team leaves its strong rail team to dominate the mid-period of the Olympic Games and pick up a char of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly exceptional portrayal of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio were downplayed.</seg>
<seg id="46">It played dramas in the background, according to the resignation of the technical leader Shane Sutton in April amid sexism and bullying allegations as well as retiring sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks quite afterwards than the now legendary reputation of GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment.</seg>

<seg id="1">Future of Portland's meltdown because of lifting the energy contract is questionable</seg>
<seg id="2">The future of Portland's aluminium melting of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs from workers - are at stake as the plant operator terminates the energy supply contract and thus lift all supply contracts, as the delivery energy company reported.</seg>
<seg id="3">This move followed the government's decision in Victoria earlier this year to give no further subsidies to the operation of the facility.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy set for 20 years is running in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2,000 jobs at the facility of Alcoa in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">No fewer than 2,000 jobs directly, as well as indirect - could be endangered in closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to domino effects as the melting about 10 per cent of Victoria's entire power generation.</seg>
<seg id="8">2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry meltdown, leading to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">Alcoa's meltdown in Portland loses money and risks closing.</seg>
<seg id="10">This move follows years of speculation about the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently because of the power price for the facility.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which delivers the large aluminium melting with its Loy Yang A power station in Latrobe Valley, announced that it assumes that three other owners will terminate their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The facility is in the majority ownership of a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which Chinese companies CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.</seg>
<seg id="13">AGL assumes the facility will continue to operate in Portland, which includes another physical demand for electricity through the meltdown, "the company said.</seg>
<seg id="14">AGL continues to say that the contracts were so-called security businesses, which should have entered into force from November 2016.</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12-month termination period so they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">Of course, AGC assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenues in fiscal year, "the power supplier said.</seg>
<seg id="17">Any potential implications for revenue on AGL from the DJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong futures markets for wholesale currency prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL announced that it had already written the value of the contracts in its annual accounts of $187 million in an expectation of a termination.</seg>
<seg id="19">Alcoa said the decision to book the contracts will not affect the capacity of Alcoas... or guaranteeing power supplies to melting. "</seg>
<seg id="20">The US company said it had completed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which should have entered into force from November this year, even if it's still guilty of a statement why it resigned from the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn of the industry's poor economic conditions ahead of the possible closure of Portland meltdown in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">In reference to the statements of the analysts earlier this week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumed around 600 megawatts and Tomago annually around 900 megawatts to electricity.</seg>
<seg id="23">Should both facilities disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the power market.</seg>
<seg id="24">And for us as an electricity producer, that wouldn't be good, "he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of September edition of Vogue</seg>
<seg id="2">Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran on Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">In a room full of people I love brought me the sight of this cover to wine, "wrote Kendall.</seg>
<seg id="5">The revelation of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians similar?), crippled reality video showing the entire Kardashian Jenner family (with the exception of the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn as well as producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as they forget the cover of her sister and ending with a classic twist: they have all planned a surprise party.</seg>
<seg id="6">This represents the cliché act nearly every birthday episode of a children's broadcast (Seacrest brought the sentence, "" you thought that we had forgotten you?, with the honesty of a characteristic check on a broadcast at 8am in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls somehow participate in this publicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September edition of Vogue, a new era of Kardashians began with security.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendall's big sister Kim may have beaten them off the vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for himself.</seg>
<seg id="9">September issue is the most selled edition of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">With an extent resembling a picture band than a fashion magazine, the issue draws a large number of advertisers (according to Fashionta, from the 832 sides of the wood's 615 pages of advertising).</seg>
<seg id="11">The revelation of his cover star is seen expected to leak pictures of the magazine before the official announcement over the last two years.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">In recent years, clearly more celebrities have been modelling as a model, the celebrities are on the cover.</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar winner and Dior-brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, after Lady Gaga had the honour.</seg>
<seg id="15">But even at the low chance that Mrs Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the breakthrough model of her generation - falls under the previous category, she is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers of today who know how to turn a good Snapchap video (even if it all true on Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who distinguished themselves in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had with the publication of lemanoma one of the most successful years of her career.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course, Jenner's success doesn't like everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With her reality TV story, Jenner's position was always tense in the fashion world.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June, the former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague, Gigi Hadid, criticised them and called her "the pieces of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">Those feelings cook again as the news with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But on the mismatch appears to be past the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">She's literally a supermodel.</seg>
<seg id="26">She runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">It makes advertising for your grounding of Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">She and all their sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective Paywall apps.</seg>
<seg id="29">It's sold of her made pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine LOVE.</seg>
<seg id="30">And in her leisure she is in reality TV, presumably just to see her sister Kourtney and their children.</seg>

<seg id="2">More than 160,000 of the country's most aid needs are dismissed annually by the community centres, while the industry has taken on the impact of further central cuts to already congested transactions.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Queensland, there are already three out of five people - mostly older people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who have no funds for unjust delogues and the like - dismissed in their requests for free legal advice and legal advice.</seg>
<seg id="4">Legal services to the community, which are already overlying, are making available for further cuts.</seg>
<seg id="5">From June of next year, it is scheduled that these legislative centres will lose another 30 per cent of its federal resources.</seg>
<seg id="6">The director of community law centres of Queensland James Farrell said the latest survey of the National Association of Community Rights Centers showed that thousands of people are already dismissed each year.</seg>
<seg id="7">Farrell said the situation would only get worse without a lifting of the federal government's decision.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Queensland's community centers are chronically underfunded, meaning that thousands of people are dismissed by important services you need," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">People who leave violent relationships, people with insensitive and crippling debt, families who go through separations, workers who were unfairly dismissed - all these people have legal and this survey shows they cannot receive the help they need.</seg>
<seg id="10">The federal government will cut the funds by 30 per cent from June 2017, meaning that thousands of needy people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help.</seg>
<seg id="11">We call on the General Attorney General and Federal Justice Affairs Minister, as well as senators of Queensland George Brandis to lift these central cuts immediately, so people can get the help they need in legal problems.</seg>
<seg id="12">Last year, the national government fulfilled its pledge to raise funds for legal assistance on the national average.</seg>

<seg id="2">Email and Internet in timeline: 20 years ago, the Nokia Communicator on the market.</seg>
<seg id="3">The sequels dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was thicker and bigger, therefore it wasn't good in hand either.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was pretty knocking.</seg>
<seg id="7">The built-in memory was initially eight Megabyte, which would be ranging for roughly two selfies with high resolution today.</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone is now being delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Nokia 9000 Communicator came exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, into the business - and it was the first smartphone.</seg>
<seg id="10">For a few euros, lovers can still buy the devices on the internet, but they somehow come from the internet age's stone.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, 20 years ago, the Communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at Cebit's Cebit in Hanover as an office in western pocket format.</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the new mobile phone could be sent a lot: SMS and emails could be sent and received, including by Fax, the Communicator.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even access to websites was possible by HTML browsers, although agonisingly slowly.</seg>
<seg id="15">A pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna, and the phone could be folded similar to a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">Pretty proud was the price: 2700 D-Mark, that is, about 1400 euros.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average sales price of a smartphone in Germany was at 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">No one could see in August 1996 that the communicator would become the start of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since then, it has been different.</seg>
<seg id="22">The smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Finns' mobile phone savings experienced an unprecedented disaster, was finally sold to Microsoft and wound up.</seg>
<seg id="24">The market dominates providers today, which came all much later than Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="25">Always and everywhere online, that's today for very many people everyday.</seg>
<seg id="26">In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="27">Sold about 1.4 billion devices, on Samsung and Apple, were accounted for by its own 555 million pieces.</seg>
<seg id="28">Global turnover with the devices is about 400 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="29">These include the well-running business of the countless app provider and the telecommunications company.</seg>
<seg id="30">Around the smartphone has since created an entire industry.</seg>
<seg id="31">The crucial breakthrough to the mass market came only in early 2007, then announced Apple chief executive Steve Jobs on Mac-World the introduction of the iPhone.</seg>
<seg id="32">He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an internet communicator, easy to use by touch-screen.</seg>
<seg id="33">Apple's victory start, still today, the iPhone is the group's most important product.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, which dominated the market, had looked after.</seg>
<seg id="35">They eventually disappeared, Blackberry has been fighting.</seg>
<seg id="36">The individuals now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung.</seg>
<seg id="37">The smartphone is self-evident 20 years after inventing.</seg>

<seg id="2">Heathrow will not only bring renewal and prosperity in our local communities and across London, but all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="3">For me, this represented the biggest attraction of Heathrows, just as it was then in 2012 in London when we run a large effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympics brought big benefits for Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And that's going to get back by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">For our local communities, we will already have 10,000 new apprenticeships, create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.</seg>
<seg id="7">Just as they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who will think the challenge of expanding Heathrows is too great.</seg>
<seg id="8">I was told that England will never be ready for the Games and that we will be blamed on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are always obstacles to overcoming, but Heathrow answers every question he asked.</seg>
<seg id="11">Like the Olympics, Heathrow is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project.</seg>
<seg id="12">Enlargement is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211bn of wildlife growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across GB.</seg>
<seg id="13">We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11bn infrastructure investment programme in time and budget, which was elected five years in a row to the world's best airport terminal, to the T2, which was built amid the world's two most frequented catwalks.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now they are ready to deliver a third catwalk, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment.</seg>
<seg id="15">The 2012 London Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that Heathrow's expansion will also be one.</seg>
<seg id="16">It's time we draw this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment on which England can be proud.</seg>

<seg id="1">Adblock Plus, Facebook in the cat and mouse game regarding advertising block</seg>
<seg id="2">For companies earning money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to circumvent advertising blocking, a cat and mouse play equals.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block display blocking on its desktop site, Adblock Plus published a blog place in which it told users could update their filters in the program to block again advertising in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the coding regarding its advertisers to discover it displaying the detection of which part of the side is advertising.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to deal with the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">In a blog post, the spokesman for Adblock Ben Williams wrote that's written this kind of battle between the displaying Open Source Community and the circumstances have already been underway since the invention of advertising blockers is underway, and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fact that the world's largest business for social media has left in the fight is a strong indication of how worrying display blockers have become for the industry.</seg>
<seg id="8">Worldwide, according to a study last year of Pagefair and Adobe, use about 200 million people display blockers; nearly four times as much in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="9">With 1.03 billion daily active users who access Facebook over their mobile terminals, mobile advertising makes 84 per cent of advertising revenues Facebooks.</seg>
<seg id="10">The company has on display blockers on desktop PCs, as mobile advertisers have no effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a spokesman told me.</seg>
<seg id="11">Advertising on desktop PCs makes an enough large proportion of revenues so Facebook appears to be the investment of such a move as worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="12">On Tuesday, Facebook told that it would update its ad preferential tool to have more control over people on them on targeted advertising.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters would be worrying because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising.</seg>
<seg id="14">For the users, this is not a positive experience, so we plan to address the problem, "a spokesman told Facebook in an email communication.</seg>
<seg id="15">Advertisers are a blunt resource, which is why we instead focused on development tools such as Ad Preferences to put more control in people's hands.</seg>

<seg id="1">Woman in presumable suicide on Switzerland's highway</seg>
<seg id="2">The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.</seg>
<seg id="3">Police witnesses witnesses after a woman was overtaken in the early hours of Thursday at a presumable suicide of several vehicles on an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incident occurred at the A1 near Morges in the Canton Vaud shortly after midnight.</seg>
<seg id="5">A woman put himself in the dark in an act of desperation on the streets and were hit by several cars, police said in Vaud.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's obvious that a Swiss age of 49, who was overtaken by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill himself.</seg>
<seg id="7">She died on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="8">Several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, police said, calling on them as well as any witnesses of the incident to report.</seg>
<seg id="9">An investigation was opened, which is a logical step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="11">Was a collision preventive?</seg>
<seg id="12">That's something the prosecutor must decide, "said Hofstetter.</seg>
<seg id="13">Two similar cases over the last five years show that drivers will not be held to responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="14">In each of the two cases - where one person ran in the dark on the highway - was decided that motorists will not have to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the highway as it did in the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="15">Last year a policeman of negligence killing was acquitted after she had overrun and killed a man who was laid on the A1 near Payerne in August 2014.</seg>
<seg id="16">The 22-year-old victim had drink and has become unconscious on the street, the court heard.</seg>
<seg id="17">The court found that the policeman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- went to a justified manner and that a man's presence on the street was a "completely extraordinary and unpredictable situation, the judge said.</seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone who has further information on the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to police under the number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44.</seg>

<seg id="2">Venus was probably once inhabited by a new NASA climate model, according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms resembling those of climate researchers.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have once eating conditions with their hot, waterless surface and carbon atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow revolution of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earthy atmosphere and still turned slowly.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also lit the topography of early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably dismissed more dry areas than de earth, but had once enough water and geographic variability to host lives and protected fast evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">Early Venus also benefited from a sun, which was 30 per cent matter.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the GISS model simulation, the slow revolution of Venus exposes their daily side of the sun almost two months, "said Giss scientist Anthony Del Genio in a news release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, which looks like a umbrella to shield the surface from much of the sun warmth.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought a story of Venus that resembles the evolution, which was previously suspected by planetary researchers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although she was once presumably habitable, the Venus -- in the course of several billion years - exposed too much heat and ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water steam was burned away from the ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">When their hydrogen emerged, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained back with a deadly greenhouse -- the Venus, which as we know them today.</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers shared the results of their new Venus Climate Models in the Geophysical Research Letters.</seg>

<seg id="2">Labour fights regarding pay for North Sea oil workers are being suspended, while all parties are putting on the table for a new round of conversations, negotiators said.</seg>
<seg id="3">Strikes against oil service provider Wood Group have been carried out sporadically on platforms in the North Sea, which will be operated by Royal Dutch Shell.</seg>
<seg id="4">Wood Group, as well as the Unite and RMT unions, can confirm that we have agreed to reshape the delivery process of the current dispute, "it said in a common statement.</seg>
<seg id="5">We will be holding some full-day sessions in the next few weeks that will start early next year to reassess the problems.</seg>
<seg id="6">Unions said their latest strike, which is the first over 25 years, was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="7">Wood Group has cut this year's rates to its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 per cent because of negative market pressure.</seg>
<seg id="8">The company's council cut follows a 10-percent decline for onshore contractors in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="9">The company said that additional cuts to the company are giving the needed room to come through the downturn.</seg>
<seg id="10">Shell has sacked for his part of thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas businesses into up to 10 countries as it rationalises its business activities as a result of its merger with British energy company BG Group.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission with the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers gather the most complete catalogue at rotation rates among the stars of the star of the pleadays.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data helps astronomers understand why stars in star clutches roar at different rates as well as in what connection the rotation periods are with the planetary creation.</seg>
<seg id="4">We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we learn more about the relationship between the crowd of a star, his age and even the story of his solar system, "said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The star of the pleadances is 445 light-years from Earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this star cluster, which emerged about 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now turning themselves at the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">To top rotation rates, these maturing stars encounter large amounts of stern winds.</seg>
<seg id="9">As these winds travel through the stars' magnetic fields, they have a braking effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">When a star alters, its rotation rate begins to slow.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotation rate of every star by recognising the time between the appearance of a recognisable star blow -- like solar stains.</seg>
<seg id="12">The latest catalogue of rotation rates points out that massive stars spin slower than less massive stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rebell compares the stars with dancers, with larger stars turning pirouettes than smaller.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the ballet of the pleading, we see slow rotors tending to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars, "said Rebell.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the star clusters of the Plejaden are so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic lab to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The star cluster of the pleines offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stellar rotation in both directions, younger and elderly," said Rebull.</seg>
<seg id="17">There is still much in front of us about what we would like to know more about how the How, Wann and Why Stars slow down their rotation rates and so to speak their 'dance shoes.</seg>
<seg id="18">Rebell and her colleagues have reported in three newspaper reports at length about their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the pleadances, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.</seg>

<seg id="2">The tears ran at Alex Rodriguez faster than the US baseball star in best days of base to base.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to his emotional resignation announcement, the 41-year-old pro on 12 August against the Tampa Bay Rays will be wearing the jersey of his New York Yankees.</seg>
<seg id="4">I love this game and this team. "</seg>
<seg id="5">I say goodbye to both, "the 14-time All-Star Game participants explained to the Major League Baseball (MLB).</seg>
<seg id="6">Three times, Rodriguez was elected the most valuable player in the league, in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees.</seg>
<seg id="7">His signature under a 10-year contract has provided him $27 million a year since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="8">By the end of the contract on December 31, 2017, he acts in future as a consultant and youth coach - in full salary.</seg>
<seg id="9">As a player, Rodriguez long paid back performance.</seg>
<seg id="10">With 696 Homeruns, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams (Runs) for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and since 2005 the Yankees created some milestones.</seg>
<seg id="11">With the Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two more baseball players in the main statistics show similar values.</seg>
<seg id="12">But in the baseball's glory hall, the 41-year-old is not likely to be included.</seg>
<seg id="13">For such successful Rodriguez - nickname A-Rod - on the field, so disputed is his appearance outside the place.</seg>
<seg id="14">Already in 2009, the superstar at ESPN admitted to having banned steroids between 2001 and 2003.</seg>
<seg id="15">In August 2013, he was banned for 211 parties due to an investigation in the so-called biogenesis scandal by the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="16">Rodriguez is considered a prime suspect to have received performance-enhancing resources for years beyond an anti-aging clinic in South Florida.</seg>
<seg id="17">After a legal dispute, the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters.</seg>
<seg id="18">The league could even be done for me for 2014, because I've played 20 years without a break, said Rodriguez at the time suffisant.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even his farewell days aren't noiseless.</seg>
<seg id="20">While many baseball legends are given the big stage in their last games, Rodriguez had to sit frequently on the bench.</seg>

<seg id="2">Caught off: because of a positive doping test, weight leader Adrian Zielinski may not start from Poland in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympics are overshadowed by the first official drug cases.</seg>
<seg id="4">A caught athlete would have won almost a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the seventh competition day, the first official doping cases have become known the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="6">Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-metre obstacle Silwia Danekova from Bulgaria and Polish weight leader Adrian Zielinski have been positively tested and excluded in Brazil - immediately before the start of the already critical athletics competitions coming to the time.</seg>
<seg id="7">At Chen, last Sunday, the Diuretic Hydrolothiadiac was proven to be used as a masked fund for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">The International Sports Court CAS confirmed their exclusion from the Olympics on Friday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday, the 18-year-old had finished fourth place in the final over 100m butterfly, only 0.09 seconds missed them the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday, Chen should have participated in the precursors of more than 50m of free-style.</seg>
<seg id="11">Chen has applied to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) the opening of the B and a hearing.</seg>
<seg id="12">The national association takes the matter very seriously and requires Chen full cooperation in the investigation, quoting Xinhua from a communication: we will work with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the verdict.</seg>
<seg id="13">For the first time in history, it is no longer the IOC, but the CAS for sanctioning athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also on the night of Rio, the news about the positive test at Danekova leaned through, the 33-year-old went into the offense himself.</seg>
<seg id="15">I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive, "this was an incredible shock," she told Bulgarian TV station BNT.</seg>
<seg id="16">She was innocent, "the only statement could be food supplements," the athlete explained.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the report, the banned substance is to act around the blood doping EPO.</seg>
<seg id="18">Danekowa has been preliminarily suspended, according to BNT, the B-test is also allowed to fall positively.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgaria's Prime Minister Bojko Borissow immediately reported criticising the athlete.</seg>
<seg id="20">I don't understand why the athletes don't pull the right conclusions, "he said: we Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been ruled out."</seg>
<seg id="21">So about all the weight leaders from the chronically doping nation don't participate in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">On Friday, the case was also known to the Adrian Zielinski, the London-based Olympic champion in class to 85 kg like his brother Tomasz three days earlier tested positive on the anabolic steroid nandrolon.</seg>
<seg id="23">Both deny the intake, but should not be allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before launching the athletes, especially the case of Danekova is another heavy blow to the reputation of the entire sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The World Federation IAAF had banned the complete Russian team to an exception because of systematic doping the launch, including runner Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="26">In swimming sport, the previous offences in China had also provided fierce clashes between the athletes.</seg>
<seg id="27">So the Frenchman Camille Lacourt grabbed the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang.</seg>
<seg id="28">Sun Yang pink purple.</seg>
<seg id="29">When I see the podium over 200 m free set, I want to hand over, "said Lacourt in French radio.</seg>
<seg id="30">Sun was also at the heart of a clash with Australian Mack Horton.</seg>
<seg id="31">I have no time and no respect for doping cheats, "said this.</seg>
<seg id="32">Sun was tested positive at the Chinese championships in 2014, but had to seat only a three-month lock.</seg>

<seg id="1">Data clue: so perfectly blackened hackers their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of extortion malware currently target companies - and are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey by the malware defence specialists, Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Britain and Germany have been at least 40 per cent of the companies surveyed over the past 12 months, partly several times victims of an attack with extortion software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, just under 20 per cent of firms were already targeting a ransome extortion.</seg>
<seg id="5">Forty per cent of victims paid willingly the ransoms requested by the perpetrators to restore the attacked systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The offenders specialise in their extortion software, according to observations of malware bytes, watching attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potentially extortion range falls significantly higher than in private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">We are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of the software, "explains Malwarebytes chief Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the world.</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most malware programmes were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the offenders discovered extortion software for itself.</seg>
<seg id="11">It was not until private users were targeting, but the change to company attacks has been frightening quickly in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransowmare works after a simple pattern: once on the computer of a victim actively, she is looking targeted after recently changing files such as Word, Excel or database files, and after archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the Ransomware and extinguishes the originals sustainable.</seg>
<seg id="14">Subsequently, the software presents the demands of blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the filing code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of Cryptown Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where to private users the personal photo database is at stake, it is all about companies around sensitive customer data or project databases without which production is shut down.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage falls out when a ransomware increases.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 per cent of German firms reported sales losses through Ransomware, 13 per cent even had to interrupt business activity, in one case, people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of nurses.</seg>
<seg id="20">We are always telling the victims: don't pay her only the problem, "explains Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 per cent of firms that pay, get their data again.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers, it's difficult to reject the perpetrators' demand in the face of standing in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers in turn know this and trying everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, F-Secure security researchers investigated the user interface and contact with the blackeners and come to the outcome: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain their victims by chat as they can pay by Bitcoin, settle freely available support websites, or decide for free example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And are private individuals redeeming after paying for a few hundred euros, companies must partly negotiate and pay five-digit sums to get their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potentially high and relatively risky gains from the Ransomware blackmail, the hackers are getting more professional and sharing the work, explaining security expert Chester Wisniewski of the anti-virus provider Sopos: "a single person can write a ransomeware around within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it's more likely that it is three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">Programmers sell their hazardous software then in the form of a software building box to the actual blackouts.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous malware kits were created by buying the Malware itself, advice and additional tools for a one-off, fixed price between $1,000 and $10,000.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the delivery range is an adjustment tool, so smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed, "says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The extortion then searches for more hackers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service economy.</seg>
<seg id="34">So you log into one of the forums underground, buying the set by a criminal and instructed another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">The pay is made per infected computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"Usually the criminals then charge spammers with the spread, explains Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known at many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 per cent of company IT leaders in the Malwarebytes poll trust to be able to defend Ransomware using file-back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the offenders already pursue new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">If encryption of data alone is no longer an adequate threat to successful blackmail, the perpetrators instead face the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations, "explains Malwarebytes chief Marcin Klezcynski.</seg>

<seg id="2">Honda HR-Vis flexible and everyday life</seg>
<seg id="3">In the small HR-W Will Honda will tackle everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and even the versatility of a minivans.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds quite overloaded, but the HR-V, which has been constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves very flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the only 1.60 m high HR is small, passengers have a lot of space in both the first row and in the Fond, it doesn't look tight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The interior's materials are well processed and acting pleasantly, only the cockpit top side falls something.</seg>
<seg id="7">Versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR-V at the storage room.</seg>
<seg id="8">Not only is it a boot of 453 low at high-profile and 1066 litres at the reverse back opposition, but there's the Magic Seats.</seg>
<seg id="9">This is less magical than it sounds like: the seating areas of the return leave like cinema chairs and offer storage space, which is high from the ground to blankets.</seg>
<seg id="10">The boot can be charged well, but the load is slightly higher with 650 mm than at the comparable Peugeot in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-litre diesel with 88 kW / 120 PS accelerates the HR-H thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in large speed areas very powerfully.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, he is likely to do a little quieter his work.</seg>
<seg id="13">Pleasingly, everyday consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is still another motoring: a 1.5-liter petrol with 96 kW / 130 HP.</seg>
<seg id="15">A wheelchair drive is not being offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">Driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between momentum and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="17">The steering, however, is likely to be a little more direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">The equipment leaves no desires open in the tested top variant of executive.</seg>
<seg id="19">Security systems include the City emergency assistant assistant (works to pace 32), the collision warning system and the spurt assistant.</seg>
<seg id="20">The collision warner is sometimes irritating because of ranking many obstacles than an approaching object.</seg>
<seg id="21">Very reliable works the remote assistant.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent Temporer responds to traffic recognition and threatens speed if needed.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, there's full connectivity, though, only for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, Navi, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB and an HDMI book are under the armrest and therefore are therefore something cumbersome.</seg>
<seg id="25">The around £29,000 for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">If you don't want to invest so much, it receives the gasoline from £20,000, the diesel from 23,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="27">The engines meet the Euro-6 exhaust.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing night: tips against sleep disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening, you're loosing forever around, and at night you're waking up for hours awake, tomorrow is already well before the clock rings can no longer be thinking about sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">That's anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adult sleep disorders and more than 10 per cent feel their sleep frequently or permanently than not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and they can underlie diverse causes, stresses Hans-Günter Week, board member of German Society for sleep research and sleep medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What you understand running beneath, though, is the insomniac, that is, an entry and sleep disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just that's sleeping many people as unsatisfying or inadequate, says Jens Wahnknett, board member in the German home doctor's association with practice in the Lower Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind this can put organic, mental or behavioral factors, but also drugs.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not seldom is the sleep disorder expressing another disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">'Very early wake up is particularly during a depression frequently, "says Week.</seg>
<seg id="14">And it may be that different factors condition each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">Anyone who, for example, has a band disc incident, can be bad, waking up every two or three hours and possibly catching up on everyday problems and concerns, Week gives an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to straining, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">From when should you get to the doctor with sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone who doesn't sleep well over a period of a month in at least three nights a week and on the day should go to the doctor, Wees.</seg>
<seg id="19">Impairment can look altogether differently: one is tired, unassuming, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has sentiment variations or physical complaints such as stomach or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">To alleviate the sleep disorder, it's important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As treatment options come under, among other things, behavioural changes, cognitive behavioral therapy or even medicines - classical sleeping tablets is only exceptional and at most for two weeks - question.</seg>
<seg id="22">Lower-lasting sleep physicians are hardly available in Germany, stressing Prof. Ingo Fietz, head of the interdisciplinary sleeping centre of Charity University medicine in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">That's why, in sleep problems, you should initially turn to the home doctor, counsel.</seg>
<seg id="24">The can clarify with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should be into the bedroom, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">To investigate in the sleep laboratory, physicians, for example, among snoring with breathing suspects, during diseased daytime fatigue, at sleeping wanders or when you don't find the cause of a panel disorder, Fietze explains.</seg>
<seg id="27">You actually don't have to prepare for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">Just please don't make a lunch sleep, "says Fietz.</seg>
<seg id="30">After the cable, you go to bed at his normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes on the body, you wear a nose glee, a breast belt and a feel on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera on the ceiling highlights the bedroom.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can subjects get to grips with the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There's quite a lot of screws on which you can set for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">White counts: regular sleeping and stakeholders, not too long in bed, don't sleep on the day, not television to sleep, alcohol avoiding and not looking on the clock at night - then that's quite and not conducive at all.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, a few lime trees, between a remaining headband: the Rigar street in Berlin-Friedrichshain doesn't work at first glance, but police include them to the city's "dangerous places."</seg>
<seg id="2">Go along the road from east to west, coming to playgrounds, a fresh kindergarten and a biolage pass.</seg>
<seg id="3">To the façade of a grey house, someone has been "ugly!" Sprayed.</seg>
<seg id="4">Opposite a Lidl, who is also to be demolished soon, is already being built: by 2017, here is scheduled to create a house with high windows and 133 new apartments.</seg>
<seg id="5">Articles about this's trendy district, as the responsible property company calls Friedrichshain, are preferred in recent weeks with burning cars.</seg>
<seg id="6">Reason is the house with the number 94 once it was occupied, now residents have lease contracts, but on the ground floor are still occupied spaces and will be used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Especially the Berlin inside senator Henkel had spoken several times since the beginning of the year for a tough action by police against the project, calling the area as a no-go zone for police officers and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After the rooms on the ground floor on June 22 were cleared with 300 police officers, police were patrolling three weeks of official statements, with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on the ground, blocking parts of the road and kept visitors from entering the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, renovated construction workers on behalf of the unknown homeowners the spaces.</seg>
<seg id="10">On July 13, a Berlin administrative court decided that the eviction was illegal, and a day later, police and construction workers drew off under the jubilation of sympathisers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon, the road works peacefully: parents are walking with children, people sitting on the pavement ahead of the houses in the sun, others are entertaining late.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate nearness of the house projects, a primary school and kindergarten.</seg>
<seg id="13">Leftist violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in the Kief since 1999, and Jana *, who here draws three children, are mainly generated by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With residents of house projects, they share concern about rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It doesn't sound like a kin, who wanted majority police protection from vandaling left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, which the Berlin interior senator and the police make up between home staff and their neighbours, doesn't exist so apparently.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in eastern Berlin was actually a traditional working-class quarter, which also has a low average income and high risk of poverty today.</seg>
<seg id="18">Also household occupations and the residential residential projects have long been part of the Kiez: in 1990, numerous homes were occupied in the former DDR, including nearly the entire Mainz Street completely near the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the mainzers had been cleared under large police bid in a downtrodden street battle, many of the projects in the Rigae were legalized and will still be inhabited by people who had occupied them 26 years ago today.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and electorates from all over the world in recent years: with them, residents are now sharing residents from DDR times and former householders their kies.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also noticeable in rents that have risen by nearly 60 per cent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Riga are attacked as symbols for this development: you acknowledge them on dropped slices or freshly cancerous facades thrown with colour bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned this year along with the words of left-autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason that not all neighbors look at this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: offences such as body injury are aimed at statistics almost exclusively against police.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the offences make property damage, which tends to meet new buildings and freshly renovated homes.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin newbies, who have been living in a rental house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, can't be a speech from uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As for violence, she is appeasing: people in the 94 are their neighbours who weren't determined to have been.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars are no longer admitting it directly in the Rigarter before.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: 'here you help each other, live together on the street and get more of each other than else. "</seg>
<seg id="30">Newbreekers are deliberately pulled into the Riga street - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">That's why it was also so important for residents to get their road back: from the police, politics and the media, who all suddenly claimed the interpretation of the neighborhood in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents such as newbreeders, the road will continue to take them away: through faceless new buildings in former building gaps that oust the old residents.</seg>
<seg id="33">These are ultimately property apartments that are not interesting for many here - here are more people who are not so well bettered, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="34">Violence and destruction cannot accept absolutely. "</seg>
<seg id="35">But what are you supposed to do when one never listens to anyone?</seg>
<seg id="36">It sets frustration on all sides, including with police and residents.</seg>
<seg id="37">For travelers who are annoying about colour bombs, Kerstin newbreeders have little understanding: the house projects and the left scene belonged to the kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Anyone herself should be aware of this - just like someone who pulls into a pub quarter, can complain badly about noise there.</seg>
<seg id="39">All of the people imagined with front-runners have been asked not to be named with their right name</seg>

<seg id="20">The cost of construction, rent or renovating these shelters must bear the local authorities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the land office to local authorities and job centres.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his home.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been designing for some time as very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the administration doesn't find private homes.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far, it doesn't work on private homes, according to Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, charitable apartments need to be enthusiastic as it means beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be set up in the Wasen Street.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the cue, Regine Kunde and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a fixed lead, there are internships, training agencies, school places, one-jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be found or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"More places would be good," Regine customer reports.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the bauf or help home companies, do not-for-profit work - and that motivates and very properly, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">It hopes work for the community leads to a positive outfield.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is not an employment therapy.</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity doesn't just think of work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needed a firm structure, say Deuschle and customers.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So it takes offers like sport, contacts with locals and, above all, language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rar.</seg>
<seg id="40">So here are administration and volunteers here.</seg>
<seg id="41">It's central that the refugees feel they were wanted in Germany and welcome.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the proceedings was a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They have to explain to the refugees that it will take it and they can bridge the time meaningfully, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Who eventually developed the feeling that he couldn't help in Urbach, should not be allowed to work and be unnecessary, which will never integrate.</seg>
<seg id="45">The significant majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">However, there are problems, though, says customers honestly, people who do nothing at all. "The work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">This is all already a mammoth task.</seg>
<seg id="48">One difficult question: have the two after recent events fear radicalisation, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">No, Regine Kunde said quite clearly what some naive likes. "A restriction could be, but don't want to exclude them.</seg>
<seg id="50">However, the aides are already aware.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents were also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the assassins bring them completely into disrepute.</seg>
<seg id="53">They want to show that they have nothing to do with it, "says Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So primary and volunteers will have to look for activities on the ground and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that soon a new blow to refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a ceiling?</seg>
<seg id="58">Clearly answering that question is politics.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it's unfair to put them on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="60">In Urbach, we haven't arrived yet where we would like, "says Annika Deuschel.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbachers are already being charged with integrating the previous people sensibly.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently about 100 people, predominantly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But if people are in distress, you have to help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, as there are no easy answers.</seg>
