31 years of exemplary clarity
The managing director of the water purpose association, "Veitensteingruppe," Ruppert Göller, is retiring.
The association is considered "Bavaria-wide exemplary."
A small fine water water association as a role model for the major water producers.
So some time ago it was in the original post in a post from Bayerischer Rundfunk.
A little later, the Water Forum of the Unterfranken government paid tribute to the purpose association.
The work of the Veitensteingruppe taught "Bavaria-wide as exemplary."
Behind all this is Rupert Göller, who was 31 years old in the purpose association, of which 28 years as managing director.
Now he was retired at age 65.
The drinking water association of the Veitensteingruppe, based in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, promotes about 150000 cubic metres of water annually, providing 32 places and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants.
The municipalities are the municipalities of Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the town of Baunach.
There are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities.
The current chairwoman, Breitbrunns Mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was hired as a waterwart in 1985 and was appointed as managing director of the purpose association in 1988.
"His duties have been very diverse and they covered water management and maintenance work, office and organisation activities, budget creation, calculating fees and contributions, and emergency operations at weekends," the chairwoman said.
As outstanding events, she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells (1994), plot purchases in the new wells (1998) and compensation of farmers, the refurbishment of the high containers (1999), the repurchase of a central computer control (2004) and the partial renewals of water pipes.
There has been no stalemate and there has always been innovation, because water lives and drinking water is the most important food.
In her laudatio, she praised Göller's loyal, reliable and correct service over 31 years.
He has worked with a lot of heart blood for his water purpose association and he has lived up to the water purpose association as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veitensteingruppe for nitrate reduction in front of the Subfranc water forum.
He received a great deal of recognition and praise for that.
Rupert Göller, for his part, praised Waterwart Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.
He's the best waterwart and he was a loyal scarf.
Together we were an unbeatable team.
As a highlight from his point of view, he referred to Brunnbau and the restructuring of the purpose association.
However, the biggest challenge and the most difficult operation was the pipe break at the high container at Kirchlauter on January 3.
Here, at minus 17 degrees, it will have to work all night so that the villages could be supplied with water.
Even the supply of Neubrunn could only be maintained once you filled the Pettstadt high container with hoses.
The management of the drinking water association has been handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who will take the succession of Rupert Göller.
