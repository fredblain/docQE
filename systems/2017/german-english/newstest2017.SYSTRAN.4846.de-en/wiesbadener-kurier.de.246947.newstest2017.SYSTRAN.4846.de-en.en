Cancer case: When the organiser pays
After their journey, sufferers will only receive money after their journey, if the cause of the disease is unquestionably found in the hotel.
But that is only the case when more than ten percent of guests show the same symptoms.
In the negotiated case, a family was seriously ill on diarrhea and vomiting on the second day of their Turkish holiday.
She spent almost the entire holiday in the room.
Their disorder led the holidaymakers back to a defective waste water treatment plant that allegedly polluted the seawater.
The family thought the trip was flawed - and clashed against the organiser.
In court, the plaintiffs had no success.
The waste water treatment plant was indeed defective.
But the organizer only learned about it shortly before the plaintiffs left.
He had to assume until then that the seawater was in order.
So he did not breach his information obligations, the ruling said.
No impurities were found in the samples of the water.
The disorder of several hotel guests - possibly by contagion among themselves - is part of the overall risk of life.
Of 691 guests, only 38 were ill.
