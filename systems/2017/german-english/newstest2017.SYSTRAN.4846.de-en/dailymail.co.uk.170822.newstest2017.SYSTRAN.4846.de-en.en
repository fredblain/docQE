Asocial family destroyed before delogulation of social housing in Saltash, Cornwall
An asocial family left her social flat after a delogit with a £50,000 damage because she terrorised her neighbours.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown from their estate in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints.
After being forcibly removed from their estate, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in a irreparable condition.
The walls pointed out crushing holes, wooden walkways were rounded up, rubbish was strewn on the floor and graffiti was leaked to the walls.
The family were relocated and it is believed she now lives in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for house management at Cornwall Housing, said she fears the apartment will no longer be repaired.
She said: "It was an absolute nightmare for people here and I think people don't have to live in that way.
There are many things to consider because this estate will presumably be considered as not such a beautiful part of Cornwall.
The family is notorious and their reputation is too.
The couple had three sons, who meanwhile lived in the flat and police said the terror the family inflicted on them was street fights with baseball sleepers, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive cries, disputes and curses.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, got an injunction for anti-social behaviour in June.
In some rooms of the house that may be demolished, old rubbish was found
In the estate where drugs have been traded in the past, the wooden diets were spotted
Neighbours said they saw them fighting on the street and had to regularly call the police
Cornwall Housing deloged her and her partner violently from the estate this week after giving them a longer period of 11 weeks to voluntarily pull out.
Delogulation was cheered by facilitated neighbours who said their lives were made to hell.
One said: "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad.
The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.
"This morning we couldn't sleep."
We stood up because it was so quiet here - we weren't used to it!
Now that they are finally away, it will be nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, the Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said the family had failed to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived for 20 years in the house where police were called at regular intervals
Rubbish and old toys were dumped down on the overgrown side of the municipal house
He added: "It's a shame that the tenant declined to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and that of their family, because delogulation is always the last step considering Cornwall Housing.
This was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be terribly seen for their neighbours.
I appreciate all the work that has been done by my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, and members of the community, who have courageously entered us and have provided us with the information.
I hope that this development will donate consolation to some neighbours, conveying the message that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said all three sons had lived at different times at the house, but that they were all over 20.

House management workers will now have to clean away rubbish mountains that surround the house
In 2014, police carried out a Razzia in the house and found over 70g of cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash of £1,700.
Skeldon received a fine after pleading guilty to possession of a Class B drug in commercial intent.
She claimed the money was for a tombstone of her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After they were without homeless, it is believed Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many room walls of the house were lined with graffiti.
Police say she will delogulate tenants who don't stick to house order
Angela Crow, from Devon and Cornwall police, said delogulation was a clear warning to the other tenants who don't stick to the house order.
"This goes to those who think they can behave without self-accusations as well as those who have been victimized by such behaviour," she said.
Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
