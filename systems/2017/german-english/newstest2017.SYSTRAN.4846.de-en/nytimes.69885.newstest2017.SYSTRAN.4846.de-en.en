Once over the price squeezed out of the market, cafe comes back in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shameful café in William Castle where you could only pay cash that had no Wi-Fi but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, prices were squeezed out of his Bedford Avenue store front.
The Soap Cherie business, which replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Locals used it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change, but I still can't believe CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel excludes and Verb is now a soap business."
But if New York is change, it is also new finishes.
A revived verb cafe opened last November at Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same employees and a similarly simple atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old café, who is the owner and managing director of the new café.
He began working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a customer offered to provide funds for a new outpost, he was excited to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, maintained a lot.
Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment.
He introduced new ingredients.
The menu includes sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garniches like capers and sucked onions.
There are natural rice bowls.
The café no longer serves beer, there are fresh juices for that.
After nine months, Rodriguez said he noticed a stubborn stream of old regular customers.
"Many old customers were also forced out of William Castle by prices," he said.
Recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, formerly lived in William Castle and visited the verb regularly.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would take the road.
After the verb closed, she gave up coffee drinking for a while, she said.
"It became clear to me that there was coffee and culture in the verb that I liked," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, even though she ordered a blended Chai Tea on that day instead of her usual Iced Coffees, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal has been another long-time and loyal customer since the verb began in 2003.
He went there before work and inevitably ordered the same thing.
"I came fourth after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket clock and they prepare my everything-Bagel with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu.
Nowadays, Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his everything-Bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said he had no groom about the soap business taking the old business space.
In fact, the Soap Cherie owners offered to make a special soap for verb with the cafe's cold-hearted coffee as an ingredient.
"I think we will still be looking at their offer," Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish residents Greentpoints have also accepted the cafe.
A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said he plans to exhibit it soon so that his new neighbours feel welcome.
The site also has further advantages.
A local juice local wants to fill and sell the cold-hearted coffee into the bottles.
There is a chance that the café will expand onto a neighbouring building.
A new verb is enough for many customers to get their old favourites.
Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed.
When the new café opened, Whitt said that entering the venue and ordering a new coffee felt like a return home.
"I had to smell that," he said.
