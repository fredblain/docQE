In bomb attack: He was the hero of Aleppo
He put his own life at risk to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar devoted his life to the people of Syria.
He risked everything to save others.
Now the 30-year-old himself has died in a facial bomb attack by the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the White Helmets, a civil protection group that, according to Bild newspaper, saved nearly 60,000 people.
2900 volunteers are putting their own lives at risk to pull people out of crushed homes and provide first aid in the war zone.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: A video of the civil servant showing him at an 11-hour rescue of a baby from the rubble of a house went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrians the luminous symbol character in the horror of war.
As a hero, however, he never saw himself, said according to Bild: "For me that's the real jihad."
"When I die from saving lives, I think God sees a martyr in me."
Shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack, he had spoken in a video about the last bombings in Syria.
The helicopters have thrown four facial bombs over the Alzadia district, one was filled with chlorine gas.
A woman and two children died, seven people suffering from breathing difficulties.
"We are now removing the poisonous remnants of the bomb so that children don't play with it," the image quotes his final words before he died.
The Assad regime's deadly bomb had to hit terrorists.
