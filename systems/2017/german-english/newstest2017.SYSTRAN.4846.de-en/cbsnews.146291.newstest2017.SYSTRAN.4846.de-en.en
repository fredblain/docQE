Hurriedly rains, flooding gives cause for bailout in Louisiana, Mississippi
Hurried rains and large-scale flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to declare the emergency on Friday, with more rains expected throughout Saturday.
Numerous rivers in southeast Louisiana and the south of the Mississippis flooded their shores and threatened with large-scale flooding after extreme rains, the National Weather Service reported.
Louisiana governor John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on the move to the affected communities.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said the requests were for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags.
Steele said the municipality of Tangipahoa had requested ten thousand sandbags alone.
A flood warning system will be deployed across large parts of south Louisiana until Saturday.
The weather service said that an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in the area.
A flood early warning system was set up in south Alabamas on Friday, while mobile continues to rage.
The river Comite near Baton Rouges and the River Amite near Denham Springs, which are both located in Louisiana, will all likely reach record levels over the weekend.
Metereologist Alek Kraut says both rivers could flood many homes in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said a downstream flood in Ascension Parish poses a danger, as these will only slowly flow into Lake Maurepas over the faithful rivers.
The River Tickfaw, south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded at 09.00 on Friday.
Rescue teams still burst people from floodwater in the Amite and Wilkinson districts in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and his wife were among those rescued near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 400 feet from his home, has risen sharply overnight.
He said he had warned another Stefsohn who lives nearby.
"We woke up and the water streamed and flooded in," said Hansford.
It reached my waist.
His wife said Hansford had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years she lived there.
Hansford said he and his family members had all disabilities and he would be the only one to swim.
Hansford said Nothelfer had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire guard in Gloster, where they were housed until Friday.
Kraut said the flood had "spread rapidly" as there continued to be heavy rains and that authorities were considering evacuation instructions.
According to Krauthann, an observer near Livingstone reported from midnight to Friday morning of 13.75 inches of rain.
Krauthmann said the ground had been significantly full-throated by the rains since Wednesday.
Authorities said heavy rains and roadblocks caused residents to rescue residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and teaching outages in five school districts.
The CBS subsidiary, WWL, reported that a beige ordered in Tangipahoa had 200 flooded houses.
Residents were evacuated in two churches, which were now both flooded.
The commune of the community Robby Miller said authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets washed up by flood waters.
Emergency shelters have been set up in the cities of Amite and Hammond to accommodate the evacuees.
"Once the water starts to go back, they will be able to go back to their homes," he said.
In the town of Hammond of the municipality of Tangipahoa, almost two dozen roads were closed due to flooding and sandbags for the residents hoping to keep the water out of their homes and shops.
"The last big flood we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum of the city government.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississipp, emergency manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison County's emergency manager said it continued to rage on the Gulf Coast.
According to his details, a handful of houses are reported to have been flooded on Thursday, but none have been reported on Friday.
Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen before," Townson said, "and it's still coming."
