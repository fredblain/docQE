Olympia 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
Wide: Due to a positive doping sample, weight theater Adrian Zielinski from Poland is not allowed to start in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympics are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.
A wired athletic would almost have won a medal.
Before the seventh day of the race, the first official doping cases have become known in Rio de Janeiro.
The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3,000-meter-barrier Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were tested positive and excluded in Brazil - just before the start of the already critically-charged athletic contests, these messages come at untime.
As far as Chen was concerned, the diuretic hydrochloriaiazid was already proven last Sunday, which is used as a masked agent for doping substances.
The International Sports Court, CAS, confirmed its exclusion from the Olympics on Friday afternoon.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old had fined fourth place in the finale over 100m butterfly, only by 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.
On Friday, Chen should have attended the precursors over 50m free style.
Chen has asked the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to open the B sample and a hearing.
The national association takes the matter "very seriously and requires Chen to cooperate fully in the investigations," Xinhua quoted from a notice as saying, "We will cooperate with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the ruling."
For the first time in history, no longer the IOC, but the CAS, is responsible for sanctioning athletes with positive cases.
Also on the night of Rio, the news of the positive sample at Danekowa sickened through, the 33-year-old went into the offensive herself.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive" this was "an incredible shock," she told Bulgarian TV broadcaster BNT.
She is innocent, "the only explanation could be food supplements," the lightweight athletin explained.
According to the report, the banned substance is supposed to be the EPO blood doping agent.
Danekowa has been provisionally suspended, according to BNT, the B sample should also be positive.
Bulgaria's Prime Minister Bojko Borissow promptly declared himself with criticism at the athletic.
"I don't understand why the athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said, "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."
For example, all weight theories from the chronically doping nation may not take part in Rio.
On Friday, the case of "Adrian Zielinski" was also known, the London Olympic champion in class up to 85 kg was tested positive for the anabex steroid nandrolon three days earlier.
Both dispute the intake, but neither can start in the class up to 94 kg.
Before the launch of light athletes, the Danekowa case is another serious blow to the reputation of the entire sport.
The IAAF World Association banned the entire Russian team from systematic doping until an exception due to systematic doping, even the runner nation of Kenya produces numerous bad news.
In the swimming sport, the previous offences in China had also caused fierce disputes between the athletes.
So Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang.
"Sun Yang pinched purple."
"When I see the podium over 200m free style, I want to pass," Lacourt said on French radio.
Sun was also at the centre of a dispute with Australian Mack Horton.
"I have no time and no respect for doping fraudsters," said this.
Sun had tested positive for the stimulant trimetazidin in 2014 at the Chinese championships, but only had to sit off a three-month lock.
