Russia & Iran trade suddenly rises to 71% - RT Business
With the lifting of sanctions, according to the Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, trade sales between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 percent annually.
Since the international sanctions against Iran were lifted, interest on the part of Russian companies has grown heavily on business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are taking existing ties with Iran, while new firms are ready to gain access to the market.
Of course, further trade expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that trade sales between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent in the first five months of 2016, compared with the same period in 2015, and were $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports into Iran rose by 91.5 percent and were $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose 16 percent to $158 million.
The trade boost was reached by deliveries of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan is out of record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian foreign ministry issued around 35,000 visas, primarily Reisevisas, to Iranian citizens.
Iran also reached the top 20 of the countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia.
It could be said that record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia from last year are being broken, "he said.
At the same time, only relatively few Russians visit Iran, something the ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization in a good condition," he said.
