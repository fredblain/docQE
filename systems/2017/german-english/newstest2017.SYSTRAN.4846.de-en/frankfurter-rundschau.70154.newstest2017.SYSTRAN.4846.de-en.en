Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Dahin go where it hurts"
Seldicames Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: locals get nothing from the summer election campaign - and holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the landtag.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.
In 2021, the election of the country will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerins Parliament decided earlier this year.
This is not the case in the past: summer holidays, heat and the election of the country.
The locals, who will be persuaded by the election campaigners, are on holiday.
The vast majority of holidaymakers in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so are not allowed to choose the land day.
There are practical problems: in the holidays, helpers who hang up posters, blow up air balloons, distribute flyers and count votes at the end of the day, only painstakingly pick up.
Until September 4, 2016, the election and final day of the day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern will have to leave the race just short of the people.
The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.
And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, must fear for his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls.
What is exciting is how much neuling AfD cuts and what's left at the end of coalition dust.
Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, makes an almost inconspicuous campaign, seen from his large posters.
He travels through the country, distributes roses and speaks a little with the people, just as his legendary legendary predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.
Otherwise, soul ring has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame at the AfD.
Her refugee policy, her "We are creating that," has accelerated the rise of right-wing populists, which is now likely to cost him the beautiful office.
The CDU, with its top candidate, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is to campaign at the wrong time in the right place.
She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale demonstrations; Merkel Bundestag constituency is in the north east.
But the target group did not agree, it was more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony than Mecklenburger and Vorpommern.
"There was probably a majority of other federal states," Vincent Kokert, general Secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently told NDR.
But it also pity anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once.
Otherwise, the North-East CDU largely renounces the usual election campaigns on marketplaces and in front of shopping centres with umbrellas and balloons.
This, Kokert believes, only plays a "subordinate role."
The union, too, has noticed that the country is leaving the base, that it must make great efforts to find a wire to the people again.
It is like the Left, the SPD, the Greens: there are hardly any in the country's expanses.
However, the CDU elector Kokert, to his co-conspirators, is also self-sustaining: "They must go where it hurts, which is where the people are: village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday party must be used."
Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called his SPD a particularly committed campaign.
In polls, the Social Democrats last stood at 22 percent behind partners CDU (25) and just short of the AfD (19).
In the 2011 election, the SPD had still clearly won 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).
The Greens, small party with seven percent in the polls, are expected to make the leap into the landtag.
They make a modern virtue from holiday distress and largely transfer their campaign to the Internet.
"Online election campaign," says state chairman Claudia Müller.
Otherwise, green election campaigners will go on track searching for local voting citizens among holidaymakers.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, curvy with a house boat through the Mecklenburg Lakes and also finds it beautiful.
Her impression: "Electoral leave in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment."
