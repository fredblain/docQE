Witnesses searched: Beverage market in forest brittle
A robbery raid was carried out on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Rewe XXL at the Waldbröler Gerberstrasse.
Under the auspices of a shot gun, three darkly dressed people who had their faces purposely demanded the release of cash and then initially flew on foot and then presumably with a silver-coloured VW golf.
The police do not share the amount of money.
The perpetrators should have been between 1.60 and 1.70 metres tall, so relatively small.
The beverage market is accessible directly from the parking deck of the Rewe market and can be viewed badly.
After the attack, the perpetrators must be torn down in the direction of Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg and be wed by the gravel-coloured car located opposite the parking lot, possibly in the direction of B 256 (Silverstein Ring).
Anyone who has made observations in connection with the robbery (about 7.45 p.m.) will urgently report to the police.
