Simone Biles creates gold in the damenturnen
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all that.
Dynamic on the jump horse.
Effortlessly on the beam.
Breathtaking bend on the ground.
All along brilliantly.
And now finally Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American-born American champion on Thursday became a multi-fight title, widening the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of the headlights of the Olympics.
Their overall score of 62,198 was clearly ahead of silver medal winners and "Final Five" teams of teams Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.

Biles is the fourth heterosexual American to win a multi-fight title and overall, while consolidating her reputation for being the best of her generation, or even at all.
She broke down in tears when her final result was shown and ended her long journey at that moment.
This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who have brought their sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated her sport the past three years, 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a mix of ambition and precision that the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton said she was "the best turnaround I've ever seen."
It awaited her last exam in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.
Not having a handful of gold back to family in Spring, Texas would be considered a disappointment.

Biles took the first medal on Tuesday while serving as exclamation mark at the farewell ceremony of retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles insisted, during her long path to the top, never planned the future, that's not really true.
Part of their ground exercises - which include their typical tumbling pass - are tuned to Latin American music that would fit home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
It's no coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school excursion to the gym where Boorman trained, became the force.
She has not lost a multi-fight contest since the summer of 2013, a victory series that will hold for as long as Biles wants.
Even though Mustafina performed slightly through two turns, the picture drowned.
Beams and ground beams - in which Biles holds the world championship title - laughed.
She resumed again with 15,433 on the suspended beam - and put one on the floor with a 15,933.
Raisman embraced her gently as she awaited her Endergbuch - a pure formality - and tears flowed on Biles glossy red, white and blue eyeliner as the vision she once described in her collection book became a reality.
Raisman's performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago, when she fought for third place, but the bronze medal in a tiebrake went to Mustafina.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, named by the Americans, had a lead.
After her ground exercise, she threw kiss hands to the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed doubtful.
As for Biles, the rapidly expanding tweet of the 19-year-old from early this week has a whole new meaning:
