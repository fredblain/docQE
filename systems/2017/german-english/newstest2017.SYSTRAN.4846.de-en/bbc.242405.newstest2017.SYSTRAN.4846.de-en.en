Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available to customers outside Scotland
According to the bank's chief executive, the RBS brand is to be reduced to a back office role.
Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank has since distanced itself when it almost collapsed and rescued eight years ago.
During that time, brand strategists have used "RBS" to protect other end consumer financial brands.
She supported international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now she has chosen to put more national brands into focus.
Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all RSB referees, the decentralised headquarters and the listing of NatWest will change.
Ulster Bank is already being used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for retail banking that will be more important - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a tour tour of clients and employees in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RSB brand will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed as we become more into a bank of brands now."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became the global brand.
I am now saying that we are not pursuing global goals, but local goals.
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already said it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the visibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship.
"It's time for us to develop into the bank of brands, because how do we focus on inside (we have asked) to make this a better bank for customers?" said the CEO.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs, not our own, I think we will see many changes.
We can launch these brands again, so I think the time has come.
