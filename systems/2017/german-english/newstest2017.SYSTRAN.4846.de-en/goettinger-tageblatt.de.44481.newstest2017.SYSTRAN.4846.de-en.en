Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee requires wealthy savers in the future to pay penalty interest - as the second institute in Germany.
Bank chief Josef Paul said on Thursday: "It's only about 139 customers parking 40 million euros on Giro or Day money accounts."
The Bundesverband Deutscher Banken speaks of an isolated case and sees no sign of it: Normal savers would have to "not fear paying for their savings-sized penalty rates."
If banks spend money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they will have to pay their 0.4 percent penalty rate.
From September, Raiffeisenbank Gmund will require Raiffeisenbank Gmund from private and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 euros on Giro or Day money accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
"The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year in the future," Paul said.
For some time, he has spent 40 million euros, which could be removed from one day to the other and which he cannot exploit.
"They lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent costs," the bank chief said.
"I can't pay for every million euros."
According to the polluter pays principle, the costs will now continue.
To simply leave the cash in the Raiffeisenbank tresses would be far too dangerous: "I have already experienced four overaults, I don't want the fifth," the bank board said.
Most customers would have understanding and switched to other forms of investment.
Few migrated to other banks.
The Bavarian Association of Confederation said: "The ECB's extreme monetary policy course is causing significant costs for all banks."
To carry them alone is "economically impossible economically."
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account guidance, credit cards or transfers.
Thuringia Volks and Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land had made headlines in 2014 with penalty interest on deposits from three million euros.
Michael Kemmer, chief executive of the banking association, said: "We do not expect retail customers to pay wholesale fees for deposits, so competition in Germany is far too strong among banks and savings banks."
A banker said there was "a clientele" on Tegernsee that is somewhat lush from the asset.
"This can become a problem for a small bank" if it hats free money.
Founded in 1911, the cooperative bank Gmund has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
The region has known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs.
The Bavaria co-operative association "is not currently known to any other banks that charge an outlay replacement for deposits from private customers," spokesman Ernst said.
The president of the Bundesverband of German Volksbanken and Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), Uwe Fr√∂hlich, declared at the end of June: "The threshold of going into negatives to the private customer is very, very high."
Competition is tough, and it threatens to drag investors into competition.
Customers in Germany will not be able to afford that.
