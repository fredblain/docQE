Haigerloch: Pilgrimage to the gate of mercy
The ministrants from the Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna branch were travelling on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Four stages were managed together.
In order to bridge the time until the next tour of all ministrants in the expected two years, the Oberministrantenround St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.
Various pilgrimage goals were examined and one finally decided for the Bishop City of Freiburg, where this year, during the Holy Year of Mercy, with the open gate of mercy at Freiburg Münster, there was a special pilgrimage goal.
16 minis from Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Holy Rooms made their way.
The evening before, parish priest Storost sent Pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrimage crosses and told the pilgrimage blessing.
Horb was driven by train to the starting point Villingen, where a mouthful of Our loved one stands and so the Pilgrimage of Münster was taken.
The individual day tours were surrounded in the morning and evening by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and writing texts.
But on the other hand, the Minis at field crossings, chapels or churches repeatedly turned up to sing together a song from pilgrimage-related pilgrimage.
The local parish houses were available for overnight stays.
Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller served on the mill goals for a tasty as well as a strong dinner and breakfast.
The second day went to Gütwangen on the second day.
Day after day, the stage went to St. Peter, which was the most strenuous route, but had to first climb around 500 metres of heights at the end of the heat and then get back to it.
The deserved reward was a common grilling at the bathroom in the evening.
After the morning impulse on the fourth Pilgrimage Day in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, it went to the closing stage to Freiburg.
Relieved and happy, Minis arrived at the Freiburg Münster later in the afternoon and steps through the gate of mercy.
With a small impulse, God thanked God.
In the evening fair in Münster, the Minis arrived at the pilgrimage destination were welcomed by collaborator Markus Obert.
After the service, pilgrims were able to visit the Sacristy and the High altar.
The next day was still time for the Breisgau metropolis.
In the afternoon, it went back to Horb by train.
In the end, all participants agreed that the days were marked by spirituality and a strong community experience.
