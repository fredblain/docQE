Podolski picks up with "Gala" after Supercup
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, a warrant has been issued against former football star Hakan Sükür.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time after the coup attempt, an important football match has resumed in Turkey.
Before the duel of the archrival between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul around the conya Supercup, the official line is clear: "Business as usual" is said.
Even in the imposition of the state of emergency after the overthrow attempt in July, the government stressed that ordinary citizens should not be affected.
But that does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, whom one is responsible for the coup attempt.
It does not stop before football.
The prosecutor issued an arrest warrant against former star kicker Hakan Sükür.
Thus, the South American, now living in America, is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
Sükür is to be supporters of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is being blamed by state President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup attempt.
Although the state of emergency, initially imposed for 90 days, is still valid until October, it has virtually no effect on the lives of most Turks.
The nightly "democracy guards" at public places across the country have declared Erdogan an end on Wednesday.
Sport - like the whole country - is split into Erdogan's supporters and opponents.
Fans of the Besiktas worker club are traditionally not among the president's friends.
What most of the Turks, however, united in the face of dramatic experience in history, is the strict rejection of military puts.
Even the fans themselves agree - no matter whether their heart is beating for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
At the cup winner "Gala", it will come back to Lukas Podolski especially.
The Cologne team proved its sporting value in the past season: with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions, the 31-year-old finished his first time as the top scorer of his club.
In the final game against Fenerbahce, he scored the 1:0 victory.
The "Fanatik" newspaper joked him: "He was the best on the pitch."
He completed the season in an excellent way and secured his team the Cup.
Thanks to "Poldi," the disappointing season for the record master found a conciliatory conclusion.
After the pre-round K.o in the Champions League, the "Lions" also distinguished themselves in the Europa League early.
In South Lig, only ranked sixth.
The season was not good.
The cup was the only way to win something.
"We managed that and that's the most important thing," Podolski said.
For champions Besiktas, the game year ran better.
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who presented the base to the 14th title with 26 seasonal goals as a South-Lig tennis champion.
That is also the reason fans continue to hope for the return of the 31-year-old.
According to the coup attempt, the Gomez, who was under contract with AC Florence, only announced to Gomez after the coup attempt not to return to the country because of the political situation in the country.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just needs to say it," Cited the specialist magazine "Kicker" club chief Fikret Orman.
In order to do this, however, the stormer would have to be willing to renounce around a third of his year-old, estimated at 7.5 million euros, Orman said: "We cannot pay for his salary at Florence."
