Rain instead of star: hope for weather improvement
The weather has made the star nude guckers in south west Germany a stroke through the bill on Friday - yet there is hope.
The night was bad for clouds and rain to observe the sky spectacle, said the chairman of the Welzheim star, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.
Our hope is on the night of Saturday.
The weather is supposed to be good, then we certainly see many star nuts in the sky.
The star scales are Perseiden, which, at 216,000 kilometres per hour, is one of the fastest stars.
They have their name because they seem to come from the Perseus star, which goes up in the northeast.
