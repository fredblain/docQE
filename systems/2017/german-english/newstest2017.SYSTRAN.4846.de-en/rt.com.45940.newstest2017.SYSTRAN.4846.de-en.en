Jewish director smashes Berlin hotel because Israeli pre-election was removed after "Arab" call - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media upset after he betrayed that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin did not list an Israeli pre-election, as Arab guests "had requested" according to an employee.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah," left his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter to German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel's pre-election list.
However, the country was not listed between countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and erased?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, the Kempinsi Bristol offers a way to choose Israel through its own call centre.
According to a statement, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received there "shocked him," as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said the measure was a "deliberate decision of the management of the Kempinski hotels."
The reason behind it was causing even more anger in the director.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre-election be erased," the employee of Lanzmann was quoted as saying.
The Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great shame," reported the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
We were appalled and dismayed by this event.
It really is very shameful.
The fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even greater shame.
No explanation is required.
We expect the hotel to "draw the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident triggered a pretty big resonance on the internet, where people called the whole thing a scandal.
Some told the Kempinski Hotel that it had "given up" the alleged calls of Arab guests.
"Shovel you," it said in another post, pointing out that the hotel, located on the noble Kurfürstendamm, stands near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly denied all accusations and called the incident a "mistake" and "apologized" to Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reported.
"There has never been a direct instruction" not to include Israel in the fast-track list," the Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman for the Kempinski hotel as saying.
It adds that the country pre-election has now been added.
