Fleeing: "Every wed woman has experience of sexual violence"
Sexual violence is almost part of everyday life for women fleeing alone.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatised.
A house offers refuge.
In a large kitchen, four women sit.
Each has a baby that is at most one year old.
One has put her little son in the arm.
He looks curious into the room with big eyes.
His mother stares at the table.
Until she notices she is being watched.
She smiles briefly and kisses the little ones.
The scene acts normally.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is an area business leader of Condrobs, a promoter of social assistance in Bavaria, and deals with the issue of women, among other things.
The four women in the kitchen are poultry.
They live in the Munich north in one of the few devolved accommodation for all-female women and their children in Bavaria.
In January, Condrobs made up the facility along with Pro Familia and the Munich women's aid.
It has recently been officially opened.
60 people live there - around 40 women and 20 children.
Men are not there - neither as visitors.
The exception is a watchman in front of the door.
"It's not exaggerated to say that every woman arriving here has experienced experiences of sexual violence on their escape," Bahr says.
"Men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they threaten torture or death or because their families send them to Europe as hopefuls," she says.
In women, other reasons outweigh the escape: "Many steal themselves secretly because they don't see another way out."
In their home country they have experience of sexual violence, forced marriages, honour killings, slavery or forced prostitution.
It continues it.
The escape goes on.
"That wickets for example for a bottle of water require a sexual act is not a rarity," says Bahr.
And women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Who thinks that the end as soon as they arrive in Germany, tells Bahr.
Here, too, single women in refugee accommodation would often be considered inferior and at worst abused.
This leads to some 90 percent of women living in the accommodation in the Munich north traumatised, she estimates.
"Some of the children certainly did not come up voluntarily."
Many women are so accustomed to saying nothing.
"Or they don't trust talking openly about the experience because shame is too big."
Because they often don't want to help, they need more accommodation only for them, Bahr asks.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.
As for whether they knew about a similar project as in Munich, some answered no.
In the Upper Palatine and Oberfranken, for example, there is no such thing in the accommodation of governments.
Even in swabs, women wed alone will not be housed separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, government spokesman for the government.
In Upper Bavaria, under- and middle franks, there are floors or own houses in some community accommodation only for single women and their children.
The exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central accommodation only for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be housed separately from men.
In a study published for the committee, it says: "It is very important for men and women to be housed separately."
"If privacy is lacking or men and women are put together, there can be - more persistent - violence against women.
In particular, washrooms should be separated and accessible to women, according to the study.
How much women feel like this need for protection can be seen at the heart of the house in Munich.
"Since talking about it, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr.
You could easily make a second house.
