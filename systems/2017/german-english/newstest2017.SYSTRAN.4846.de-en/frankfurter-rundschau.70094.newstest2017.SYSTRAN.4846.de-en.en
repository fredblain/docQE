Turkey: Kurdish community expects mass exodus
"Anyone who doesn't suit and praises Erdogan is sitting on packed caffeine," says the chair of the G端len-close foundation Dialogue and World, Ercan Karakoyun.
In the short term, the Kurdish community of Germany is counting on tens of thousands of protectors fleeing Turkey to Germany.
In the medium term, it could even be "a few hundred thousand", believes the association chairman, Ali Toprak.
Due to the hard action of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass exodus to Germany.
"In the short term, I reckon with tens of thousands, with a few hundred thousand protectors from Turkey in Germany in the medium term, when the Erdogan regime continues to fight minorities and democratic opposition," says association chairman Ali Toprak of the "world" of Friday.
Because the government had already overrun Kurdish strongholds with punitive actions months ago, 500,000 Kurds within Turkey are on their way.
After the sworn coup, secular and opposition ethnic Turks were still in addition.
Many will want to start new in Europe if they are further oppressed in Turkey.
"It cannot be that a state that even takes up refugees produces refugees in their own country," Toprak said.
The association chief lamented the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in Alevilian towns.
In doing so, Erdogan wants to increase exit pressure on the remaining Kurds.
"They are the last large minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been eradicated or displaced over the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also CDU member.
The association chief called for the federal government to be "as sharp as Austria against Erdogan and its supporters."
In Germany, too, a "witch hunt" is taking place against Erdogan critics.
I don't feel safe in Germany for the first time in recent months.
The German branch of the G端len movement also fears the exodus of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and opposition activists.
The brand mark as G端len trailer annihilates teachers and other academics.
"Anyone who doesn't suit and praises Erdogan is sitting on packed caffeine, by the way, the kemalists and seculars," said Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the G端len-based foundation Dialogue and Education, the "world."
As the newspaper reports, citing figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Turks made the largest group of asylum seekers recognised for political persecution in Germany before the coup.
On June 30, 30, this was 11,386 people, and thus almost 29 percent of all recognised applicants (39,625).
This survey does not find the benefits of war, poverty or lack of prospects.
According to the Basic Law, asylum rights are exclusively political, i.e. from the state side.
