What the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming
Former German swimmer Markus Deibler has commented on the disappointing cut of the DSV team at Olympis via Facebook.
In December 2014, he first picked gold at the short-haul world championships in Doha, putting his first world record at the same time.
Now, former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has put himself in front of Facebook in front of his ex-team-mates.
"In a country where an Olympic winner gets 20,000 €premium and a jungle king €150,000, no one should be surprised at missing medals," the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday.
The support system in swimming is bad, but the doping controls are very good.
In this way, we cannot compete with countries that promote very much and do not look so closely at doping or even run it.
"I am not saying that the controls should be stopped here," he continued.
If he had a comeback, Deibler would have to be notified nine months before his first start of the National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA).
That is exactly how we should keep it with countries.
"Anyone who cannot be controlled for a period of time before WM / OS by independent controllers of WADA / FINA cannot take part," asks the election hamburger, who now runs an ice cream division.
