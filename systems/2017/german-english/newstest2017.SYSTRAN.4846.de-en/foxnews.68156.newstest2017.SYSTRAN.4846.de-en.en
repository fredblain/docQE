Reid says Clinton will stay at Garland in case of electoral victory at Garland
Harry Reid, leader of Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland's confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
Majority leader in Senate Mitch McConnell believes the next president will appoint the successor to the late judge, Antonin Scalia.
Reid said Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects Clinton to select Garland "with a certain degree of certainty."
A Reid spokeswoman later said he had not yet spoken to Clinton whether she would nominate Garland and he speculated.
He praised Garland, saying Clinton's team would not care for unrest with a new candidate.
Garland is the top judge for the U.S. Appellation Court for the District of Columbia.
Raid said Republicans blocked Garland's nomination, be lacklustre and helpers of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also noted that Donald Trump is unfit for the presidential race.
