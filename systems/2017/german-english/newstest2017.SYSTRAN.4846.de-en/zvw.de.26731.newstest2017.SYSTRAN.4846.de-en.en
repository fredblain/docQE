Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee officer
Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organizing.
She is also a social worker on the ground.
Since July, Annika Deuschle has been the refugee officer for Urbach.
The social pedagogist supports the management team of Achim Grockenberger.
It sees itself as a contact for all actors: refugees, refugee aid, administration, authorities and anyone else.
Regine customer from the working circle suggests that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the egg legend Wollmilfsau, which has a problem above all else.
Thus, some - rather than the number of tasks required - had intended to be targeted when the administration wanted to tender.
An administrative specialist with a talent for languages and people, coupled with years of experience in the field of social work, has just been joined by an egg legend Wollmilfsau.
But administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deuschle.
Above all, it is about organizing, working with people on the ground, and also behind the scenes and networking activity.
The 31-year-old has been there for around six weeks.
It has limited a 50 percent job to three years.
"It was high time," Regine customer says, adding that Annika Deuschle supports honor and key players.
There are big and small problems, organisational, human and understanding problems.
Soon new containers will be in the Wasenstraße
A serious problem has been for some time to find housing for the connecting refugees who have been recognised.
Local authorities are responsible for the accommodation.
They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented rooms.
The costs for the construction, rent or renovation of these accommodations must be borne by municipalities themselves.
The responsibility changes from the Land Council to the Commune and Jobcentre.
Problem: There are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been shaping up as very difficult for some time.
In fact, the administration does not find private homes.
It does not work so far, it is reliant on private housing, said Deuschle.
Therefore, community housing must be humiliated, as is so beautiful.
So soon new containers will be set up in the Wasenstraße.
But only apartments are not done.
The perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to a firm stay, there are internships, training places, school places, one-euro jobs and help for refugees and migrants who need to be fired or set up.
"More places would be good," Regine customer reported.
Many work in the Bauhof or help house masters, do nonprofit work - and that's motivated and very decent, as Annika Deuschle reports.
It hopes that work for the community will lead to positive visibility.
This is "no employment therapy."
But activity does not mean work.
The day needs a firm structure, say Deuschle and customer.
People would have to develop a sense of belonging.
So it needs offers like sports, contacts with locals and above all language courses.
Professional courses are rar.
So here too, administration and volunteers jump.
It is central that the refugees feel that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.
The long duration of the procedures is a problem.
They must explain to the refugees that it is just taking place and that they can make good use of the time, for example with language courses.
Anyone who eventually develops the feeling that he could not help anyone in Urbach cannot work and is pointless, never integrate.
The clear majority is motivated.
But there are also problems, says customers honestly, "people where nothing goes", the work of Deuschle and customers is always to motivate others.
All this is already a "mammoth task."
A difficult question: Do the two fear radicalisation after recent incidents, even in a small community like Urbach?
"No," Regine customer says quite clearly, "which some might call naïve," a residual risk, but does not want to exclude it.
But the helpers are already aware.
These incidents are also subject to the refugees.
They would fear that the assassins will bring them into disrepute.
"They want to show that they have nothing to do with that," Regine customer says.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
So, major and volunteer volunteers must look for activities on the ground and in the region.
They always have the background that a new bumper to refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.
Does Germany need a cap?
To answer this question clearly is the policy.
It is actually unfair to put them on the ground.
"In Urbach we have not yet arrived where we want," says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would relax the situation.
Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbachers are already busy integrating the past people.
There are currently around 100 people, mostly young men.
But if people are in need, they need to help them, both women agree.
The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.
