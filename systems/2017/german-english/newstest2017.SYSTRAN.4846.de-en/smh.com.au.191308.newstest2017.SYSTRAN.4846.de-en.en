Future of Portland's melting plant questionable due to lifting energy contract
The future of Portland's aluminum melting in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs from workers - is at stake as the plant operator announces the energy supply contract and thus will lift all supply contracts as the energy company supplied.
The move followed the government's decision in Victoria earlier this year not to grant further subsidies to operate the facility.
A subsidy set for 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2000 jobs at Alco's facility in Portland are at stake.
No fewer than 2,000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk when closing.
In addition, domino effects could come as the melting plant consumes around 10 percent of Victoria's total electricity generation.
In 2014 Alcoa closed Point Henry Smelzerei, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alco's melting plant in Portland is losing money and risks closure.
This move follows years of speculation regarding the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the price of electricity for the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminum melting plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it expects three more owners to cancel their contracts.
The plant is owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
"AGL expects the plant to continue operating in Portland, which will mean further physical demand for electricity through melting," the company said.
AGL also said the contracts were so-called "backup operations," which should have come into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period so they will end in 2017.
"That is why AGL expects the contracts to contribute to revenues in fiscal year 17," the electricity supplier said.
All potential impacts on the revenues on AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by forecasts of strong wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it had already written off the value of the contracts in its annual instalment of $187 million in "anticipation of termination."
Alcoa said the decision to book the contracts does not affect the "Alcoa's ability... to operate the melting plant or to ensure the power supply to the melting plant."
The U.S. company said it had completed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which should have come into effect from November this year, even though there is still an explanation why it resigned from the contract.
Analysts warn of the industry's poor economic circumstances ahead of the possible closure of Portland melzerei in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.
In reference to the analysts' statements earlier in the week, head of operations Stephen Mikkelsen said Portland consumed around 600 megawatts of electricity and Tomago around 900 megawatts of electricity annually.
If both plants disappear from the market, that would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [electricity market].
And for us as a generator, that would not be good," he said.
