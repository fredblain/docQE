QueensFerry Crossing: Bridge now linked to Fife
The £1.35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have linked the QueensFerry Crossing's north deck with the viaduct - meaning the bridge is now linked to Fife.
It is the first of four closures of the "deck blowers" approaching each of the three towers of the bridge.
Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
He has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 slush haste.
The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown took a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in building the QueensFerry Crossings.
We are all witnesses to an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with over 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit.
Overall, almost 79% of the entire bridge decks are in their place and the last section of the deck gets a concrete cast for the deck in Rosyth today, meaning the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge.
Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "The first closure represents a significant milestone in each bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the closure of high- and low-cost construction is the result.
After the installation of the last road deck and its connection with the north tower deck, we then had to close the remaining gap on the north or land side.
This was reached 700 millimetres south by dragging the northern train bridge.
This was a massive and very delicate activity.
As the viaduct is 222 metres long, it weighs around 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled up at a climb of about 3%.
Heirs, because the tolerances the team worked on were tiny - on each side they only scored a few millimetres.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
