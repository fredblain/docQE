Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket, which brings him 3,000ten win
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000ten British win at Newmarket on Friday.
He set a milestone on Predilection, trained by John Gosden, on his local circuit with his second win of the night.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in the flat race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
Three-time winner Dettori, who won on Ghayar before, said: "It's something special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here too
I'm very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday evening with 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very modest.
Dettori takes the jubilee as he picks up victory on Predilection
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in the impeachment race - jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who reached more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the ninth-straight Derby winner, had 4,493 career victories
Frankie is one of the best jockey of modernity and it's no surprise he reached this milestone that few have reached before him.
He has style and is strong, but it's his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for races, his enthusiasm and charisma have been enthralling fans for years for this sport.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he had already picked up 6,000 wins if he were not just a weekend and grand tournament jockey!
Frankie has already scored nearly 30 years of winners in GB, which is great.
He has a living personality, which is good for a British race, but beyond that he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Discus
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the hub of Britain's flat race for two decades.
It was nerve-wracking.
A whole series of big-tournament wins, including his famous "glorious seven" in 1996 at Ascot, but he also survived an airplane crash and received a drug ban.
Three years ago, he initially had trouble when he returned from his six-month lock, but showed an impressive characteristic strength to trot out his doubters and return to his best form.
And he is far from at the end - Dettori once said he wants to continue in competitions up to his at least 50.00 life.
