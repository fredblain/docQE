Jennifer Aniston: I always get stuck in drawers
Jennifer Aniston doesn't always have to be perfect or successful.
The Hollywood star has now made that clear in an interview.
"I am always stuck in drawers or glued from outside labels, which have little to do with me and reality."
"I myself don't have the desire to always be perfect and successful."
"Frankly, these things are more snuff me."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh at her being considered "Miss Perfect" as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan."
Most importantly, the actress spends her time at home, front television with loose dutt and Mexican food, says the magazine.
To the white glut, they raise the question of child desire: "We women don't have to be married or have children to be perfect," the Hollywood star said.
In her new film, "Mother's Day - love is not a childhood play," Aniston is seen as a single mother of two sons.
The film will run with us from August 25.
