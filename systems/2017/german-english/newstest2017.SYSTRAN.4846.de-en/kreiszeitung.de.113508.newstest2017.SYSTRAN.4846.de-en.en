Cats react more sensitive than katers to cries of the young
Biologists have studied in Hanover the effect of rowing cat babies on adult animals.
To their surprise, the males also did not leave the males cold - however, unlike the females, they always behaved the same way.
Female cats can detect the excitement of cat babies at the mouth of the little ones.
They respond by ten percent more quickly to loudness of kittens who are in great distress, as scientists have found out from the veterinary university and medical university Hanover (MHH).
Katers are also responding to kittens' calls - but always the same.
"Apparently, the acoustic differences between seeing less and heavily excited young animals are either not perceptible or not significant for the males," said biologist Wiebke Konerding of MHH.
She is first author of the study, published this Friday in the specialist magazine "BMC Evolutionary Biology."
In a previous investigation, the team of researchers had already found out that the duration and pitch of kittens' cries was different to the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine adult katers and eight female MHH animals were observed.
They were played on the one hand by little ones, who were taken out of the box for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings.
Secondly, they were confronted with cries of more excited kittens, who were additionally raised.
Researchers believe their results, despite the low sample, to be meaningful.
"All females, even those who had not yet had their own offspring, responded differently to the cries," Konerding said.
They turned faster to the speaker when this rowing of the very angry kittens played off.
This ability may be innate or develop with gender maturity.
"A surprise was that the males responded at all," the biologist said.
In the past, scientists have already examined the reactions of women and men to baby noises several times in the past.
Also, some studies showed that women responded more sensitively to babies, whether they were already mothers or not, reported biologist Marina Scheumann.
