Trump does not see the looming defeat defeat as close
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a campaign event in Florida.
If there is nothing wrong with the election to the US President, Donald Trump has an alternative idea.
He then goes on holiday.
If Donald Trump hits the U.S. presidential election in November, it would be relatively no matter: "Ultimately, it will either fold, or I have a very, very nice, long vacation," the Republican candidate said in a telephone interview with U.S. television broadcaster CNBC.
If there is not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that's fine, Trump said.
So he beat U.S. President Barack Obama and Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton as founder of the Islamic State (IS) terror militia.
There was more and more resistance within his party.
