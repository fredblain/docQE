Military leadership falsifies ISIS intelligence information, congresses committee
United States Central Command military personnel altered intelligence information to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than it would have allowed actual state conditions on the ground, a congressional committee of inquiry reported in a report on Thursday.
The preliminary report, drawn up by a task force of Republican members of the Board of Conflict, Intelligence Committee and Wehrbudgetkommite, reported great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts, who reported how superiors changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.
Central Command, briefly Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Intelligence information, typically notorious by senior Centcom commanders, regularly drew a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism than it had allowed actual conditions on the ground and was consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence services," a newspaper article quoted the report as saying.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, a Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The leadership errors in Centcom range up to the top top of the organisation.
The ten-page report detailed persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.
Although it does not provide direct indications that government peaks under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts face pressure from their prerogatives to draw a more optimistic picture of the Islamic State threat, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, opinions and statements in front of Congress were significantly more positive than it did the facts," the report noted.
For example, a Centcom affiliate publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mossul, Iraq's second largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, it's so clear," Mike Pompeo, Republican congressman from Kansas, said in an opinion statement.
From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, Central Command leaders changed intelligence reports to downplay the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq.
Republicans called the task force into life after they were told that analysts were worried about manipulation of reports on Islamic State.
The report, published on Thursday, will be completed by more detailed findings while investigations will continue.
In addition, further investigations of Centcom reports are under way by the inspector general of the Ministry of Defence.
Democratic members of the intelligence committee released their own findings on Thursday, agreeing with some of the Republican task force conclusions.
"In 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly limited process for creating intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," the highest-ranking Democrat in the committee, a member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, announced in an opinion statement.
That process, Mr. Schiff said, "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," damaging morale among analysts and "gave overly little room for divergent opinions."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said there was no indication of an intervention by the White House at Centcom analysts regarding a "certain political opinion."
The preliminary results of the congressional investigations were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."
Last August, the New York Times reported from investigations by the Pentagon's inspector general, who received complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon press spokesman, said in an opinion statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on Congress while the inspection's investigations were still underway.
But he also admitted that "experts sometimes have divergent opinions regarding interpreting complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense."
The investigations have repercussions on the issue of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim that has now been made by a growing number of Defense Ministry members).
Last year's accusations, however, raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
Criticism about secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of interceptions of more than ten years ago, when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document about how the then government under George W. Bush faced only a small crew force in Iraq, and little time to worry about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against current coverage of the Islamic State.
Last year, the team for Mr. Hooker, according to government officials, notes that, contrary to government statements, air strikes against the Islamic State-held refineries would not have any significant impact on the financial position of the terrorist group, as these provisional refineries would have been put into operation to sell oil on the black market.
However, this finding was not published, the Times reported in September.
Centcom's damning commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the Legislature for his overly positive assessment of the state of war at a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at Central Command.
