Mahaj Brown, 6, "cleared of bullets," survives shooting in Philadelphia
Police say the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week, the second time a 6-year-old child is being shot.
The boys' grandparents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents said Brown suffered several shooting injuries including in the end, leg, arm and belly, but that he was in hospital when he was transported.
"He has gone through a lot, his small body has been cleared of bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez told the broadcaster.
I just can't believe that.
The condition of the boy was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several surgeries.
The boys' family told the broadcaster he expected to be regendered.
He should have started first class at a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in German town.
Three men were also shot: two aged 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The boy was found lying up on the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old, who is in a critical condition, reported the broadcaster.
The other two victims were not in the car and police were just determining whether to find themselves among one of the injured men of the offender.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it apparently came to a crossfire between several shooters.
Cartridge sleeves for storm rifles, traced to various storm rifles, oversailed the Tatort.
It seems that this is clearly an ongoing battle.
On the road, on both sides of the walk, hung hulls.
So there appear to have been several armed fighters here who were very actively involved," police haul pman Anthony Ginaldi told the broadcaster in Philadelphia.
Several houses and vehicles have also been hit in the area.
No arrests have occurred and police are currently investigating the surveillance video.
On Tuesday, another 6-year-old girl was hit by a cross blaze at the arm as she played in front of her home in the residential area of West Oak Lane.
She is recovering and police are still searching for a suspect.
