Three men have "lucky yet to be alive" after being thrown from their fishing boat in front of Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station hit the alarm at 13:20 BST on Friday after a crew watched the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulty swimming in safety while their boat moved on on their own.
"We saw how the boat turned around in its vicinity and turned us off the worst," said the head of Moelfre Vince Jones rescue station.
"Fortunately, the strong winds have already gotten the boat apart from their reach until we left to water," he added.
Two of the men were rescued from a local fishing boat, while the third man at the age of 60 was exhausted and found at a boje hanging without a rescue jacket.
They all arrived aboard the shore rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
Mr Jones said: "The three men thrown into the water are lucky and still alive.
The bootengine had an emergency stopover, but it was loosing the boat from the person who controlled the boat.
Someone woke up about these men today.
