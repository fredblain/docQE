Adblock Plus, Facebook in "cat-and-mouse game" regarding ad blocking
For companies that make money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers, attempts to bypass ad blocking are equal to a "cat and mouse game."
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block ad blocking on its desktop page, Adblock Plus released a blogpost saying users could update their filters in the program to again block advertising on the social network.
On Tuesday, Facebook informed that its desktop site would change the coding regarding its advertisements to make it more difficult to detect display blockages, which is part of the page advertising.
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.
In a blogpost, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of hin-and-her struggle between the ad-blocking open source community and the bypasses has been in progress since the invention of scoreboards," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of how worrying ad blockers have become for the industry.
Worldwide, according to a study last year by Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people use display blockers; almost four times as much in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile phone advertising accounts for 84 percent of advertising revenue.
The company has put it on display blockers on desktop pcs, as mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a spokesman said.
Advertising on Desktop pcs accounts for a sufficient amount of revenue, so Facebook seems to be rewarding the investment of such a step.
On Tuesday, Facebook informed that it would update its "ad preferences tool" to have more control over its advertising.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that adblocking new filters would be worrying because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising.
"It is not a positive experience for users, so we plan to address the problem," a Facebook spokesman said in an email message.
Ad blockers are a blunt means, so we focus instead on developing tools like Ad Preferences to put more control into people's hands.
