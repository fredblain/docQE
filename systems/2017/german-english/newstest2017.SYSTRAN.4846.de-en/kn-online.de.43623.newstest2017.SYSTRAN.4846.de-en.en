Steel - Light view for German steel industry
The crisis-battered and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared extra costs of millions.
Financial burdens threatening the industry from the extraction of electricity are off the table.
It maintains the exemption from the renewable energy levy at the plants for so-called own-electricity production in the German steel industry, said Federal Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday issue).
"I am really glad that we could finally achieve that after two years of negotiations."
The European Commission had therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers, who use gases from the high furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption, to pay their cash.
The steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros a year, according to the German industry association.
Gabriel told the WAZ there is now a fundamental agreement with the European Commission after talks with competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators are replaced in the steel plants will an EEG surcharge of 20 percent be applied.
But this is also not being collected in the steel industry.
IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the EU Commission for the production of own electricity.
Thus, the status quo of the current arrangement is largely laid down.
The successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry are particularly important.
"In terms of our steel campaign, it is a first step."
"Others must follow."
"Even in the reform of the emission trading trade, climate and employment objectives must be weighed," said IG Metall chief executive JÃ¶rg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
The steel industry in Europe has suffered overcapacity and significant price pressure since the 2008 financial crisis.
Last year, the situation intensified as the world's largest producer country threw bulk steel onto the world market in light of the weakening domestic demand.
European manufacturers are dumping price dumping on Chinese steel companies.
In the course of this spring, the situation has been somewhat relaxed.
On the one hand, import duties on imported steel have been shown to have an effect, while the economic outlook in China has been suspended.
What is unclear is how sustainable the price recovery is.
German industry primus Wilhelm Krupp remained cautious on Thursday.
Finally, prices would have stagnated again.
The industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
In the last analysis, Thyssenkrupp did not want to exclude closures of individual works.
In the German steel industry, around 86,000 people were employed at the end of 2015.
In July, the German steel manufacturers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.
They produced 3.4 million tons of good six percent less crude steel than the same month last year, according to the economics association Stahl on Friday.
After a brief increase in May, the manufactured crowd went back for the second month.
Since the beginning of the year, production has been two percent lower than last year.
In the coming months, the association expects an improved order of orders with increasing output.
