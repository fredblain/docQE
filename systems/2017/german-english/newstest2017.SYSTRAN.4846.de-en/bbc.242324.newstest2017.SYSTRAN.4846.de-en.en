Assistant doctors strike: demands for new workplace action
Assistant doctors have called on their union to approve new labor-fighting measures in their disputes regarding a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called on its entire council to approve more labor combat measures from early September.
The JDC said that ministers had failed to address concerns about the contract.
Assistant doctors and medical students voted in July to reject a contract agreed with the BMA.
He was rejected by 58% of his members who voted in the election.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday evening, JDC chairman Ellen McCourt said the government had "persistently calm" to problems, resulting in the contract being rejected.
She said: "In view of this, the JDC Board voted to completely reject the proposed new contract and request official renegotiation to all your concerns."
In response to the government's silence, the JDC board today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA council to approve an ongoing program of escalating labor-fighting measures that begins in early September.
The disputes caused assistant doctors to strike six times this year, the first total outages in the history of the NHS.
BMA assistant doctor Dr Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject agreed contract conditions recommended by the BMA.
He told BMA members during the meetings held before the vote by 54,000 assistant doctors and medical students that the contract was advantageous and should be approved.
After the vote, the Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be imposed on doctors in England.
