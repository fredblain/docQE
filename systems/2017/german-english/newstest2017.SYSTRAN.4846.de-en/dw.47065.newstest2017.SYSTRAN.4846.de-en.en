Donald Trump admits ″ huge problems ″ in election campaign
The leadership of the U.S. Republicans is plagued by massive concerns, even in traditionally conservative states.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump has now admitted weaknesses of his election campaign in the Republican stronghold of Utah.
A rare moment when the normally big-spurned and self-reliant multi-millionaire expressed something like concerns, correspondents reported.
After throwing 16 rivals inside the Republican camp, doubts are now growing about his success in the battle for the White House.
"We have huge problems in Utah," Trump said of evangelical Christians, who he asked for support in key states such as Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
Guilt was false reports of his candidature, he resumed his well-known media blaze.
Republican strongholds wacky
Utah is usually a safe bank for Republicans.
According to a June poll by SurveyUSA, Trump and his rival, Hillary Clinton, were equal.
Other institutes see Trump ahead, though not with the distance that is common for Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also considered endangered.
In an interview by CNBC sen. Trump, Trump responded to how he wanted to stop Clinton's advance: "Just as I have done so far."
And shouting back: This will "either succeed, or I'll make a very nice, long holiday."
He does nothing else than "tell the truth."
If there is not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that's fine, Trump continued.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the party is supposed to have threatened Trump to cancel funds to support his campaign, should he not be able to present better poll values.
Instead, the Republicans' candidates want to get more under-represented.
