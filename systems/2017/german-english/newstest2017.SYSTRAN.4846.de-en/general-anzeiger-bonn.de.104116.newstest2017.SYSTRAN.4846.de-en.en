Volkswagen is still glimpsed.
Despite diesel scandal, delivery numbers are rising worldwide.
But it is not in all markets.
There is a spinal cord in the recall campaign.
Volkswagen will start deliveries more cautiously in the second half of the year.
In spite of the diesel affair, Europe's largest car manufacturer can continue to show a plus in the past year despite its many brands and some well-run markets.
But in July, the core brand VW weakened mainly in Western Europe, thereby restarting the overall sale, as indicated by the Dax company.
Worldwide, the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer cars in July with 449100 cars than the same month last year.
In Western Europe alone, after China the second most important market, sales were 14 percent lower than last year.
In the home market Germany, deliveries sacked by almost a sixth.
Brand sales chief JÃ¼rgen Stackmann led the weaker figures from July mainly to two sales days less in Europe.
In addition, in some core markets, there has been a reluctance to buy in some core markets.
In addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey, the British vote to leave the EU has also burdened, a spokeswoman said.
In the USA, where the exhaust gas affair escalated first, a minus is also continuing.
The big support for VW is the Chinese market.
Overall, the mainly affected house brand of the Lower Saxony is already continuing to glimpse through the diesel scandal: after the first seven months, only a 0.9 percent extradition minus is to 3.37 million vehicles.
Group sales chief Fred Kappler continued to present a sales plus from January to July.
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles during that time, worldwide 5.904 million.
Volkswagen had manipulated exhaust tests using a software.
In Germany alone, VW calls around 2.5 million cars for conversion into workshops.
In the course of the conversion, VW reiterated that the conversion of the cars has no negative impact.
After the conversion of the vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance.
The car manufacturer will provide a "guarantee equal" certificate to the customer after the conversion, but does not speak of a "guarantee," as it said on Friday in corporate circles.
The reason is legal.
The "Focus" reported that Volkswagen is now giving its German customers a guarantee of upgraded diesel models.
This would have been confirmed last Monday by VW representatives in the Federal Transportation Department.
The Ministry of Transport confirmed that there was this meeting.
"VW has full compliance with the requirements of my commission of inquiry and the KBA."
"Variations of this are not accepted," Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) said, according to the ministry.
VW has accepted the guarantee that fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance will not take place after the conversion, and all type-approval-relevant vehicle values will be unchanged.
Volkswagen itself does not use the term "guarantee" as it was in corporate circles.
In the broad term "guarantee," Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers might come to a workshop for example half a year after the conversion, and could return this to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
It is also important in the interests of the customer to avoid that any other damage that has nothing whatsoever to do with the exhaust scandal will result in uncertainty regarding possible warranty schemes as it was called.
That is why VW does not use the term "guarantee".
