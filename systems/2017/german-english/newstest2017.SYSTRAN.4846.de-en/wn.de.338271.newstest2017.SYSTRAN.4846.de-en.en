Better traffic flow on the motorway
It regularly stands on the bypass - here a picture of November.
But that is to change: legal remedies should be extended.
This is good news for all car drivers who stand in congestion on the local road every evening when they drive over the highway (A 43).
On Tuesday and Wednesday (16/17 August), the land operation of road construction will extend the legal remedies of 700 metres in the area between Hammer Strasse and Weseler Strasse.
Motorists can then right from Hammer Strasse right.
The great advantage: the traffic will be shared early, thus improving the total on the much-vaunted section of Bundesstrasse 51.
The idea with the extended exit was the CDU group in the district of Münster-West.
The road congestion on the train operator nervets motorists between 17 and 7 p.m.
On weekdays, the backlog reaches back to the bridge over the Albersloher route and sometimes beyond.
The reason is the Nadelöhr on the B 51 just before the exit Weseler Strasse.
From here, traffic is only steeped in traffic over the motorway bridge.
The second track had to be rebuilt well over three quarters of a century ago.
The reason: Static calculations have shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary power to take two-lanes in particular.
For how long this bottleneck and the associated daily congestion will persist, the relevant national farm cannot say.
However, years can be expected: because the bridge has an official residual period of validity until 2034.
For the extension of legal remedies, the farm has deliberately chosen the less-trafficked time in the school holidays, because of disability.
Traffic will be carried past the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday.
