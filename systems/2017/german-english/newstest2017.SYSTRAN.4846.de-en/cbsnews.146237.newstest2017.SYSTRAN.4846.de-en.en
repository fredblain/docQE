Police: 3 victims shot in serial murderer case while listening to music
According to police reports released Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot dead in one of the deadliest attacks for a decade in the first serial murderer case of Phoenix while they were in the car and listened to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on June 12 while the car was parked in a driveway, authorities said.
The offender fired eight shots from a handfire weapon while standing on the front passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, according to the report.
Police indicated that the triple murder did not appear to have been the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 that was in possession of one of the adult victims.
Phoenix Sgt police spokesman Jonathan Howard said the shooting led investigators to take a closer look at whether it is linked to four previous attacks.
In total, seven people have been killed and two others injured in nine attacks in Hispanic residential areas within four months.
"It happens in a residential area in front of a house," Howard told KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, earlier this month.
It is believed the suspect has used several vehicles, including a brown Nissans from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators refused to reveal the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and were committed by the same murderer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalised due to her injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis daughter Maleah still died on the ground.
A witness told police that it was not unusual for her to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
Authorities also released a police report on the shooting, aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder, saying it was the work of the serial murderer.
Investigators found cartridge lizards and secured a bullet from the seat as well as bullet fragments from the engine room.
