Ms. in suspected suicide on Swiss highway
The victim was lying in the middle of the night on the highway.
Police are calling witnesses after a woman was caught driving on a highway in the early hours of Thursday in a suspected suicide of several vehicles.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.
A woman put himself in the dark "in an act of desperation" and was hit by several cars, police said in Vaud.
It is clear that a Swiss woman aged 49, who was driven by several vehicles, including a lorry, himself wanted to kill himself.
She still died on the ground.
Several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, said police, calling on them as well as any witnesses to the incident to sign up.
An investigation has been opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter told the Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown.
Was a collision avoidable?
This is something the prosecutor must decide," Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases over the past five years show drivers are not being held accountable.
In each of the two cases - where a person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that motorists would not have to expect a pedestrian to run on the highway in the middle of the night, according to the newspaper.
Last year, a police officer was acquitted of negligent killing after driving and killing a man who was on the A1 near Payerne in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and has become unconscious on the street, the court noted.
The court found that the policeman — who responded to an emergency call — drove in a justified manner and that the presence of a man on the street was a "completely extraordinary and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone who has further information on Thursday's incident near Morges should contact the police at number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
