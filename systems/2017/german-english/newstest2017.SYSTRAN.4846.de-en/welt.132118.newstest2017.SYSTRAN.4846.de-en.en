Data cloud: So perfide blackmail hackers their solace
Programmers of blackmail malware currently target companies - and are successful.
According to a recent survey by malware defences specialists Malabytes among 540 companies in North America, Britain and Germany, 40 percent of companies surveyed in the past 12 months were at least once, sometimes multiple victims of an attack with blackmail software.
In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already once target of ransomware blackmail.
Forty per cent of victims willingly paid the lifeline demanded by the perpetrators to reuse the systems and data they had collected.
According to the observations of Malware bytes, the perpetrators specialize in attacks in corporate networks, according to the observations of Malware bytes.
If they are successful there, the potential to blackmail is significantly higher than for private users.
"We are currently seeing a terrifying rapid evolution of malware," MalaBytes chief Marcin Kleczynski said in conversation with the "world."
In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send advertising.
Then the perpetrators discovered extortion software for themselves.
Only private users were the target, but the shift towards corporate attacks has been terrifying quickly in recent months.
Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once active on a victim's computer, she specifically search for recently modified files such as Word, Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the Ransomware and permanently erase the originals.
The software then presents the demands of the blackmailers.
To get the final key code to the files, victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of cryptocurrency bitcoin.
But where the personal photo database is at stake for private users, companies are about sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production remains silent.
Accordingly, the damage falls when a ransomware strikes.
22 percent of the German companies affected reported loss of sales by Ransomware, 13 percent even had to break down business completely, in one case people were in danger of life.
In Germany, hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of health care.
"We always say to the victims: don't pay, it only promotes the problem," Kleczynski explained.
But 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay get their data again.
It is difficult for managers to reject the perpetrators' demands in the face of stalemate in operation.
The hackers, in turn, know that and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a recent study, F-Secure security researchers examined user interfaces and contact with blackmailers and come to the conclusion: perpetrators actually try to build a kind of customer service to take more money.
They explain their victims via chat as they can pay via Bitcoin, target freely accessible support websites or decrypt sample files.
And if private people are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros, companies will have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data back unencrypted.
Given the potentially high and relatively risky profits from ransomware blackmail, the hackers become increasingly professional and share the work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski of antivirus provider Sophos: "A single person can write a ransomware circa within a week."
It is more likely, however, that they are three or four people.
The programmers then sell their software to the actual blackmailers in the form of a software building.
The previous malware kits emerged by buying the malware itself, advice and additional tools for a one-time, fixed price between $1,000 and $10,000.
"Included in the scope of delivery is an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.
The blackmailers then look for other hackers to spread the freshly bought software among the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So you log into one of the forums in the underground, buy the set from a criminal and instruct another to install the software on as many pcs as possible.
Payment is made per infected computer.
"Usually the criminals then instruct spammers with the spread," Wisniewski explained.
The risk of Ransomware is now known to many companies that better secure their data.
More than 50 percent of corporate IT executives in the Malware poll trust to be able to repay Ransomware using file back-ups and scanner software.
Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.
"If encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful essay, the perpetrators are instead threatening to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explained MalaBytes chief Marcin Kleczynski.
This means that, depending on the type of data, the damage potential is much higher than before.
In the future, the perpetrators could also take completely new goals on the Internet of Things.
At the Defcon hacker conference, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the internet under their control.
In the middle of winter, the free movement of such a blocked heating could well be worth a solvent.
If the perpetrators then block an entire manufacturing road in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become an issue in industry 4.0.
