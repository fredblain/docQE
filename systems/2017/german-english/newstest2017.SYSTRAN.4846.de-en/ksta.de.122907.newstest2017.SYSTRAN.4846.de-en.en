The right-wing "Identitarian movement" has come under fire from the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection.
According to several local offices, the constitutional protectors in the federal government also put the group under observation.
"We see in the Identitarian movement evidence of aspirations against the liberal democratic order," said constitutional protection chief Hans-Georg Maaßen of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
So immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are being defamed in extremist ways.
That's why we are now watching the movement.
The Identitarian movement is a grouping with French roots, which has also been active in Germany since 2012.
It opposes "multicultural crackdowns," "uncontrolled mass immigration" and the "loss of one's own identity through strangers."
Constitutional protectors in nine federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hesse, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - are already watching the "identitaries."
Maaßen said his authority had aligned itself closely with the local offices during the decision.
"Groups like the Identitarian movement are trying to pick up their target group where it stands," the constitutional protection chief said.
Generally, extremists try to address them with youth-appropriate language, often with poppy music.
Islamists like right-wing extremists do that.
It's not a beguiling advertisement for your own thing.
Propaganda is supposed to address people emotionally.
Young people are particularly vulnerable here.
It is dangerous.
Finally, there had been reports from several federal states of contacts of "identitaries" with AfD politicians.
Maaßen said he had no findings on that.
For constitutional protection, possible contacts of this nature are only relevant from a certain point of view.
It is important for the respective party - in this case the AfD - to change its target and become so extremist by certain individuals who are extremist.
The decisive factor is whether such individuals have control over the party.
This is not apparent.
In view of the significant increase in right-wing crime and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelters, Maaßen said he would not yet speak of new right-wing terrorism in this context.
But we have noted in recent years that there can be legal terrorist structures.
There was the Old School Society group or the Freitaler Group.
It may well be that other right-wing terrorist groups or micro groups are forming, the attacks against asylum seekers, refugee homeowners or attacks from other right-wing extremist motives.
However, Germany-wide or Europe-wide control of legal terrorism is not apparent.
The previous groups have emerged at regional level or on social networks.
Maaßen expressed concern that many assaults went to the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right scene.
That's the worrying thing.
Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum shelters were previously not known as criminals, politically motivated offenders or supporters of the right scene.
"So many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists, who were perhaps politically indifferent, or, for example, CDU, SPD or left, who then radicalised themselves by right-wing extremist sentiment."
