French court rejects bid to demolition of shops in Jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected a bid by authorities in Calais to settle dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.
At a court hearing this week, the authorities argued in Calais that the state should be empowered to put down 72 provisional shops where people inside the warehouse sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or sell simple meals for a few euros at provisional restaurants.
The Calais prefecture argued that these places should be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would pose a fire and sanitation risk.
Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important because free meals offered by the state-backed association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They also said the provisional shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for expelling people who operate the 72 provisional shops but acknowledged that the concerns of the Calais prefecture were "absolutely understandable."
Judge Jean-François Molla said the grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than simply feeding people who "live in extremely precarious conditions."
He said the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the downfall was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the Camp, which operates in a nonsense and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed the petition to keep the Kids' cafe.
In a letter to the Guardian, it said the closure "would be a disaster for these children, of which the youngest eight years old."
The Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants aid agencies estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp has risen to over 9,000 people - the highest number so far - after a steep increase in newcomers over the summer.
