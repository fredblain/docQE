Scotland's Callum Skinner crashes home as Britons rush gold for cycling
Scotland's Callum Skinner raced to fame last night in the men's team sprint in Rio, when the British team defended the London 2012 title.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took on the anchor role his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made himself, making the legend proud when he stormed home to take a victory from the favourites New Zealand.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy took the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
They repeated the trick after taking only a modest sixth place in March at the London World Championships despite Hoy's resignation.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.
They did so in time as Hindes.
Hoy's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man they stayed at when they saw potential in the Scots, which has now unfolded.
Hindes, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
Hindes narrowly resigned after his round, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner kept it.
A change of strategy made a big part of the transformation, where Hindes drove in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and, above all, Skinner to keep the pace.
Hoy looked out of his position as a BBC expert and dropped Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they rose to the podium.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said: "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make me a name.
We set up an Olympic record in the final, defeating the world champions.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win.
After the 2012 triumph at Kenny's and Hoy's side, Hindes admitted he deliberately fell onto the railroad after a weak start.
He later withdrew that statement and there was no objection from England's rivals.
In such a surprising victory, there was no such problem this time around.
Hindes said: "It feels like the whole GB flags in the gallery like London."
We have come together as a team over the last three months.
We have gone so badly on so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, winning seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.
If that's a barometer of our progress over the last five months, that expect us successful five days in the velodrom.
With Kenny's form, it is in the realm of possible that he repeats Hoy's win of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.
That would mean for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23rd (a seemingly cursory date for British sport; that day was also born Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.
That would be the same as Hoy.
Kenny takes part next in the sprint, which begins today and will go over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I just enjoy this for the moment."
The team event is always best.
You can win it with his colleagues.
It feels a bit lonely to win alone.
Hindes said: "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knights."
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there was further good news for England.
Sir Braiz Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the fourth-four-kilometre race.
They came in at 3:51,942.
The world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was at 3:51,659.
The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will certainly be in focus.
He had contested himself yesterday with representatives before the qualification, when he called on him to measure his body size.
In the respective women's competition, which will continue tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie, in world record time, will be in 4:13,260.
The GB team relies on its strong rail team to dominate the middle period of the Olympics and pick up a shar of medals.
After a truly extraordinary display of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio were down.
Dramas played out in the background, the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid sexism and bullying allegations as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, if you look at the first evening of the competition in the velodrom, it looks like GB's now legendary reputation, which reached its peak at the perfect moment, will be repeated.
