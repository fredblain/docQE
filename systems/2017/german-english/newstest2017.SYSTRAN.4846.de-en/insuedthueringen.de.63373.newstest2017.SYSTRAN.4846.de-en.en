Soprano Anna Netrebko openly walks with the autism of her son Tiago - and turns to other affected parents: "You must have the courage to talk about it."
"Medicine has made great progress," said the 44-year-old Italian newspaper "Corriere della Sera."
When the disease was detected by her son, she believed she had to die.
The now eight-year-old Tiago, however, has come forward well and now runs private in New York, where there are the best therapists.
"To give an example: When I ask him something two years back when I sang at the Milan Scala, he remembers nothing," Netrebko said.
But he is the happiest person on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebko's connection with Bassbariton Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
