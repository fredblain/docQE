GfK leadership after disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK exchanged its chief Matthias Hartmann.
The returns came suddenly - but not entirely surprising.
The difficult situation of the market research firm GfK has made it clear that the chair of CEO Matthias Hartmann is becoming even more uncertain the longer the success he has promised.
Turbulence at the top of Nuremberg market research firm GfK: after again disappointing business figures and the resignation of corporate governance, the world's number five is facing a personnel new start.
GfK chief executive wants to leave the company at the end of the year.
The chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board, Arno Mahlert, is already out of the supervisory board with effect from September 12.
The executive board member, Gerhard Hausruckinger, announced the lead on the board as early as September 1st, the company announced.
He is to officially assume the function of a "board spokesman" until a successor to Hartmann is found.
As a reason for the returns, the company called "differing views" on long-term business policy orientation.
Details did not want to name a company spokesman on Friday.
Anyone who will be managing the market research company in future is still unclear.
In investor circles, it was said on Friday that the shareholder was most recently disappointed with the continued disappointment of the restructuring initiated years ago.
Mr. Hartmann has been at GfK lace since 2011.
"However, the fruits of restructuring are still not visible after 5 years," it said.
Given the last bad GfK business figures, every shareholder will eventually be restless.
"If that were the case at BMW, that would also make the quandts like that," it said.
After setbacks in the previous quarter, the company had not stopped its loss in the second quarter of 2016.
At 361.2 million euros, sales were 6.1 percent below the comparable previous year's quarter.
In the first half of the year, sales fell by 3.4 percent at 721.2 million euros.
The second-quarter profit has mainly strained the company's slower value given its difficult economic situation.
The corporate value write-offs of 139 million euros required in the Consumer Experience business unit resulted in a loss of 148.2 million euros.
In the second quarter of 2015, GfK had yet to generate a group profit of 19.7 million.
