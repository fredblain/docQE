How to protect yourself with Krav Maga before gun attacks
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from DailyMail.com could make it a bit safer for you.
We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, a grandmaster of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance.
Regardless of whether you are approaching you from front or back, this video shows how you turn the spieze around for your robber.
If you get closer to you from behind, you should turn around as first so you can see your attacker and "get out of the shot line," Mizrachi says.
Then take the weapon between your front arm and shoulder before beating it in your face with your free elbow.
Then put him in the bar with the knee and twist it while the attacker knocks together pain, the weapon from his hands, and move backwards while targeting the weapon.
In attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line, take the weapon and twist it so the attacker can't shoot.
At the same time, put the weight on the weapon and beat the attacker to the chest, then twist the weapon out of his grip before moving backwards and targeting the weapon.
Does it sound difficult?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi pretended.
But remember that in a robbery, it's safest to hand over your money - unless you're a Krav Maga grandmaster.
