Group rises at start-up for live video game transfers
To watch other people play video games is a huge trend - Microsoft also wants to benefit.
The technology group buys the start-up Beam, which specialises in this hobby.
How much money the acquisition fills, Microsoft said on Thursday.
Beam only went to launch in January with its offer, and already has more than 100,000 users.
They can watch others while playing, but also intervene themselves.
For example, they can give up missions to the players and provide enemies as well as provide equipment.
The gaming giant Activision Blizzard is launching a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sports.
On the way to the global media event, Facebook is to help.
The advertising industry is already horrendous.
The start-ups, which has its headquarters so far in Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington, are moving to Microsoft headquarters in California Redmond, as Beam co-founder and chief executive Matt Salsamendi announced.
Therefore, no changes will be made to customers.
According to Microsoft, Beam is integrated into the video game division around the Xbox console.
