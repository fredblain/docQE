Destination plates: who actually buys records?
LONely middle-aged men love plates.
Before you rush to the commentary section to sow him under the pseudonym of non-all-male middle-aged age with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed resurgence of records is not about a boom in millals that want to welcome the newness of physical items, but to midlife nostalgia.
Those who recently bought a plate are all predicted to be between 45 and 54.
In fact, the 18-24 age group is the most unlikely buyers group.
Nor is it a hordes by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers tend to keep their feelings more for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).
But do the results of YouGov vote?
If this blog were a news report on television, the camera would follow me while I walk in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest grey suit and wildly stomping, holding my hands and saying something like, "So, let's take a closer look at it."
So, let's take a look at it.
Even though Soho's heart is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there are still a handful of fantastic record shops.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn out the camera for the next part, where I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and cozy by watching.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, to whom I am from Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three middle-aged men) into Reckless Records (data number: eight middle-aged men, a woman, presumably around the 20), is a day long due to a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
"I guess already," he says.
I have around 3,000 or 4,000 plates.
These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by email, I didn't follow him home), dress the walls of his living room.
The reason he owns such a significant number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy plates he couldn't afford when they appeared and again bought items he sold when he was young and placid.
"Many things I buy are from the late sixties, early 70 's, which appeared when I was 11 or 12, things where I was probably a little too young to buy them," he says.
He agrees that those who buy plates are more introverted and like to spend time alone, adding: "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.
That's my laster.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets are accessing the YouGov profile.
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people influenced by the medienhpe, people who have heard about the comeback and are looking to buy their old plates again.
From the conversations I had, people usually got away from their collection in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their plates to buy themselves cds now sell their cds to buy their plates again," he says.
That would explain the boom to followers of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional importance of plates?
It only takes a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realise that record stores offer a calming community of like-minded people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers took impetus in the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record hulls, from objects that awake happy youth memories.
"I think sometimes it can be filling a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation," Wez says.
That's with me as a collector so I think it's like that with many people.
It's an easy way to engage mentally.
"We are like their social workers!" a staff member flutes from a plate.
A survey by ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a plate last month had not yet listened.
The survey also found that 41% own a record player they never use, while 7% of those buying a plate don't own record players.
At this point in the news report I would probably look very worried while I was blowing through a pile of bossa nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data number: three middle-aged men), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revival.
"Someone only recently arrived here and said: "I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a radiohead record so I can put her on the shelf," he says.
This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.
More productive, less musical.
We have people saying, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not older ones, who only slowly come clean.
Fopp, who has devoted almost an entire floor to the records, has a blower audience when I go straight.
There are couples around the 70, tourists making photos, teenageboys and middle-aged women.
Even though the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the aforementioned stores - Wild Beast's latest synthesizer and sexy pop instead of experimental jazz, from the loudspeakers, it's good to see such diversity with the customer.
None of them look very lonely, but nagging mental traumas are difficult to determine when standing next to someone 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been running around in the store for a few minutes and considers the variation of the plates for sale.
It makes more of a shaufenstummel than a big shopping.
It doesn't deserve much, so collecting plates is not a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It's easy listening to music from a computer or other way, but the beauty of plates is... "she drives off with a fallen sigh.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I seem to be mustering the jeans hotpants, I watch a group of young teenagemagoers grouping for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter consider buying a Crosley record player.
On the left is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Lockhouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, essential plates for an average collection.
Nobody sees them - perhaps because they are only decorative, some so far up that it is impossible to touch them.
It's pure "plate art."
But considering that every attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and send some customers into the depths of Sohos, there's nothing to complain about.
It's no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one who is spending most on luxury items like plates.
Even though my research revealed that the results of YouGov vote, they leave, at least in record shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record lovers that exist in reality, record shops and online forums.
These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.
They certainly don't spend their Thursday morning with banging through record shops of Berwick Street and browsing through plates, while avoiding the startling sight of an uncanny, 30-year-old wrong presenter who racks over the shoulders of middle-aged men.
