Despite Olympic disappointment: Martin remains struggling
Despite his disappointing appearance in Olympic time, cyclist Tony Martin does not want to get under way.
"I continue to keep the World Cup in mind, remain confident and continue fighting," the 31-year-old wrote on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook.
He does not have a statement for his miserable twelfth place at Zusugar.
"I honestly find it difficult to comment on yesterday", Martin said.
He must analyse calmly what causes the debacle.
Martin actually wanted to fight for the title at the time-driving World Cup in Qatar in October.
"I will look at everything we have changed in recent times."
"This also includes my position," wrote the three-time time world champion, who had lost more than three minutes on Olympic champion Fabian Cancelara (Switzerland) on Wednesday on the 54.5 km.
