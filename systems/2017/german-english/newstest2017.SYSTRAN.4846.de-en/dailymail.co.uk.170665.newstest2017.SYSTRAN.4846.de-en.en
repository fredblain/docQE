The £2-a-day drug that can lower heart attack risk
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £2-per-day drug after authorities recommended that this more people be administered for a longer period of time.
The inhibitory drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with a heart disease.
The drug is already administered for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of stroke or another heart attack.
NICE regulator NICE has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.

Around 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and stroke attacks are caused by accumulating fat material in the arterial walls, which form coverings.
When the covering breaks apart, it can cause a blood clotting that closes blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.
When the blood clotting closes, it can flow through the blood stream and clog the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who already had a heart attack are subject to higher risk.
Ticagrelor, made by the British company AstraZeneca and distributed under the trade name Brilique, reduces that risk by making the formation of blood clotting more unlikely.
NICE guidance, published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice-daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Center said: "Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all individuals who suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences."
Fear of a renewed heart attack can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
Experience shows that Ticagrelor, in combination with Aspirin, is effective in reducing further heart attacks and stroke attacks in people who already had a heart attack.
Through a Ticagrelor preliminary recommendation, we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit.
Information about the effectiveness and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years, the guidance draft does not recommend treatment beyond that period.
