Culture of political correctness flowing up electoral fraud in Muslim areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfor Rahman was removed last year at the request of a government report for corruption
A culture of political correctness has meant that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is knowingly ignored as a damning government report revealed today.
Former Cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police, election observers and town hall officials for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse due to "oversensitivities regarding ethnie and religion."
The former minister for integration and municipal government, which is now an anti-corruption case, said the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that police should be allowed to set up lockers outside election cabins to protect intimidated voters.
He recommends that voters should carry a card to prove their identity in elections.
At the moment, a voter must only name his name and address.
The report suggests not applying removable ink to a person's finger when casting their electoral vote to prevent someone from electing twice.
Whistleblower should receive more protection, says Sir Eric.
He calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions from non-official commenters or working groups.
"This is not only against electoral fraud, but is also intended to protect the municipal government from the wider corruption and financial fraud culture that comes with it," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlets electoral scandal in east London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that acting mayor Lutfor Rahman should be dismissed after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his office.
The court ruled Rahman had "perversely perverted" the religious feelings of his Muslim community, and that he would have silenced his critics with racial and Islamophobial accusations.
Rahman is said to have "conducted his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the consequence of an imitation in which one person chooses as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.
In particular, he expressed alarm at the fraudulent electoral election - during which older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice.

His report said: "As proof it was appropriate to put pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, particularly women and young people, in order to vote in accordance with the will of older people, especially communities with Pakistani or Bangladeschian background.
"There were concerns that... state institutions knowingly ignored such behaviour due to "politically correct" oversensitivities regarding ethnie and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to sanitise the system, including banning political activists from editing letter ballots to stop "election harvests."
The report, considered by Theresa May, also requires tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral directory being used for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Options consider asking voters for your ID before the election.
Use unremovable ink on a person's finger as soon as she cast her voice to prevent someone from electing twice.
To carry out systematic checks on the nationality of a person to ensure they are eligible to vote.
A three-year limit on requests for an automatic letter choice.
Prohibition that political activists process full letter elections and envelopes of letter elections.
The police give the power to set up closures around election stations.
A change of law that facilitates an indictment of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983 (People's Representation Act 1983).
Photo ban in electoral stations.
The requirement that only English be used in electoral stations (except for Wales).
Intensification of training to ensure that employees enforce the rule that voters go to the electoral booth alone.
Sir Eric falls through the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that no criminal complaint was made after Tower Hamlets.
"The Electoral Court has declared Lutfor Rahman and his deputy to be unfit for purpose due to a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.
For a number of reasons, he was found guilty sufficiently - according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings.
He also criticises the impacted "abhakcontrols" of the electoral registration departments of the town hall.
Sir Eric said: "The court ruling in Tower Hamlets of last year was a warning signal.
Our country has a proud heritage as the mother of the parliaments, but the worrying and concealed spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation.
