Intercultural travel: Cultural offers for schools
The international class of the Waldschule attended the theaterpiece "The invisible house."
The Nima's association and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project.
The Nima's association allows young people with migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Class International" of the Waldschule Kinderhaus has attended an exhibition of the award-winning piece "The invisible house" of the boy theatre Münster.
In the context of the "Intercultural journey" initiated by the Association Nima's, 19 students aged between 11 and 15 visited the staging in the Small House.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which has committed to the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee backgrounds, offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster under this project.
Most of the class of the class came to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016, among other things from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria, and spearheaded little German.
Thanks to the choreographs, the scenic images and video animations, they have been able to follow the course of action, according to the press release of the theatre of Münster.
The association Nima's, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg of Sprawl, and the Young Theatre will work in the upcoming playtime as part of a music theatre project.
Between October and December, young people with and without the escape and migration background between the ages of 14 and 20 will be able to attend professionally directed courses in singing, dance, play and music.
Offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theatrical language mediation are in the planning.
The project "Intercultural Travel" continues.
Given the increased numbers of refugees, the association expects many classes to take part.
