B27 refurbishment: Restaurants suffer closure
There is nothing to mess with the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated.
There is always praise for those responsible for the construction work, which start at 5.30 a.m. and only end at around 20 p.m.
"They made everything pretty crunchy," says Elvira Tetzlaff of the jet petrol station.
It's a super team.
Nor is there any delay.
The construction site could be moved to the south at half-time at half-time, and everything should be finished by the end of October.
The compensation of those responsible for the construction work will also be praised, for example when it comes to the establishment of temporary occupations.
Since the construction site moved south on Monday, and the closure of Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen has also been lifted, and the connection to Rottenburg has also been restored, the traffic situation within the location has been relaxed.
The citizens can now travel from Ofterdingen to the B 27 again.
The traffic through the place seems to be going back.
"There were some significant complaints in some cases," says deputy chief executive, Florian King, responsible for the transportation management management.
The residents of Bachelierstrasse, Steinlaughstrasse, Hafnerstrasse and Weiherrain were struggling with more traffic noise because many surreptitious routes were searched and more familiar to their Navi than the signposting.
This resulted in some lorries being franked in residential areas.
As speed limits were also not met, the municipality demanded the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.
"There have been significant overruns," says King, who made himself aware of the situation on the ground.
Two to three a minute have already passed.
The quickest was travelling at 77-hour kilometres in the Tempo -30 zone.
Since the construction site moved on, it has become more quiet.
For business people at the B 27, it is only a small consolation that for customers from Rottenburg the road is open again.
Businesses cannot look into the cards.
But that the B 27 refurbishment has led to sales blows in them leaves everyone wondering.
However, some more and some are less affected.
Those who have less to do with "end customers", so for other companies, have little impact.
Even at the Maier car house, Thomas Sulz talks of a "at most slight decline" but also acknowledges that of course "the runner-up is missing."
The most heavily battered are the locals along the road.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly crown, finds clear words.
This is already existential.
Not only him, but all restaurants have "hit hard."
The customers were missing from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil.
We must be happy with every euro turnover.
He cites the losses as "well over 50 percent."
The road refurbishment had "thrown back at two years."
Half of his employees have had to dismiss him.
If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half would have been dismissed, the policy would have reacted differently.
Instead, government president Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request from Göhner whether there could be a financial compensation, with the reference that the restaurant of professional animals otherwise of the benefits of the situation on the B 27, must also bear in mind the disadvantages caused by the refurbishment.
Göhner knows from other districts where so much more generous was handled.
In all cases, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue.
After all, the family business has been here since 1715, he points out the long history.
The fact that other regular guests are now seeing less frequently due to the complicated traffic management can be understood.
If you can't drive, it's beautiful elsewhere.
Göhner has no doubts that his regular clientele will come back after the restoration work.
Despite the crises with BSE and avian influenza, Göhner considers the impact of the B 27 construction work on his clientele to be the biggest crisis his restaurant has experienced in its long history.
Six months of construction work, that is already brutal.
