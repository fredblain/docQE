The reason in the double pack
The municipal council focused on issues related to construction in the recent meeting.
With relief, the board took the notice from Mayor Robert Putz that "finally, the marketing of recently designated residential construction areas can begin."
After the land, parcel and development issues and the applications for surveying could be clarified, the sale of the land in the residential areas of "road lane" and "Schönau-West" (section of Binderstraße - extension section 1) to interested parties no longer stands in the way.
The municipal council is convinced that the land in the rural and quiet residential community of Schöau will equally address young families and senior seniors.
As it has been said, building wilderness can be reported immediately in town hall, and the municipal council is expected to advise the municipal council in its September meeting.
In order to also be able to enquire about the relocation of other commercial establishments, linked to the creation of jobs, the municipal council decided to change the land use plan recently created in the spring of this year.
Thus, in the subtimn area, the commercial area already designated is extended by two plots towards state road 2112.
