Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
The city of Main, therefore, has the best chance of attracting jobs and companies relocated from London in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg.
"It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit vote," says Michael Voigtländer, head of the competency field of financial markets and property markets of the IW.
After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether money houses continue to operate from London from financial operations across the EU.
For the so-called EU passport, they have so far been subject to authorisation in Britain.
That is what big US banks are using.
Several banks have already announced their intention to relocate jobs.
The lobby association "Frankfurt Main Finance" expects 10000 new jobs in the main within five years.
For Frankfurt, the IW said, the seat of the European Central Bank (ECB), which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the eurozone, as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance supervisory authority EIOPA and the risk council ESRB.
In Paris, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has its headquarters, but it is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB.
"The proximity to the emergency bank is important for banks as they can communicate so directly with supervision," says IW Professor Voigtländer.
Luxembourg is a big fund industry, but as much as Dublin, it is cutting down on infrastructure.
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the airport.
Also, points the city with easily available commercial properties.
"In Paris, it is not so easy to find free high-quality offices," says Voigtländer.
In addition, rents for first-class commercial properties are 50 percent higher than in the main.
In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure, as well as less crime.
In a ranking of the Mercer consultancy, the city stands in place of seven, Luxembourg in place 19, Dublin in place 33 and Paris in 37th place.
Even though quality of life is a matter of preferences, "With its already strong position as a financial location for the European single market, Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors," the IW concludes.
But London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite Brexit vote, mine said.
The crow relationships are also for this: in London, according to figures from Landesbank Helaba, around 144,000 people were working in the banking sector at the end of 2015, and in Frankfurt it was 62500.
