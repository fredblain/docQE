The fees per cubic metre of waste water will be 3.10 euros for the Neudorf / Reuth / Welschenkahl waste water treatment plant from 1 October 2016, 3.44 euros for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp 3.36 euros (so far 2.26 euros) and for Azendorf 3.64 euros (so far 2.18 euros).
At the plant in Azendorf, the waste water charge will increase again if appropriate improvement measures become necessary.
After an excessive calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf will then be at 4.37 euros per cubic meter.
As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, when the budget was approved by the Landsgemeinde Kulmbach, it was discovered that these wastewater treatment facilities were running out.
Due to legal bases, the Kasendorf market is obliged to cover the facilities in a cost-effective manner.
From 1 October 2016, the citizens as well as the industrial and industrial businesses of Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to dig deeper into the purses.
The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.
As managing director Herbert Schmidt told the board, a new calculation of charges for the market's waste water plants was necessary.
Over the period from October 2016 to September 2020, it will also be possible to balance over or below the previous calculation period.
According to Schmidt, the heavy fee increases were due to the fact that all three waste water plants are relatively small plants with a very low waste water waste, which is between 6800 and 12000 cubic metres a year.
For example, due to the low distribution base, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have serious consequences.
In addition, waste water in all three plants is slightly declining.
Furthermore, in the past calculation period, all three plants have also been taken up to a significant extent, not least due to their age renovation and repair expenses.
The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the facilities for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp are almost 20 years old.
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation plant had to be exchanged at the Azendorf waste water plant due to damage.
In the Welschenkahl pumping plant, the nearly 20-year-old conveyor plants had to be overhauled from the ground up and, after almost 20 years of operation, Lopp had to plant the first waste water pond, dispose of sewage sludge and install an additional ventilation facility to continue to comply with the water regulations.
Schmidt said: "On these extraordinary expenses, the continued care and maintenance costs, which must be taken into account in the new calculation period, came to light."
The same applies to electricity costs, which were still well below current levels during the previous calculation in 2011/2012.
Steinhäuser made it clear that in the case of the low waste water waste, the expenses for the operation and maintenance "fully beat" in the three plants.
Schmidt added that the market congregation has been spared major entertainment costs in the past 20 years.
According to Steinhäuser, the situation for these plants will continue to be precarious in the long term, especially as the supply area of the Friesenbachtal waste water sewage association will not be able to expand these facilities because they are deficient entities.
