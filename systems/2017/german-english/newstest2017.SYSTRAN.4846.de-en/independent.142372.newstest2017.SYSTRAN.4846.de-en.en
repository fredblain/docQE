Britain picks silver in 7-er rugby after Fiji masterclass picks gold
Britain's impressive performance at 7-er rugby came to an abrupt halt in the final on Thursday evening in the final hurdle in the form of the Fijis when they were beaten up here in Rio with a score of 43-7.
Fiji gave a masterclass in handling, side-stepping, afterward, line-running and raw force to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was sweetened by the not-too-bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament, where they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The Boks' clear defeat, 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day, could fall back on them in the final.
But, regardless of that, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in best form.
It could be a consolation for GB - but it probably won't - that at least one Briton will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's head coach Ben Ryan, the former head for England from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult path behind it.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost each game at the Adelaide Sevens.
Here they lost only one.
This mud will hurt, but the progress is amazing.
Fiji began marvellously, leaving GB's attacks out of fun.
It felt for captain Tom Mitchell and Co., as if going into driving buses, the World Series winners went 5-0 upwards when Osea Kolinisau scored in the corner.
With still four minutes of playing time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner, which he converted.
12-0 and GB have hardly touched the ball.
A hated tally of Mitchell stopped the mountain from Man Leone Nakarawa a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua lashed a touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new since the rebound and there was still over a minute playing time... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou pressed through further weak tacklings of the GB team and crashed down to the line to make a gate.
The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.
It is as if Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB still learns.
So it is.
GB introduced fundamental changes at half-time and closed the fijian gap... for whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half, until Josua Tuisova went through a brilliant intermediate play of Fiji.
Dan Norton launched an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game had long been in favour of the South Seeinsulans, whose fans sang, flags snapped and danced in the gallery.
It was not hard to admire Fiji's playful approach.
Mata Viliame set the i-bag with another try in the final seconds.
The pfiff hung, the Fijis embraced themselves and GB kickstarted crashing into the lawn.
Earlier on the day Fiji Japan had defeated Japan in the semi-finals with 20-5 defeats and Britain pushed South Africa in a tight semi-final match from the race - Britain's conversion of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the Boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke down the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate under the post in the second half.
A brilliant late tackling of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-side team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.
