Assistant doctors want to organise further strikes after they rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the British Medical Association functionaries, but 58 percent of the 33,000 assistant doctors who voted in an election rejected him.
In July, Hunt had unveiled plans to introduce the contract forcefully and said the NHS would be in a "niemandsland" and any further delay would be harmful to staff and patients.
The first assistant doctors are to receive a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend work to improve care at unreasonable times.
Dr Ellen McCourt, the chairwoman of the BMA Committees for Assistant Physicians, shared last night in a notice: "Assistant doctors have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and manage to treat all doctors fairly."
With only eight weeks remaining, until the first group of doctors falls under the new contract, progress must be made and time is running out.
Efforts by the BMA to resolve the disputes caused by conversations with the government were reluctant to participate and sometimes to ear-numbing silence.
That's what happened to the promise Jeremy Hunt made only last month that his door would always be offensive.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, lift up the force and address the concerns of assistant doctors."
If he fails to do so, assistant doctors have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further labour combat measures.
The last strike in late April saw an uptick of almost 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 dates, as nurses and specialist doctors were included to provide coverage to doctors on the strike chain.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting the reformed treaty with the functionaries of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants a better weekend pay for the 54.000 assistant doctors who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, director general of NHS staff, urged assistant doctors to end the strike.
Mortimer said: "Labor combat measures achieve nothing of only little, but already burden overburdened teams and service providers, and only prepare the patients, carers and their families for concerns, distress and disruption."
Over the last two months, we have spoken to the Assistant doctors' committee and have responded positively to the concerns about guardianship and whistleblowing with the Ministry of Health and other ministries.
Employers hoped that continued positive engagement on other important issues - such as posting, flexibility in training, extra training for those returning from a professional period, training centres, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training holidays, and the gender pay gap - were a sign of how serious it was for the employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health to comply with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.
