Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes an internethit
Not always do Olympians or world records determine the headlines at the Olympics.
This shows the brave performance of Robel Kiros Habte at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.
At the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that he was temporarily no longer seen in the TV images.
He just disappeared - no matter how far the cut was selected.
On social networks, Habte subsequently became a viral internethit.
In fact, the 24-year-old finished his lead with a backlog of 48 seconds and finished 59 in 59.
It was rather his not-exactly-sporty figure, who drew the attention of international media.
Why the 24-year-old still attends the Olympics?
The Ethiopians got a special start right from the international swimming association.
This is distributed to make swimming in under-represented countries more familiar.
Since most athletes are running in aethopia, Habte simply wanted to do something different.
Preparation is everything: Robel Kiros Habte makes himself ready for the big race.
quickly, the first nicknames made the round.
Some media described him as a "robel of the whale."
In line with a "prosperity belly," the English tabloid "The Sun" made fun of him with "Dad Bod."
His time, he only beat with one minute and almost five seconds over the 100-meter free style, played no part.
Comparisons with Eric the Eel were also drawn.
At the 2000 Sydney Olympics, Eric Moussambani's run ensured media attention.
Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equatorial Guinea when he had to enter over 100 metres of free style on his own.
Frenchman was fired at the time.
The then 22-year-old only learned about eight months before Olympia and had never completed such a long distance before the match.
