CBC commentator for the Olympics apologises for his statement that Chinese swimmers "have died like a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of fourth place of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at dr 4x200m free-style swimming season outraged viewers of the CBC live broadcast of the Olmypical games on Wednesday
Canadian broadcaster CBC had to apologise after one of its commentators said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "went off like Mief" and during the race like "a pig died."
Commentator Byron MacDonalds thought his microphone was switched off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m free-style swimming season.
MacDonald, who had been picked up on board the CBS commentator to give more "color," could be heard saying: "This little 14-year-old Chinesin has lost the connection, baby."
Excited, went off like Mief, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second stage of swimming season 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor ruck, allowing Canadians to close the gap with China.
Viewers across Canada quickly responded online after being shocked by the tone and language
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Has the CBC commentator just said that the 14-year-old swimmer from China "has died like a pig"?"
The idiot did not realise they were still on shipment."
Ai Yanhan from China was described in the final 4 x 200m free-style swimming season for women: "This small 14-year-old Chinesin has lost the connection, baby."
The criticism against Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and hard, when many made him speech
Twitter users didn't hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter userin Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and let us all look like racists. #eneked.
A short time later, Scott Russel, who moderated the CBC broadcast, apologized live for comment by MacDonald, saying: "We apologise that the comment was broadcast on a swimming performance."
It was an unhappy formulation, we're sorry it happened."
CBC apologized at the end over 90 times for people who responded to the bemusement via Twitter
Commentator Scott Russel had to apologise on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and added his apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about the comments made by MacDonald
The network also apologised quickly and issued a notice.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that it was possible to broadcast them.
Yesterday night we apologised quickly to our viewers on broadcast and our followers on social media.
To make one thing clear, Byron's comments relate to the swimmer's performance, not to her as a person.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and an unhappy formulation, Byron does what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized in the broadcast and tried to justify his comment, saying it was not his intention to be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I would like to take a moment to apologise for the comment I made after the women's swimming season in the CBC Olympiscope," he said.
"I was referring to the performance of the swimmers and not to them as a person."
Of course no disrespect was intended and I am very sorry."
