Who builds Braunschweig's cheap apartments?
The SPD and Greens believe that investors should be much more accountable in the future.
How to respond to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap homes over the next few years?
The SPD proposes an "action plan" for the next council meeting.
But dispute is programmed.
First and foremost, the question is: who should actually build the cheap housing?
A regulation is missing.
SPD group chairman Christoph Bratmann said: "We agree with the Greens: those who want to build on urban land will have to expel 20 percent of all homes as social housing in future."
However, cheap apartments can also be created in stock.
However, the big point of contention at town hall is, said Bratmann: "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private land?"
"We want investors on such land to build at least 10 percent but as much as 20 percent of homes as social housing."
A new urban housing support program, which will cost millions and still needs to be funded, should provide incentives.
The problem, Bratmann said: "There is currently no agreement between the groups."
The CDU wants to make investors as few regulations as possible.
The left still wants tough conditions for investors.
Regardless, Bratmann said, a tightening of the situation in the housing market is emerging.
If the action concept is implemented, it will provide additional tasks in the construction administration.
More staff are needed.
It is unclear if we will get the skilled workers.
However, the programme is not yet complete: for the approximately 1260 new homes that should be built anyway.
But how do we compare the loss of some 1300 cheap homes, which will be phased out over the next few years?
By 2020 alone, there will be 500 homes.
To prevent that, planning policy spokeswoman Nicole Palm said, should now be purchased from the city.
In addition, consideration should be given to getting housing back into price fixing.
This is possible in the West City.
The problem could be solved at a stroke.
Because in the West City, deadlines expire at the end of the year.
Around 1800 homes could be picked up there in price fixing for cheap apartments.
Only: the owners, the housing companies, do not want that.
Because the number of social housing in the West City is once again drastically increased, away from the goal of so-called through-mix.
There should no longer be a concentration of the socially vulnerable in only a few districts.
The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion.
Group chairman Holger Herlitschke says: "For a broad majority, the CDU must be on the boat."
That has focused on more building sites for single-family homes.
But that does not mean that a compromise cannot be found.
