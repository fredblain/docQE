Olympia: Trieste cheating on doping test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary commission on the case.
Kenya's light athletes are at risk after the second doping affair at the Rio de Janeiro Ungemach Olympics.
Kenya sent a coach home after a scam at a doping control in the Olympic Village.
The International Olympic Committee announced that it would immediately set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case.
A Kenyan functionary had announced that the former sprinter and current coach, John Anzrah, had made an urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich.
This was reported to Kenya's team management by the doping controllers.
The IAAF World Association has asked the IOC for information on the case to make its own investigations, an IAAF spokesman said.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent actions of the IOC, the IAAF will make an assessment," it said in an IAAF statement.
"He (Anzrah) has gone to the doping control station and has issued himself as Ferguson Rotich, rehearsed and signed, declared Kenya's chief of mission Stephan Arap Soi.
He was in possession of the athlete's accreditation, which was on the list for the World Anti-Doping Agency's training controls.
Ferguson Rotich had become more than 800 metres in Beijing in 2015.
Four days earlier, Kenyan lightweight athletics chief Michael Rotich had been dragged away from the Rio Games.
He is said to have briefed his country's athletes on money payments on upcoming doping tests.
According to media reports, he should have been arrested on his return at Nairobi Airport.
Kenya has been under special observation at the IOC for a long time after numerous doping offences.
In announcing the more than 2,000 doping target controls put in place by the IOC before the Rio Games, it was unusually previously pointed out that athletes from Kenya and Russia are specifically targeted.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was passed just weeks before Olympic start.
As a result, WADA Kenya took on the list of countries whose doping control is compliant with WADA's rules.
Kenya is considered a big runner nation.
The country's lightweight athletes won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.
A number of ARD television reports repeatedly raised allegations that Kenya's doping funds are easily accessible and there is to be a significant mentality of sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound last called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he employed her in Russian lightweight athletics.
It has been demonstrated that the sport has been comprehensively and systematically doped in this sport.
Russia's light athletes were subsequently excluded from the summer games.
