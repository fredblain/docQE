England must steer the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and across London, but across the country.
For me, that represented the biggest Heathrows attraction, just as it was in London in 2012, when we ran a great effort to ensure all our nations and regions benefited from the Games.
The Olympics brought great benefits for Stratford and the East End.
And that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities, we will alone create 10,000 new apprenticeships, create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.
Just as they were ahead of us at London 2012, there will be those who think the challenge of expanding HeathRows is too big.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be blaming ourselves on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcoming, but Heathrow answers every question put to him.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is for many, not individual, infrastructure projects.
Enlargement is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion of long-term growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both to the airport and to the whole of GB.
We have a great team at Heathrow, which has implemented a £11bn expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from the T5 - which was elected to the world's best airport terminal five years in a row - to the T2, which was built amid the world's two most frequented careers.
Now they are ready to provide a third catwalk, supported by £16 billion in private investment.
The London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.
It is time for us to steer this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, securing our future trade and creating a legacy of skill and employment that England can be proud of.
