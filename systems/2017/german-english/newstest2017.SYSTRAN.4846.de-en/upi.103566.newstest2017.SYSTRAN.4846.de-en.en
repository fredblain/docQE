NASA climate model: Venus once habitable
Venus was likely once habitable, according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to discover the venue's past using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and carbon-dense atmosphere, could once have shown similar conditions.
Scientists have previously hinted that the venue's slow turnaround could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests the Venus may have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and still slowly turned on.
The model also lit up the topography of early Venus.
The planet presumably dismissed more dry areas than de Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to house lives and protected from rapid evaporation.
The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent probable.
"In the GISS model simulation, the slow turnaround of Venus exposed its day-to-day side of the sun for almost two months," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio said in a news release.
This warms up the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like a umbrella to shield the surface from much of the sun's heat.
The result is average temperatures, which are some degrees cooler than those of Earth today.
The model brought out a history of Venus similar to evolution, previously suspected by planetary researchers.
Although it was once habitable, Venus — over several billion years — was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans evaporated and their water vapour was burned away from the ultraviolet light.
As their hydrogen escaped, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a fatal greenhouse effect was left behind — venus like we know it today.
Researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.
