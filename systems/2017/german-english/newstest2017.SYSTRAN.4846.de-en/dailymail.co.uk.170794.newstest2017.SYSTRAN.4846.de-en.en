Travel guide Ian Wright sends his tongue to the dirtiest places in Europe
A British traveller subjected his immune system and WÃ¼rgereflex to serious scrutiny - by deleting some of Europe's dirtiest and most egregious places.
The presenter and travel writer, Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, departed from Suffolk on a Euro-gig, a railroad at Piccadilly Circus, a sprinkler of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.
Before leaving each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he was going to get into.
But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results to light.
The idea of leaking the sprinkler of a train toilet, already used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen flush.
On his journey through Europe, Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Luckily nothing left him behind, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.
Mr. Wright became known for testing the resilience of his intestine by traveling through the world and offering strange and wonderful things.
From public changes at stations to flushing toilets, the task definitely put his immune system under a sample
In the film, he said: "Already as a child I was relatively unconcerned as to my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."
In the film, he was in any case fair to his reputation.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His sample was a luminometer number of over 4000 units.
In comparison, the luminometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet he refused to lick after her luminometer number was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60
Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" which shows the bacteria number in different places like the bathroom
In the film, he says: "That comes down to the worst thing I've gotten in a toilet."
There is nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not going to lick anything here because it's indoors here.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.
The company is equipping Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which includes both lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that's fascinating to look at while explaining the benefits of probiotics.
We ran crazy brainstormings that ended that we said "Let's call Ian."
They claim interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon
Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a wider context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we have been able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.
I also think the film shows we have a great sense of humour!
Tom Hakala, who led the film's directing, added: "Let me say it like that - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had loved some of the things I'd instructed him to lick, like the eerie Russian toilet shown in the film."
Of course, there were things where it was easier to get Ian to lick them and others where this was pretty difficult.
I'm glad we've taken some of these dirty leaks on film."
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of all respondents associated lactic acid bacteria, particularly with the wellbeing of stomach and intestines, and 58 percent said they at least occasionally use products containing attached lactic acid bacteria.
