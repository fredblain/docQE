City Council unanimously decides: no kiosk new construction on St. Goarer Rhine shore
Normally, the St. Goarer investment projects are taken by traders with kiss hand - however, retail in the core city is considered to be significantly expanding.
However, the city council unanimously rejected the request for the rebuilding of a sale skosk on the Rhine shore, in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine convention.
"In principle, we welcome new traders, but at this location in exposed location on the Rhine shore, these kiosks are not fitting," explained Michael Hubrath for the CDU group.
