Greenland shark: The oldest vertebrae is almost 400 years old
Seldom sight.
Greenland sharks usually come to the surface only in winter.
This hai was allowed to return to sea after an investigation aboard the research vessel Sanna.
He was born in 1624 and floats well at 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day.
Greenland sharks only get 150 years of offspring.
The Greenland shark is floating along the north Atlantic Ocean, and in an hour it is an average of 1,220 metres.
Only when it arrives will the five-metre-long animal accelerate to sat 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal at this maximum speed.
This slowness, however, seems to be a recipe for high age.
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues, in the journal "Science," at least, report a Greenland shark that could be 392 years old.
"Madness," Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock said in Rostock, which represents a world record for vertebrates.
Although the evolutionary biologist has long suspected Greenland sharks will be stinged.
Only lacked evidence.
Greenland sharks are hard to watch, eventually living in the ice sea off the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius, they usually only dive in winter.
Researchers know little about the Greenland sharks lifestyle.
Their timescale pace was somewhat different when they took six animals with a broadcaster before Spitsbergen.
Prey make these sharks anyway: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear.
They may hunt sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice ocean and seek carcasses that torkish from higher water layers.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland sharks that fishermen took from Greenland or Spitsbergen in front of Greenland or Spitsbergen as a catch from the north Atlantic.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long, while the largest was 502 centimetres.
To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lentil nucleus of the sharks with the carbon -14 method.
This center of the eye lens emerges before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it will no longer be renewed.
The two smallest sharks had remarkably much carbon -14 in lentils.
Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons attempted to put greater quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
In the 220-centimetre length of the third smallest animal, the lentil core, on the other hand, contained a small surplus of carbon -14 from the nuclear tests, it should have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.
All major Greenland sharks, in their lentils, had normal carbon -14 quantities, created by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon -14 watch for a 493-centimetre long Greenland shark showed an age of 335, while the record hai was expected to be 392 years old at 502 centimetres.
Greenlandhai females only get offspring when they are longer than four metres, it was known.
Now the researchers of length were able to assign an age.
Since one of the animals was probably at the threshold of gender maturity at 392 centimetres, and its age was 156 years old, Greenland sharks can clearly be at least one and a half centuries old with the propagation.
This is also likely to be world record for vertebrates.
It is not a coincidence that such methusaleme lives mainly in icy waters.
Even the previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale, in whose bacon a 120-year-old Hardenenspitze stecked, was trapped before Alaska.
Due to low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there is often also running on flame.
So they mature later - and ageing slowly.
In order to warm up in cold water, the animals are often particularly large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat.
The heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much greater than in a gram of elephant.
Another advantage: They have fewer enemies.
"A smaller animal is therefore more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as early as possible," explained evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.
A very large animal should, on the other hand, invest its resources in a long life.
