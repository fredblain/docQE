North oil workers resume talks, suspend strike
Labor struggles over pay for north sea oil workers are suspended, while all the parties to the dispute are set to table a new round of talks, negotiators said.
Strikes against oil field service provider Wood Group were sporadically carried out on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group, as well as the Unite and RMT unions, can confirm that we have agreed to restart the resolution process of the current dispute," said a joint statement.
We will hold some full-day meetings in the next few weeks, which will begin early next year to address the problems.
The unions said their last strike, which is the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible pay cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group this year cut rates to its contractors in the North Sea by about 9 percent due to negative market pressure.
The company's rate cut follows a 10 percent decline for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said additional cuts give the company the space needed to get through the market downturn.
Shell has dismissed for its part thousands of people and plans to abandon its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its operations as a result of its mega merger with UK energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices, an economic situation exacerbated by Britain's decision in June to leave the European Union.
Scottish parliamentarian Dave Anderson met with Labour leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest job disputes that have taken place in the North Sea for a generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for many and not just for few," he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion is expected to be spent on new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $7 billion over the past five years.
