Putin Putin fixes chief of staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Russia's closest confidence circle for many years.
The 63-year-old was appointed special envoy for environmental and transportation affairs.
In an opinion of the Kremlin, it is that Putin, without giving reasons, "ordered Ivanov's dismissal of his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration."
Anton Vaino, who has been Ivanov's deputy since 2012, was appointed to his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo.
On the Kremlin's website, it says (in Russian) that he was later protocol chief and chief of staff of government personnel.
Asked about his appointment, he said to Putin: "Thank you for your confidence."
I think it is the government's most important task to support your job as head of state regarding draft laws and controls to implement your instructions.
Putin told the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Surely the smiling faces?
This move has made Moscow secret.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidances and works as he does for the Soviet Secret Service, the KGB.
As chief of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, who aired on television, both men claimed the chief of staff resigned at their own request.
But despite the smile for the cameras, few here are convinced - especially now, just before the general election.
Is this the result of a kind of power struggle?
Nobody knows that at the moment.
But the official claim - that a man once touted as a potential president wants to guide Russian environmental policy at once - came up with great scepticism.
In his remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said "it is true that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you in a conversation to entrust me with this very complicated post - you could almost say - for four years.
As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took the post in December 2011.
Previously, he was deputy prime minister and defence minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, former member of the KGB state security service.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov as one of five people he trusted most.
Once it was assumed that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin's second term, as a third term Putin's term would have violated the constitution.
But this post was taken by another nearby ally, Putin's, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before becoming president three and a half years later.
