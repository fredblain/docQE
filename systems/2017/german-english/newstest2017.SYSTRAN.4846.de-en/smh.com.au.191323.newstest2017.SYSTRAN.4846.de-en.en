More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of Kardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of U.S. Vogue.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder's brand embassy and ran at Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to the wine," Kendall wrote.
The cover of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians?), crippled reality video that shows the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (with the exception of problems Rob and Caitlyn, and in the presence of the all-popular Showbiz-onkels and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as they forget their sister's cover and that ends with a classic twist: they have all planned a surprise party.
This represents the clich√©-filled plot of almost every birthday episode of a children's broadcast (Seacrest brought the phrase, "You rooftop, that we would have forgotten you?," with the honesty of a drawing rabbit on a broadcast pitch at 8 a.m.), but Kris had to somehow let her other girls participate in this publicity.
With regard to the September issue of Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall's big sister Kim may have beaten her in the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were on it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself.
The September issue is the most selling edition of the year for Vogue.
With a volume more likely to resemble a picture tape than a fashion magazine, the output attracts a large number of advertisers (according to Fashion Ista, from the 832 pages of the Roller's 615 pages advertising).
The unveiling of his cover stars is so eagerly anticipated that in the last two years, images of the magazine have been leaked before the official announcement.
Women already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, clearly more "celebrities, the modules," were "models that are celebrities" on the cover.
Oscar prize winner and Dior brand embassy Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honour.
But even at the low chance that Ms Jenner - described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls below the previous category, she is in good company.
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or young people of today who know how to turn a good snapchat video (even though it is all about Jenner).
They are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, Jenner's success doesn't like everyone.
With her reality TV story, Jenner's position in the fashion world was always somewhat tense.
In June, the former Victoria's Secret model criticized Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "the mist pieces of the moment."
These feelings cooked up again when the news came out with Jenner's appearance on the Vogue cover.
But to get around the missminess seems to be passing by.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
It is, literally, a supermodel.
She runs for Marc Jacobs.
It makes advertising for your grunting of Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine LOVE.
And in her spare time she is seen in reality TV, presumably only to see her sister Kourtney and her children.
