Golfer Langer gets the sports pyramid
His experience on horseback is manageable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer was looking for a bit of a variety with a few colleagues on the beach.
It was a premiere for the 58-year-old.
CHIO: "Golden sports pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses remembered their holiday, they hunted home in a quick gallop to feed.
One kilometre at that pace, I was scared.
"It wasn't a good experience," Langer says.
And thus the riding carriere ended again.
On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament victories - was back near horses.
He was let go with his family about the facility of the ALRV, and he didn't even get to a horse for a horse.
Langer was the first time in Aachen and thus also at the CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German sports aid handed over the golden sports pyramid to the man from Anhausen in a small gala.
The sympathetic athletes don't miss out on awards.
Federal merit, silver leaf leaf, champions tour player of the year...
Even the British Queen has already adored him.
Langer is the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid.
In Aachen, he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
"This award means a great deal to me," says Langer, "because she is awarded not only for sporting success but also for social engagement."
Langer has been promoting the offspring for decades.
And so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros straight away.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time U.S. master winner was taken to the "Hall of Fame of German Sports" on Saturday.
Among the performers are the lightweight athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the fencers of Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, the Bob-Rider, Alwin Schocker, the springer Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumous of the handballer Erhard.
Many of these sports legends had come to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrious society migrated to the Springstadium, where the Lavazza Prize ran.
Bernhard Langer kept distance to the big animals.
