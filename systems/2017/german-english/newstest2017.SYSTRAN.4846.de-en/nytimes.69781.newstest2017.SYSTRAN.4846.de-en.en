USA wins fourth match in women's field hockey, a showdown with Britain
A day after she shot three goals during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the women's field hockey team in a match Thursday against India that Americans won 3-0.
Five goals in two games should actually be a memorable achievement, but Bam (27) said she couldn't remember having ever done that.
"I have no idea," she said.
I'm not one of the people who keep their gates in mind.
However, it knows: the Americans are 4-0 in Olympic competition and are in their group with the British in their first place, unbeaten after their 2-0 win against Japan.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which of the two will win the first and second place within their group from six teams.
The first place will take the strong Dutch out of the way that the other group leads.
Whatever the game on Saturday, Americans have caused a surprising swirl through their success story, four years after they landed at last year's London Games at the last of 12 places.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had a hockey squirrel for the first time at three years (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), at 16, she became a national player in the USA, the youngest in the team's history.
She missed the Olympics in 2008 as she couldn't qualify for the kader.
Then came 2012, where everything went wrong for her and her team.
In the following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the national team, and thus things started to turn better.
"A culture change, a mental change and a physical change," Bam said.
We didn't have the workload in London we have now.
We can tear the ruder around completely.
On Thursday evening, Bam opened the torre in the first half of the game with a backhand shot from close range.
India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly fenced and kept the 1-0 game up to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.
She carried a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and lugged the ball into the gate to give the American a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.
The shutout was the first of the entire tournament for the US goalkeeper, Jackie Briggs, who had to book a gate in each of the previous games.
She has a run.
Just like Bam.
"We're in a good position," said Parnham, but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday.
