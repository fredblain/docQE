Salzburg "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare year, the Salzburg Festival presents the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic love couple, similar to Romeo and Julia.
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquered Salzburg: the "West Side Story," Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.
The artistic director, Cecilia Bartoli, wanted to bring the musical into the Temple of Classics and fulfilled a youth dream with the role of Maria.
In the orchestra, the Simón Bolívar orchestra led by the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm," he swarmed.
We always say that she is very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and melody.
It's a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
Bartoli plays an older mary in this staging.
She remembers her love with Tony, while the younger Maria plays and dance.
The role of Maria has always fascinated me.
First because it is musically extraordinary!
And then there would be Maria's personality.
She says it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so beautiful, I feel pretty and witty and bright".
So she is wise, obviously naive, and very passionate.
"It resembles me very much, my Italian character, who I have as a Roman," laughs Bartoli.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It's such an honor for us to work with her.
She is an immensely generous person.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
Conducting is a necessity for him.
You see it in each of his movements, in his looks, it's his life!
It's such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a more southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a cheerful approach to life, which is very important at all!
For American director Philip Wm McKinley, the "West Side Story" is highly topical: "This piece is about prejudice and fanaticism."
Today we have the refugees, then the Puertorians went to New York, and the New York residents didn't want them.
These are the same issues, and they are just as meaningful today as they were then.
59 years later, the piece is still relevant.
