Clinton's and Trump's economic policy by comparison: It's all about the money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing the trade deal TTP - that's what both Clinton and Trump want.
The two U.S. Presidential candidates, however, are divided on tax and energy policy and on a fundamental issue.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton lie in a fundamental, rather philosophical, difference.
The, about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small, warning how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate to death, he says.
He himself would be quite different, Trump claimed.
He will massively back regulations, and he is pushing for wide tax reform at lower rates - for private people and for companies.
Clinton, on the other hand, says the state has certain tasks to perform, it has disadvantaged opportunities to open and needs money for it.
That is why taxes would be increased for the rich, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure.
Investing in that, Trump and Clinton say almost word equal.
The Democratic candidate is even announcing the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II.
State investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly opposed by the state-critical teaparty wing of Republicans.
So there could still be intra-party discussions on Trump.
The differences in energy and climate policy are clearer.
Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and re-run coal production in the United States.
Oil extraction should also be possible in protected areas, the Paris climate change agreement wants to cancel.
Clinton, on the other hand, wants to explicitly expand Renewable Energies with her investment program, calling for "a country to become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs."
"It will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be."
But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart.
TPP, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, both don't want to sign.
At the same time, however, both do not want to isolate the USA from international trade - but simply better protect American jobs.
They should also be paid better, for example, for Clinton.
The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a starvation wage.
He wants to raise it to $15 an hour.
What Trump wants to do on this issue is not entirely clear: once he says the minimum wage must be up, then he says he should not be altered.
But the big discussion in the coming months should probably be more about the tax policy of the two camps.
On one hand stands Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth.
His critics predict that the budget deficit will only increase.
On the other hand is Clinton, who wants at least to ask the rich that they pay more taxes, and whose critics say more taxes are not the solution either.
