In the midst of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the Trampoline
Whatever you are, however late it is, it is the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel steady and inescapable, a fast-paced baton between competition and aspiration.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning pole that goes from the brake protection to the swimmer to the turner to the turner.
You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour's conversation in the queue at Coffeshop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there is Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is at the Olympics for the first time at the Olympics and a women's swarm with green, could well have been among those familiar names being sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and wellbeing TV adverts if he were a swimmer, Turner or even fencer.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting gold in Olympic trampoline.
The Olympic flame doesn't illuminate every event.
Further from the centre, partly in the shadows, are the sports that are not universally recognised: air pistols shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We'll always have the chest swim and it will be long.
But if I can humbly make arguments for my particular favourite, let me draw attention to the trampoline's discreet charm.
Although trampoline is already an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it has been so scary for the last 16 years that many, I had interviewed, didn't know it was an Olympic sport at all.
That could also be regional ignorance.
Although the USA sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in trampoline and has had an athlete until 2012 that has managed to reach the final.
The Chinese and Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
The trampoline has a certain outsider charm, in part because it fits the unenlightened ear for a clown school than that for the Olympics.
At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but just an accomplished enthusiast.
It has humoristic potential - the cartoonist citation of its never-ending impact - but also the grace of the tournament and diving, the two sports that essentially unite it.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means as much as "springboard."
Prospective victors jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and must have a series of falling movements (turning, hitting and saltos) before landing on their feet.
They are assessed according to the official Olympic program by execution, difficulty level and "flight time."
Powerfully athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight.
Medal hoff must go further in their pursuit of gold, faster, upwards and over, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and forth, up and down the pitch.
Not only do they hunt the finish line or the exit wall, but also in the television transmission, another cavernous goal: that of the world or the Olympics.
The targeted aspiration is noble, admirable, even fanatic - and it's enough to even stir a spectator to tears.
But it's also what I find a bit tiring even when I grant these games.
The trampoline offers a breathing space.
The trampolinspringer's vector is up.
A pre-heat movement is not the goal.
He or she prallt, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes upwards, then downwards, then effortlessly back up.
There is competition here, obviously, not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, just the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.
It's as Zen as the competition at the Olympics can only be.
Women's qualification and endrance will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 1pm Eastern Time; that of men on Saturday, also at 1pm.
NBC will broadcast the Endrells as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00.
In the midst of Olympic mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to overlook in general tumult.
If raising awareness can only be achieved by angling and objectifying male athletes - as the male U.S.-Turner recently suggested, according to The Wall Street Journal - Mr. Dooley expects his air-ring, new fan base.
