Treats want Nacktkalendar for "women and for men"
Treats magazine is working with photographer David Bellemere to bring out a 1970s Pirelli-inspired Kalendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of topmodels for their NU Muses Kalendar for 2017.
The editor-in-chief of Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude magazine of Oldschool Playboys was different because "Playboy is for men."
I do that for women.
He seems to think that the Kalendar is doing it too.
"We must return to the representation of timeless and classical nakedness, where both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body," Shaw said in a press release to publish the calendar.
Women will want to participate in this project because it's a wonderful work of art.
Models can submit their images online or personally at open casting call in Los Angeles and New York.
