Airline not liable: crash on passenger bridge
An airline is not liable for the crash of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
For liability is only conceivable in the case of dangers typical of aviation, argued the Oberlandesgericht DÃ¼sseldorf (18 U 124/14).
The plaintiff had broken a knee disc during the crash.
However, the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life, the court said.
The airline had no compensation to the man.
