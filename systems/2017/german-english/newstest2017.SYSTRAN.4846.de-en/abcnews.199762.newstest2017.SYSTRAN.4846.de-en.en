28-year-old cook found dead at San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old cook who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping centre.
The victim's brother said he can't imagine anyone wanting to harm him, "finally it got uphill with him again."
The corpse found on Wednesday morning in the Westfield Mall was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, told the San Francisco court medical department.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was classified as murder and the investigations are underway.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABS broadcaster KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who used to work as a cook in Boston, had made his dream job as a cook at Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokesman for the Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and destroyed" over his death.
"We are a small team that works like a close family and we will painfully miss him," the spokesman continued.
Our thoughts and condolences are at this difficult time at Franks family and friends.
Louis Galicia said Frank initially lived in hostels, but that "things finally went uphill for him."
"He found a flat, he had a girlfriend," Louis Garcia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he could not imagine anyone wanting to harm his younger brother.
He was a friendly person with a great heart.
His way of connecting with his family was to always cook us something, prepare us the dinner," Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to participate in any kind of dispute.
He was the brother who swam with the stream.
"With everything going wrong in the world, he was this unflattering diamond that lit bright every day," he said.
Anyone who has information on the case will be asked to call the SFPD telephone number under number 415-575-4444.
