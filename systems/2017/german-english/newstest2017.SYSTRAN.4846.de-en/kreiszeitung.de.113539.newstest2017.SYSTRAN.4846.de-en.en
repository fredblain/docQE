Doping still determines the headlines at the Rio Olympics.
Russian swimmer Julija Jefimowa, who had endured her starting right just before the Games, was mercilessly exhausted and boosted at her start (100 metres of breast).
There was a scurry scene: with a laid-out smile she was still strolling into the hall and had provoked with her appearance.
When she realised she wasn't going to pick gold, the audience broke into a jubilant storm.
But there are still many other athletes who go to the start despite doping past at the Rio Olympics.
Here is an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100-m-Staffel / USA): The 34-year-old is among the most controversial figures in lightweight athletics.
He was already locked two times for doping (2001 and 2006 until 2010).
Since his bann, the 2004 Olympic champion and ex-world champion runs even faster than before, he is over 100m in 9.80 seconds the world's number one and is considered the biggest challenger to Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100-m-Staffel / Jamaica): The two-time Olympic champion and seven-times world champion had to sit off a six-month lock in 2010 after she was shown the intake of the painkiller oxycodon.
She had strong dental pain after surgery, defying the 29-year-old.
Sandra Perkovic (discussion / Croatia): In 2011, the 2012 Olympic champion, world champion and European champion tested positive for the banned stimulant methylamine from 2010 to 2016.

This year, the 30-year-old is over 200 and 400m the world's fastest man.
Iwan Tichon (Hammerwurn, Belarus): probably hardly any athlete has been deterred by so many medals.
