The depressing eating of the economic crisis in "a plentiful meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his rise to the president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch in the Oval Office.
As gourmets, President Roosevelt had a faible for refined delicacies of Fifth Avenue such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup.
His menu that day was slightly more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potato püree and as dessert a plum pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," Jane Ziegelman said.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added, "It was also a message to Americans how they should eat."
The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coe's last book, "Chop Suey," was from Chinese cuisine in the USA, while Ziegelman told "97 orchard" about living in a residential home on the Lower East Side from the food perspective.
Her latest collaboration, "A Decent meal," which will appear at Harper Verlag on Tuesday, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity as they met with a reporter at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, snappy snack in the FlatIron District, which has already been in business since the 1929 stock market crash.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, turkey with potato püree and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered hackers, this found the pair fit for a discussion about eating in the era of the Great Depression.
"Wealthy foods were very popular," Ziegelman said.
There were peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.
They were made of an ingredient and something cheap that stretched the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.
Coe gringest.
"It must have been in the stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table in an American household, especially in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Women's teams cooked for male field workers and freshly baked pastete was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the first world war. "A Square Meal" painted the ways the country went about not being the land of sheep.
"It was a time when food became a central, tense issue for Americans," Coe added, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Just as tense was the new budget diet: Secrecy foods such as brote and cashier reels were made to staple, the cashier role as a "wonderful way to reuse food remains," Ziegelman noted, as cooks could hide unsavoury ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dry fruit.
Meat, which for years was the focus of American cuisine, became a rarely served luxury.
Peculiar mixtures were tried as a calorie-rich and nourishing satisfaction took precedence over taste or even healthy kitchen mind.
During her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from that era, baked onions with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition at lunch," says Coe.
Ziegelmann continues: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter and baked onions don't suit each other.
It was typical of many of the house economy recipes.
As never before, or ever since, household economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - are pushing the country's eating habits like that.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "budget politicians" and to meet the challenge of turning pampe like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
"A Square Meal" is a celebration of historical delicacies.
Particularly tasty are the reports of the government's response to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's Lass-me-cake-eating attitude.
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen, he saved like the millions-heavy man of world he has become.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He was sitting in an almost gold-plated dining room and wearing a smoking.
He was gloriously alien.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if not his wife Eleanor had asked him to statualize an exempt with his stomach.
As described in the book, the hallmark of a housekeeper with no interest in flavors by Ms. Roosevelt led to the White House producing the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most trosty."
Many of the species from the Great Depression era to deal with food were discarded once the country got back on its feet.
The legacy is based on our continued focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as how science was applied to food.
The couple admitted to having better understood Ziegelman's eating habits when writing the book - for example, how she couldn't throw away food.
"She had a real fear of wasting food," Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled: "She actually made people sick."
There was the windbag incident.
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, they and Coe drew a dessert that they had prepared at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt was enjoying at lunch.
"It's called Prune Whip," Ziegelman said, adding that it was a common trick to miss a more modest recipe.
There was no swollen cream, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly appeared a spoon in the teeth, brown glibbers.
Astonishingly, it wasn't bad.
Coe took a hit three times.
Like a Can-Do budgeter, he said to his wife, "A few hacked walnuts would help."
