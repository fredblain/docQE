Donald Trump election campaign charged after staff allegedly pulled gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign has been accused of alleged inaction after it was announced that her campaign director for North Carolina was targeting a shooting gun on an employee in February while traveling in a Jeep.
The incident is described in an indictment filed Wednesday in Charlotte State Court by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in that state.
Bordini admitted having waited for months that the matter would be regulated internally before realising that "that would not happen."
The campaign manager, Earl Philip, "pulled a pistol, put his right finger on the deduction, and rammed the run into Vincent's knee throat," Bordini admitted in his indictment.
After complained to the local and regional campaign management, Bordini noted that at least four other people had already made the same experience with Phillip, he admitted in the indictment.
"Guns don't have to be fired to cause damage," Bordini admitted.
The indictment comes just two days after the Republican presidential front-runner triggered an uptick when he told a crowd in North Carolina that "second amendment people" - gun owners and gun friends - should take action if his rivaline Hillary Clinton is elected and appoint judges.
Trump's campaign made it clear that the media would have torn his words out of context and that he would not incur violence.
Bordini's complaint demands damages from the campaign for the breach of duty of care and Philip for the violation of the law and permanent psychological damage.
Trump's press spokeswoman Hope Hicks was unable to reach an opinion.
Attempts to contact Philip were just as wrong.
WCCB, a local intelligence officer in Charlotte, says Phillip is no longer a campaign employee.
There was no response to calls at his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has so far run a controversial campaign.
The trial is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS -14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
