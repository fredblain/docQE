Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by battle with trainer's cancer to rowing victory
There will be no more emotinous gold than in these games and that wants what.
From the first rowing blow to the last, 220 hard Hieve, which went into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an extra meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though it was only those who sat at the ruder, there were three voices in the boat, the echo of the coach Robin Williams, was all-present as they ruined the second Olympic gold in the second without a tax woman in a row, the first women in the history of British sport to set such a benchmark.
Her dominance was absolute, even her 39.unadulterated bet, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes who glide across the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the type of triumph.
Behind every gold in rowing, a battalion is set up by willing helpers who contribute to the incremental advances that make up the difference and it was no-one more comfortable than the coach who didn't know 30 months ago whether he would survive that day when cancer was diagnosed with him.
As he said, he was risky.
I had bladder cancer that is operational and that's what they did.
If you don't do that, he spreads everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were lucky that he was able to start treatment in early 2014, outside the season, which kept the disruption to a minimum, if that is the right term in such circumstances.
I needed money, so I had to get better again soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would suffice.
That's how it starts.
Rurowing in itself is already a challenge, but it makes it even bigger.
In the immediacy of victory, her first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve-wracking morning talking a little more than usual, trying to process his own fears.
Stanning, who was a principal at the Royal Artillery Regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, said "I was an emotional wreck this week, maybe something extremely extreme, but it means so much."
It just repeats how much I mean how much I and Helen and Robin have worked.
It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we would be no one, so a massive thank you to him, he is the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have liked a better person to train or a better coach.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the past five years.
The pair had a hard rhythm that their opponents couldn't match.
Even in the last 500 metres, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to close, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were trapped very much at the moment.
Helen called "stay in the process, stay in the process."
It's really important not to let yourself go.
We had a good start and at the same time we weren't looking to make something.
We didn't want a fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, which we did too.
The pair will take a time off for a year before making decisions about their future.
Glover will have to appear at a wedding next week, her own with TV adventurer Steve Backshalle.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say that was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London, it took around six months to realise I'm an Olympic champion.
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed.
Here it took about four minutes.
That feels so much better," she said.
