Berlin / Schwerin: Poll before country election: SPD and CDU lose
In the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (September 4th) and Berlin (September 18th) significant losses are emerging for the governing parties SPD and CDU.
These were representative surveys of the opinion research institute INSA for the "Bild" newspaper (Friday).
While the red-black government coalition could rule narrowly in the north, this is not possible after the poll values in Berlin.
In both federal states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would have a good chance of continuing to face the head of the government.
In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, the SPD fell from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
According to the survey, the party would only be close to the CDU, which could come back to 23 percent.
Third place is controversial between the left and the AfD.
The left would come to 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), the AfD would represent 19 percent for the first time in the country day.
Despite slight losses, the Greens fell again into the Schwerins Landtag, with 6 percent (previously 8.7 percent).
NPD and FDP would not represent 3 percent in the country day.
According to the Berlin Chamber of Deputies, the Poll would only be 23 percent (election 2011: 28.3 percent).
The CDU only reached 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
They were still behind the Greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent) but before the left at 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented at the Chamber of Deputies for the first time at 14 percent.
At 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return that pirates would miss the entry in contrast to 2011.
