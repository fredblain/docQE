Puzzles around fish landed in garden in Banff
A Banff resident called for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that the 75 fish could be sand eels, spinning out of a fountain.
Mr Bain, who lives around 500 metres from the sea, posted a video of the spectacle on Periscope hoping someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish.
