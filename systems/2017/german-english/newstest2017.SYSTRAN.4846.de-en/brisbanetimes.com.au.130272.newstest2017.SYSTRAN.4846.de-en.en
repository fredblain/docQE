Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
It's fascinating watching how the world changes.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, rather preferring to spend their leisure time on screens, has been lamented by many over the last decade.
Pokemon Go is about getting people out of the sofa and getting more active.
The time at the screen was initially on the television, then on video games and most recently on smartphones.
So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities don't mutually exclude each other.
I refer, of course, to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters originally created for the video games in the 1990s (later created a series of characters, game cards and other spin-offs).
Like many phenomena of pop culture, interest before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand fell in early July.
Market introduction in other countries was shifted by the massive demand that overloaded the servers.
Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémons, which are tracked with a GPS and, once found, can be "photographed" (via a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "captured."
A generation that played the game when she was even younger joined the craze and jumped for the search from the sofa.
In the United States, the game led to a significant increase in steps that the "average" person replaces every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that traces 35,000 users, told the Washington Post recently that within two days of the game's launch, the number of folks who train for 30 minutes every day, from 45 percent to 53 percent, was demanding.
The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data on performance.
Many public health education campaigns that want people to "take 30 minutes" to "get out of the sofa" and "be active every day" stir on deaf ears because many public messages to health are boring and come from people who look eleven.
Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overvalued.
Whoever drives sports regularly reduces his chances of suffering from cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that is fun for them.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.
Some people even close new friendships.
As always, there are also mouthful playoffs that always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could run against a door.
What should?
A breakthrough has occurred.
Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit were already tracking our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to drive sports as it does this game.
The new will lose its appeal and the use will decrease over time.
However, due to Pokemon's success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the active world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.
