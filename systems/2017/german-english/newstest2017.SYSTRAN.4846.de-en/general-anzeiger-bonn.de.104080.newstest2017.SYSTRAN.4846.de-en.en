In the name of the fight against terrorism, laws are constantly being violated.
After the latest attacks, Interior Minister de Maizière is now presenting a thick security package.
But what has a tolerance status to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say to all that?
Thomas de Maizière gives the conciliatory.
All his proposals are "politically reasonable" for the coalition partner, says the Federal Interior Minister when presenting his new security package.
They don't overrule anyone.
Other, broader points would initially be discussed within the parties.
I also participate in that.
As an interior minister, however, he is interested in results and in a "workable consensus" within the coalition.
After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, De Maizière has taken a little time away before presenting his conclusions for security in the Republic.
But these are all the more extensive.
Some are already familiar, announcing that a new security agency is to crack down on cracking encrypted communications.
Nor does Germany have to implement several EU requirements on passenger data and gun rights.
The call for more video surveillance and staff for the security agencies is also not surprising.
In part, de Maizière is launching a second start for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD: he wants to criminalise sympathy for terrorist groups and knock off jihadists with dual citizenship, the German passport.
"These will be difficult points for the SPD," the CDU man admits.
He considers this to be reasonable, nor does he claim anything that has no chance at the coalition partner anyway.
A few new ideas are also presented to de Maizière.
They are partly in themselves: he plans fast-track procedures for detachment and more ways of detaining people from deportation.
Refugees who are specifically picked up into the country are to check their smartphones before, disclosing social media accounts for a security review.
He wants to make some even worse for rejected asylum seekers than before - such as those committing crimes or deliberately throwing away their papers to conceal their identity.
Some of it is politically and legally sensitive.
Some are also still impacting, leaving questions open.
And on some points - in the unequal treatment of patience, for example - the question arises: what does this actually have to do with security and terror?
Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror.
But it cannot be denied that the attackers of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people worried about security, given the high numbers of refugees.
And things that deeply employed people could not be excluded even during election campaigns.
Internal security has been hugely concentrated.
Only the attacks in the neighbourhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The uncertainty is great.
And yes, there are election campaigns.
The Union and SPD are therefore increasingly concerned about internal security.
In the past few days, the two parties have been high.
Only a garish dispute over the equivalence of the federal police, then through a security policy collection of some unions interior ministers, in which department chiefs also call for a burqa ban and a departure from dual citizenship.
De Maizière is also tired of conciliatory sounds here.
From a departure from the double pass, he holds nothing.
We have befriended the discussion in Germany.
To re-establish it does not make sense.
And in a burqa ban, he has constitutional concerns.
Whether his own package is constitutional on all corners, and whether it is actually "reasonable" for the coalition partner, has yet to show up.
There are some things that could cause controversy.
But the SPD is also trying to profile itself on internal security.
Party leader Sigmar Gabriel only once signalled cautious conversation, saying: "The SPD is willing to talk about everything that helps to further increase security."
