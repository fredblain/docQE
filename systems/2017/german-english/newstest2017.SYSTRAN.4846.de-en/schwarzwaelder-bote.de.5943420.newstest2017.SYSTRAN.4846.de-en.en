Nagold: Play and fun at summer-free
Eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and teenagers of the social-educational group / social group work of the child protection federation Nagold with their carers at their summer-free in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
In the quietly located Hardtwäldle recreation home, the life-pleasing group was quartered during the first school holiday week.
Several full-day trips were on the programme.
On the one hand, it went after brettings with the visit of the Steigenzoos.
Secondly, Maulbronn, where there was a special child guide in the world-famous monastery.
The third trip led to Pforzheim.
At the Celtenmuseum in Hochdorf, the group learned a lot about the everyday life and food of the Celts.
On the hot days, the group sailed on Deep Lake in Maulbronn, which invited to jump, swim and plan.
Children and carers were cultivated with their self-prepared body dishes such as the Spätzle, Lake Pfännle, Iselshauser-Bloff, English breakfast and Tübinger Bolognese.
Workshops were made, beautiful jewellery made of pearls and stones, or made of wood a Roman mill game.
Other highlights of the leisure were fishing in a nearby pond, the evenings on fire and the final "Bunte evening."
On the day of home travel, the sun laughed and the children and young people were happy.
