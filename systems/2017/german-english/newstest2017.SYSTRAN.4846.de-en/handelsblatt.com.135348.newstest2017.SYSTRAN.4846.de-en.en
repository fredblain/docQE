Here comes the Enforcement Trailer
Germany's Rinters have to adjust to the next generation of speed knives: in different federal states, including Hesse and Brandenburg, new lightning devices are being tested that are supposed to carry pace sinners particularly effectively.
Vitronic's futuristic enforcement trailer from Wiesbaden can be used at accident spots, for example, where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, at motorway construction sites or to gentle bridges with tempolitic tempoles, there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that the speed limit is met with a stationary lightner.
However, a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly.
The Enforcement Trailer is autark: Its battery holds five days in uninterrupted measuring operation, the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem.
With laser measuring technology, all vehicles can also be captured across multiple tracks.
Variable speed limits as well as passage bans by time, driving strips and vehicle class can also be monitored.
The trailer can be moved in the high-powered state, according to manufacturers with any car clutch.
In order for it not to be simple, it is lowered in the measuring operation, so the wheels disappear in the armored and, incidentally, shot outer shell.
In addition, a built-in alarm system will protect the lightner from vandalism.
Since 2015, the trailer has been tested and now used in various federal states, according to Vitronic.
Foreign authorities are also blitzing with the new technology: Younger France has ordered 100 pieces after an order of 150 pieces last year.
