Post rises into trade in electric transporters
An electric delivery vehicle of Deutsche Post in action.
The interest of other companies is apparently great.
The Mail plans to sell its electric vehicle Streetscooter as well.
The group will shortly start trading the transporter.
The Mail will also offer its electric transporters on the free car market from next year.
"We want to get into sales to third parties," a post spokesman said on Friday.
The company has been checking for months whether to sell its self-developed street scooter, with the letters and packs, to other businesses as well.
Post board member JÃ¼rgen Gerdes had said there were always questions such as craftspeople.
According to information from the news magazine "Der Spiegel", the Bonner Group wants to enter into mass production of the vehicles shortly.
In postown manufacturing, the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars a year and shift.
Gerdes announced that the group would significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and long-term a full shift to environmentally friendly vehicles.
"We will make a very, very robust move towards 2020," he said at the end of July.
I can imagine that we will change the fleet.
The street scooter has been active on Germany's roads since 2014.
