London schoolgirl who follows IS was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join the IS, reportedly died in Syria.
Attorney Tasnime Akunjee said her family learned from her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
It was believed she was killed by a Russian air raid in Raqqa, the group's bulwark in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and died, according to her family, shortly after she pretended to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
"You can only hope that the only good thing lies in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - people from ever making that decision," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London stepped into a plane heading towards Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months.
