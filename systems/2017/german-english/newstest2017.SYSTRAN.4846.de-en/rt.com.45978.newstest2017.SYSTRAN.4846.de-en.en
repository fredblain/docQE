Police set tear gas & rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students met with police on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo as they gathered to protest against government reforms for the public education system.
Police set up tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The difficulties began when police officers tried to evade the students, resulting in police deploying rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students attended the demonstrations to express their dismay at the plans.
According to the proposals of the governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, fewer than 100 public schools are being closed, while 300,000 students are being implemented to save money.
Some of the protest participants were seen spraying graffitits against provisional president Michel Temer to walls.
The latest protests occurred several days after protesters took to the streets in crowds to support suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been removed from office by a Senate vote to leave.
