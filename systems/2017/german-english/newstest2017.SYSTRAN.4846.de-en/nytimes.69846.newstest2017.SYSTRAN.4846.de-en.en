"A generation protested" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the U.S.
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political changes in Ethiopia stalled at violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say that a few protesters were killed during clashes with police during shooting.
Is Ethiopia just collapsing?
Over the past decade, it has been one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.
But in recent months, protests against the government have shaken the country and spread into more and more areas.
Last week, thousands of people stormed onto the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.
The government's response was merciless, according to human rights organizations.
Witnesses said police shot and killed officers on a few unarmed protesters.
Video about the protests, presumably from the last or early this year, shows how security people are beating young people with sticks, while these were forced to make a handstand against a wall.
The head of the U.N. human rights authority now calls for an in-depth investigation.
"It has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is estimated by the West.
American military and intelligence services are working closely with the Ethiopians to fight terror threats beyond the region, especially in Somalia, but only a few countries in Africa receive so much Western aid.
Ethiopia's economy expanded at a significant pace.
Its infrastructure has improved drastically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.
The roads are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Even though Ethiopia was anything but a role model for democracy - human rights organizations have continued to cite repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, with dissidents effectively silenced.
Many were sent into exile or jail, killed or driven into the desert.
But that could change.
"If you suppress people and don't have other options other than to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia.
The whole youth protested.
A generation protested.
There are numerous complaints covering everything from land use to stranglehold on power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of parliament.
At the same time, tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea; a battle for this crunchy, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less confined in recent years, could exploit the turmoil and arm themselves again.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness are now exploding after years of falling under the surface.
The first seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years have many Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media as cheaper smartphones became more common and internet services improved.
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does regularly, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies that hide where they are staying.
Several young Ethiopians said they were so gathered to protest.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
Since Eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia's mostly Christian Highlands, prospered in politics and economy while exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslim and live in flat land areas.
But that too is changing.
"We are in the process of coordinating under an umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The largest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, which account for around 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia's prime minister until his death in 2012 for 17 years.
He was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think of corners.
Analysts say he was particularly adept at exercising early signs of discontent and using special agents to edit opponents and make them harmless.
"The current regime lacks this fundamental skill," said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively opaque reasons to take Mr Mele's position.
Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of North Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.
Many fear the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such an uptick was in 2005 after thousands protested against elections that, according to analytics, were seemingly swept away by the government and subsequently stolen.
During the following raids, many protesters were killed, even though it was less than in recent months and this period of unrest went relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, like the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in fighting poverty.
But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the Ethiopian government's internal misgivings.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month protesters at Gondar, an amharic city, Tigray-led business, and hatred of the Tigray become increasingly popular on social media.
Analysts say the protests put the U.S. and other Western allies in a peculiar position.
The American government used Ethiopia as a base for drones over neighbouring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it was closing this base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile area.
"This," Mr. Abdi said, "is a very thin grate migration."
