Ma Long in his own league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion.
The 27-year-old defeated his compatriot and "title defender" Zhang Jike 4:0 (12.5.4.4) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro in a one-sided final.
Thus, the world rankings first took the "Golden Grand Slam" with successes at World Cup, World Cup, World Tour final and Olympia.
Bronze went to Japanese Jun Mizutani.
The two Chinese made it into the final game as expected and made the title one among themselves.
It was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would pick the single title in the five rings.
Last non-Chinese at the top Olympic staircase was former SVS-NÖ legionaire Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left on the plate alone, between the sentences and during time-outs they had no coaches in themselves.
They had moved back to the gallery and left their protectors alone in the fair competition.
"The matches to here I played for my country."
"In the finals I play for myself," Zhang had consistently said.
After the match, gold and silver medal winners competed with the China flag.
The match itself was unexpectedly biased.
Ma had really struggled with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first set.
After that, he set the pace at the plate, leaving Zhang with a total of 13 points.
The superiority of Ma did not develop the expected match.
Nevertheless, there were nonetheless plenty of breathtaking ball changes.
Mizutani won the match for bronze against 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4:1.
In his quarter-final against the German European champion, Dimitrij Ovtcharov, the white russe had a rib injury, was then in medical treatment, had to settle "eventually" with bleach.
The Swedes Jan-Ove Holland (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008), by the way, were in similarly high table tennis age Olympic fourth.
