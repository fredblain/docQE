Bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Several dead
The Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, said Foreign Ministry spokesman Thomas Schnöll, Friday morning.
She suffered cut wounds and was treated in hospital, but has already been able to leave.
Her journey home planned her for early September.
Whether the further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket, as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon are also affected by Austrian citizens, is still unclear for the time being.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities in this regard, said Schnöll.
Hua Hin, located around 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok, initially exploded two bombs on Thursday evening in a fortnight.
According to police, a Thai altercation was killed and around 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
On Friday morning, two explosives went up again, killing another person, according to the authorities.
A bomb explosion was also reported in the early morning by Phuket.
A taxi driver was injured during the detonation near the Patong beach, popular with holidaymakers.
Another bomb exploded in Surat Thani on the country's south east coast, killing an urban employee.
According to the authorities, the explosion was in the air, according to the authorities in a flower beet.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south west coast, as well as in Chumphon on the south east coast, were still called for.
There is a connection between the explosions in Hua Hin, it said.
"The bomb attacks carry the same handwriting," Army General Danai Kritmethavee told journalists Friday morning.
"We assume it is a coordinated attack."
It is too early to comment on possible motives - but it is probably the actions of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also wanted to identify a pattern typical of the bomb attacks of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
Thai police, on the other hand, said the attacks were not related to the Islamist uprising movement or international terrorism.
"This is only local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces," a spokesman in Bangkok said.
It is assumed that the bombs were placed by opponents of the ruling military junta.
In the past few days, the authorities would have received intelligence on upcoming attacks in the south of the country - though they were not informed of the exact timing and location.
It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.
Police instructed their officials across the country to step up security around key government buildings as well as airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.
In Thailand, there are always smaller bombings, but mostly they do not target tourists.
Hua Hin is home to a palace used for years by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
After the bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its homepage that the instructions of the Thai security authorities be given.
High security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and surroundings.
After clashes between security forces and Muslim populations, there is no need to travel to these provinces.
Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place just days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.
This gives the military great influence over the coming years too.
Junta chief and prime minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs had been an attempt to stir chaos while the country moved toward stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.
Military Unta, which seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, is holding itself back to having led the kingdom back to stability and order.
However, the military has also failed to manage the uprising of Muslim rebels in the far south of the country for years.
More than 6500 people have already been killed in the conflict.
Just over a year ago, 20 people were killed in Bangkok in an attack on a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.
It was the bloodiest attack on the country's recent history.
