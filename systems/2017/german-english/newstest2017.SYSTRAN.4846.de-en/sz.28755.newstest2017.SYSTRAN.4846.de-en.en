Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
E-mail and Internet: 20 years ago Nokia Communicator entered the market.
The successors dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iphone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it was not good.
On the contrary, it was pretty big.
The built-in memory initially was eight megabytes, which would now be for roughly two selfies with high resolution.
An iphone is now being delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 communicator" came into the shops exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996 - and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the devices on the internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age.
Twenty years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the Cebit computer fair in Hanover as an "office in the western pocket format."
In fact, the new mobile phone could be a lot for then standards: SMS and emails could be sent and received, even via fax was reachable by communicator.
Even access to websites was possible via HTML browsers, albeit agonically slow.
A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be sounded like a laptop.
Then there was a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.
The price was very proud: 2700 Deutschmark, i.e. around 1400 Euros.
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.
No one could see in August 1996 that the communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.
Since then, everything has been different.
The smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.
The Finns cell phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster, eventually sold to Microsoft.
The market today dominates operators, all of whom came much later than Nokia.
Anytime and everywhere online, this is today for a very many people.
In 2015, there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide.
Some 1.4 billion devices were sold, and Samsung and Apple alone accounted for 555 million pieces.
Global sales with the devices are around 400 billion euros.
This includes the well-run business of countless app operators and telecommunications companies.
A whole industry has now emerged around the smartphone.
The decisive breakthrough to the mass market only came in early 2007, then Apple chief Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhones at Mac World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an internet communicator to ease everything by touch screen.
Apple's victory began, even today the iphone is the group's most important product.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, which dominated the market, had the aftertaste.
They eventually vanished, Blackberry has to fight.
Sawing now has Apple and Asian operators like Samsung.
The smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention.
On average, every German now looks at his mobile phone 88 times a day.
"We must all learn to put the smartphone away," said Janina Kugel, the Siemens Board for Staff.
Permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing.
