One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and everyday
In the small HR-V, Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coup√© and also the versatility of a minivans.
It sounds pretty overloaded, but the HR-V, built on the same new platform as the new Jazz, is actually proving extremely flexible in everyday life.
Although the HR-V is only 1.60 m high, passengers have plenty of space both in the first row and in the rear, it does not work closely at any point.
The materials of the interior are well processed and pleasant, but only the cockpit side falls down there.
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles.
Not only is there a boot of 453 l at high and 1026l in folded backrest, but there are the "Magic Seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: the back benches of the back bench can be flapping like a cinema chair, and thus offer storage space that is 1.24m high from floor to ceiling.
The boot can be loaded well, but the loading height at 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1.6-l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp speeds up the HR-V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.
He should, however, carry out his work quietly.
The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing.
There's another motorisation: a 1.5-l gasoline with 96 kW / 130 hp.
All-wheel drive is not offered.
Driving is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
But the steering should be a bit more direct.
The equipment leaves no wishes open in the tested top variant "executive".
Security systems include the City emergency brake wizard (working up to Tempo 32), the collision warning system and the track keeping assistant.
The collision Warner sometimes irritates because he assesses many obstacles as "approaching objects" when ranking.
The remote light assistant works very reliably.
And the intelligent speed controller reacts to traffic signs and drops the speed when required.
However, full connectivity exists only for top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, Navi, app integration and more.
Two USB and HDMI connectors are under the armrest and are therefore a bit cumbersome.
The approximately 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.
Those who don't want to invest so much will receive the gasoline from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23,000 euros.
The engines meet the Euro 6 exhaust standard.
Honda offers a versatile and everyday car with the HR-V.
