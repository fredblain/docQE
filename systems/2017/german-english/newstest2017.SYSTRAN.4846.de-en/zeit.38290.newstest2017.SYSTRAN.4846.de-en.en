Old buildings, a few lindenages, interbetween still a remnant pavement: The Rigaer Strasse in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not look like that at first glance, but police count it among the city's "dangerous places."
If you walk down the street from east to west, you will get past playgrounds, a freshened nursery and a biolade.
To the fa√ßade of a grey house, someone sprayed "ugly!"
Compared with a Lidl that will soon be demolished, it is already being built: a house with high windows and 133 new rentals will be created by 2017 here.
However, articles about this "trendy district," as the responsible property company Friedrichshain calls it, are being given preferential treatment in recent weeks.
The reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, now the residents have rental contracts, but the ground floor still occupies rooms and is used for events.
In particular, the Berlin interior senator, Henkel, had spoken out several times since the beginning of the year in favour of a tough police action against the project, describing the area as a "no-go zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.
After June 22, the rooms on the ground floor, the Cadterschmiede, with 300 police officers, were patrolled by police for three weeks, according to official statements, with 30 to 40 officers and three crew cars on the ground, blocked parts of the street and stopped visitors entering the home with number 94.
Meanwhile, construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners.
On July 13, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the eviction had been illegal, and a day later police and construction workers moved under the jubilation of sympathizers and residents.
On this summer afternoon, the street acts peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the pavement in front of the houses in the sun, others entertain themselves in front of spawn.
A primary school and kindergartens are located close to the house projects.
Left-wing violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in the Kiev since 1999, and Jana *, who dragged three children here, are mainly from the police presence.
With the residents of the house projects, they share concerns about rising rents and gentrification.
It does not sound like a Kiev, which majority of the police protection from vandalating left.
The trench that the Berlin interior senator and police make up between homeowners and their neighbours so apparently does not exist.
Friedrichshain in eastern Berlin was actually a traditional worker district, which even today has low average income and high poverty risk compared to the rest of the city.
House occupations and the home-made projects have also long been part of the Kiev: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer road near the Rigaer.
While the Mainz had been cleared in a real street raid, many of the projects were legalised in the Rigaer and are still inhabited today by the people they occupied 26 years ago.
At the same time, in recent years, the district has become a magnet for tourists and election Berliners from all over the world: now residents from DDR times and former housekeepers are sharing their Kiev.
This is also noticeable in rents, which have risen by almost 60 percent in new rents since 2009.
Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: they are detained on sliced discs or freshly coated facades, which were thrown with colour bags.
No other road was so often mentioned this year along with the words "left-wing violence."
One reason that not all neighbors see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as the violation of bodies are almost exclusively against policemen.
Most of the offences are made up of material damage, which tend to hit new buildings and newly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a rental house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, there can be no talk of uncertainty.
As for acts of violence, it is appealing: the people in the 94 are their neighbours, who certainly have not been.
Even the famous burning cars will no longer exist directly in the Rigaer.
For the architect, their street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "Here one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere".
Neugebauer deliberately moved to Rigaer Strasse - and stayed.
That is why it was also so important for the residents to get their streets back: from the police, the politics and the media, all of them suddenly claiming sovereignty over the district in July.
But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the street continues to be taken away from them: through faceless new buildings in former construction gaps that squeeze the old residents.
"These are ultimately property apartments that are not interesting for many here - here are more people who are not so well beguiling," she says.
"I absolutely cannot approve of violence and destruction."
But what should you do if you never listen to someone?
There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the residents.
Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for Zugezon, who annoys himself over colour bombs, and the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiev.
Anyone who draws should be aware of it - just like someone pulling into a pub neighborhood can complain badly about noise there.
