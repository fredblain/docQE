U.N.-backed troops say they regain full control of Manbij from Islamic State
U.S.-backed troops have conquered full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city left them, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
The Democratic forces of Syria (DKS) are currently hampering the city after the excerpt of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves inside the city.
They freed over 2,000 civilians held hostage by fighters, shared Sharfan Darwish of the Reuters military council allied with the DKS.
"The city is under perfect control now, but we are just carrying out clean up," he told Reuters.
