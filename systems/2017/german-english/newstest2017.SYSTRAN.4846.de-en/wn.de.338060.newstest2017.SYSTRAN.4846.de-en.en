De Maizière said that after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people would be worried about further attacks.
The state must respond calmly and decisively to terror threats.
What is certain is that our country will not answer the violence of perpetrators with hatred and division.
We will not give the terrorists this triumph.
However, if criminals have to leave the country more quickly, this increases security and also the popular consent for refugee policy.
De Maizière wants to achieve the implementation of the proposals until the 2017 federal election.
He also announced further human reinforcement of security forces, "on a medium-sized scale over several years."
Sympathy advertising terrorism must be punished again.
Video surveillance is to be improved in such a way that the right of arms is revised so that the purchase of weapons on the Internet is more difficult.
According to de Maizières, the most recently discussed obligation for doctors is to be preserved.
However, in dialogue with physicians, he wants to look for solutions to reduce the vulnerability of citizens, he said, looking at mental striking.
To counter the radicalisation of refugees, the minister considers better social care to be necessary.
Teachers must be better prepared for dealing with traumatised people.
To prosecute criminals in specific areas of the Internet (Darknet), de Maizière plans to use disguised investigators.
SPD chief Gabriel said: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps further increase security."
It is important that the Minister of the Interior clearly opposed action.
"That was a slap in the face for sharpeners in CDU / CSU," Gabriel told the Funke Media Group newspaper (Friday).
De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the union following a burqa ban and the abolition of dual nationality.
A general ban on full concealment considers it constitutionally problematic.
You cannot ban everything you reject and I reject the wearing of the burqa.
We can talk about rules for example in road traffic or for witnesses.
Greens leader Simone Peter warned the minister that he wanted to simulate power and ability to act with ever-new anti-terror packages.
Left party leader Bernd Riexinger said: "Fleet spells and a tightening of the right of residence don't bring more security to the people of this country."
