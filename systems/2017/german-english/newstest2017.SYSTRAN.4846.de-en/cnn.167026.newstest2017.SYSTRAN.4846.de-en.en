Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I imagine under the women's Olympic team in the turret, for more than a reason.
First, I have been at every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant.
And second: this team has three turners, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who were inspiring for many young girls of other skin color.
The structure of this team, which is Aly Raisman, who is JÃ¼din and Madison Kocian, who is a Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the USA.
It solidified black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
In the past four years, number one among female turners was an Afro American.
Last year were Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2.
It shows strength.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic win and America jubilant.
Now the world was able to be witness to the incredible performance of triple world champions Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez as they delivered unexpected but masterful gymastic routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American to win gold at an individual multi-fighting event for women.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We are witnessing the top of this sport, but so do turn classes across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all suggested the same path as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.
They are the "Last Five," because the next Olympic man will have only four turners in the team, and that is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.
But the reality is that Turnen is an expensive sport, and Turner is primarily in private tournaments, which are maintained by parents who pay for the training, set-up, travel, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their turners and families); the list can be continued anywhere.
The majority of these turnaround clubs are in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.
In these clubs, the Turner will receive their entire training and that is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started the turret.
We must allow the communities aun innumerable, young girls, inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a more accessible and accessible tournament training.
I founded my Turn Foundation of 20 years.
At my events, we offered free and affordable tournaments in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youth (mainly black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer youth high quality tournaments that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Turnen develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.
It's the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to be interested in the turret and that's great.
It is so important to participate in sport, especially for girls.
It's such an exciting time.
Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby, Gabby, and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by the hols of the Olympic team and thanks, motivating so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way of becoming healthy, strong and successful young women.
