Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return on Friday, which found an income of $US10.75 million for Democrats and her husband, and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $US1 million for charitable purposes, mostly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton generated almost $US5.3 million in speech fees; the former Secretary of State gave an income of $US3 million by the publisher Simon & Schuster for her book about her tenure at the Foreign Office.
Clinton's nominee for the vice presidency, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, together with his wife Anne Holton, is publishing his tax returns of the past decade.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards regarding financial transparency," Clinton's Kampagnenhelferin Jennifer Palmieri said in an opinion statement.
In a stark way, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and backers to publish his tax returns in relation to his past promises.
It is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, even though they are obliged by law.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have indicated a tax audit by the tax authorities as reason for his refusal.
"They are on the move," Clinton's campaign director Ian Sams wrote on Twitter, referring to the release of the presidential candidates.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's special adviser, said to CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish anything before tax audits are not completed.
Trump's critics, including Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, have already made it clear that his refusal raises questions about assets, his donations for charitable organizations, his business dealings and various other connections, especially with Russia.
Clinton has already plunged on the issue, posting a video on the internet on Friday, in which high-ranking Republicans Trump called for his tax return to be released.
On Thursday, she also addressed the issue during a speech on the Michigan economy.
"He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and releases his tax returns," she said to the crowd.
Politico has reported that Trump paid no or very little taxes during the 1990s for two years, and a New York Times economic journalist cited a number of tax lawyers and tax advisers on Friday who indicated that that still could be the case.
Federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign.
Clinton supports a scheme named after billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, who would ensure that people earning more than $US1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During an election campaign event for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate has its headquarters here, called on Trump to meet with a meeting to discuss their tax returns.
Buffett said he had also undergone a tax audit of the IRS and Trump had "fear" before voters and not before the tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has released tax returns back to 2007.
The Clintons, now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid an effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014, and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
The 2015 Clinton's tax return showed that these only earned USD 100 of their income as wages, unlike most Americans.
Their main money investment was a low-cost index fund, from which Clinton's dividends and earnings of $US109,000 were taxed.
