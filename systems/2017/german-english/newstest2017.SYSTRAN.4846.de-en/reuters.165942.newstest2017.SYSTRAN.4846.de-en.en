Gilead gets legal costs from hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A U.S. official ruled Gilead Sciences Inc was entitled to the reimbursement of the legal costs incurred from the Hepatits C legal dispute with pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was cleared of a $200 million damages payment for violating Merck's two patents, which were related to blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead after a U.S. judge revealed a pattern of wrongdoing by Mercks, including the Oath and other unethical actions.
In collecting the lawsuit on Thursday, U.S. Office Judge Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead claims to have incurred the costs incurred during the defence of the case.
Merck is trying to equalise with Gilead, which dominates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with lever disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck complained to each other and took possession of lab work to which Sofosbuvir was active, the active ingredient in Gilead drugs.
