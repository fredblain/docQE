Police: 3 victims shot in series murder of music listening in the car
According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot dead in one of the fatal attacks for the first time in a decade in the first serial murder of Phoenix, while heard in the car and heard music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis's daughter Maleah were shot dead on June 12 while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said.
The offender fired eight shots from a hand firearm while he stood on the front side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, in the report.
Police announced that the three-time murder did not appear to have been the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 who were in possession of one of the adult victims.
Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard's police spokesman said the shooting led the investigators to be a closer look at whether it is associated with four previous attacks.
Overall, predominantly in Hispanic residential areas, seven people were killed and two others injured in nine attacks in nine attacks.
's happening in a residential area in front of a house, "told Howard of KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, earlier this month.
It is believed the suspect used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators refused to disclose the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and committed by the same murderer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to her injuries and died later.
Liners, 31, and Ellis daughter Maleah still died on the ground.
One witness told police that it wasn't unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which was aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before three-time murder and which will be expected that it was the work of the serial killer.
Investigators found cartridges and secured a bullet from the seat as well as ball fragments from the motor room.
