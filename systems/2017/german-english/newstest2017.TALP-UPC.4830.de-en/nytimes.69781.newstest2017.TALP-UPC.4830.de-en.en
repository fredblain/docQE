The US wins fourth match in the women's field hockey, a showdown with Britain standing before
A day after she scored three goals during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the women's American field hockey team in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3-0.
Five goals in two games should actually be a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she could not remember that ever done.
I have no idea... she said.
I'm not among the people who retain their goals in memory.
However, they know the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the British in the first place that remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan.
Britain and the United States will meet in the last game of the first round on Saturday.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals, the game will decide which of the two will gain the first and second place each within their group of six teams.
The first-place will go for the strong Dutch slightly longer, leading the other group.
Whatever the game on Saturday, Americans have triggered a surprising swirling through their success stories, four years after they landed at the past London Games on the last of 12 places.
BAM was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years of a hockey in hands (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), with 16 years she became national player in the US, the youngest in the team's history.
She missed the Olympics in 2008, as she could not qualify for the cadre.
Then came the year in 2012, in which for her and her team, everything went wrong.
In the following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, trainer of the national team and things began to turn to better.
A culture change, a mental change and a physical change, said Bam.
We didn't have the workload in London that we have now.
We can have the rudder completely around.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the torrent in the first half of the game with a backhand from close range.
India had gone into the game without a victory in the tournament, but the team showed surprising and kept the game level from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.
They fell a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then dropped into the middle and lups the ball into the gate around the Americans creating a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.
The shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the goalkeeper of the US, Jackie Briggs, who has each had to book a goal in each of the previous games each.
She has a run.
Just like Bam.
We are in a good position, "said Parnham, but well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday.
