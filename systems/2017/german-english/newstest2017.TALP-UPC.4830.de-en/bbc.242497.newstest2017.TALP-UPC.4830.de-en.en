Queensferry Crossing: bridge now linked to Fife
The £1.35bn project is expected to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have linked the Norddeck of the Queensferry crossings with the viaduct - meaning the bridge is now associated with Fife.
It's the first of four closures of the blowers closer to completion around each of the bridge's three towers.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete as well as 46 slopes.
The £1.35bn project is expected to be completed by May 2017.
Economy minister Keith Brown stated the construction site today and was one of the first to get to the bridge from the country.
He said: "this is a historic and symbolic moment at the construction of the Queensferry crossings.
We are all witnessing an engineering art from a truly epic measure of this project with over 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge.
Despite the bridge's massive size and weight, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for the adjustment.
Overall, nearly 79 per cent of the total bridge decks in their place and the last section of the deck are getting a concrete concrete for the deck today, meaning that the entire deck is prepared to be raised on the bridge to its place.
Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "the first closure represents a significant milestone on every bridge project.
During this fantastic project, the closure of forward-looking civil engineering.
After installing the last road section and its compound with the expanding northern turkey, we then had to close the existing gap on the North or land side.
This was reached by pulling the northern feeding bridge 700 millimetres south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.
Massive as the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tonnes and had to be drawn at a slope of about 3 per cent.
Thorny, as the tolerances to which the team worked were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything was very good.
