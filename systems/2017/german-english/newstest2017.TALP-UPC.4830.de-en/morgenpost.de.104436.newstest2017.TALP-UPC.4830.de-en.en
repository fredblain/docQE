Trump doesn't see the impending election defeat
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a campaign event in Florida.
Should it be nothing with the election to the U.S. president, Donald Trump already has an alternative.
He then just rides into the holiday.
Losing Donald Trump the US presidential election in November, he would be the relatively needed: "ultimately it will either club, or I have a very, very beautiful, long holiday," the Republican candidate said in a phone interview with the US television channel CNBC.
If it doesn't range for him for reasons of political correctness, that's fine, Trump said.
He described U.S. President Barack Obama and the Democrats' candidate, Hillary Clinton, as founder of the Terrorism Islamic State (IS).
Within his party, more and more resistance formed.
