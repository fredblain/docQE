One for all cases
Honda HR-Vis flexible and everyday life
In the small HR-W Will Honda will tackle everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and even the versatility of a minivans.
Sounds quite overloaded, but the HR-V, which has been constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves very flexible in everyday life.
Although the only 1.60 m high HR is small, passengers have a lot of space in both the first row and in the Fond, it doesn't look tight.
The interior's materials are well processed and acting pleasantly, only the cockpit top side falls something.
Versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR-V at the storage room.
Not only is it a boot of 453 low at high-profile and 1066 litres at the reverse back opposition, but there's the Magic Seats.
This is less magical than it sounds like: the seating areas of the return leave like cinema chairs and offer storage space, which is high from the ground to blankets.
The boot can be charged well, but the load is slightly higher with 650 mm than at the comparable Peugeot in 2008.
The tested 1.6-litre diesel with 88 kW / 120 PS accelerates the HR-H thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in large speed areas very powerfully.
However, he is likely to do a little quieter his work.
Pleasingly, everyday consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km.
There is still another motoring: a 1.5-liter petrol with 96 kW / 130 HP.
A wheelchair drive is not being offered.
Driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between momentum and comfort.
The steering, however, is likely to be a little more direct.
The equipment leaves no desires open in the tested top variant of executive.
Security systems include the City emergency assistant assistant (works to pace 32), the collision warning system and the spurt assistant.
The collision warner is sometimes irritating because of ranking many obstacles than an approaching object.
Very reliable works the remote assistant.
And the intelligent Temporer responds to traffic recognition and threatens speed if needed.
However, there's full connectivity, though, only for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, Navi, app integration and more.
Two USB and an HDMI book are under the armrest and therefore are therefore something cumbersome.
The around £29,000 for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.
If you don't want to invest so much, it receives the gasoline from £20,000, the diesel from 23,000 euros.
The engines meet the Euro-6 exhaust.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
