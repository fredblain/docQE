Amid the rage of the Olympics, the ten of the trampoline
Wherever you are, how late it is, it's the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel consistent and inevitable, a rampant staff run between competition and pursuit.
It's as if the Olympic torch itself would be a burning staff, which is fed by the breakfast protection to the swimmer to the turner to the triathlete.
You can't turn on the television, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour's conversation in the queue in the coffee shop without listening to Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there is still Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is there for the first time at the Olympics and a woman's swarm with greens, could have been well under those known names being sent to Prime Time, built through sponsors and feel-good TV advertising when he would be a swimmer, turner or even fox.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, struggles in the Olympic trampoline around.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event equal.
Further away from the centre, partly in the shadows, the sports that are not generally recognised are air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwond.
We will always have the breast swim and may be long.
But if I likely make modest arguments for my certain darling, let me draw attention to the trampoline's discreet charm.
Although trampoline jumping has already been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had his debut in Sydney, it has been so sparsely perceived the last 16 years that many of them, I had interviewed, didn't know it was any Olympic sport.
That could also be regional ignorance.
Although the US sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping and by 2012 an athlete that made it to the final round.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
The trampoline jumping has a certain outsider low, in part because it sounds more appropriate for the unexplained ear for a close school than the one for the Olympics.
At this point I should admit that I'm not an expert but only an earthquake enthusiast.
It has humorous potential - the cartoonage of his never-ending impact - but also the grace of the turn and diving, the two sports that essentially unite.
The word trampoline comes from the Spanish el trampoline, which means as much as a springboard.
Emerging winners jump on a giant trampoline, shooting almost up to 30 feet into the air and must have a range of falling movements (turning, Hechten and Saltos) before landing on the feet.
They are being assessed, according to official Olympic programme after running, difficulty and flight flight.
Two-term athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will join each other in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight.
Medallists need to go further in their pursuit of gold, faster, up and down, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and back, up and down in the playground.
They don't just chase the finish line or the starting wall, but in television transmission also another goal: the world or the Olympics.
The targeted pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical - and it's enough to even touch a viewer to tears.
But it's also what I recognise myself at the viewing of these games as something tiring.
This offers the trampoline a breathing space.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is up.
A forward movement is not the goal.
He or she collapses, apparently heavily like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up again.
Even here there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise, there's no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.
It's so Zen as the competition at the Olympics can only be.
Women's qualification and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.
NBC will broadcast the finals as part of an afternoon block on both days from 2 p.m.
Amid the Olympic mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one which is likely to be overlooked in the general tumult.
If the awareness increase can only be achieved by the angst and the objectification of male athletes - as the male US Turner proposed recently, according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr Dooley expects his struggling, new fancy community.
