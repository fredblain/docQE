'A generation protest in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the US
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters who call for political changes in Ethiopia encountered violent resistance to the government.
Witnesses say that time protesters were killed during clashes with police in firing changes.
Is Ethiopia straight together?
Over the past decade, it was one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months, protests against the government have been the country and expanded into increasing numbers of areas.
Last week stormed thousands of people on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.
The government's response was ruthless, according to human rights organisations.
Witnesses said policemen shot and killed on unarmed protesters.
Circulating videos about the protests, which are presumably from the last or the beginning of this year, show security personnel beat young people with sticks while these were forced to make a handset against a wall.
The head of the UN Authority for Human Rights is now requiring an incoming investigation.
It has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will be even more difficult, "said Rashid Abdi, the project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is estimated by the West.
American military and intelligence services are working closely with Ethiopians to fight terrorist riding over the region, especially in Somalia, only a few countries in Africa, if anything, get so much Western help.
Ethiopie's economy expanded at the considerable pace.
Its infrastructure has improved drastically - there is a new commute train in the capital Addis Ababa.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Even if Ethiopia was anything but an example of democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, with dissidents effectively silenced.
Many were sent to exile or prison, killed or driven into the expansions of the desert.
But that could change.
If you suppress people and these do not have any other options except to protest, it breaks out, said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia.
All of the youth protests.
A generation protests.
There are numerous complaints covering everything from ground use to stranglehold in terms of power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the opposition's last seat and now control 100 per cent of parliament.
At the same time, tensions rise along the border with Eritrea; a fight around this trapping, controversial line claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts worry that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogadine's National Liberation Front, which has been more or less forced in recent years, exploit turbulence and could arm again.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness were now exploding after years of getting in front of the surface under the surface.
The first seems harmless: smartphones.
It is only in recent years that very many Ethiopians have been able to communicate through social media as cheaper smartphones have been increasingly frequent and improved internet services.
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, which they do regularly, particularly in protests, many people can still communicate over internet proxies that hide where they stop.
Several young Ethiopians said they gathered to protest.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two biggest ethnicities in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
Since eons, the Amharas, who are mostly Christian highlights, have been prospering in politics and the economy while exploiting the oromos, many of which are Muslims and living in flat areas.
But that's also changing straight.
We are in the process of coordinating under a screen, "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The biggest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which accounts for about 6 per cent of the population and are dominant in the military, in the intelligence agencies, in trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr Meles, a former rebel leader, was until his death at a non-publicised disease in 2012 for 17 years of Ethiopia's prime minister.
He was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think of corners.
Analysts say he was particularly savvy in it to perceive early signs of dissatisfaction and use special envoy to edit opponents and make them unharmed.
"The current regime is missing from this fundamental skill," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopie's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegs, was selected for relatively obscuring reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.
Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he is not enjoying the confidence of the Tigray controlled security services.
Many fear the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such turmoil was in 2005, after thousands protested against elections, which, according to data from analysts, apparently botched and subsequently stolen from the government.
During the following raids, many protesters have been killed, even if it was less than in recent months and this time of unrest went over relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuting plant, as well as for their measurable progress in combating poverty.
But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the Ethiopian government's internal miscarriage.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, an amharic city, of Tigray's business and the hatred towards the Tigray will be increasingly common in social media.
Analysts say the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a strange position.
The American government used Ethiopia as the base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, even though they recently told them that it closed this base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile area.
This, said Mr Abdi, is a very thin gratitude.
