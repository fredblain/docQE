Clinton and Trump's economic policy compared: it's all about the money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade agreement - which wants both Clinton and Trump.
However, disagreements are the two U.S. presidential applicants in tax and energy policy, as well as in a fundamental issue.
The difference in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is underlying a fundamental, more philosophical difference.
The one, about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep the doubt more small and warns about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate to death, he says.
He, on the other hand, would be quite different, claiming Trump.
He will massively return regulations, and he makes for far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for businesses.
Clinton, by contrast, says the state has certain responsibilities to open up disadvantaged opportunities and needs money for it.
That's why taxes for the rich would be increased, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to the issue of infrastructure.
They have to be invested, saying Trump and Clinton almost worthless.
The Democratic applicant announces even the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II.
Government investment programmes into infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by Republicans' state-owned wings.
So on Trump, partisan discussions could come.
Clearers are the differences in energy and climate policy.
Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and ride coal production in the US again.
Oil production is also expected to be possible in previously protected areas, the Paris Climate Change Agreement he wants to terminate.
By contrast, with her investment programme, Clinton explicitly wants to expand renewable energies and calls for: one country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs. "
It's going to be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be it. "
But not only in infrastructure - including in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other.
TPP, the trans-Pacific trade agreement, don't want to sign both.
At the same time, however, both want the US not to isolate international trade - but just protect American jobs better.
They are then to be better paid, calling for about Clinton.
The current minimum wage of $7.25 dollars is a hunger.
He wants to raise it to $15 an hour.
What Trump wants to do on this issue is not very clear: once, he says: the minimum wage must be running, then he says he should not be allowed to change.
But the big discussion of the coming months is probably more likely to develop around the tax policy of the two camps.
On one side stands Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth.
His critics stick to him so that the budget deficit would only greater.
On the other hand, Clinton, who at least wants the rich to demand that they pay more tax, and whose critics say: more taxes aren't the solution either.
