Snapchat's anime effect criticised as an Asian cartarian
Snapchat says this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races.
With its filter tool, Snapchat allows around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that borders absurdity.
You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The filters are unsurprisingly, property tools that create more than 30 million improved selfies a day.
All missteps enter the public.
Snapchat filters have drawn criticism in the past, in which they were accused of promoting the app blackface or promoting white skin as a beauty ideal.
When this week suggested a filter that gave them slits, false teeth and unseated cheeks, it called some critics a racist cartoon of Asians - being yellowed.
They asked whether these repeated controversy pointed to a bigger problem that the company has diversity.
The news and outrage were widespread on Wednesday, with reports of The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat told that it had disabled the feature.
The company offered an apology: the filter was thought to be a tribute to anime characters and not as a cartoon of Asians.
But outsiders who have experienced racism recalled the filter to injuries clich√©s.
Others declined the animated comparison.
In an email, Grace Sparapani wrote, a Korean-American art student whose tweet over the photos were widespread that the filter was "violating and said to be uncomfortable."
She added that it's difficult to argue with the opposition of a very disgusting Asian caricature and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow, but that the yellow face was drawn into the depressing extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural stumbling wires.
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration battle, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all keep in hand.
And Snapchat's great audience of young people - who are diverse in terms of breed as their older opponents - could be more likely to expect sensibility.
If one of Snapchats filters generates a picture that is insulting for a user, it's much more difficult for such stuff to stay unnoticed when it used to be the case, "said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to extinguish her Snapching account called on others to do the same.
In an essay for medium and in a phone interview, she said she believes that racial controversy reflects a lack of diversity in recruitment practices at Snapchat.
Zhu criticised the large part of white, only male leadership and finished her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.
Either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colours in their workforce so they can make such decisions, "said Chinese-American Zhu, or they have people with other skin colours that are working there, but not in positions in which they are safe or comforting to say what to say about it."
Others share their opinion, a complaint that left Snapchat mostly unanswered.
The company does not release numbers on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his staff, but, according to a spokesman, the company has recently stopped a staff leader who focuses on under-represented population groups and on internal integration efforts.
Zhu said, for its part, that she will let her snapchat account be closed and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that's not O.K. is."
