Military leadership distort ISIS intelligence information, presents committee of Congress
Military members of the United States Central Command changed intelligence to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than it allowed actual conditions on the ground, an investigative committee of Congress reported in a report on Thursday.
The preliminary report, created by a task force of Republican members of the Armed Force Committee, intelligence committees and anti-budget committees, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed its assessments on the U.S. efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.
The Central Command, briefly Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Intelligence information that was typically dismissed by senior CENTCOM commanders, regularly drawing a more positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism than the actual conditions on the ground were allowed and were more positive than analysis of other news services, a newspaper article quoted the report.
What happened at CENTCOM is unacceptable - our soldiers are suffering when poor analysis is presented by our political leaders, "stated Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The leadership error at CENTCOM ranges to the top tip of the organisation.
The ten-side report shows detailed consistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analysis of American efforts in the training of Iraqi armed forces.
Although there is no direct indication that government peaks have given under Obama to change the reports, it shows how analysts suffered pressure from their superiors to draw an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic state, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, opinions and statements before Congress were much more positive than it matches the facts, the report noted.
For example, a CENTCOM member publicly announced that a military recovery could begin Mossuls as early as April or May 2015.
Mossul, second-largest city of Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic state.
After months of investigation, it is so clear., said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in an opinion.
From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, Central Command's leaders changed the intelligence reports to downplay the danger by ISIS in Iraq.
Republicans called the task force into life after playing that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday will still be completed by more detailed findings while the investigation will continue.
In addition, further investigation is underway by CENTCOM reports by the Defense Ministry's general inspector.
Democratic members of the intelligence committee published on Thursday their own findings, which coincided with some of the Republican Task Force's conclusions.
In 2014 and 2015, CENTCOM created an overly limited process for creating intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services, "admitted to the highest-ranking Democrat in the Committee, a member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, in an opinion.
This process, according to Mr Schiff, delayed the publication of intelligence reports, damaging morality among analysts and gave overly little room for dissent. "
But Mr Schiff and Democrats said no evidence of an intervention by the White House at the CENTCOM analysts was found in terms of a particular political opinion.
The preliminary results of the Congress's investigation were published Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, the New York Times reported investigation by the Pentagon's general inspector, which was included after complaints from CENTCOM analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon press secretary, admitted in an opinion that the Defence Ministry would not comment on Congress's reports while the investigation into the inspectorate was still underway.
But he also admitted that's experts sometimes well have divergent opinions about the interpretation of complex data, and that the news services and the Department of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence. "
The investigation has repercussions about the issue of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim that is now made by a growing number of members of the Department of Defence).
However, the accusations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can leave to the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
The criticism of secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of information from more than 10 years ago, when a CENTCOM analyst, Gregory Hooker, written a paper on how the then-government under George W. Bush contradicted many analysts only a small crew force in Iraq and little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Mr Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against current coverage of the Islamic State.
Last year, the team around Mr. Hooker, according to government offices, notes that, contrary to the government's statements, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State had no significant implications for the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these provisional refineries operated to sell oil on the black market.
However, this finding was not published, the Times reported in September.
Centcom's then commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature because of his excessively positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced at the Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
