Berlin / heavy: poll before country elections: SPD and CDU lose
In the upcoming elections in the federal states, Mecklenburg (4 September) and Berlin (18 September) are characterized by significant losses for the government parties and CDU.
This resulted in representative polls of the opinion institute INSA for the picture newspaper (Friday).
While the red-black government coalition could continue to govern in the north, this is not possible after the poll results in Berlin.
In both federal states, the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to ask the leader.
In Mecklenburg, the SPD crashed 35.6 per cent five years ago to 24 per cent.
The party would only be just before the CDU, which could come back to 23 per cent.
Third place is controversial between the left and the AfD.
The left would come to 19 per cent (previously 18.4 per cent), which AfD would be represented with 19 per cent for the first time in the country's Day.
The Greens resume despite slight losses with 6 per cent (earlier 8.7 per cent) again in the Schweiner Land State.
NPD and FDP wouldn't represent 3 per cent in the county each.
According to Berlin's deputy selection, the survey would just 23 per cent (2011: 28.3 per cent).
The CDU just reached 18 per cent after 23.4 per cent.
It would still be behind the Greens with 19 per cent (2011: 17.6 per cent), but before the left with 15 per cent (previously 11.7 per cent).
The AfD would be represented with 14 per cent for the first time in the House of Deputies.
With 5 per cent, the FDP could hope of returning the pirates, by contrast to 2011 missing the entrance.
