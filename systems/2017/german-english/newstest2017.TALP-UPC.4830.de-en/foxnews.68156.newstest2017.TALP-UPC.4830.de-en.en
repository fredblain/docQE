Reid says Clinton will remain in the case of an election victory at Garland as candidate for the Supreme Court
Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the Democrats' presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton will nominate the judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland's confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
The majority leader in the Senate Mitch McConnell believes the next president will appoint the successor of the late Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reid said Thursday during a phone conference that he expects Clinton to select Garland with a degree of certainty.
A spokeswoman from Reid said later that he had not yet spoken to Clinton she would nominate Garland and he speculated.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team wouldn't worry for unrest with a new candidate.
Garland is the top judge for the U.S. Appellation Court for the District of Columbia.
Raid said Republicans were blocking the Garland nomination, were Lakayes and aides of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also noted Donald Trump was inappropriate for the presidential office.
