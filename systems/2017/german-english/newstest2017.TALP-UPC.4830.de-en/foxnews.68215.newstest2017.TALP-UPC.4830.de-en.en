Treats wants nude calendar for women and for men
The Treats magazine works with the photographer David Bellemere to bring out a 1970s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their muse calendar for 2017.
The editor-in-chief of Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his naked magazine of Oldschool Playboys was distinguished, as Playboy was for men.
I do this for women.
Apparently, he thinks it does the calendar as well.
We need to return to the portrayal of timeless and classic nature, where both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body, "said Shaw in a press release to release the calendar.
Women will want to take part in this project because it's a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit their images online or personally at open casting call in Los Angeles and New York.
