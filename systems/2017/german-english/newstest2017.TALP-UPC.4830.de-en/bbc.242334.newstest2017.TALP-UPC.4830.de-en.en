Russia and Turkey: an alliance of outsiders?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
Russia's leaders and Turkey met on Tuesday to give hands and announce an official end of the eight-month war of the words and economic sanctions.
But as Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the St Petersburg Palace, I can't deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most.
There was the handship, yes.
But Putin's smile was narrow and he hardly radiated heat, even for his restrained conditions.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke repeatedly from his dear friend Putin - according to a report entirely five times.
I couldn't count it.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old levels before the crisis, but will even improve.
The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have been so behaving like never happened badly.
It appeared to me his enthusiasm rather to indicate the opposite.
But one of Putin broadcast, sustainable cooling showed that the leader of Russia had nothing to forget.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the firing of a Russian warplane on the Syrian border by Turkey.
Moscow's reaction at the time was augmented.
Putin shared and accused Ankara to have fallen into the back of Russia.
The offence was even bigger as it was committed by a supposed friend.
Rebuilding the venture will be difficult, if not impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media led a fierce, unlimited attack on Ankara.
At once, it seemed the Turks were to blame for everything.
Most seriously, the accusations of senior officials were that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria, which will be controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He vehemently denied this.
But in St.Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan he wanted to hear.
Russia has been able to book a kind of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are clearly on hand.
Erdogan primarily needed all friends he can get after he was removed last month at a failed coup almost his office.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.
But there is economic motives too.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - particularly banning charter flights that usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has dropped by nearly 90%.
In Russia, travel organisers and charter companies will be relieved if the flights are resumed.
They include a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.
This week, state television predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables once Turkish agricultural imports are allowed.
A report in Vedemosti formulated as follows: "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."
But the visit had an added political value for Moscow.
Ankara is furious on the West as it considers its reaction to the attempted power takeover as a weak answer.
This comes to the continuing resentment about the snap of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is keen to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey's relationship with the West.
The Russian leader won in Ankara with security a bonus that he called for support for the elected organs after the attempted coup.
That's well noticeable for Moscow, which itself has a severe fear of regime change.
The summit in this lackluster palace on the seafront enabled it to Russia and Turkey, one as it once described me an analyst to depict an alliance of outsiders: two countries that feel violated by the West and feel badly treated and now allied.
Still, despite public reconciliation, there are still big differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role as a peacekeeper, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It could be significant that after nearly three hours of first discussions, both presidents said at the press conference that they had not even striped the issue.
Turkey's president avoided deliberately responding to a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasise them.
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found to Syria.
But after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey fired the Russian fighter jet - it's certainly better that the two heads of state at least talk to each other.
