Destination records: who actually buys records?
Lonely men's middle-aged records.
Before rushing to the commentary to overturn him under the pseudonym non-selling men's age with rough insults, this statement is heading from current data.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed resurgence of records is not on a boom in Millennials who want to welcome the news of physical objects, but attributable to midlife nostalgia.
Those who recently bought a plate are all predicted to be aged between 45 and 54.
In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group.
Nor is it hordes through hobby collectors - it has an emotional significance: older record buyers retain their feelings more for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending alone time (69% vs 66 per cent).
But do YouGov's results vote?
If this blog would be a news report on television, the camera would follow me while I run amid a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest grey suit before I stand, keep my hands and say something definitely like: 'let's throw us a closer look at it. "
So, let us look at it.
Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm, hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were based - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialist business.
I would ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and trying to assess their age and mind by observation.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I do from Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three men's middle age) to the Reckless Records (data number: eight men's middle age, a woman, presumably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the business to fill the couple of hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
I'm already appreciating, "he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, above pictured (he sent me the snapshot by email, I didn't follow him home), dress up the walls of his living room.
The reason why he owns such a significant number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: he is now capable of buying records that he couldn't afford when they appeared and once again buying items he sold when he was young and bust.
'Many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s who appeared when I was 11 or 12, things I was probably too young to buy them, "he says.
He agrees that those who buy plates are more introverted and like to spend time alone, adding: 'I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.
That's my last.
WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes many customers he meets on the YouGov profile.
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people affected by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and prompting to buy again their old plates.
Of the talks I have led, people generally relented in 1998 or 1999 of their collection.
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy again their records, "he says.
This would explain the boom to supporters of the record revival of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional significance of records?
It takes only a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realise that record business offers a soothing community of peers.
According to WEZ, some of the older customers took push to the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to withdraw to the stability of familiar records, from objects that recall happy youth reminders.
I think sometimes it can be the filling of an emptiness or possession of material possessions than some sort of consolation, "WEZ WEZ.
That's with me as a collector and I think it's happening among many people.
It's an easy way to deal mentally.
We're like their social workers!, a staff from a record stack.
A survey by the ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who bought a record last month have not yet listened.
The survey also found that 41% own a record player they never use, while 7% of those buying a record do not own a record player.
At this time of the news report I would presumably look very concerned while I leave through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data number: three men of middle age), has noticed a trophy aspect of the revival.
"Someone only recently came here recently and said: 'I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a radiochead record so I can put them into the shelf," he says.
This is not a huge percentage, but it definitely happens.
More product, less music.
We have people who say I don't have a record player...
These are younger people, not older, who only slowly get in.
Fopp, which devoted the record almost an entire floor, has a bungled audience than I get in.
There are couples around the 70, tourists who make the photographs, teenage and women of middle age.
Although the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the aforementioned businesses - Wild Beast's latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz browns from the loudspeakers - it's good to see such diversity among customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but nagging mental trauma are hard to determine when you're standing alongside someone 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been running around in the business for some minutes and considers the variety of the records on sale.
She's more likely to make a story stroll than a major purchase.
It doesn't earn much, so the collection of plates is not a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It's easy to hear music from a computer or in other ways, but the beauty of plates is... "she drives with a lovely sigh.
I don't know how I should explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a business, which is believed to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban outfitters.
While I look at the appearance of patting the Jeans-Hottans, I watched a group of young teenagers who are grouping for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are considering buying a Crosley record player.
To the left, there is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection.
No one sees them - perhaps because they are just purely decorative, some so top that it's impossible to grab them.
It's pure record art.
But given that any attraction for these items means more money for the industry and could send some customers into the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain.
It's no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, is also the one who spends most for luxury items such as records.
Even though my investigations showed that the results of YouGov vote, they let them, at least in plate shops in Soho, leave the large number of female collectors who exist in reality, record business and online forums.
These people are probably working hard in school or in offices.
They spend their Thursday tomorrow with certainty not with the strolls through plate shops of the Berwick Street and leaves through records while avoiding the startling look of an unruly, 30-year-old's false presenter who appears over the shoulders of nothing middle-aged men.
