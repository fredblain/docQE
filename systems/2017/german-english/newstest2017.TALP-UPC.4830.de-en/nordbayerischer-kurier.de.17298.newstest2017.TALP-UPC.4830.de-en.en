The charges per cubic meter of wastewaters are starting from October 1, 2016 for the area of the wastelance plant's Neudoff / Reuth / Welschkehl 3.44 run for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp 3.33 euros (previously 2.26 euros) and for Azendorf's 3.64 euros (previously 2.18 euros).
At the facility in Azendorf, the sewage charge will increase again at the latest, when appropriate improvement measures are needed.
According to an overturned calculation, the water price in Azendorf will then be at 4.37 per cubic feet.
As Mayor Bernd Steinheuser (CSU) reported, when approving the budget through the council's Office of Culmbach, it was determined that undercovers were running for these sewers.
The Casent Village market was committed to running the facilities coverage.
From October 1, 2016, citizens, as well as the business and industrial operations from Welsh Kahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to grab deeper into the purse.
The fee increases are between 48 and 67 per cent.
As administration leader Herbert Schmidt pointed out the panel, a recalculation of charges for the market community's wastewater plants was necessary.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over-related undercovers were also offset from the previous calculation period.
The serious charge increases resulted in all three sewers plants around relatively small facilities with a very low sewage case, which lies between 6800 and 12,000 cubic metres a year.
So because of the low distribution basis, for example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would be serious.
Moreover, sewers are easily declining in all three plants.
Furthermore, in the past calculation period, at all three plants were not last substantial because of its age renovation and repair expenses.
The facility in Azendorf was nearly 30 years old, the facilities for Welshelle, Neudorf and Reuth, as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp nearly 20 years.
Schmidt pointed out that in the wastewater Azendorf, the mechanical ventilation facility had to be exchanged because of a damage.
In the Pumpwerk Welchenkahl, the nearly 20-year-old funding facilities had to be overtaken by reason and, after nearly 20 years of operation, had to dig operations of the first plaintiff, the sewage mud will have to be disposed of and installed an extra ventilation possibility to adhere to the water rights guidelines even in the future.
Schmidt: "these extraordinary expenses came from advanced care and maintenance costs to take into account accordingly in the new calculation period.
The same applies to electricity costs, which were still significantly below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012.
Stone houses made it clear that in the three facilities, the expenses for the operation and entertainment in the three plants were fully running.
In doing so, Schmidt, the market community of major entertainment costs in the wastewater facilities over the past 20 years, remained spared.
The situation for the named facilities will continue to precariously remain precarious, according to stone homes, particularly since the utilities area of the sewage association Friesenschabach around these facilities could not be expanded because it's about deficit facilities.
