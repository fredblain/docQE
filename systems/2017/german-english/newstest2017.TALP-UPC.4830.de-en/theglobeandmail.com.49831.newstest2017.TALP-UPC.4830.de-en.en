Adblock Plus, Facebook in the cat and mouse game regarding advertising block
For companies earning money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to circumvent advertising blocking, a cat and mouse play equals.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block display blocking on its desktop site, Adblock Plus published a blog place in which it told users could update their filters in the program to block again advertising in the social network.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the coding regarding its advertisers to discover it displaying the detection of which part of the side is advertising.
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to deal with the new codes.
In a blog post, the spokesman for Adblock Ben Williams wrote that's written this kind of battle between the displaying Open Source Community and the circumstances have already been underway since the invention of advertising blockers is underway, and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution.
The fact that the world's largest business for social media has left in the fight is a strong indication of how worrying display blockers have become for the industry.
Worldwide, according to a study last year of Pagefair and Adobe, use about 200 million people display blockers; nearly four times as much in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users who access Facebook over their mobile terminals, mobile advertising makes 84 per cent of advertising revenues Facebooks.
The company has on display blockers on desktop PCs, as mobile advertisers have no effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a spokesman told me.
Advertising on desktop PCs makes an enough large proportion of revenues so Facebook appears to be the investment of such a move as worthwhile.
On Tuesday, Facebook told that it would update its ad preferential tool to have more control over people on them on targeted advertising.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters would be worrying because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising.
For the users, this is not a positive experience, so we plan to address the problem, "a spokesman told Facebook in an email communication.
Advertisers are a blunt resource, which is why we instead focused on development tools such as Ad Preferences to put more control in people's hands.
