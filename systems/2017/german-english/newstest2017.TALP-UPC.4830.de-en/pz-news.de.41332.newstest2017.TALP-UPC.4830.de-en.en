Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
The city at Main therefore in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg has the best chances of attracting from London's relocated jobs and firms.
It's very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit vote, says Michael Voigtlander, head of the IW's financial markets and property markets.
According to the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether funds may continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU.
For the so-called EU passport, they have so far been enough to admit in Britain.
These are just using large U.S. banks.
Several banks have already announced to shift jobs.
The lobbying agreement, Frankfurt Main Finance, expects 10000 new jobs on the Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, according to the IW, speaking to the headquarters of the European Central Bank (ECB), combines responsibility for monetary policy and oversight of the eurozone's largest banks, as well as other major authorities such as European insurance supervision EIOPA and the ESRB risk.
In Paris, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has its headquarters, but this one is less significant than the ECB for the financial sector.
"Closeness to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision," says IP Professor Voigtlander.
Luxembourg, while a large fund industry, cut as well as Dublin in infrastructure worse.
Frankfurt was much easier to achieve thanks to the big airport.
Also scored the city with easily available commercial properties.
In Paris, it's not so easy to find free high-quality offices, "says Voigtlander.
Additionally, the rents for first-class commercial properties are 50 per cent higher than at Main.
In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime.
In a ranking of consulting Mercer, the city stands at seven, Luxembourg on No 19, Dublin to No 33 and Paris in 37th place.
Even though quality of life is a matter of preference: "with its already strong position as a financial location for the European single market, Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors," conclusions.
However, despite Brexit vote, London will remain in Europe, my business researchers.
The power conditions are also talking about: in London, according to figures from Landesbank Helaba in late 2015, about 144,000 people in the banking industry, in Frankfurt, were 62500.
