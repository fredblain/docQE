Woman in presumable suicide on Switzerland's highway
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police witnesses witnesses after a woman was overtaken in the early hours of Thursday at a presumable suicide of several vehicles on an exercise.
The incident occurred at the A1 near Morges in the Canton Vaud shortly after midnight.
A woman put himself in the dark in an act of desperation on the streets and were hit by several cars, police said in Vaud.
It's obvious that a Swiss age of 49, who was overtaken by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill himself.
She died on the ground.
Several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, police said, calling on them as well as any witnesses of the incident to report.
An investigation was opened, which is a logical step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed.
Was a collision preventive?
That's something the prosecutor must decide, "said Hofstetter.
Two similar cases over the last five years show that drivers will not be held to responsibility.
In each of the two cases - where one person ran in the dark on the highway - was decided that motorists will not have to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the highway as it did in the newspaper.
Last year a policeman of negligence killing was acquitted after she had overrun and killed a man who was laid on the A1 near Payerne in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had drink and has become unconscious on the street, the court heard.
The court found that the policeman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- went to a justified manner and that a man's presence on the street was a "completely extraordinary and unpredictable situation, the judge said.
Anyone who has further information on the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to police under the number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44.
