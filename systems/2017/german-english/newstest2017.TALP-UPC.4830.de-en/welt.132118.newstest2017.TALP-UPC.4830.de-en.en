Data clue: so perfectly blackened hackers their ransom
Programmers of extortion malware currently target companies - and are successful.
According to a recent survey by the malware defence specialists, Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Britain and Germany have been at least 40 per cent of the companies surveyed over the past 12 months, partly several times victims of an attack with extortion software.
In Germany, just under 20 per cent of firms were already targeting a ransome extortion.
Forty per cent of victims paid willingly the ransoms requested by the perpetrators to restore the attacked systems and data.
The offenders specialise in their extortion software, according to observations of malware bytes, watching attacks in company networks.
If they are successful there, the potentially extortion range falls significantly higher than in private users.
We are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of the software, "explains Malwarebytes chief Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the world.
In 2008, most malware programmes were still designed to send advertising.
Then the offenders discovered extortion software for itself.
It was not until private users were targeting, but the change to company attacks has been frightening quickly in recent months.
Ransowmare works after a simple pattern: once on the computer of a victim actively, she is looking targeted after recently changing files such as Word, Excel or database files, and after archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the Ransomware and extinguishes the originals sustainable.
Subsequently, the software presents the demands of blackmail.
To get the filing code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of Cryptown Bitcoin.
But where to private users the personal photo database is at stake, it is all about companies around sensitive customer data or project databases without which production is shut down.
Accordingly, the damage falls out when a ransomware increases.
22 per cent of German firms reported sales losses through Ransomware, 13 per cent even had to interrupt business activity, in one case, people were in danger of life.
In Germany, hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of nurses.
We are always telling the victims: don't pay her only the problem, "explains Kleczynski.
But 80 to 90 per cent of firms that pay, get their data again.
For managers, it's difficult to reject the perpetrators' demand in the face of standing in operation.
The hackers in turn know this and trying everything to build a good reputation.
In a recent study, F-Secure security researchers investigated the user interface and contact with the blackeners and come to the outcome: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.
They explain their victims by chat as they can pay by Bitcoin, settle freely available support websites, or decide for free example files.
And are private individuals redeeming after paying for a few hundred euros, companies must partly negotiate and pay five-digit sums to get their data unencrypted.
Given the potentially high and relatively risky gains from the Ransomware blackmail, the hackers are getting more professional and sharing the work, explaining security expert Chester Wisniewski of the anti-virus provider Sopos: "a single person can write a ransomeware around within a week."
However, it's more likely that it is three or four people.
Programmers sell their hazardous software then in the form of a software building box to the actual blackouts.
The previous malware kits were created by buying the Malware itself, advice and additional tools for a one-off, fixed price between $1,000 and $10,000.
In the delivery range is an adjustment tool, so smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed, "says Wisniewski.
The extortion then searches for more hackers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So you log into one of the forums underground, buying the set by a criminal and instructed another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
The pay is made per infected computer.
"Usually the criminals then charge spammers with the spread, explains Wisniewski.
The risk of Ransomware is now known at many companies that better secure their data.
Over 50 per cent of company IT leaders in the Malwarebytes poll trust to be able to defend Ransomware using file-back-ups and scanner software.
Accordingly, the offenders already pursue new strategies.
If encryption of data alone is no longer an adequate threat to successful blackmail, the perpetrators instead face the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations, "explains Malwarebytes chief Marcin Klezcynski.
As a result, the damage potential, according to the type of data, is still much higher than before.
Also, the offenders could take completely new targets on the internet of things in the future.
At the hacking conference Defcon demonstrated security researchers as they could get a thermostat associated with the internet.
In the middle of winter, the clearance of such a blocked heating so many victims could well be worth a ransom.
If the perpetrators then rather than heating in the future block a whole manufacturing road in a factory, Ransowmare could also become an issue in industry.
