Mecklenburg power: 'going where it hurts
Strange Mecklenburg powers: the locals get nothing back from the summer campaign with - and the holidaymakers from North North West West are not allowed to choose the country.
In Mecklenburg, they understood.
In 2021, the land election will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays, the heavy parliament has already decided earlier this year.
Because than before, it's not about: summer holidays, heat and rural election campaign - biting.
The locals to be convinced by campaigners are on holiday.
Most holidaymakers who are in the country on Usedom, Russia or Hiddensee are not locals, so they may not vote the country.
These are practical problems: in the holidays, workers who hang posters hang up, blowing balloons, distributing flyers and counting at the end of votes, only painful to feature.
By the time of September 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg Pomeranians once still have to campaign barely past themselves over.
The hot period, if you can say that ever, has just begun.
And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, must fear for his office.
The SPD, since 1998's strongest party, is now clear in polls behind the CDU.
Exciting, how strongly New AfD cuts down and what remains left on the end of the coalition.
Celering, 66 years old and since 2008 chief executives, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign, seeing its big posters.
He travels through land, distributing roses and chatting a little with people, just as it also did his legendary worthy predecessor Harald Ringstorff.
Otherwise, sailoring has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel blamed on the bloom of the AfD.
Their refugee policy, her we create that, have accelerated the rise of legal populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful office.
The CDU with its top candidate, Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when you make election campaigning at the wrong time at the right place.
She has invited twice Chancellor Angela Merkel to big rallies; Merkel federal election constituency is in the Northeast.
But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine Westphalians, Berliners and Saxony than Mecklenburger and premeditation.
As there was probably the majority from other federal states, Vincent cocktails, general secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg, recently in the NDR.
But it is also a pity no one from other corners of Germany to listen once Angela Merkel.
Otherwise, the northeastern CDU is largely renouncing the usual campaign standings on marketplaces and before shopping centres with sunshines and aerial balloons.
That, so thinks costume, play only a 'subdued role. "
The union has also noted that on the country, it takes away the base that it needs to be very exhausted again to find a wire to people.
You go like the left, the SPD, the Greens: barely available in the expansions of the country.
However, the CDU campaigner's concern to his comrades is also self-defensive: "you have to go where it hurts, namely where people are: village festivals, Golden Weddings, every birthday party must be used."
Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called on his SPD to a particularly committed campaign.
In polls, the Social Democrats were last with 22 per cent behind partners CDU (25) and just before the AfD (19).
At the 2011 election, the SPD had still clearly won 35.6 per cent before the CDU (22).
The Greens, small party with seven per cent in the polls, are likely to create the jump in the country.
They make out of holiday distress a modern virtue and move their campaigning largely to the internet.
Online campaigning, calling it the country's chairman Claudia MÃ¼ller.
Otherwise, green campaigners are encountering lane search for domestic voting citizens among the holidaymakers.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, is straight with a houseboat through the mecklenburgic lakes and it also finds it still beautiful.
Her impression: 'polling holidays in Mecklenburg is not a punishment. "
