The Austrian Embassy in Thailand are in contact with the woman, said the State Department's spokesman, Thomas Schnell, Friday morning.
She suffered cutting edge and had been treated at the hospital, but this one can already leave.
Her home trip was scheduled for early September.
Whether from the further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket, as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon also affected Austrian citizens, were still unclear for now.
The State Department is in constant contact with the local authorities, according to school.
In about 200 kilometers south of the capital, Bangkok, Hua had initially exploded two bombs on Thursday night in a nightclub.
In doing so, according to police, a Thai child was killed and about 20 people have been injured, including the Austrians, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.

A bomb explosion was also reported in the morning.
At the detonation near the popular beach of Patong, a taxi driver was injured after police claims.
In Surat Thani on the country's southeast coast, another bomb then exploded, killing an urban employee.
The explosives went into the air, according to authorities in a flower before the area of coastal police.
Eventually, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south west coast, as well as in Chmphom on the southeast coast, called for several injured.
You go from a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it said.
The bomb attacks carry the same handwriting, said army general Danai Kritmethavee Friday morning in front of journalists.
"We assume that it's a coordinated attack."
It's too early to comment on possible motives - probably handle, though, around the deeds of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern in the attacks, which is typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
Thai police, on the other hand, said the assassinations were not related to the Islamist insurgency movement or with international terrorism.
This is only local sabotage restricted to limited areas and provinces, "said a spokesman in Bangkok.
Rather, the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta.
Authorities have received intelligence indications of imminent attacks in the south of the country in recent days - but they were not informed about the exact date and places.
Still, it's unclear which group behind the attacks.
Police advised their officials across the country to increase security around important government buildings as well as airports, stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and pleasure quarters.
In Thailand, there are always smaller bomb attacks, but they are usually not against tourists.
In Hua is a palace used for years by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
According to the now bomb explosions, the Austrian State Department recommends its homepage, necessarily affording the instructions of Thai security authorities.
High security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla, as well as Preah Vihear and surrounding area.
After clashes between security forces and Muslim population parts, there will be no necessary travel in these provinces.
Increased safety risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday were made a few days after a controversial referendum on one of the constitution prepared by the military junta.
This admits to the military's great influence in the coming years.
Junta boss and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country moves towards stability, improving economic situation and tourism.
The military union, which had taken power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, keeps itself benefiting the kingdom back to stability and order.
However, the military has also failed to get to grips with the insurgency of Muslim rebels for years.
More than 6,500 people have already been killed in the conflict.
Just over a year ago, in Bangkok, in an attack at a popular Hindu shrine, 20 people were killed - most of them foreign tourists.
It was the bloodiest attack of the country's younger history.
