Asocial family destroys delogation of social housing in Saltash, Cornwall
An asocial family left her social housing after a delogism with a damage of £50,000 because she had terrorized her neighbours.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebiccock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall.
After being violently removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an irreparable condition.
The walls highlighted gaping holes on, wooden diets were torn up, rubbish was scattered on the floor and graffiti was shelled to the walls.
The family have been resettled and it is believed they live in a private accommodation now
Donna McEvoy, who works for home administration at Cornwall Housing, said she worried that the home was no longer repaired.
She said: 'it was an absolute nightmare for people here and I believe people don't have to live in this way.
There are a lot of things to take into account as this property is believed to be considered not so nice part of Cornwalls.
The family is infamous and their reputation it is also.
The couple had three sons living in the apartment in the meantime and police said that terror, which had inflicted the family, included road fighting with baseballs, intimidating residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screaming, disputes and curling.
Skeldon, 47, whose name stood on the rental contract, got an arrangement for anti-social behaviour in June.
In some spaces of the house that will be demolished in circumstances, old rubbish was found
It was in the property in which drugs were traded in the past, the timber diets
Neighbours said they saw them fighting on the street and regularly had to call police
Cornwall Housing deloged her and her partner this week violently from the property after they gave them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to pull out voluntarily.
The delogist was cheered by facilitated neighbours who said their lives were made to hell.
One said: "they shouted around anyone."
We lived alongside them 20 years and it was always bad.
The countless times we say police here are incredible.
This morning we couldn't sleep. "
We stood up because it was so quiet here - that's not used to!
Now where they are finally gone, it's going to be nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said the family had failed to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house to which police were called at regular intervals, for 20 years
On the municipal side of the community house, rubbish and old toys
He added: "it's a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and that of their family as a delogism is always the last step to consider Cornwall Housing.
This was a very difficult case as the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be terrible.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall as well as members of the community who have been courageous with us and have provided us with the information.
I hope this development will donate some neighbor to comfort and convey the message that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said all three sons had lived at different times in the house, but that they were all over 20.

Workers of home administration will now have to waver off rubbish mountains that surround the house
In 2014, police led a crackdown in the house and found over 70g cannabis, as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash amounted to £1,700.
Skeldon received a fine after being familiar with the possession of a drug of class B in trade intention.
She claimed the money was for a tomb stone of her son, Lee Skeldon, who was killed in a car accident in 2013.
After they were without a shelter, it will be assumed that Tanya and her partner now live in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many of the house's room walls were covered with graffiti.
Police say they will delogize tenants who don't get to the housing rules
Angela Crow by police from Devon and Cornwall announced that the delogue was a clear warning to the other tenants who don't keep to the house order.
This goes to those who think they can behave without self-charges as well as to those damaged by such behavior, "she said.
Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
