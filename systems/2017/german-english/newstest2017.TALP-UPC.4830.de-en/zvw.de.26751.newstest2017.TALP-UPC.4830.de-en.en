Schorndorf: burglars with helicopters
The police helicopter flew different areas for about an hour - unsuccessful.
Two unknown men are violently invading an apartment in a multi-family home on Friday morning.
The resident surprised the two and suggested the unheaded into the flight.
The two men were about 1.65 to 1.70 metres large, arguably masked, wearing both blue jeans and black hoodes.
They fled towards downtown.
To search, police set up several strike crews as well as a police helicopter.
The search expired without success.
Possibly, the unknowns indeed fell close to the apartment relating to their flight.
