Scotted Callum Skinner stormed home when Britons scored gold for cycling
Scotland's Callum Skinner rasted last night in the men's team sprint in the Velodrom in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role that had his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had embraced the boy... the boy made the legend proudly when he stormed home to introduce a victory from the favorites of New Zealand.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while the fifth of six Olympic medals picked up.
They repeated the trick after picking up only a modest sixth place in March at the rail championships in London despite the resignation of Hoys.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of driver Jamie Staff.
They did so in time for a hind.
Hoys retirement generated a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man where they stayed when they saw potential in the Scot, which has now unfolded.
Hindes, Kenny - who win with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner put an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealander won in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
Hindes were just back after his round, but Kenny brought the team to the front and skinner held it.
A strategy change made much of the transformation, where Hindes drove in a higher gear to slow it and allow Kenny and especially skinners to keep the pace.
Hoy looked at his position as BBC expert and dropped skinner, Kenny and Hindes when these rose to the podium.
The 23-year-old skinner from Glasgow said: "it's a flattering comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make me a name.
We set up an Olympic record in the final and defeated the world champions.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win this.
After the 2012 triumph on the side of Kennys and Hoys, Hindes admitted that after a weak start, he was intentionally on the track.
He later pulled this statement back and there was no appeal from England's rivals.
In such an outstanding victory, this time there was no such problem.
Hindes said: it feels like the whole GB flags in the stands like London. "
We have come together as a team in the last three months.
We have come so badly at so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which won seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London.
If that's a barometer of our progress in the last five months that expects successful five days at the Velodrom.
With the form Kennys is in the area of the possibility that he reiterates Hoy's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.
That would be for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (an apparently holy date for British sport; on the day there were also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.
That would be the one of Hoy equals.
Kenny is taking part next in the sprint, who will begin today and go over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said: 'I only enjoy this for the moment.
The team event is always best.
You can win it with his colleagues.
It feels something lonely to win alone.
Hindes said: when he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to Knight. "
It was the only medal contest of the day but there was further good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometre race.
They arrived at 3: 51,942 at the target.
The world record, which won gold in 2012, was 3: 51.659.
The first and final round (22.42) takes place today on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will certainly be in focus.
He had argued with representatives before the qualification yesterday when him calling for officials to measure his body size.
In the relevant women's contest, which continues and finished tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibal of Milngavie in World record time in 4: 13,260.
The GB team leaves its strong rail team to dominate the mid-period of the Olympic Games and pick up a char of medals.
After a truly exceptional portrayal of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio were downplayed.
It played dramas in the background, according to the resignation of the technical leader Shane Sutton in April amid sexism and bullying allegations as well as retiring sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks quite afterwards than the now legendary reputation of GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment.
