It is constantly being screwed up in the name of combating terrorism.
After the recent attacks, Interior Minister de Maizière now presents a thick security package.
But what has a toleration status to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say about all this?
Thomas de Maizière gives the reconciliation.
All of his proposals were politically reasonable to the Coalition Partner, says the Federal Minister on the idea of his new security package.
They don't overcome anyone.
Other, further points would be discussed inside the parties initially.
I'm also participating in that.
As an interior minister, however, he was located in results and on a 'achievable consensus within the coalition.
De Maizière has passed a little time after recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach before presenting his conclusions for security in the Republic.
The falls for this, though, are all the more extensive.
Some is already known, announced: that a new security agency is to take care of the crackdown encrypted communications is not new.
Nor does Germany have to implement several EU requirements on passenger data and gun law.
The call for more video surveillance and staff for security authorities comes just as not surprisingly.
Partly, de Maizière launches a second run for suggestions that have not been made with the SPD so far: he wants to punish sympathy for terrorist groups and punish jihadists with double citizenship off the German passport.
This will be difficult points for the SPD, admits to the CDU man.
He doesn't consider this to be reasonable and also demands nothing that doesn't have any chances at the coalition partner anyway.
A few new ideas presented de Maizière as well.
They have it partly in themselves: it plans to speed up quick procedures for deportation and more opportunities to determine people before deportation.
Refugees targeted in the country are expected to check their smartphones before and disclose social media accounts for a security review.
In tolerations for rejected asylum seekers, he wants some even worse than previously - such as those who commit offences or throw away their papers to cover up their identity.
Some of this is political and legally delicate.
Some are also still impossible and leaves questions open.
And on some points - during inequality of tolerated for example - the question poses: what actually does this have to do with security and terror?
Yes, says de Maizière is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror.
But it doesn't conclude, yes, that the assassins of Ansbach and Werzburg were refugees.
Moreover, given the high refugee figures, many people were concerned about security.
And things that people deeply employed now also didn't exclude even in campaign time.
Internal security is enormous in the focus.
Only the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Wirzburg and Ansbach.
The uncertainty is great.
And yes, there are campaigning.
Union and SPD are therefore increasingly in position on the issue of internal security.
In the past few days, it was high between the two parties.
Just a garden dispute over the federal police, then about a security ideas collection of some Union interior ministers, in which the residents "leaders also demand a burka ban and a departure from dual citizenship.
De Maizière is also struggling here to be conciliatory tones.
From a departure from double passport, he didn't have anything.
We pacified the discussion in Germany.
Remodeling them is not meaningful.
And in a burka ban, he had constitutional concerns.
Whether its own package on all corners is constitutional and whether it is actually reasonable for the coalition partner, has yet to show.
There is something in it what could provide controversy.
But the SPD is also currently trying to profit on the issue of internal security.
Leader Sigmar Gabriel only signals cautious discussion readiness and says: "the SPD is prepared to talk about everything that helps to increase security further."
