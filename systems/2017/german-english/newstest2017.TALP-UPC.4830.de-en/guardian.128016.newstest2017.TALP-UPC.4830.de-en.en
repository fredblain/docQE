French court rejects offer on demolition of business in the jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an offer by authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional stores and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.
During a trial this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorized to deflect 72 provisional businesses in which people within the camp, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.
The Calais prefecture argued that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and that there would be a fire and sanitary risk.
Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important as free meals offered by the government-backed association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing figures in the camp.
They also led to the fact that the provisional business and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in distress.
A court in Lille decided that there was no legal basis for expulsion of people who operate the 72 provisional businesses, but conceded that the concerns of Calais's prefecture were absolutely understandable. "
The judge Jean-Fran√ßois Molla said that food businesses, cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than merely feed people who live in extremely precarious conditions.
He said the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the riot was the Jungle Book kids "cafe of the camp, which is operated unnecessarily and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to keep the kids' cafe.
In a letter to the Guardian, it said the closure would be "for these children of a disaster, of which the latest eight years old."
The two aid agencies Help Refugees and L Auberge of the Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of those in the jungle camp had risen to over 9,000 people - the highest number to now - following a steep increase in new arrivals during the summer.
