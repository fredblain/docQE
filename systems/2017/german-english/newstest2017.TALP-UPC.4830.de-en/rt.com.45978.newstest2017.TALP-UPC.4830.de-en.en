Police set tear gas rubber shots against protesting Brazilian students
Students met with police on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo when they gathered to demonstrate against the government's reforms to the public education system.
Police set tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The difficulties began when police officers tried to deal with students, leading to police rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students attended the demonstrations to express their consternation about the plans.
Under the proposals by the governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, slightly less than 100 public schools will be closed, while 300,000 students are being implemented to save money.
Some of the protesters saw graffititits against the interim President Michel Temer spraying on walls.
The recent protests occurred some days after protesters went to the streets in masses to support the suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been removed from office by a vote by the Senate.
