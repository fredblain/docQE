Old buildings, a few lime trees, between a remaining headband: the Rigar street in Berlin-Friedrichshain doesn't work at first glance, but police include them to the city's "dangerous places."
Go along the road from east to west, coming to playgrounds, a fresh kindergarten and a biolage pass.
To the fa√ßade of a grey house, someone has been "ugly!" Sprayed.
Opposite a Lidl, who is also to be demolished soon, is already being built: by 2017, here is scheduled to create a house with high windows and 133 new apartments.
Articles about this's trendy district, as the responsible property company calls Friedrichshain, are preferred in recent weeks with burning cars.
Reason is the house with the number 94 once it was occupied, now residents have lease contracts, but on the ground floor are still occupied spaces and will be used for events.
Especially the Berlin inside senator Henkel had spoken several times since the beginning of the year for a tough action by police against the project, calling the area as a no-go zone for police officers and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence.
After the rooms on the ground floor on June 22 were cleared with 300 police officers, police were patrolling three weeks of official statements, with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on the ground, blocking parts of the road and kept visitors from entering the house with the number 94.
Meanwhile, renovated construction workers on behalf of the unknown homeowners the spaces.
On July 13, a Berlin administrative court decided that the eviction was illegal, and a day later, police and construction workers drew off under the jubilation of sympathisers and residents.
On this summer afternoon, the road works peacefully: parents are walking with children, people sitting on the pavement ahead of the houses in the sun, others are entertaining late.
In the immediate nearness of the house projects, a primary school and kindergarten.
Leftist violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in the Kief since 1999, and Jana *, who here draws three children, are mainly generated by the police presence.
With residents of house projects, they share concern about rising rents and gentrification.
It doesn't sound like a kin, who wanted majority police protection from vandaling left.
The ditch, which the Berlin interior senator and the police make up between home staff and their neighbours, doesn't exist so apparently.
Friedrichshain in eastern Berlin was actually a traditional working-class quarter, which also has a low average income and high risk of poverty today.
Also household occupations and the residential residential projects have long been part of the Kiez: in 1990, numerous homes were occupied in the former DDR, including nearly the entire Mainz Street completely near the Rigaer.
While the mainzers had been cleared under large police bid in a downtrodden street battle, many of the projects in the Rigae were legalized and will still be inhabited by people who had occupied them 26 years ago today.
At the same time, the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and electorates from all over the world in recent years: with them, residents are now sharing residents from DDR times and former householders their kies.
This is also noticeable in rents that have risen by nearly 60 per cent since 2009.
Many of the new buildings in the Riga are attacked as symbols for this development: you acknowledge them on dropped slices or freshly cancerous facades thrown with colour bags.
No other road was mentioned this year along with the words of left-autonomous violence.
One reason that not all neighbors look at this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: offences such as body injury are aimed at statistics almost exclusively against police.
Most of the offences make property damage, which tends to meet new buildings and freshly renovated homes.
For Kerstin newbies, who have been living in a rental house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, can't be a speech from uncertainty.
As for violence, she is appeasing: people in the 94 are their neighbours who weren't determined to have been.
Even the famous burning cars are no longer admitting it directly in the Rigarter before.
For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: 'here you help each other, live together on the street and get more of each other than else. "
Newbreekers are deliberately pulled into the Riga street - and stayed.
That's why it was also so important for residents to get their road back: from the police, politics and the media, who all suddenly claimed the interpretation of the neighborhood in July.
But in the eyes of residents such as newbreeders, the road will continue to take them away: through faceless new buildings in former building gaps that oust the old residents.
These are ultimately property apartments that are not interesting for many here - here are more people who are not so well bettered, "she says.
Violence and destruction cannot accept absolutely. "
But what are you supposed to do when one never listens to anyone?
It sets frustration on all sides, including with police and residents.
For travelers who are annoying about colour bombs, Kerstin newbreeders have little understanding: the house projects and the left scene belonged to the kiez.
Anyone herself should be aware of this - just like someone who pulls into a pub quarter, can complain badly about noise there.
All of the people imagined with front-runners have been asked not to be named with their right name
