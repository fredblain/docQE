In the recall action, there's swirling about a term.
Volkswagen launches behaviour in the deliveries in the second half.
Europe's largest automaker can continue to provide a plus in the previous year despite the diesel effects thanks to its many brands and some well-running markets.

In Germany alone, VW calls 2.5 million cars to convert into the workshops.

The focus had reported that Volkswagen is now granting its German customers a guarantee for revamped diesel models.
This would have confirmed VW representatives in the Federal Department of Department last Monday.
Confirmed from the Department of Transport that there was this meeting.
VW has fully fulfilled the conditions of my investigative commission and the KBA. "
Deviations of these are not accepted, "said Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), according to the ministry.
VW has taken the guarantee that in fuel consumption, carbon emissions or engine power after conversion, there will be no deterioration and have all type-approved vehicle values unchanged.
Volkswagen itself uses the term's guarantee but not as it did in corporate circles.
In the vast term's guarantee, Volkswagen sees the possibility that, for example, customers could come into a workshop for example after conversion - and this could return to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
Even in customer interest, it is important to avoid the fact that any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust scandal comes to an uncertainty about possible warranty arrangements, as it does.
That's why VU doesn't use the term's guarantee.
