More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of September edition of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US.
Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran on Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
In a room full of people I love brought me the sight of this cover to wine, "wrote Kendall.
The revelation of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians similar?), crippled reality video showing the entire Kardashian Jenner family (with the exception of the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn as well as producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as they forget the cover of her sister and ending with a classic twist: they have all planned a surprise party.
This represents the clich√© act nearly every birthday episode of a children's broadcast (Seacrest brought the sentence, "" you thought that we had forgotten you?, with the honesty of a characteristic check on a broadcast at 8am in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls somehow participate in this publicity.
With regard to the September edition of Vogue, a new era of Kardashians began with security.
Kendall's big sister Kim may have beaten them off the vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for himself.
September issue is the most selled edition of the year for Vogue.
With an extent resembling a picture band than a fashion magazine, the issue draws a large number of advertisers (according to Fashionta, from the 832 sides of the wood's 615 pages of advertising).
The revelation of his cover star is seen expected to leak pictures of the magazine before the official announcement over the last two years.
Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, clearly more celebrities have been modelling as a model, the celebrities are on the cover.
Oscar winner and Dior-brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, after Lady Gaga had the honour.
But even at the low chance that Mrs Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the breakthrough model of her generation - falls under the previous category, she is in good company.
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers of today who know how to turn a good Snapchap video (even if it all true on Jenner).
They are really talented women who distinguished themselves in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had with the publication of lemanoma one of the most successful years of her career.
Of course, Jenner's success doesn't like everyone.
With her reality TV story, Jenner's position was always tense in the fashion world.
In June, the former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague, Gigi Hadid, criticised them and called her "the pieces of the moment."
Those feelings cook again as the news with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue cover.
But on the mismatch appears to be past the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
She's literally a supermodel.
She runs for Marc Jacobs.
It makes advertising for your grounding of Estee Lauder.
She and all their sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective Paywall apps.
It's sold of her made pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine LOVE.
And in her leisure she is in reality TV, presumably just to see her sister Kourtney and their children.
