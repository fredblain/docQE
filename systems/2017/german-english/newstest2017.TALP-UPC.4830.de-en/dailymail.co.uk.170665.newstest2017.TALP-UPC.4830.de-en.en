The £2-day drug to cut heart attack risk
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £2 per day drug after being recommended by authorities to administer this more people for an extended period.
The polluting drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with a heart disease.
The medication is administered for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
NICE's NICE has long recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.

About 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of which suffer another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by collections of fatty material in the arterial walls, forming surfaces.
When the belonging breakdown, it can cause a blood island that causes blood flow to heart, causing a heart attack.
If the bloodstream solves, it can flow through the blood stream and clog the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who had already had a heart attack are subject to higher risk one more.
Ticagrelor, which is manufactured by British company AstraZeneca and is displaced under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making it more unlikely to educate blood islets.
The NICE's guidance draft, which was published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily income of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre, said: "despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all those who suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or a stroke - often with disastrous consequences."
The fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on a person's quality of life.
The experience shows that Tigrelor is in combination with aspirin effectively in reducing more heart attacks and strokes among people who had already had a heart attack.
By a preliminary recommendation from Tigrelore, we are delighted that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
The information about the effectiveness and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the blood risk - is limited to a period of up to three years; the draft guidance does not recommend treatment that goes beyond that period.
