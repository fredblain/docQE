Group rises in start-up for live video transmissions
Watching other people at playing video games is a huge trend - of which Microsoft wants to benefit as well.
The technology group buys the start-up beam, which specialises in this hobby.
How much money goes for the takeover, Microsoft didn't told Thursday.
Beam went on to start with his offer only in January and already has more than 100,000 users.
They can watch others at the game, but even intervene.
For example, they can give up the players missions and provide enemies as well as equipment items.
The player giant Activision Blizzard starts a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sports.
On the road to global media event, Facebook is scheduled to help.
The advertising industry is already horrified.
The start-ups, which has his seat so far in Seattle in the US state of Washington, draw to Microsoft's headquarters in California Redmond, as well as beam co-founder Matt Salsacendi.
Therefore, there is nothing to change for customers through the taking.
Beam is being integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console, according to Microsoft.
