Simone Biles creates gold in the ladies
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all that.
Dynamically on the spring.
Effortless on the beam.
Breathtaking on the ground.
On whole line brilliant.
And now, finally, Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American Turner climbed on Thursday to multiple titles and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world all eyes under the headlights of the Olympic Games.
Her overall result of 62,198 was clearly in front of the silver medal winner and Final Five's team cameramen Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medallist Aliya Mustafina.
The Americans Simonen Biles turned on the balance during the women's individual campaign finale at the 2016 Olympic summer games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multiple title and overall the fifth while consolidating her reputation, being the best of her generation or even ever.
She broke in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at this moment an end.
This success puts them into the same league like unique athletes such as Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated the last three years of their sport, winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises including a mix of ambition and precision that the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton said that she's been "the best turner I've ever seen."
It expected a last examination in Brazil, a contest that went not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.
Not with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be seen as a disappointment.

Biles picked up the first medal on Tuesday while she served on the farewell ceremony of the retirement team co-ordinator, Martha Karolyi, as exclamation mark.
Although Biles insisted, during their long way to the top, never having the future planned, it's not really true.
Part of their ground exercises - which include their typical tumbling passport - is voted on Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympics in Rio.
That's not a coincidence.
This girl, who was adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by coach Aimee Boormat's mother during a school holiday in the gym, was trained in the Boorman became strength.
She hasn't lost an additional contest since the summer of 2013, a victory series that will last for so long as it wants Biles.
Even though Mustafina led easily through two rotations, the picture.
Sweeping beams and ground turbines - in which Biles hold the World Championship title - laughed.
She picked up again with 15,433 on the floor beam - and put one still on the floor with a 15,933 on the ground.
Raisman embraced them gently as she expected her final completion - a mere formality - and tears poured on Biles shiny red, white and blue eyeliners, when the vision she once described her in her collection book was to reality.
The performance of Raisman was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she struggled to third place, but the bronze medal in a Tiebrake went to Mustafina.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, which is named by the Americans grandma, had an advantage.
According to her ground exercise, she threw out to the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes appeared doubtful.
As for Biles, the rapidly expanding tweet of the 19-year-olds from the beginning of this week has a whole new importance:
