Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee officer
Annika Deuschel is the contact partner in terms of integration and organisation.
Besides, she is social worker on the ground.
Since July, Annika Deuchel is the refugee officer for Urbach.
The social pedagogist supports the administration's team around Achim Grockenberger.
She sees itself as a contact partner for all players: refugees, working circle refugee assistance, administration, authorities and who else.
Regime customers from the working group suggest that volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the egg legendary wool milk which has mostly a problem.
That's how some - less spotted than rather to the variety of desired assignment areas - meant when the administration wanted to tender the place.
Searched an administrative professional with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in the area of social work, just an emerging wool milk sauce.
But administration work is not her central area, means Annika Deuchle.
Above all, it's about organisation, working with the people on the ground and behind the scenes as well as networking.
The 31-year-old has been involved for about six weeks.
It has a 50-percentage point to three years.
It was high time, says Regine Customer that Annika Deusche supports honorary and full-time players.
There are big and small problems, organisational, human and understanding problems.
Soon, new containers are standing in the Wasen Street
A serious problem has been for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognised.
Local authorities are responsible for connecting accommodation.
They have to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented housing rooms.
The cost of construction, rent or renovating these shelters must bear the local authorities themselves.
The responsibility changes from the land office to local authorities and job centres.
Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his home.
The search has been designing for some time as very difficult.
De facto, the administration doesn't find private homes.
So far, it doesn't work on private homes, according to Deuschle.
Therefore, charitable apartments need to be enthusiastic as it means beautifully.
So soon new containers will be set up in the Wasen Street.
But only with apartments it is not done.
Perspective is the cue, Regine Kunde and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to a fixed lead, there are internships, training agencies, school places, one-jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be found or set up.
"More places would be good," Regine customer reports.
Many work in the bauf or help home companies, do not-for-profit work - and that motivates and very properly, as Annika Deuschle reports.
It hopes work for the community leads to a positive outfield.
This is not an employment therapy.
But activity doesn't just think of work.
The day needed a firm structure, say Deuschle and customers.
People would have to develop a sense of belonging.
So it takes offers like sport, contacts with locals and, above all, language courses.
Professional courses are rar.
So here are administration and volunteers here.
It's central that the refugees feel they were wanted in Germany and welcome.
The long duration of the proceedings was a problem.
They have to explain to the refugees that it will take it and they can bridge the time meaningfully, for example with language courses.
Who eventually developed the feeling that he couldn't help in Urbach, should not be allowed to work and be unnecessary, which will never integrate.
The significant majority is motivated.
However, there are problems, though, says customers honestly, people who do nothing at all. "The work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others.
This is all already a mammoth task.
One difficult question: have the two after recent events fear radicalisation, even in a small community like Urbach?
No, Regine Kunde said quite clearly what some naive likes. "A restriction could be, but don't want to exclude them.
However, the aides are already aware.
These incidents were also subject to refugees.
They would have the fear that the assassins bring them completely into disrepute.
They want to show that they have nothing to do with it, "says Regine customer.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
So primary and volunteers will have to look for activities on the ground and in the region.
They always have in the background that soon a new blow to refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.
Does Germany need a ceiling?
Clearly answering that question is politics.
Actually, it's unfair to put them on the ground.
In Urbach, we haven't arrived yet where we would like, "says Annika Deuschel.
No new refugees, that would relax the situation.
Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbachers are already being charged with integrating the previous people sensibly.
These are currently about 100 people, predominantly young men.
But if people are in distress, you have to help them, both women agree.
The political world situation is so complicated, as there are no easy answers.
