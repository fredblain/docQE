Olympic 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
Caught off: because of a positive doping test, weight leader Adrian Zielinski may not start from Poland in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympics are overshadowed by the first official drug cases.
A caught athlete would have won almost a medal.
Before the seventh competition day, the first official doping cases have become known the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-metre obstacle Silwia Danekova from Bulgaria and Polish weight leader Adrian Zielinski have been positively tested and excluded in Brazil - immediately before the start of the already critical athletics competitions coming to the time.
At Chen, last Sunday, the Diuretic Hydrolothiadiac was proven to be used as a masked fund for doping substances.
The International Sports Court CAS confirmed their exclusion from the Olympics on Friday afternoon.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old had finished fourth place in the final over 100m butterfly, only 0.09 seconds missed them the bronze medal.
On Friday, Chen should have participated in the precursors of more than 50m of free-style.
Chen has applied to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) the opening of the B and a hearing.
The national association takes the matter very seriously and requires Chen full cooperation in the investigation, quoting Xinhua from a communication: we will work with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the verdict.
For the first time in history, it is no longer the IOC, but the CAS for sanctioning athletes with positive cases.
Also on the night of Rio, the news about the positive test at Danekova leaned through, the 33-year-old went into the offense himself.
I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive, "this was an incredible shock," she told Bulgarian TV station BNT.
She was innocent, "the only statement could be food supplements," the athlete explained.
According to the report, the banned substance is to act around the blood doping EPO.
Danekowa has been preliminarily suspended, according to BNT, the B-test is also allowed to fall positively.
Bulgaria's Prime Minister Bojko Borissow immediately reported criticising the athlete.
I don't understand why the athletes don't pull the right conclusions, "he said: we Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been ruled out."
So about all the weight leaders from the chronically doping nation don't participate in Rio.
On Friday, the case was also known to the Adrian Zielinski, the London-based Olympic champion in class to 85 kg like his brother Tomasz three days earlier tested positive on the anabolic steroid nandrolon.
Both deny the intake, but should not be allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg.
Before launching the athletes, especially the case of Danekova is another heavy blow to the reputation of the entire sport.
The World Federation IAAF had banned the complete Russian team to an exception because of systematic doping the launch, including runner Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio.
In swimming sport, the previous offences in China had also provided fierce clashes between the athletes.
So the Frenchman Camille Lacourt grabbed the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang.
Sun Yang pink purple.
When I see the podium over 200 m free set, I want to hand over, "said Lacourt in French radio.
Sun was also at the heart of a clash with Australian Mack Horton.
I have no time and no respect for doping cheats, "said this.
Sun was tested positive at the Chinese championships in 2014, but had to seat only a three-month lock.
