Salzburg's West Side Story with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare year, the Salzburg Festival presents the West Side Story, with Tony and Maria as a tragic love couple, similar to Romeo and Julia.
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A Musical captures Salzburg: the West Side Story, Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.
Artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of the classic and met with the role of Mary a youth dream.
In the orchestra, the Simón Bolívar orchestra, led by the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: this music is full of rhythm, he swarms.
We always say it is very Latin American.
There are a lot of Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody.
It's a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say we really have Bernst's music in our blood!
In this production, Bartoli plays an older Maria.
She remembers with hurt of her love with Tony, while the younger Maria plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
First, because it's musically extraordinary!
And then there would be Maria's personality.
She says in her song: "I feel pretty, oh pretty, feel pretty and witty and bright."
So it's wise, of course, naive, and very passionate.
She resembles me very much, my Italian character I have as a Roman, laughs Bartoli.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It's such an honour for us to work with it.
She is an immensely generous person.
And Bartoli gives the compliment back: "Dudamel is such an exceptional artist and very passionate!!
Conducting is a necessity for him.
You see it in every one of his movements, in his looks, it's his life!
It's such a huge chance of sharing this musical experience with him.
We both have a more southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a happy approach to life, that's very important at all!
For American director Philip World, McKinley is the West Side Story highly topical: this piece is about prejudice and fanaticism. "
Today we have the refugees, then the Puertorians went to New York, and the New York residents didn't want them.
They are the same issues and they are just as meaningful today as they are.
59 years later, the piece is still relevant.
