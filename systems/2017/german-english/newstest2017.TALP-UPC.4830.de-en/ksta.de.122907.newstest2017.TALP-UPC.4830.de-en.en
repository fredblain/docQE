The right's identical movement is targeted by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection.
According to several local offices, the constitutional defenders in the federal government have also placed the group under observation.
We see at the Identity Movement's claims for aspirations against the Freedom Democratic basic order, "said Constitutional Protection of Democrats Hans-Georg Maasen of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
So immigrant Islamic faith or from the Middle East is defamed in an extremist way.
That's why we are now watching the movement as well.
The identifier movement is a grouping with French roots that have also been active in Germany since 2012.
She turns against "multicultural watch," uncontrolled mass immigration and the loss of his own identity through overcrowding. "
Constituencies in nine federal states - Bremen, Bayern, Berlin, Baden-WÃ¼rtemberg, NRW, Sachsen and Thuringia - are already watching the identities.
Maes said his authority voted closely with the landing offices in the decision.
Groups like the identity movement are trying to pick up their target group where it stands, "the constitutional chief said.
Generally, extremists are trying to address them with adolescent language, often with popper music.
This would be Islamists as well as legal extremists.
This is not a betul advertisement for its own thing.
The propaganda is expected to address people emotionally.
Young people are there in particularly vulnerable.
That's dangerous.
Most recently, it had been given reports of contacts of the identities to AFD politicians.
Maes said he did not have any findings.
For constitutional protection, possible contacts of this kind were only relevant from a certain point.
It depends on whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - by certain people who are extremist to change their target direction and become so extremist.
So determining is whether such people have tax influence on the party.
This is not recognisable.
With a view of the significant increase in legitimate offences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelters, Maes said he would not speak of new right-wing terrorism in this context.
But we have found in recent years that there can be right-wing terrorist structures.
There was the group's Old School Society or Friday group.
It may well be that other right-wing terrorist groups or small groups plan to plan attacks against asylum seekers, against refugee homes or attacks from other far-right motives.
A Germany or Europe-wide control of legal terrorism, though, is not recognisable.
Previous groups were created at the regional level or in social networks.
Concerns expressed messages about the fact that many assaults went to the account of people who were not previously appearing in the right scene.
That's worrying.
Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum shelters were not previously known as criminals, politically motivated offenders or supporters of the right scene.
So many people have committed criminals who had nothing at all with right-wing extremists who may have politically indifferent or elected, for example, CDU, SPD or left, which then radicalised themselves through right-wing extremist mood.
