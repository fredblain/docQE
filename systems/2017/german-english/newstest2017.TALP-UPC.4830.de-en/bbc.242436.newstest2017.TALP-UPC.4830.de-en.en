Russia's Putin fires Stafford Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's closest confidence circle for many years.
The 63-year-old was appointed special environmental and transportation affairs.
In an opinion of the Kremlin, it is that, without indication of reasons, Putin ordered Ivanov's dismissal of his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration.
Anton Vaino, who has been Ivanov's deputy since 2012, has been appointed his successor.
Vaino, 44, is former diplomat.
Born in the Estonian capital of Tallinn in 1972, made his degree at the renowned state Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the message in Tokyo.
It says on the Kremlin's website (on Russian) that he was later log chief executive and chief executive of government staff.
About his appointment, he told Putin: thanks for your trust. "
I think it's the government's most important thing to support your activity as head of legislation and controls to implement your instructions.
Putin told the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Convince the smiling faces?
This move has made Moscow mysterious.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of the closest confidence Vladimir Putins and works like him for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.
As a chief of staff, he was one of the country's most powerful men.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed the Chief of Staff will resign on their own desire.
But despite the smile for the cameras, only few are convinced - especially now, just before parliamentary elections.
So here is the episode of a sort of power struggle?
No one knows that at the moment.
But the official claim - that a man who was once being toured as a potential president, wants to guide Russian environmental policy at once - had great scepticism.
In his remarks to Putin, quoting on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said it's true that in early 2012 I asked you in a conversation to me to trust this very complicated post - you might nearly say - to trust an appealing post four years.
As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took the post in December 2011.
Before, he was deputy prime minister and defence minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and how Putin former member of the State Security Service KGB.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy.
When Putin got to power, Ivanov called Ivanov as one of five people he most familiarised.
Once agreed that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin's second term, as a third term Putin had violated the constitution.
But this post was taken by another, almost ally Putin's ally, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before becoming the president three and a half years later.
