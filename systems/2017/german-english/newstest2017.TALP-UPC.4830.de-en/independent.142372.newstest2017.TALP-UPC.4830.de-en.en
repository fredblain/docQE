Britain picks silver in 7-7 rugby after Fiji Masterclass Gold
Britain's impressive performance at 7-7 rugby arrived in the final Thursday evening to an abrupt stop at the final hurdle in the form of Fiji, when it was beaten with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji issued a master class in handling, side stepping, neighbours, line and raw force to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any colour.
The defeat was sweetened by the not too bad consolation price of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could well be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The clear defeat of the boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall on them in the finals.
But, regardless, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in best form in this form.
It could be a consolation for GB - but will probably not - that at least one Briton will hang a gold medal around his neck: Fijis chief coach Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult way behind.
Eight years ago, they lost under Ryan every game at the Adelaide Sevens.
They lost only here.
This slap will hurt, but the progress is amazing.
Fiji began wonderful and left the attacks GBs out of fun.
It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. as if you were going to run in travelling buses... the World Series winners went 5-0 up, when Osea Kolinisau rebounded in the corner.
With still four minutes of season, Jerry Tuwai still added another attack from the right corner he converted.
12-0 and GB hardly covered the ball.
A heavy tackle from Mitchell stopped stopping the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa a third goal, but it just stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute, JASA Veremalua in the right corner was a touchdown and it stood 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new since the replay and there was still over a minute of season... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou presented by further weak tacklings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a gateway.
The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.
It's like Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB still learns.
That's how it is.
GB conducted fundamental changes at half-time by and concluded the Fijian gap.... for a whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half well until Josua Tuisova gone through Fiji after a brilliant interim play.
Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game has long been in favour of the Southern Seanslaner, whose fans sweated flags and danced on the gallery.
It wasn't hard to admire Fiji's playoff approach.
Mata Viliame set this in items with another attempt in the final seconds.
The pepper, the Fijis embraced and GB damningly beaten into the lawn.
Earlier in the day, Fiji Japan defeated Japan in the semi-finals with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a narrow semi-final match from the race - Britain's transformation of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the boks in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive foot work and scored a gate among the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late tackling of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the gain - and therefore the silver medal.
