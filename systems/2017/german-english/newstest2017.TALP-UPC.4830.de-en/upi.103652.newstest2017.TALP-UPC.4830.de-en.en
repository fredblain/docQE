Kepler measures rotation rate from stars in the star clusters of the plejades
The latest mission with the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers gather the most complete catalogue at rotation rates among the stars of the star of the pleadays.
The new data helps astronomers understand why stars in star clutches roar at different rates as well as in what connection the rotation periods are with the planetary creation.
We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we learn more about the relationship between the crowd of a star, his age and even the story of his solar system, "said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The star of the pleadances is 445 light-years from Earth.
Many stars in this star cluster, which emerged about 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.
They are now turning themselves at the fastest.
To top rotation rates, these maturing stars encounter large amounts of stern winds.
As these winds travel through the stars' magnetic fields, they have a braking effect on the stars.
When a star alters, its rotation rate begins to slow.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of every star by recognising the time between the appearance of a recognisable star blow -- like solar stains.
The latest catalogue of rotation rates points out that massive stars spin slower than less massive stars.
Rebell compares the stars with dancers, with larger stars turning pirouettes than smaller.
In the ballet of the pleading, we see slow rotors tending to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars, "said Rebell.
Since the star clusters of the Plejaden are so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic lab to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates.
"The star cluster of the pleines offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stellar rotation in both directions, younger and elderly," said Rebull.
There is still much in front of us about what we would like to know more about how the How, Wann and Why Stars slow down their rotation rates and so to speak their 'dance shoes.
Rebell and her colleagues have reported in three newspaper reports at length about their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the pleadances, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
