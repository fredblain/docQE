Mystery for fish landed in garden in Banff
A resident of Banff called for identification of the fish help, which appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks it could act on the 75 fish surrounding sandals that have been outperformed by a Spring fountain.
Mr Bain, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, published on Periscope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two inches of long fish.
