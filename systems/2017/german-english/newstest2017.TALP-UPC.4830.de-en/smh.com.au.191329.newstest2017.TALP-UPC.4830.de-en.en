Council rights centres show 160,000 people a year
More than 160,000 of the country's most aid needs are dismissed annually by the community centres, while the industry has taken on the impact of further central cuts to already congested transactions.
In Queensland, there are already three out of five people - mostly older people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who have no funds for unjust delogues and the like - dismissed in their requests for free legal advice and legal advice.
Legal services to the community, which are already overlying, are making available for further cuts.
From June of next year, it is scheduled that these legislative centres will lose another 30 per cent of its federal resources.
The director of community law centres of Queensland James Farrell said the latest survey of the National Association of Community Rights Centers showed that thousands of people are already dismissed each year.
Farrell said the situation would only get worse without a lifting of the federal government's decision.
"Queensland's community centers are chronically underfunded, meaning that thousands of people are dismissed by important services you need," he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with insensitive and crippling debt, families who go through separations, workers who were unfairly dismissed - all these people have legal and this survey shows they cannot receive the help they need.
The federal government will cut the funds by 30 per cent from June 2017, meaning that thousands of needy people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the General Attorney General and Federal Justice Affairs Minister, as well as senators of Queensland George Brandis to lift these central cuts immediately, so people can get the help they need in legal problems.
Last year, the national government fulfilled its pledge to raise funds for legal assistance on the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of community centres and their customer communities and that the Parasczuk government is investing in this important work.
