Helen Glover and Heather Stanning through fight with the coach's cancer to run inspire
There will be no more emotional gold than these games and that wants to hot.
From the first row to the last, 220 hard Hieve, who go into the story, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an extra significance at their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though it was just the two that sat on the helm, there were three votes in the boat... The echo of the trainer Robin Williams was present as she rushed to the second Olympic game in the two without tax woman in a row, the first women in the history of British sport that set off such a scale.
Their dominance was absolutely, after all, her 39th unbeaten use, which is also unprecedented.
What we see is two brilliant athletes who slide across the surface with the elegance of swans, which doesn't reflect the kind of triumph all the time.
Behind each gold in the row, a battalion to willing helpers contribute to the incremental progress that make up the difference and it was no one more helpful than the coach who didn't know about 30 months ago whether he would survive that day at all than was diagnosed with him cancer.
As he said he was risky.
I had bubble cancer, which is operational and they did.
If you don't, he spreads everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes a little bit of the outlook.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was lucky that he was able to start treatment in early 2014, outside the season, which kept the interruption to a minimum if this is the right term in such circumstances.
I needed money, so I had to go better again soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would enough.
That's how it starts.
The rowing in itself is already a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one.
In the immediacy of the victory, their first thought to Williams, who spent an annoying morning spent something more than otherwise, trying to process his own anxiety.
Stanning, who was a principal in the Royal Artillery Regiment in Afghanistan, said I was an emotional wreck this week, which is perhaps something extreme, but it means so much. "
It's repeated just how much me meant how much I and Helen and Robin worked.
It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anyone, so a massive thanks to him, he is the best coach in the world.
I wouldn't have a better person to train or want a better coach.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race over the last five years.
The couple had a tough rhythm with which their opponents couldn't keep up.
Even in the last 500 metres when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to close, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very captured at the moment.
Helen called "remains in the process, remain in the process."
It's really important not to get involved.
We had a good start and at the same time we were not about to make something Tolles.
We didn't want fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go beyond and win the race, what we did.
The couple will take a time for a year before making decisions about his future.
Glover must appear next week on a wedding, her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say that was my last race.
That would have too much pressure.
In London, it took around six months to realise I'm an Olympic champion.
It was all so new for me and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
It feels so much better than that, "she said.
