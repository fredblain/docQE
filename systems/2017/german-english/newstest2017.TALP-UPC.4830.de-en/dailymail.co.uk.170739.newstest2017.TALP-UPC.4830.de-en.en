How to protect yourself with Krav Maga of gun attacks
The world out is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make him a little safer for you.
We spoke with Rhon Mizraci, a grandmaster of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at near distance.
Regardless of whether you approach you from the front or behind you, this video will show you how you turn for your robber's turn.
If you get closer to yourself from behind, then you should turn yourself first, so you can see your attacker and get out of the firing line, "says Mizrachi.
Take the gun then between your front arm and your shoulder before beating him in the face with your free elbow.
Strike him then with the knee in the performance and twist you, while the attacker gathers together against pain, the gun from his hands, beating him with the run into the face and moving backwards while addressing the gun on him.
In attackers closer to front, the technique is similar - move your body from the firing line, take the gun and twist them, so the attacker can't shoot.
Shift at the same time the weight on the gun and beat the attacker on the chest, then twist the gun from his grip before moving backwards and targeting the gun on him.
Sounds difficult?
Look at the video to see exactly how it makes Micraizi.
But remember it's more secure in a room to hand your money - unless you're not a Krav Maga grandmaster.
