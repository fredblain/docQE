Greenlandai: the oldest vertebrae is nearly 400 years old
Rare sight.
Greenland sharks are mostly just in winter to surface.
This shark has returned to the sea following an investigation on board the research ship Sanna.
He was born in 1624 and swimmed with good a 1km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day.
Greenland's shark will only get up to 150 years.
Indeed, the Greenlandhai swim at the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour he comes on average just 1,220 feet.
Just when it comes down, the five metre long animals are accelerating to satellite 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a robber.
However, this long-standing lifestyle seems to be a patent recipe for a high age.
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal Science, in any case, of a Greenlandhai, which could be 392 years old.
"Madness," comments Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock this life span, which means a world record for vertebrae.
While the evolution biologist has long been suspected, Greenland sharks will become stone.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland's sharks are hard to watch, after all, they live especially in the ice cream in front of the thinly populated coastlines of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they mostly dive on the surface only in the winter.
Researchers accordingly know about the lifestyle of Greenlandhais.
Her timeless pace measures them when they equipped six animals with a broadcaster before Spitsbergen.
Prey these sharks are still making: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a robbe, another had swallowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear.
Possibly they are chasing sleeping animals or patrolling at the bottom of the ice seas and search caravers who torture from higher water layers.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues are now investigating 28 Greenland sharks that fishermen picked up fishermen between 2010 and 2013 ahead of Greenland or Spitzbergen as bycatches from the depth of the North Atlantic.
The smallest shark was just 81 inches long, while the largest 502 inches.
To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the sharks with the carbon 14 method.
This centre of the eye lens arises before the birth of the sharks, which included proteins will no longer be renewed later.
The two smallest sharks had strikingly had a lot of carbon 14 in the lentils.
Her birth should therefore be following the early 1960s, when nuclear attempts made larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
In the country with 220 centimetres of third-seeded animals, the lentils contained a small surplus of carbon 14 from nuclear tests, therefore likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday during its investigation in 2012.
All the larger Greenland hair, by contrast, had normal carbon 14-foot quantities that emerge through cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
Indeed, the carbon clock for a 493 centimetre long Greenhandhandi showed an age of 335, while the record has been likely to be 392 years old with 502 centimetres.
That Greenlandhai females were only getting offspring when they are longer than four feet, was known.
Now, the researchers were able to assign length an age.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres was probably on the threshold of gender tire and his age was determined with 156 years, Greenland sharks with the propagation obviously leave at least one and a half centuries.
Even this is likely to be world record for vertebrates at the moment.
That such Methusaleme lives especially in icy waters isn't a coincidence.
Even the previous record holder, a 211 year old Greenwall whose bacon on the neck put a 120-year-old harpoint top, was caught before Alaska.
Through low temperatures, frequently, the organism of the animals living there also runs on savings flames.
So they mature later - and ageing slower.
To keep warm in the cold water, the animals are also often particularly great.
Because the volume is growing much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat.
The heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much bigger than at a gram elephant.
Another advantage: they have fewer enemies.
So a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should be focused on having as many offspring as possible as early as possible, "explains the evolutionary biologist.
By contrast, a very large animal should invest its resources into a long life.
