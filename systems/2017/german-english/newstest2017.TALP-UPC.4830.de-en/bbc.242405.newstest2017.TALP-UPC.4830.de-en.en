Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
The brand RBS is expected to be reduced to a back-office role, according to the bank's chief executive.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told the BBC Scotland that the brand RBS was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank has since distanced itself when it had to be almost collapsed and rescued eight years ago.
During that time, brand strategists used RBS to protect other end-user financial brands.
She backed international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now she decided to put more national brands into focus.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralised headquarters and the stock market listing will change to NatWest.
Ulster Bank's brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for retail business that will receive more importance - Coutts, Adam Co, Drummond and Holt's military bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
He told the BBC Scotland with: "the RSB brand will become our investor brand as well as to the brand under which our staff will be employed as we now become more to a bank of brands."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I'm saying now that we are not pursuing global goals but local goals.
Each of these brands will be in their own communities for something completely different and our staff will work under these brands with the customers.
RBS has already testified that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the perceptions of the various brands in its sports sponsorship.
It's time for us to develop to the bank of the brands, because how do we inside (we asked) to do this to a better bank for customers? "The chief executive said.
It would have been very cynical three years ago when we said we will be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think you'll see a lot of changes.
We can launch these brands again, so I think the time has come.
