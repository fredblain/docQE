Cats react more sensitive than hangover on cries of young people
Biologists have investigated in Hanover what effect the calls from cat babys have on adult animals.
To her surprise, the mian also didn't get the males cold - but they always behaved in the difference to the females.
Female cats can recognize the emotion of cat babies at the middle of the little.
They respond to 10 per cent faster on lutters of kittens who were in great distress, as scientists have found out from the veterinary university and the Medical College Hanover (MHH).
Hangovers are also responding to the cries of kittens - but always equal.
Apparently, the acoustic differences between the miaue of less and sharply hit young animals for the males either not perceived or not of importance, "said biologist Wiebke Conerding from the MHH.
She is an author of the study published this Friday in the specialist magazine of BMC Evolutionary Biology.
In a previous investigation, the research team had already found that the duration and pit of kitten shouting differs with the urgency of its need for help.
Overall, we have been watched nine adult hangovers and eight kits from the livestock farming of the MHH.
They were played for a call of minors who were taken from the burs for three minutes and separated by mother and siblings.
At the same time, they were confronted with shouts of stronger kittens, which were additionally highlighted.
The researchers hold their results despite the small sample for meaningful.
All the females, even those who had not yet had their own offspring, responded differentiation on the cries, "said conversing.
They turned up more quickly to the loudspeaker when this call of the more vulnerable kittens.
This ability may be born or developed with gender maturity.
"A surprise was that the males have responded at all," the biology said.
In the past, scientists have already investigated responses from women and men on baby noise.
Again, some studies showed that women responded more sensitive to babies, regardless of whether they were already mothers or not, the biologist Marina Scheumann reported.
