Traveller Ian Wright scores for a travel guide to his tongue to the dirtiest places of Europe
A British traveller underwent his immune system and citizenship of a serious examination - by leaving some of Europe's most dirtiest and most energetic places.
The presenter and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shadowed his train on a euro ticket, a railing at the Piccadilly Circus, a rink of a Zugtoilette as well as a public phone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.
Before the divergence of each object, he used a luminometer to show us and what he will enter.
But the experiment, which was filmed under the title: The Lickhik's Guide to Inner Strength, brought some surprising results to daylight.
The thought of disconnecting the flush of a train toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repellent, but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen ring.
On his trip through Europe, Mr Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about promoting bacterial bacteria as well as about his own health.
Fortunately, nothing left what he dismissed, more than a bad afterthought in the mouth.
Mr Wright became known for testing the resilience of his intestines by traveling through the world and ate strange as well as wonderful things.
From public railings to station stations to rinsing toilets, the job put his immune system definitely under a sample
In the film, he told: "already as a child, I was relatively uncomfortable about what affects my health and I've had all kinds of things put in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."
In the film, he was definitely fair to his reputation.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His trial showed a luminome number of more than 4,000 units.
In comparison, the luminometry number is freshly washed hands less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet he refused to strip after their luminometers were over 4,000 units while freshly washed hands one of less than 60
Mr Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio produced the travel film The Lickies Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the bacterial number in different locations such as the bathroom
In the film, he says: "this comes the worst of what I've smelled in a toilet, close."
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm going to leave nothing here because it's indoors here.
The Lickner's guide to Inner Streggth was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio.
The company provides Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both milk acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of bacterial bacteria and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we wanted to provide really something new to consumers.
Something that is fascinating to watch, while at the same time explaining the benefits of probiotics.
We led crazy brainstorming through which ended up telling Lass Ian to call.
They claim that interest is going to be a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a wider context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it's linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary, we have been able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.
I also think the film shows we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who led the film's director, adding: "let me say it like that - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I have depended on him, like the echoed Russian toilet shown in the film.
Of course, there were things where it was easier to get Ian to cover them and others where this was pretty difficult.
I'm glad we've taken some of these dirty leaks on film. "
In one of Valio's 2015 survey, 84 per cent of all respondents associated milk acid bacteria, particularly with the welfare of stomach and intestine and 58 per cent said they at least occasionally use products that include attached milk acid bacteria.
