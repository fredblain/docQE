A French director with Jewish roots removed a media result after betraying that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli pre-selection as it requested Arab guests, according to an employee.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary Shoah, left his trouble at Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel's pre-election list.
However, the country was not listed between the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and deleted?

Instead, Kempinksi Bristol offers a way to choose Israel across its own Call Center.
According to a statement, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received there, "shocked him, as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel resident said the measure was an intentional decision by the management of the Kempinski hotel.
The reason behind it triggered even more raging in the director.

The Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadassman called this a big shame, "the SÃ¼ddeuthe newspaper reports.
We were horrified and dismayed by this event.
That's really very embarrassing.
The fact that this has taken place in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even greater disgrace.
That does not require any explanation.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions, "the official said.
The incident triggered a pretty great resonance on the internet in which people called the whole a scandal.
Some understand the Kempinski Hotel that it had given up the alleged calls of Arab guests.
"Ashamed you," they said in another contribution in which he was pointed out that the hotel, which is located at the noble Kurfurstendamm, stands near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly pointed out all the allegations and called the incident an accident and apologised at Lanzmann, The Mirror reports.
There was never a direct statement to include Israel into the fast-track list, "the Southern German newspaper quoted a spokesman for the Kempinski hotel.
It adds that the country's preselection was now added.
