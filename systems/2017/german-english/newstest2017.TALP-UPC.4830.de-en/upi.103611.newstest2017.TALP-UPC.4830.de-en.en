North Sea workers take talks again, set strike
Labour fights regarding pay for North Sea oil workers are being suspended, while all parties are putting on the table for a new round of conversations, negotiators said.
Strikes against oil service provider Wood Group have been carried out sporadically on platforms in the North Sea, which will be operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
Wood Group, as well as the Unite and RMT unions, can confirm that we have agreed to reshape the delivery process of the current dispute, "it said in a common statement.
We will be holding some full-day sessions in the next few weeks that will start early next year to reassess the problems.
Unions said their latest strike, which is the first over 25 years, was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 per cent.
Wood Group has cut this year's rates to its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 per cent because of negative market pressure.
The company's council cut follows a 10-percent decline for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said that additional cuts to the company are giving the needed room to come through the downturn.
Shell has sacked for his part of thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas businesses into up to 10 countries as it rationalises its business activities as a result of its merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices, an economic situation that had strengthened by the British's decision to leave the European Union in June.
Scottish parliamentary member Dave Anderson met with workers earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest work disputes that had taken place for a generation in the North Sea.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
In the North Sea and throughout the country, we need an economy that works for many and not just for a few, "he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea compared with an average of around $7 billion over the past five years.
