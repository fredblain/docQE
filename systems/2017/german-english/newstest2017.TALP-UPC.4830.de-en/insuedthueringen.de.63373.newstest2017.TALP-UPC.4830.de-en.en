Soprano Anna Netrebko goes openly with her son Tiago's autism - and turns to other affected parents: "you have to have the courage to talk about it."
"Medicine has made great progress," said the 44-year-old the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.
When the disease had been detected at her son, she believed she had to die.
The now eight-year-old Tiago, however, has moved well forward and now learn privately in New York, where it's the best therapists.
To give an example: when I ask him something that's going back two years when I sang on Milan's Scala, he remembers nothing, "said Netrebko.
But he is the happiest person on earth.
Tiago comes from Netreben's connection with the bassbariton Erwin Schrott.
She is now married with the tenor Yusiy Eyazov.
