Trade between Russia's Iran suddenly rises to 71% - RT Russiness
With the lifting of the sanctions, according to the Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzharyan, trade sales between Moscow and Tehran in the year, grew by 70.9 per cent.
Since international sanctions have been lifted against Iran, interest on the part of Russian companies at stores in the country grew strong, the ambassador told.
Russian companies are taking existing links with Iran, while new firms are ready to access the market.
Of course, the further trade expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral collaboration with Iran, said Dzhagaryan.
He noted that trading sales between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 rose by 70.9 per cent compared with the same period in 2015, and $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports in Iran increased by 91.5 per cent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose 16 per cent to $158 million.
The trade recovery has been reached by deliveries of machinery, land vehicles and guns, "the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan goes from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia for this year.
Last year, the Russian overseas representation admitted about 35,000 visas, primarily travel visas, an Iranian citizen.
In addition, Iran reached the top 20 of the countries, affecting the number of tourists in Russia.
You could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia will be broken from last year, "he said.
At the same time, only relatively few Russians visit Iran, something that the ambassador hopes it will change.
Personally, I can recommend the visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, who have received monuments of the old Persian civilisation in a good condition, "he said.
