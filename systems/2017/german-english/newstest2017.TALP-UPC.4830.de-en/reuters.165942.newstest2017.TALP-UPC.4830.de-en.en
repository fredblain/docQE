Gilead gets legal costs from the Hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
An American court judge decided that Gilead Sciences is entitled to refund the legal costs that emerged from the Hepatits C legal battle with the pharmaceutical company Merck Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was freed from a compensation payment of $200million for the violation of two patents of Merck, which stood in connection with the blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead after a US judge uncovered a pattern of misconduct by Mercks, including the ceiling and other unethical acts.
During survey of the lawsuit on Thursday, U.S. Judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead's claim for issuing costs were created during the defence of the case.
Merck is trying to equalise with Gilead, which dominates the market of a new generation of hepatitis drugs, which can cure over 90 per cent of patients with liver disease.
The case goes back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed property on laboratory work that Sofosbuvir underlined, the active ingredient in the Gilead's drugs.
