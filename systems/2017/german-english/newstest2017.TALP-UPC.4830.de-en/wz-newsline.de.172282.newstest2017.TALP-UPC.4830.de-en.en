Rain instead of stars: hope of weather improvement
The weather has made the star guards in southwestern Germany on Friday night by the bill - but there is still hope.
The night was poorly suited for clouds and rain for watching the sky spectacle, said the chairman of the Observatory of Welzheim, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.
Our hope is on the night of Saturday.
The weather is expected to be good, then we're determined to see a lot of star snaps in heaven.
The star shapes are persecutors, which include 216,000 kilometres per hour among the fastest star snippets.
Their name has them because they appear to get out of the star picture Perseus, which goes up in the Northeast.
