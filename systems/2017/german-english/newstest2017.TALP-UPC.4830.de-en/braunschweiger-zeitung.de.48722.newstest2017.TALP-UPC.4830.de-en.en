Who is building Braunschwing's favourable homes?
The SPD and Greens think: investors are to be much more duty in the future.
How do you respond to the bad news that Brunswick will lose nearly 1300 favorable homes in the next few years?
The SPD proposes a's concept of action to the next council meeting.
But dispute is programmed.
First and foremost about the question: who is to actually build the favourable homes?
So far, a settlement is missing.
SPD chairman Christoph Bratmann thinks: "we agree with the Greens: who wants to build urban areas in the future 20 per cent of all apartments as social housing."
However, the favourable apartments can also emerge in the stock.
However, the big point in City Hall is, according to Bratmann: how to go around with investors who want to build on private areas?.
We want investors to build at least 10 per cent on such areas, but as much as 20 per cent of homes as social housing. "
A new urban housing support program, which will cost millions and has yet to be funded, is expected to provide incentives.
The problem, according to Bratman: "there's no agreement between the groups at the moment."
The CDU wants investors to make as few regulations as possible.
The left still wants tough conditions for investors.
Regardless, according to Bratmann, a tightening of the situation on the housing market.
If the action concept is implemented, this will provide additional tasks in construction management.
More staff is needed.
It's unclear whether we will get the professionals.
But the program is still not altogether: because the around 1260 new homes should be built anyway.
But how do you equal the loss of another 1300 favorable homes whose promotion will expire over the next few years?
It will be 500 apartments by 2020 alone.
To prevent this, according to planning spokesman Nicole Palm, expiring ties should be bought from the city.
Additionally, thought would have to be thought to pick up housing back into price returns.
This is possible in the Western City.
On one blow, the problem could be solved.
Because in the West Council, the year-end deadline runs out.
Around 1800 homes could pick up there back into the price of favourable homes.
Just: that's wanting the owners, the housing companies don't.
Because the number of social housing in the West City is being raised drastically again, removed from the target of so-called mixing.
A concentration of social weaknesses in just a few city districts is expected to no longer exist.
The Greens expect there will still be movement in the discussion.
Group chairman Holger Herlitschken thinks: for a broad majority, the CDU needs to be in the boot.
While this was focused on more construction places for detached houses.
But what doesn't mean that a compromise cannot yet be found.
