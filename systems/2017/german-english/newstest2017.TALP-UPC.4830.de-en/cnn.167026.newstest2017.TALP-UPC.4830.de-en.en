Why we Simone, Gabby and Laurie need
That's what I present to me among the women's olympics in the turn and this is for more than one reason.
First, I have been involved in every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.
And second: this team has three turners, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who worked inspiringly for many young girls of other skin colours.
The structure of this team, which Aly Raisman, which is Jeding and Madison Kocian, which is Catholics, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the U.S.
It solided the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
Over the last four years, the number one among the female Turner was an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were # 1 and 2.
That shows strength.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America cheered.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez as they delivered unexpected, but masterful gym routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American who won gold at an individual multi-championship event.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We are experiencing the tip of this sport, but so don't look at getting classes across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie struck all the same as Aly and Madison to create it in the Olympic team.
They are the last five because the next Olympic team will have only four turners in the team, and that's that last year with Marta Karoliy as a coach.
But the reality is likely that turns are an expensive sport and Turner primarily continues in private turn clubs, which are being maintained by parents, which raise for the training, facilities, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the coaches and their turners and families).
The majority of these turn clubs are in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.
In these clubs, the Turner gets their entire training and that is an expensive and long-term engagement for the families.
Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, both have trained their athletes since they started with the guys.
We need to allow the communities of innumerable, young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a more affordable and more easily accessible turnaround.
I founded my trial of 20 years.
At my events, we have trained free and affordable turns in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youngsters (especially black and hispan) and trained national and international winners.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer the youth high-quality guys who earn the possibility of learning and benefiting from this great Olympic sport.
Turns develop strength, flexibility and coordination for the body, as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination provides lifelong benefits to health as well as for school and professional success.
It's the inspiration of this team to get thousands of young girls to get interested in the guys and that's great.
It's so important to participate in the sport, especially for girls.
That's such an exciting time.
Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real portrayal of Girl Power by the occasion of the Olympic team gold and thanks, back her so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated to become their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
