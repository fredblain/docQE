Witnesses searched: beverage market in forest oil raid
A robbery has been carried out on Thursday night on the Rewe XXL's beverage market at the Waldbill Gertern Road.
Under presentation of a firearm, three dark dressed people who had missed their faces, from the drinks market's employees then first walk and then presumably with a silver Volkswagen Gulf.
How much money was exploited, police don't share.
The perpetrators should have been big between 1.60 and 1.70 feet, so relatively small.
The beverage market is immediately available from the park of the re-market, accessible and badly viewable.
The offenders must be ran after the raid in the direction of Gerterstrasse, Friedrich-Engelberg's train and from the opposite Scottish parking lot with the silver car, possibly in the direction of B 256R (charge ring).
Anyone who made observations about the time (against 7.45pm), which is related to the robbery, is expected to report urgency among police.
