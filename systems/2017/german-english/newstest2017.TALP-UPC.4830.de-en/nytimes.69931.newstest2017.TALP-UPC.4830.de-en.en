The depressing meal of the economic crisis in a rich meal
In March 1933, shortly after his rise to the president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch in the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt had a fait for sophisticated delicacies of Fifth Avenue like PÃ¢te de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup.
His menu this day was a little more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potato piracy and as a dessert a plum pudding.
It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people, "said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat."
The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coes's latest book Chop Suey acted from Chinese cuisine in the US, while brick man in her book's 97 orchard has been told about life in a housing at the Lower East Side from the food perspective.
Her latest collaboration, a decent meal, will appear on Tuesday in the Harper publisher, illustrating the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a reporter in the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small, unnecessary snack at the Flatiron District, which has already been in business since the stock crash in 1929.
Brick man, 54, ordered a freshest cherry with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, turkey with potato purges and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered reporters, this found this fitted the couple for a discussion of the food in the era of the Great Depression.
"Rich groceries were very popular," said Ziegel.
There was peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.
They were prepared from an ingredient and slightly cheaper that stretches the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinners.
CoE grinsten.
It must have laid in the stomach like lead, "he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American budget, especially in rural areas, an all-y-can-eat buffet.
Teams of women cook for male field workers and it was served freshly baked paste for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War, a Square Meal distinguishes the pathways with which the country declined to be no longer the slate land.
It was a time when food for the Americans was a central, tense theme, "endorsed Coe, why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Just as tense was the new budget diet: mysterious foods such as bread and casseroles have become basic foods, casserole rolling as a "wonderful way of recovering food rests," noticed brick since cooks could hide unappetitive ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry fruit.
Meat, which was years at the heart of the American cuisine, became a rarely served luxury.
Strange mixtures have been tried, as a calorie and nutritious satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy kitchen sense.
During her research for the book, which includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a court from this era, baked onions with peak butter.
It wasn't a popular addition at lunchtime, "says Coe.
Brick man continues: it was surreal.
Peanut butter and baked onions don't fit each other.
It was typical for many of the home economic recipes.
As never before or since, budget economists - including Louise Stanley, director of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 to 1943 - drove the country's eating habits of this kind.
By releasing prescriptions and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become budget policymakers and to meet the challenge of turning pamper like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
A Square Meal is a festival of historic delicacies.
In particular, the reports of the government's response to the hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's lass-mich-cake food stance.
While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farm kitchen of his kitchen, he dined like the millionaire man of world to which he has become.
He moved continental kitchen like fish with cucumber sauce, "Coe said.
He in a nearly gilted dining room and wearing a smoking.
He was wonderfully realistic.
President Roosevelt might have committed the same mistake if not his wife, Eleanor, called him to state an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, the hinters of a housekeeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs Roosevelt carried out that the White House produced the most boring meal in Washington but also one of the most prepared.
Many of the species from the era of the Great Depression to deal with food was dismissed once the country came back on its legs.
The legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food, said Ziegel, as well as how science was applied to food.
The couple announced the book's eating habits better understood the book's eating habits - for example, like they couldn't throw food.
She had a real fear of wasting food, "Coe said.
Brick man recalled: 'you actually made people sick.
There was the wind plague incident.
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg, they and Coe produced a dessert which they had been preparing at home: the plum dessert, which President Roosevelt was attached to midday.
It is called Prune Whip, "said Ziegelman, adding that it was an usual trick to miss a sending name.
There was no beaten cream, just plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone emerged somewhat reluctantly a spoon in the tough, brown glibbers.
Amazingly, it didn't taste bad.
CoE took three times an afterthought.
Like a Can-Do-Budgeter, he told his wife, "A couple of hacked walnuts would help."
