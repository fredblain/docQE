Here comes the enforcement trailer
Germany's rasers need to adjust to the next generation speed knife: in different federal economies, among others in Hessen and Brandenburg, new lightning devices are being tested to effectively transfer paces.
The futuristically acting enforcement trailer of Vitronic from Wiesbaden, for example, can be deployed to accident points, where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by police.
For example, at highway construction construction or sanitary bridges with temporary pace, there is often no needed infrastructure to provide there with a stationary speed limit for complying with the speed limit.
A permanent mobile build-up, however, can be too dangerous or elaborate.
The Enforcement trailer is self-sufficient: his battery at uninterrupted measurement five days, the case data is transmitted over a modem.
With laser measuring technology, all vehicles can also be captured over several marks.
Variable speed limits as well as passing bans after time, line and vehicle class can also be monitored.
In the high-profile condition you can move to supporters, according to manufacturers with each car with supporters.
For it to be not simply clouded, he is lowered in measurement operation, so the wheels in the armored and by the way also disappear.
In addition, a built-in alarm is expected to protect the flash of vandalism.
Since 2015, the trailer has been tested according to Vitronic in different federal states and is now also used.
Foreign authorities are also flashing off with the new technology: recently France has down 100 pieces, according to an order of 150 pieces last year.
