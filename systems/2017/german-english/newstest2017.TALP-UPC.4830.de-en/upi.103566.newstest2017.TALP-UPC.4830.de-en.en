NASA climate model: Venus was once inhabitable
Venus was probably once inhabited by a new NASA climate model, according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.
Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms resembling those of climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have once eating conditions with their hot, waterless surface and carbon atmosphere.
Scientists have previously indicated that the slow revolution of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earthy atmosphere and still turned slowly.
The model also lit the topography of early Venus.
The planet probably dismissed more dry areas than de earth, but had once enough water and geographic variability to host lives and protected fast evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from a sun, which was 30 per cent matter.
In the GISS model simulation, the slow revolution of Venus exposes their daily side of the sun almost two months, "said Giss scientist Anthony Del Genio in a news release.
This warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, which looks like a umbrella to shield the surface from much of the sun warmth.
The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than the Earth today.
The model brought a story of Venus that resembles the evolution, which was previously suspected by planetary researchers.
Although she was once presumably habitable, the Venus -- in the course of several billion years - exposed too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans evaporated and their water steam was burned away from the ultraviolet light.
When their hydrogen emerged, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained back with a deadly greenhouse -- the Venus, which as we know them today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus Climate Models in the Geophysical Research Letters.
