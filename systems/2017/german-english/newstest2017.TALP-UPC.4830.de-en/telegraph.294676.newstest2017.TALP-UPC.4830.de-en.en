England must direct the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will not only bring renewal and prosperity in our local communities and across London, but all over the country.
For me, this represented the biggest attraction of Heathrows, just as it was then in 2012 in London when we run a large effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympics brought big benefits for Stratford and the East End.
And that's going to get back by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities, we will already have 10,000 new apprenticeships, create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.
Just as they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who will think the challenge of expanding Heathrows is too great.
I was told that England will never be ready for the Games and that we will be blamed on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcoming, but Heathrow answers every question he asked.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project.
Enlargement is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211bn of wildlife growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across GB.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11bn infrastructure investment programme in time and budget, which was elected five years in a row to the world's best airport terminal, to the T2, which was built amid the world's two most frequented catwalks.
Now they are ready to deliver a third catwalk, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment.
The 2012 London Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that Heathrow's expansion will also be one.
It's time we draw this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment on which England can be proud.
