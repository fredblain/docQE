Buyers in Primark outraged about women who tried underwear in the middle of the business
The buyers didn't know where they should look when a woman pulled her clothes amid a primark to try underwear.
To worsen the situation, she mustered how she looked at it, pulled her and put her back into the shelf.
They continued and tried four pairs of underwear in a business in the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkstone.

A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the business at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear, she pulled herself again and left the business without buying something. "
She said: "people couldn't believe what they saw."
In the middle of the sales surface, she took a pair of underwear out of the outage, pulling her own tights and pants and tried her.
She didn't even try to find a slightly more discreet place to do it - they just stood there, cheeky like Oskar. "
Everyone starred when they pulled the underwear again, which they obviously didn't like them as they put them back into the shelf. "
She repeated the same thing with three other underwear before finally deciding that her nothing liked herself, attracted and rushed out.
She didn't disturb it that they watched someone - or think about the person who would buy the underwear in circumstances they had tried. "
Mrs Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: 'how disgusting to think that someone would take underwear with home that has another person and who weren't washed. "
The incident occurred Tuesday afternoon.
Ms Davidson added: 'how I got to get the staff trying to pull the garments out of sale after they went - which is just as good.
I'd hate it to go home with a new couple's underwear and figure out that another woman has handed her and returned and they weren't washed.
A spokesman for Primark said: "Primark is aware of the incident, which occurred on Tuesday 9 August at our branch in Folkstone."
Any products coming into question were drawn from the sale.
