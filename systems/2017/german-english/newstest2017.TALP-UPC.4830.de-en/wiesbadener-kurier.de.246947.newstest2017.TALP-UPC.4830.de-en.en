Disease case: when paying the organiser
Diseased holidaymakers get money back after their journey, when the cause of the disease is doubtful at the hotel.
However, that is only the case when more than 10 per cent of guests proved the same symptoms show.
In the negotiated case, a family on the second day of their Turkish holiday was hard for diarrhoea and vomiting.
She spent almost the entire holiday in the room.
Their disease caused the holidaymakers back to a defective treatment plant, which had allegedly polluted the seawater.
The family believe the trip was poor - and complained against the organiser.
In court, the plaintiffs had no success.
While the treatment plant was in fact defective.
But the organiser only learned before leaving the plaintiffs.
By then he had to assume that seawater was fine.
So he did not injured his information requirements, according to the verdict.
No contamination has been found in the water's samples.
The disease of several hotel guests - perhaps by contagion - belongs to the general risk of life.
Of 691 guests, only 38 were diseased.
