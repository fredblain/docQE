Flight: "every fleeting woman has experiences with sexual violence.
Sexual violence is part of women fleeing alone, almost everyday.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatised.
A house provides refuge.
In a large kitchen, four women sit.
Each has a baby, which is at best a year old.
One has put her little son in the arm.
He looks with great eyes curious in the room.
His mother stared on the table plate.
Until she notices that she is being watched.
She smiles and kisses the little.
The scene acts normal.
Until you speak with Katrin Bahr.
She is an area managing director of Condrobs, a carrier for social aid offerings in Bayern, and employs, among others, the issue of women on the flight.
The four women in the kitchen have fled.
They live in the Munich north in one of the few devolved shelters for their own women and their children in Bayern.
In January, Condrobs have made the establishment along with Pro Familia and Munich women's aid.
Recently she was officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
Men don't exist - even as visitors.
The exception is a guard before the door.
It's not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here has made experiences of sexual violence on her flight, "says Bahr.
Men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they threaten torture or death or because their families send them as hope to Europe, "
At women outweigh other reasons for the flight: "many steal themselves secretly because they don't see another way out."
In their home, they made experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honour murder, slavery or forced prostitution.
That continues it.
On the flight, that goes on.
That smugglers, for example, for a bottle of water call for a sexual act, is not a rarity, 'says.
And women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Who believes that's that once they arrived in Germany, mistaken, told Bahr.
Here, too, single women in refugee shelters would often be viewed as inferior and at worst abuse.
This means that about 90 per cent of women who live in accommodation in Munich North are traumatised, she estimates.
Some of the children are certainly not voluntarily created. "
Many women are so used to them saying nothing.
Or they don't trust themselves to speak openly about the experience because the shame is too big. "
Since they often don't know they wouldn't need more accommodation just for them, demanding bar.
In Bayern, the seven district governments are responsible for accommodating refugees.
On the question of whether they know from a similar project as in Munich in their responsibilities, some respond with No.
About there is something like this in government accommodation.
Even in Swabs, fleeting women alone are not separated, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press secretary of the government.
In Upper Bayern, Underground and Central Francs there are in some community accommodation floors or their own homes only for single women and their children.
The exception is Niederbayer, there are two central accommodation exclusively for women.
The Committee on Rights of Women and Equality of Genders in the European Parliament is also calling for women to be housed separately by men.
In a study published for the committee, it said: it's very important that men and women are being separated. "
'Missing privacy or getting men and women together, it can be - continually - violence against women. "
In particular, the laundries should be separated and easily accessed for women, standing in the study.
How much the women feel this need for protection can be read at the range that gives it to the house in Munich.
"Since speaking around that there is, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr.
You could easily make up a second house.
