Better traffic flow on motorway tracker
It's regularly on the bypass road - here's a picture of November.
But that is meant to change: the regulatory lane is to be extended.
This is good news for all car drivers who are in careers on the environment road every evening in the traffic jam when they drive over the highway - (43).
The national operation of street construction extends next Tuesday and Wednesday (16 / 17 August) in the area between Hammer Street and the downhill Weseler Street the legal track at 700 metres.
Motorists then can thrive directly from Hammer Street on the right.
The big advantage: traffic shares early on, improving the total ­ expiration on the much-driven section of the Bundestrasse 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU group in the district's representation of Münster-West.
The carriageway on the feet nervously needs motorists especially between 17 and 7 p.m.
Working days range from the back to the bridge over the Albersloher path and sometimes beyond.
Reason is the needle turn on the B 51 just before the downhill Weseler Street.
From here, traffic is only steered over the highway bridge.
The second track had to be rebuilt before three-quarter years ago.
The reason: static calculations had revealed that the bridge no longer owns the required vigour to include, especially, heavy traffic traffic dual.
How long this bottleneck and the related workable congestion will last, the relevant national operation cannot say.
However, with years to come, because the bridge has an official remaining time between now and 2034.
For the extension of the legal backlog, the country's operation deliberately selected the traffic weaker time in school holidays because of disabilities.
Traffic will be passed at the construction site on Tuesday and on Wednesday.
