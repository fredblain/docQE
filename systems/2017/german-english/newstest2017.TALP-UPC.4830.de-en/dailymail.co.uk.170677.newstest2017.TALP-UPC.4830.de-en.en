Culture of Political Correctness leaves voter fraud in Muslim areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed last year on prompting a government report for corruption from office
A culture of political Correctness has meant that widespread voter fraud in Muslim communities will be knowingly ignored as a damning government report disclosed today.
Former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles attacks police, electorate observers and city halls for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse because of over sensitivities relating to ethnic and religion.
The former minister of integration and local government, which is now a corruption king, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that police should be allowed to set up shutout bands outside electoral cabins to protect intermittent voters.
He recommends voters should lead an ID to prove their identity in elections.
At present, one voter must merely call his name and address.
The report suggests that not remote ink on the finger of a person when they make their electoral votes to prevent someone choosing twice.
Whistleblowers should get more protection, says Sir Eric.
He calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions from non-official committees or working groups.
This is not only serving against electoral fraud, but is also intended to protect the local government before the broader corruption and financial fraud culture, which is accompanied by it, "he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlet election scandal in eastern London.
Last year, a special election court decided that the acting Mayor Lutfur Rahman should be dismissed after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his office.
The court found that Rahman would have perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community in a cynical way, and that he would have silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobia allegations.
Rahman is said to have his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of Muslims to choose him.
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the episode of an imitation where one person chooses as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.
He was particularly alarming to the fraudulent postal ballot - at the elderly members of the Muslim community to pressure people to choose a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including leading expectations to prove the identity
In his report, it said: as evidence has been appropriate that pressure has been exerted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, particularly women and young people to vote, according to the will of the elderly, particularly communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds.
There was concern that... state institutions have known such behaviour because of politically correct over-sensitivities regarding the ethnicity and religion knowingly ignored. "
Sir Eric spoke of 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including banning political activists editing postal election documents to stop polls.
The report, which is being considered by Theresa May, also requires tougher registration reviews to prevent the electoral directory of immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider asking voters before the election, according to your ID.
Not removed ink on the finger of a person once they delivered her voice to prevent someone choosing twice.
Systematic reviews on a person's nationality to ensure they are eligible.
A three-year limit on requests for an automatic briefing.
Ban that political activists edited full postal elections and envelopes of postal elections.
The police are giving the power to settle shutouts around electoral stations.
A legislative change that eases an indictment of intimidation according to the Representation of the People Act 1983 (People Representation Act 1983).
Photography banned election stations.
Requirement that only English be used in the election stations (with the exception of Wales).
Intensifying the training to ensure that staff rule that voters go to the electoral cabin alone.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it's amazing that according to the Tower Hamlet case, there was no criminal charge.
The electoral court has explained Lutfur Rahman and his deputies for corruption and illegal practices as unsustainable, "he said.
He was pleaded guilty because of a number of reasons for sufficient - according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings.
He also criticises the impact of the electoral registration departments of the town halls.
Sir Eric said: "the court ruling in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.
Our country, as the mother of parliaments, carries a proud heritage, but the worrying and disguised spread of voter fraud and denial of some authorities are threatening this good reputation.
