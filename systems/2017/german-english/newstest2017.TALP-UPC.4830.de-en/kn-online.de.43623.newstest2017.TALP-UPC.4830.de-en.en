Steel - Lightness for Deutsche Steel Industry
The crisis-backed and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared an extra cost of millions.
Financial burdens, which the industry threatened from energy support, are off the table.
It remains in liberation from the renewable energy surcharge at the inventories for so-called equipment production in the German steel industry, said Federal Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the West General Newspaper (WAZ, Friday edition).
I'm really happy that we could finally achieve that after two years of tough negotiations. "
The European Commission, therefore, initially had planned to ask the steel manufacturers to use gases from the block to power generation for its own consumption.
The steel industry threatened an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros a year, according to the German industry association.
Gabriel told the WAZ there is now a principle agreement with the EU commission after talks with competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
It is only when the generators are replaced in the steelworks, falling an EEG-pay of 20 per cent.
But these are not going to be raised in the steel industry, too.
The IG Metal welcomed Germany's agreement with the EU commission on standard production.
As a result, the status quo of the previous settlement will be largely enshrined.
Particular importance has Gabriel's successful efforts for the steel industry.
In terms of our campaign's stole, the future is this is the first step. "
Others must follow.
Even in the reform of emissions trading, climate and employment targets are weighing, "explained IG chief executive JÃ¶rg Hofmann in Frankfurt.

It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.

Most recently, prices were more likely to have stagnated.
The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost cutting.
ThyssenKrupp latest wanted not to exclude closures of individual works.
Around 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry in late 2015.
