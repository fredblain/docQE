Seriously injured - man stands out on his ex-girlfriend
A man has attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and seriously injured.
As the police said yesterday, the 50-year-old had got the key to the home to pick up his personal things.
Instead, the alcoholised perpetrators cut the clothing of his ex-girlfriend.
When these came to the apartment, he stabbed her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured in his hand and body.
Police were able to arrest the perpetrator.
While the 50-year-old destroyed the clothes of his ex-girlfriend, he called his mother.
This alerted its sister then.
Together with her life companion, the 45-year-old wanted to calm her brother.
But she couldn't move him to leave the home.
That's why she went out of the house with her life companion.
On the road, they met the man's ex-life person.
When the two women entered the home again, the 50-year-old pushed his sister to the side and grabbed his ex-girlfriend.
