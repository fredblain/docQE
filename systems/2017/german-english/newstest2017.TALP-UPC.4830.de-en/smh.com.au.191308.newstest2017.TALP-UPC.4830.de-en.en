Future of Portland's meltdown because of lifting the energy contract is questionable
The future of Portland's aluminium melting of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs from workers - are at stake as the plant operator terminates the energy supply contract and thus lift all supply contracts, as the delivery energy company reported.
This move followed the government's decision in Victoria earlier this year to give no further subsidies to the operation of the facility.
A subsidy set for 20 years is running in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs at the facility of Alcoa in Portland are at stake.
No fewer than 2,000 jobs directly, as well as indirect - could be endangered in closure.
In addition, it could come to domino effects as the melting about 10 per cent of Victoria's entire power generation.
2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry meltdown, leading to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa's meltdown in Portland loses money and risks closing.
This move follows years of speculation about the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently because of the power price for the facility.
AGL, which delivers the large aluminium melting with its Loy Yang A power station in Latrobe Valley, announced that it assumes that three other owners will terminate their contracts.
The facility is in the majority ownership of a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which Chinese companies CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
AGL assumes the facility will continue to operate in Portland, which includes another physical demand for electricity through the meltdown, "the company said.
AGL continues to say that the contracts were so-called security businesses, which should have entered into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month termination period so they will end in 2017.
Of course, AGC assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenues in fiscal year, "the power supplier said.
Any potential implications for revenue on AGL from the DJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong futures markets for wholesale currency prices.
AGL announced that it had already written the value of the contracts in its annual accounts of $187 million in an expectation of a termination.
Alcoa said the decision to book the contracts will not affect the capacity of Alcoas... or guaranteeing power supplies to melting. "
The US company said it had completed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which should have entered into force from November this year, even if it's still guilty of a statement why it resigned from the contract.
Analysts warn of the industry's poor economic conditions ahead of the possible closure of Portland meltdown in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.
In reference to the statements of the analysts earlier this week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumed around 600 megawatts and Tomago annually around 900 megawatts to electricity.
Should both facilities disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the power market.
And for us as an electricity producer, that wouldn't be good, "he said.
