Raiffeisenbank Gmund at Tegernsee requires rich savers in future criminal interest rates - as a second institute in Germany.
Bank chief executive Josef Paul said Thursday: "it's only 139 customers who park 40 million euros on giro or daily accounts."
The Federal Association of Deutsche Banks speaks of an individual case and does not see it as a signal: ordinary savers would not need to be afraid to pay for their savings criminal penalties.
Camp banks money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), must pay their 0.4 per cent penalty.
This fee requires Raiffeisenbank Gmund from September from private and corporate customers for deposits over £100,000 to giro or daily accounts.
"The first £100,000 are free."
The next 100,000 costs £400 in the year, "Paul said.
He has been wary of 40 million euros for some time, which could be lifted from one day to the other and which he couldn't recover.
"They are on the central bank account and cause 0.4 per cent cost," the bank's chief said.
I can't hint for every million 4,000 euros. "
The cost he now continues after the polluter principle is now.
Letting the cash just be in the trespasses of the Raiffeisenbank would be far too dangerous: I have experienced four overs, I don't want to get the fifth of them!, "the bank's board said.
Most customers would have understanding and changed to other investment forms.
Few wandered to other banks.
The Co-operative Association Bayern said: the ECB's extreme monetary policy course causes significant costs at all banks. "
Carrying it alone is business permanently not possible. "
Some German banks have therefore increased their charges for account, credit cards or transfers.
With criminal interest rates for deposits of three million euros, the Thuringer People and Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land had made headlines with their Skatbank branch in 2014.
Michael Kemmer, chief executive director of the banking association, said: "we don't expect private customers to have to pay coverage of charges for deposits, so the competition in Germany is far too strong in Germany under banks and savings banks."
A banker said there's on the Tegernsee there's been a clientele that is slightly luxurious from the assets. "
This can become the problem for a little bank's problem when they are wary of free money.
The 1911 Co-operative Bank Gmund has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernese.
In the region, familiar actors, athletes and entrepreneurs live.
The Co-operative Association Bayern is currently not known any other banks that charge a replacement for deposits of private clients, "spokesman seriously said.
The president of the Federal Federation of German People's Banks and Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), Uwe happiness, had explained at the end of June: "the threshold, into negatives towards the private client, is very, very high."
The competition is hard, and it faces the migration of investors to competition.
Customers in Germany will not like that in the width.
