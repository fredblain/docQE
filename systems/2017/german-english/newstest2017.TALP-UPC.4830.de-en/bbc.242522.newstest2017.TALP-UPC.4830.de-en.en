Saving in the Moelfre Bay: three men have lucky yet to be alive.
Three men have lucky yet to be alive after being thrown ahead of their fishing boat before Anglesey.
The Moelfell RNLI rescue station suggested on Friday at 13: 20 BST alarm after a crew observed the event in Moelfrey Bay.
The three men had difficulty swimming in safety, while their boat moved from their own strength.
We saw how the boat turned near itself and put us the worst, "said the head of the rescue station of Moelfre Vince Jones.
Happily, the strong winds have already got the boat except their reach until we let to water, "he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man exhausted at the age of 60 and was found at a buoy without a bailout.
They arrived all on board the coastal boat and were taken back to the rescue station
Mr Jones said: "the three men who were thrown into the water are lucky unharmed and still alive.
While the boat engine had an emergency row, this triggered, however, at the corner of the boot from the person who controlled the boat.
Someone today was waking up about these men.
