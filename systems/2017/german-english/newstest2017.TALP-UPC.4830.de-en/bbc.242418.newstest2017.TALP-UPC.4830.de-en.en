Frankie Dettori reaches on prediction his 3,000th win at Newmarket
Dettori springs champagne after a double at Newmarket, which brings him 3,000th win
The jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British gain at Newmarket on Friday.
He put on predilection, which will be trained by John Gosden, on his local circuit with his second profit of the night a landmark.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey who reaches the milestone in the flat race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
The three-time winner Dettori, who won before Ghayaryar, said: "it's something special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here too
I'm very happy about it happening at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday evening with 20,000 people.
I'm relieved and very modest.
Dettori takes the jubilator when he picks up the victory on predilection
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who reached more than 4,300 wins in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time Derby champion had 4,493 career victories
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modernism and it's no surprise that he has reached that milestone that few have reached before him.
He has style and strong, but it's his tactical intellect that differs from the others in weight control room.
He's a fantastic ambassador for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma has been thrilling fans for years for this sport.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he had already picked up 6,000 gains if he wouldn't just be just a weekend and great tournament jockey!
Frankie has already ridden in GB nearly 30 years of winners, which is great.
He has a vibrant personality, which is good for a British race, but beyond that, he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical flying dismount
From Flying finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the hallmark of the British flat race for two decades.
It was nervous.
A whole range of big tournaments, including his famous glory Seven in 1996 in Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban.
Three years ago he had difficulty initially when he returned from his six-month lock but he showed an impressive character strength to defy his doubters and return to his best form.
And he is far from at the end of the day - Dettori once said earlier that he wants to continue with competitions up to his at least 50th years of life.
