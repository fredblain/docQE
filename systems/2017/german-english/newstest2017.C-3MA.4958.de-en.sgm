<seg id="1">28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco Mall</seg>
<seg id="2">A 28-year-old chef, who recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in the stairwell of a local shopping centre.</seg>
<seg id="3">The victim's brother said he could not imagine anyone who would want to hurt him, "Endess went uphill on him."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Leunam, which was found in Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning, was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, who shared the court medical department in San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="5">The San Francisco Police Department said the death was classified as murder and the investigation is underway.</seg>
<seg id="6">The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told the ABS Sen. KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who formerly worked as a Koch in Boston, had climbed his dream job six months ago as a chef at the Sons & Daughter's restaurant in San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="7">A spokesman for the Sons & Daughter said they were "shocked and destroyed on the ground."</seg>
<seg id="8">"We're a small team that works like a close family and we'll miss him painfully," the spokesman added.</seg>
<seg id="9">Our thoughts and condolences are in this difficult time at France's family and friends.</seg>
<seg id="10">Louis Galicia admitted that Frank was initially living in hostels, but that, "the things for him finally went uphill."</seg>
<seg id="11">"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend," shared Louis Garcia KGO.</seg>
<seg id="12">Louis Galicia said he could not imagine anyone wanting to hurt his younger brother.</seg>
<seg id="13">He was a friendly person with a big heart.</seg>
<seg id="14">Connecting his way with his family was to always cook us something to prepare for dinner, "Louis Galicia said.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never wanted to take part in any kind of controversy.</seg>
<seg id="16">He was the brother who was swinging with the electricity.</seg>
<seg id="17">"In everything that's going wrong in the world, he was this casual diamond that's bright every day," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone who has information on the case will be asked to call the SFPD phone number at 415-575-4444.</seg>

<seg id="1">Golfer Langer gets the sports pyramid</seg>
<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer was looking for a bit of variety with a passing on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-olds, it was a premiership.</seg>
<seg id="5">Chio: 'Golden sports pyramid' for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">After a few minutes, the horses were reminded of their holiday, they were hunting at home to feed.</seg>
<seg id="7">A kilometre at that pace, I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It wasn't a good experience," says Langer.</seg>
<seg id="9">And so the riding career ended again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday, Germany's best golfers of all time - 101 tournament victories - were once again close to horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He left with his family about the ALRV facility, on a horse he was not interested in photography.</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and the CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports support was handed over to the man from Anhausen in the frame of a small gala the Golden Sports pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no lack of awards for the sympathetic athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">Bundesverwaltkreuz, Silver Lorbeerblatt, Champions Tour player of the year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen has already posted it.</seg>
<seg id="18">Long is the 18th anniversary of the sport pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Aachen, he met first winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="20">"This award means a great deal," says Langer, "she is awarded not only for sporting successes but also for social engagement."</seg>
<seg id="21">For decades, Langer has been promoting aftergrowth.</seg>
<seg id="22">And so he gave the prize money of 25,000 euros equally.</seg>
<seg id="23">With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-fold US Masterwoman was added to the "Hall of Fame of the German Sports" on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="24">The recordings include the athletics of Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the Fechter Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Puch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob-driver Meinhard Nehmer, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the sprint of Alwin Schackemöle and postman of the craftsman Erhard Wunderlich.</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="26">After the official part, the Fidelity company emigrated to the Springstadium, where the Lavazza Prize was running.</seg>
<seg id="27">Bernhard Langer kept distance to the big animals.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton and Trump's economic policy compared: It's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent TTP - that is what both Clinton and Trump want.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential candidates are opposed to tax and energy policy and to a fundamental question.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are fundamental, rather philosophical.</seg>
<seg id="5">Of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep in doubt rather small and warns against how the state can hurt the economy - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to cut the economy to death and regulate to death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself would be quite different, Trump said.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will have a massive return on regulations and he is strong for far-reaching tax reform with lower rates - for private and business.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton, on the other hand, says that the State has certain tasks to do, opening up opportunities and spending money on it.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why taxes on the rich would be increased, she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">To invest in it, Trump and Clinton say almost exactly.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Democratic Applicant announces the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II.</seg>
<seg id="15">Government investment programs in infrastructure are classical democratic policies, and are firmly rejected by Republicans, for example, by the government's government.</seg>
<seg id="16">So, on Trump, there could still be bipartisan discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are clearer.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and restore coal mining in the US again.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil extraction should also be possible in protected areas, the Paris climate agreement will announce it.</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton, on the other hand, wants to expand its investment program explicitly to expand and call for "a country to become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"It's probably going to be China, Germany or America - I want us to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only with the infrastructure - including international trade agreements - the two competitors are not too distant.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transient trade deal, do not want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both, however, do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They are to be paid better, and for about Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 was a famine.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to raise it to $15 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do on this issue is not quite clear: Once he says, the minimum wage needs to be reversed, then he says he must not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the next few months is likely to develop rather than the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens, is to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics think he would only increase the budget deficit.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who, at least, wants to ask the wealthy to pay more taxes, and whose critics say: More taxes are not the solution either.</seg>

<seg id="1">Escape: 'Every swept woman has experience of sexual violence'</seg>
<seg id="2">Sexual violence is a part of everyday life for women fleeing their lives.</seg>
<seg id="3">When they arrive in Germany they are often traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen there are four women.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each has a baby, which is not a year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son in the arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He is guessing with great eyes curious in the room.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother startet on the table plate.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until she notes that she is watching.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiled in short and kissed the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene looks normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">She is a business leader of Condrobs, a promoter of social assistance in Bavaria, and deals with women on the flight.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen were flashing.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the north of the north in one of the few decentralised accommodation for isolated women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January, Condrobs put the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Relief.</seg>
<seg id="18">It has recently been officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">Men don't exist - even not as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a watchdog in front of the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"It's not overly to say: Every woman who arrives here has made her escape experience with sexual violence," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Men are fleeing because of wars, because they are persecuted politically, because they are threatening torture or death or because their families send them to Europe," she tells.</seg>
<seg id="24">Women overweigh other reasons for fleeing: "Many steal it because they don't see a different way out."</seg>
<seg id="25">In their home, she has had experience of sexual violence, forced marriages, honour killings, slavery or forced prostitution.</seg>
<seg id="26">That is what drives them.</seg>
<seg id="27">The flight goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"That Schleper, for example, for example for a bottle of water a sexual act is not a rare thing," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">Those who believe that as soon as they arrived in Germany are mistaken.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here, too, single women in refugee shelter are often regarded as inferior and, at worst, abused.</seg>
<seg id="32">That leads to some 90 per cent of the women who live in the accommodation in the Munich North are traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Some of the children are certainly not voluntary."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so accustomed to saying nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Or they don't dare to talk openly about the experience because the sham is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">As they often don't get to help, they need more accommodation only for them, asks Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">Asked whether they knew about a similar project as in Munich in their area of responsibility, some replies No.</seg>
<seg id="39">For example, there is no such thing in the upper Oberpfalz and Upper Franconia.</seg>
<seg id="40">Even in the case of pigs, only women who have fled are not separated, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, the government's press spokesman.</seg>
<seg id="41">In upper Bavaria, under- and middle-aged people, there are some community shelters or houses only for single women and their children.</seg>
<seg id="42">The exception is Lower Bavaria, where there are two central accommodation exclusively for women.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommodated separately.</seg>
<seg id="44">In a study published for the committee, it said: "It is very important that men and women are home separated."</seg>
<seg id="45">"Lack of privacy, or will accommodate men and women together, can lead to violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">In particular, the washrooms should be separated and easily accessible to women.</seg>
<seg id="47">As the women feel about this protection, you can read the rang that is available at the house in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Since we've been talking about it, we have a long waiting list," Bahr says.</seg>
<seg id="49">It could easily be a second home.</seg>

<seg id="1">Assistant doctors dispute: Calls for new job fight</seg>
<seg id="2">Deputies of assistants have called on their union to approve new anti-war measures in their disputes on a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called for its entire council to approve more work-related measures from the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC said it would have said ministers had been asked to comment on concerns about the Treaty.</seg>
<seg id="5">Assistant doctors and medical students voted in July to reject a contract agreed with the BMA.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a letter to members released on Twitter on Thursday night, JDC Ellen McCourt told the government that the government would remain "stubbornly quiet" on issues that resulted in the contract being rejected.</seg>
<seg id="8">She said: "In view of this, the JDC Board of Directors has voted to fully reject the proposed new contract and have requested official renegotiation to all of the cases."</seg>
<seg id="9">As a response to the government's silence, the JDC Board today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme of escalating labor action starting in early September.</seg>
<seg id="10">The disputes led to the fact that assistant doctors had six occasions this year, the first overall failures in the history of the NHS.</seg>
<seg id="11">The head of the BMA assistant doctor Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed contract conditions recommended by the BMA.</seg>
<seg id="12">He shared BMA members during meetings which were still pending before the vote by 54,000 assistants and medical students, that the contract should be beneficial and should be adopted.</seg>
<seg id="13">After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be enforced for doctors in England.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: An "Alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and declare an official end of the eight-month-long war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin received his Turkish counterpart in the murdering Hall of St. Petersburg's Palace, I cannot deny that Ankara wants this reconciliation most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile had a meltdown, and he barely radiated heat, even for his restrained relationships.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke repeatedly of his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report all five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have been as it would never have happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me, his enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But a sustained and sustainable cold demonstrated by Putin that Russia's leader had nothing to forget.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his words: The firing of a Russian fighter on the Syrian border with Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was wuttering.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared out and accused Ankara of being back to Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offence was even bigger, as it was committed by a alleged friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Building the veto will be difficult, if not impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, state-controlled media conducted a fierce, full attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">Once it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">The most serious were allegations by senior officials that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from the illegal oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He disputed that.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">After all, this meeting was held only because Putin received the apologies of President Erdogan.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia had a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are clear.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan first needs all the friends he can get after he was unravelled at a failed coup last month.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are economic motives too.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular, the ban on charter flights that typically bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has dropped by nearly 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-seasonal Anstorm to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the state television forecast cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">A report in Vedemosti put it: "Tourists there, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry at the West as it considers its response to the attempted takeover as a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">To this end, continued resentment of the EU's accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey's relationship with the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian leader won in Ankara with security a bonus for calling for support for elected statehood following the attempted coup d'état.</seg>
<seg id="40">For Moscow, this is a matter of course, which itself has a deep fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this Gaulal palace on the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to portray a "alliance of outsiders," as one analyst once described to me: Two countries that are in breach of the West and feel poorly treated and are now behind.</seg>
<seg id="42">Yet, despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently served as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It might be significant that, after nearly three hours of initial talks, both presidents said at the press conference that they would not even have had the issue.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey deliberately had to respond to a question about their differences, while Putin chose to emphasize it.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found on Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostility - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey shuts off the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State should, at least again, talk again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland no longer available</seg>
<seg id="2">The RBS brand is supposed to be reduced to a backoffice role, according to the bank's default.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Bank has since distanced itself when she had almost collapsed and rescued eight years ago.</seg>
<seg id="6">At this time, Markenstadists used "RBS" to protect other end-of-the-art retail trade marks.</seg>
<seg id="7">She supported international sports with millions of pounds of sponsorships, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.</seg>
<seg id="8">But now it has decided to focus on more national brands.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland but will not be initialized.</seg>
<seg id="10">In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralised headquarters and stock exchange will change to NatWest.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are other smaller brands for the retail business that will receive more importance - Coutts Bank, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.</seg>
<seg id="13">McEwan was interviewed during a tour of clients and staff in Inverness-shire.</seg>
<seg id="14">He shared the BBC Scotland with: "The RSB brand will become our investor brand and the brand under which our employees will be employed, as we will now become more a bank of brands."</seg>
<seg id="15">When the bank became a global brand, RBS became the global brand.</seg>
<seg id="16">I am saying now that we are pursuing not global targets but local objectives.</seg>
<seg id="17">Each of these brands will be completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers under these brands.</seg>
<seg id="18">RBS has already announced that it will no longer continue its Six Nations Sponsoring and that it will increase the visibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship.</seg>
<seg id="19">"It is time for us to develop into the bank of the brands, because how do we concentrate on the inside (we asked) to make this a better bank for customers?" Said the CEO.</seg>
<seg id="20">It would have been very cynical three years ago if we said that we would be a great bank for our customers and that these brands had been launched.</seg>
<seg id="21">But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think we will see many changes.</seg>
<seg id="22">We can launch these brands again, so I think the time has come.</seg>

<seg id="2">Dettori spray champagne after a double at Newmarket, bringing him 3,000th profit</seg>
<seg id="3">The Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="4">He set to predilection, trained by John Gosden, on his local race track with his second win of the night a milestone.</seg>
<seg id="5">The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in the flat race.</seg>
<seg id="6">He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggod, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.</seg>
<seg id="7">The three-time winner Dettori, who won at Ghayyar, said: "It's something special."</seg>
<seg id="8">I'm very emotional because my family is here too</seg>
<seg id="9">I am very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday evening with 20,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I'm relieved and very modest.</seg>
<seg id="12">Dettori takes the jubilee when he picks up victory</seg>
<seg id="13">Two jockeys reached the milestone in the impeachment race - Jockey Richard Johnson and the retired 20-painted winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who scored more than 4,300 wins in a rebound career.</seg>
<seg id="14">Lester Piggod, the nine-member Derbywinner had 4,493 career talent</seg>
<seg id="15">Frankie is one of the best jockey of the modern era and it is no surprise that he has achieved this milestone, which has reached just a few.</seg>
<seg id="16">He has style and is strong, but it's his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.</seg>
<seg id="17">He's a fantastic ambassador for race, his enthusiasm and charisma thrilled fans for years for this sport.</seg>
<seg id="18">I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he had already picked 6,000 wins if he wouldn't just be a weekend and big tournament jockey!</seg>
<seg id="19">Frankie already has nearly 30 years in GB, which is great.</seg>
<seg id="20">He has a living personality, which is good for a British race, but beyond that he is an incredible jockey.</seg>
<seg id="21">Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount</seg>
<seg id="22">From the Flying finisher to Flying Dismots, Frankie Dettori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades.</seg>
<seg id="23">It was nervous.</seg>
<seg id="24">A whole series of great turnovers, including his famous "Glorious Sieben" in Ascot in 1996, also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban.</seg>
<seg id="25">Three years ago, he initially had trouble when he returned from his six-month-old lock, but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to defy his doubters and return to his bride.</seg>
<seg id="26">And he's still far from the end - Dettori said earlier that he would want to carry on in competitions up to his minimum 50.th life year.</seg>

<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who was Ivanov's deputy since 2012, was appointed to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the renowned State Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin's website, it is said (in Russian) that he was subsequently the chief executive of government staff.</seg>
<seg id="10">On his appointment, he said to Putin: "Thank you for your trust."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the government's most important task to support your work as a Head of State with regard to draft laws and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convincing the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This move has made Moscow mystery weeks.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidants, and works like him for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As a striker, he was one of the country's most powerful men.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, broadcast on television, both men claimed the stabbing would resign on their own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">Is this the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody currently knows.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official claim - that a man who was once prized as a potential president - would like to head to Russian environmental policy - came to great skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin, who are quoted on the Kremlin's website, said Ivanov, "it is true that in early 2012 I asked you in a conversation to give me this very complicated post - one could almost say - complaining for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the presidential administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously he was deputy prime minister and defense minister.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990 "s, when Putin was Chairman of the BHS, which replaced KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people he was most familiar with.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was assumed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term, as a third term Putin had breached the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But that post was taken by Putin's closest ally, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became prime minister before becoming president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="1">Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now linked to Fife</seg>
<seg id="2">The £1.35-billion-expensive project is to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have linked the North deck of the Queensferry Crossings with the Viaduct - meaning the bridge is now linked to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is the first of four decrees of the "cover zone," which approaches the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="5">Fife's bridge section is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete, as well as 46 wires.</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Business Minister Keith Brown issued a visit today and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossings.</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses to engineering from a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for the passage.</seg>
<seg id="12">Overall, almost 79% of the entire bridal deck is at their place and the last section of the deck is now getting a concrete cast for the deck in Rosyth, which means the entire deck is ready to be raised on the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "The first conclusion is a significant milestone in each bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">In this fantastic project, the conclusion represents a pioneering high-end construction.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last road cover and its connection with the northern turmdeck, we had to close the existing gap on the North or Landside.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by dragging the northern Zubragerbrücke bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and, at the same time, very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive, as the viaduct is 222 meters long, it weighs about 6,000 tons and has to be pulled upwards of about 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Delicate, as the tolerances to which the team is working, they were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimetres.</seg>
<seg id="20">Thankfully, everything went very well.</seg>

<seg id="1">Who builds Braunschweig's cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="2">The SPD and the Greens mean that investors should be given a much stronger role in the future.</seg>
<seg id="3">How to respond to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap homes in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">The SPD proposes a "approach to action" at the next Council meeting.</seg>
<seg id="5">But dispute is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">The first concerns the question of who is to build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation has to date.</seg>
<seg id="8">SPD we are agreed with the Greens: Who wants to build on urban land must in future designate 20% of all apartments as social housing. "</seg>
<seg id="9">However, affordable apartments can also be built in stock.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, the big dispute in the town hall is, however, Bratmann: "How do you talk about investing in private land?"</seg>
<seg id="11">"We want investors to build on such land at least 10 percent, but as much as 20 percent of homes as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">A new urban housing support programme, which will cost millions and will still be funded, will provide incentives.</seg>
<seg id="13">The problem, Bratmann: "There is still no agreement between the groups."</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants investors to make as few rules as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants to go even harder for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Despite this, Bratmann said, the situation in the housing market is worsening.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the concept of action is implemented, it will provide additional tasks in the building management.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff are needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the professionals.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the programme is not entirely: For the approximately 1260 new homes that should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how does the loss of more than 1300 cheap apartments be phased out?</seg>
<seg id="22">It will be 500 apartments by 2020 alone.</seg>
<seg id="23">To prevent this, the planning spokesperson Nicole Palm should now be bought-up from the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, consideration should be given to bringing homes back into price fixing.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">The problem could be solved.</seg>
<seg id="27">For in the West, the deadline is for the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments could get back to price fixing for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only those who do not want housing companies.</seg>
<seg id="30">The fact that the number of social housing in the West is dramatically increased again is the aim of the so-called mixture.</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no more of a concentration of social weakness in just a few neighbourhoods.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens are counting on the fact that there will be some movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">Group Chairman Holger Herlitschke said: "For a broad majority, the CDU must be in the boat."</seg>
<seg id="34">This has concentrated on more places for single-family homes.</seg>
<seg id="35">But what does not mean that we cannot find a compromise.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness worth seeing</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teens and children are no longer to go outside, but rather prefer to spend their free time on screens, has been complained by many over the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">At Pokemon Go, it's about getting people from the sofa to get more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time at the screen was initially confined to the TV, then limited to video games and most recently on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is therefore great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">I am, of course, referring to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were first created for video games in the 1990s (a cartoon series, game cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many phenomena of pop culture, interest declined before the release of the game in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The launch of the market in other countries has been delayed by the massive demand that the servers overloaded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players go out with their smartphones and search for Pokémons, who are tracked with a GPS and, once found, "photographed" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation playing the game, when she was even younger, joined the win and jumped for the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US, the game led to a significant rise in steps that the "average" person put back every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which tracked 35,000 users, told the Washington Post recently that within two days of the game's launch, the number of subsequent people, who train every day for 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company doesn't know who is playing Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data for the performance increase.</seg>
<seg id="17">A lot of public awareness-raising campaigns on health, who want to get people to "take 30 minutes," "from the sofa to come" and "active every day," because many public messages about health are boring and come from people who look elend.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overvalued.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly drive sports reduce their chances of becoming sick of cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the Wonderful of Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Three pillars of health cover - movement, fresh air and sunshine and fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people close to hunting even new friendships.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there are men's players who always have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough occurred.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit had previously been able to follow our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to drive sports like this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new one will lose its charm and use it with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, thanks to Pokemon's success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the assets in the real world, helping many people to hunt, active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="5">Dynamically on the sprunken.</seg>
<seg id="6">Effortlessly on the bar.</seg>
<seg id="7">Stunning on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="8">On whole line brilliant.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now, at last, Olympic Champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American Turner climbed to the multiplayer title on Thursday and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in the face of the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="11">Their overall result of 62.198 was clearly in front of the silver medal winner and "Final Five" team-mate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American women's Simone Biles turnt on the Sweet during the men's section of the women in the arts tournaments at the Summer Olympics Games in Rio de Janeiro in 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multi-match title and overall the fifth, while consolidating her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey in that moment was ending.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success puts them into the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who have brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has dominated her sport's last three years, winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that involve a mix of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou rescues of her said she was "the best turner I ever saw."</seg>
<seg id="17">She expected a final exam in Brazil, a contest that went not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of over-dimensional expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not having a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas would be seen as disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The American women Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman tumbled off after they have won gold and silver in the women's singles in the arts tournaments at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles picked up the first medal on Tuesday while serving as an exclamation mark on the relegation ceremony of the team co-ordinator Martha Karolyi.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although Biles insisted on it, during her long way to the top, never planned the future, that's not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of their floor exercises - which includes their typical Tumbling Pass - is aligned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is no accident.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, who has been adoptioned by her grandparents as a small kid and was discovered by trainer Aimee Boormans's mother during a school outing, in which Boorman trained, became the force.</seg>
<seg id="25">It has not lost any more competition since the summer of 2013, a set of victories that will continue as long as Biles wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even though Mustafina was slightly guided by two shoots, the picture sounded.</seg>
<seg id="27">Swedes and Bodenburg - in which Biles holds the World Championship title.</seg>
<seg id="28">She picked up again with 15,433 on the Sweet again - and still has a 15,933 on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman breathed them gently when they expected their final wound - a pure formality - and tears flowing on Biles's glossy red, white and blue Eyeer than the vision she once described in her collection book.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place but the bronze medal went to Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="31">This time, the 22-year-old number of teams, called "Oma," had a lead.</seg>
<seg id="32">After her floor exercise, she threw the audience Kouswede, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes appeared dubious.</seg>
<seg id="33">As far as Biles is concerned, the rapidly expanding tweet of the 19-year-old from the beginning of this week has a very new meaning:</seg>

<seg id="2">According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot dead in one of the most deadly attacks since a decade in the first series mortar case of Phoenix, while they kept in the car and listened to music.</seg>
<seg id="3">Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot dead on June 12 while the car was parked in an entrance, authorities said.</seg>
<seg id="4">The perpetrator humbled eight shots from a handgun weapon while standing on the passenger's side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, is to read in the report.</seg>
<seg id="5">Police said that the triple murder did not seem to have been the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 who was in possession of one of the adult victims.</seg>
<seg id="6">Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said the shooting was giving investigators a closer look at whether they are linked to four previous attacks.</seg>
<seg id="7">In total, in Hispanic residential areas, seven people were killed and two more injured in nine attacks within four months.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It happens in a residential neighborhood in front of a house," shared Howard of the KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, earlier this month.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is believed to have used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990 "s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.</seg>
<seg id="10">Investigators refused to disclose the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same killer.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to her injuries and died later.</seg>
<seg id="12">Liner, 31, and Ellis daughter Maleah still died on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="13">One witness told police that it was not uncommon for them to sit in a parked car and hear music.</seg>
<seg id="14">Authorities also released a police report on the shooting, which targeted an empty pickup truck a half-hour before the triple murder and assumed it was the work of the serial killer.</seg>

<seg id="7">A flood alert system is used across vast parts in southern Louisiana until Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="8">The weather service provided evidence that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the south of Alabama, a flight alert system was used on Friday, while it continued to rain in the Mobile.</seg>
<seg id="10">The River Comite near Baton Rouge and the River Amite near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, are likely to reach record lows after over the weekend.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Metereologist Alek Krautmann says both rivers could overshadow many houses in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.</seg>
<seg id="12">He also said that a stream-driven flooding in Ascension Parish is a danger, as they will only slowly flow into the Lake Maurepas.</seg>
<seg id="13">The River Tickshaw, south of the Mississippi State border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level on Friday, which was ever recorded.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rescue teams still pleaded to people from the floodwaters in the district of Amite and Wilkinson in the Southwest of Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="15">Leroy Hansford, his wife and his stepson were among those rescued near Gloster on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 400 feet from his house, rose sharply overnight.</seg>
<seg id="17">He said it would have warned him a further pen son who lives nearby.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We are guarded and the water flowed and moved in," Hansford said.</seg>
<seg id="19">It reached my waist.</seg>
<seg id="20">His wife, Hansford, said that in the 48 years they lived there would never have seen such high levels of the river.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hansford said he and his family members would have all disabilities and he would be the only person who can swim.</seg>
<seg id="22">Hansford said emergency workers had rescued all three in a major military truck and brought them to the next fire guard in Gloster, where they were housed until Friday.</seg>
<seg id="23">Krautmann said the flood "had spread quickly" as there were still heavy rains and that the authorities were considering evacuation instructions.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Krautmann, an observer reported near Livingstone from midnight to Friday morning from 13.75 inches of rain.</seg>
<seg id="25">Krautmann said the ground had been substantially depleted by the rains since Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="26">Authorities said heavy rains and road flooding caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and school failures in five school districts.</seg>
<seg id="27">The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that an ants in Tangipahoa had 200 flooded houses.</seg>
<seg id="28">Residents were evacuated in two churches, which were now both flooded.</seg>
<seg id="29">The forehead of the Municipality of Robby Miller said authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets that had been washed out of flooding.</seg>
<seg id="30">Emergency shelters were set up in the cities of Amite and Hammond to house the evacuees.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Once the water begins to go back, they will be able to return to their homes again," he said.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the town of Hammond of the municipality of Tangipahoa, almost two dusty roads were closed down because of flooding and sandsacks for residents to be included, hoping to keep the water from their homes and shops.</seg>
<seg id="33">"The last major flooding we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum of the City Administration.</seg>
<seg id="34">This seems to be a similar incident.</seg>
<seg id="35">In Mississipp, the emergency manager Rupert Lacy of the Harrison County said it continued to rain on the Gulf Coast.</seg>
<seg id="36">According to his claims, a handful of houses were to be reported as flooded on Thursday, but on Friday no one reported.</seg>
<seg id="37">Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.</seg>
<seg id="38">"I've seen water in places I've never seen before," Townson said, "and it's still coming."</seg>

<seg id="2">Police say the six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, this week already the second time a six-year-old child is shot.</seg>
<seg id="3">The boys' grandparents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.</seg>
<seg id="4">The grandparents said Brown suffered multiple gunshots, including in the leaning, leg, arm and belly, but that he was in the hospital at his transport.</seg>
<seg id="5">"He went through a lot, his small body was extinguished by balls," shared his grandmother Delores Melendez to the station.</seg>
<seg id="6">I simply cannot believe it.</seg>
<seg id="7">The boy's condition was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo multiple operations.</seg>
<seg id="8">The boy's family told the broadcaster he is expected to come back again.</seg>
<seg id="9">He should have started the first class in a local primary school.</seg>
<seg id="10">Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.</seg>
<seg id="11">There were also three men: Two aged 29 and a 32-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="12">One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are in the stable condition according to CBS Philadelphia.</seg>
<seg id="13">The boy was spotted on the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old who is in a critical condition, said the station.</seg>
<seg id="14">The other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating whether they could be in one of the perpetrators' injured men.</seg>
<seg id="15">Investigators shared CBS Philadelphia that apparently there was a cruise between multiple shooters.</seg>
<seg id="16">Patrones for storm guns, which have been traced back to various storm guns, have been paralysed.</seg>
<seg id="17">It seems that this is clearly an ongoing struggle.</seg>
<seg id="18">On the road, on both sides of the secret, they were shakes.</seg>
<seg id="19">So it seems that there have been several armed fighters who have been very actively involved, "shared police surgeon Anthony Ginaldi of the police in Philadelphia.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I would like to present under the Women's Olympian Mission in Turnen and that is more than a reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First of all, I have been in every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: This team has three stars, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Laurie "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this crew, the Aly Raisman, which is Jüdin and Madison Kocian, who is a Catholic, makes every proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has consolidated the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one among female athletes was an Afro-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year, Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">That shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic winner and America.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world has been able to witness the incredible performance of the three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected, yet masterful gymastic routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American, who won for an individual multi-match event for women gold.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We are seeing the top of this sport, but so, in the rest of the country, tournament classes are not.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie beat all the same way as Aly and Madison to create it to the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "Last Five" because the next Olympiad will have only four runners in the team, and this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainee.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that Turnen is a more expensive sport and that Turner is primarily in private tournaments maintained by parents who will pay for the training, instruction, travel, competition and hotel costs (for the coaches and their visitors and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these tournaments lie in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, the Turner receives their entire training and that is a costly and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started with the turf.</seg>
<seg id="22">We need to allow the municipalities of Aug.</seg>
<seg id="23">I set up my Turn Foundation of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events, we have offered a free and affordable tower in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youngsters (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to provide the youth of high-quality turners who will earn the opportunity to learn and profit from this fantastic Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turnen develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body and hard work, discipline and consistency for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health and for educational and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to interest in the Turnen and that is great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to take part in sport, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is so exciting.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this genuine portrayal of "Girl Power" by the Holen of the Olympic team golds and thanks to her so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="1">Assistant veterans want to organize further strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal</seg>
<seg id="2">Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistants who voted in the election rejected him.</seg>
<seg id="3">In July, Hunt unveiled plans to impose the contract forcibly, saying that the NHS would be in a "no man's land" and would be damaging any further delay for staff and patients.</seg>
<seg id="4">The first assistants are to receive a new contract, which includes changes to night and weekend work to improve care for uneasiness.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dr Ellen McCourt, the chair of the BMA Kommitee for assistant doctors, shared last night in a communication with: "Assistant doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and will treat all doctors fairly."</seg>
<seg id="6">In just eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors falls under the new Treaty, progress must be made and time is running out.</seg>
<seg id="7">Efforts on the part of the BMA to resolve the disputes through talks have led to the government's reluctance to participate and, at times, to silence.</seg>
<seg id="8">That happened to the one that Jeremy Hunt had made only last month that his door would always be open.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, lift the excitement and address the concerns of assistants."</seg>
<seg id="10">Should he fail to do so, assistants have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further work.</seg>
<seg id="11">The final strike at the end of April saw a postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and specialist doctors were involved to provide cover to doctors on the strike chain.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association.</seg>
<seg id="13">The BMA wants a better weekly reward for the 54,000 assistant doctors who will be subject to the contract.</seg>
<seg id="14">Daniel Mortimer, director of the NHS staff, urged assistant doctors to end the strike.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mortimer said: "Work combat measures reach none of the little but are already burdened by overburdened teams and service providers and are causing concern, distress and interruption to patients, care workers and their families."</seg>
<seg id="16">Over the last two months, we have spoken to the committee of assistants and have responded positively to the concerns about the status quo and whistleblowovers with the Ministry of Health and other ministries.</seg>
<seg id="17">Employers hoped that the continued positive engagement on other important issues - such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a vocational training course, training kits, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was the employers, the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health concerning compliance with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.</seg>

<seg id="3">Ticagrelor's germination-inhibited drug reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.</seg>
<seg id="4">The drug is administered for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or a further heart attack.</seg>

<seg id="6">Regulator NICE of the NHS has recommended a four-year-long take to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.</seg>
<seg id="7">Some 140,000 people suffer from a heart attack each year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and stroke cases are caused by collections of fat material in the arteries.</seg>
<seg id="9">When the Belag breaks out, it can cause a blood from the water to the heart, causing a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="10">When the blood is dissolved, it can flow through the blood flow and reduce the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="11">People who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, manufactured by British company AstraZeneca and driven under the trademark Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood-bearing islands less likely.</seg>
<seg id="13">NICE's draft, which was published today, recommends a 12-month-long take-up of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre, said: "Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all those who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or a stroke of stroke - often with dire consequences."</seg>
<seg id="15">Fear of a renewed heart attack may have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.</seg>
<seg id="16">The experience shows that, in combination with aspirin, Ticagrelor is effectively reducing further heart attacks and stroke in people who have already had a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">With a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="18">The information on the effectiveness and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years.</seg>

<seg id="1">Culture of Political Correctness leaves voter fraud in Muslim neighborhoods</seg>
<seg id="2">Former mayor of Tower Hamlets Luttum Rahman was arrested last year on trial of a government report on corruption</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correctness has caused widespread voter fraud in Muslim communities to knowingly ignore what a devastating government report has revealed today.</seg>
<seg id="4">Former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles is attacking police, election observers, and council houses to have ignored evidence of voter abuse due to "obesity and religion."</seg>
<seg id="5">The former Minister for Integration and Local Government, who is now an anti-corruption member, said intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that police should be allowed to set up landlords outside polling booths to protect intimidated voters.</seg>
<seg id="6">He recommends that voters should hold a card to prove their identity in elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the moment, a voter only needs to name his name and address.</seg>
<seg id="8">The report proposes that non-removable ink on the finger of a person should be issued if they give their votes to prevent someone from choosing twice.</seg>
<seg id="9">Whistleblowers should receive more protection, says Sir Eric.</seg>
<seg id="10">It calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions by non-official Comoros or Working Groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"This is not just against voter fraud, but also seeks to protect the community government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that accompanies it," he said.</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlets election scandal in East London.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last year, a special panel ruled that the incumbent mayor, Mr Lutfr Rahman, should be removed after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his duties.</seg>
<seg id="14">The court found that Rahman would have had the religious feelings of its Muslim community "in a cynical manner" and that he had silenced his critics with racial and Islamophobia debt.</seg>
<seg id="15">Rahman is supposed to have "conducted his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose it."</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 votes were either dubious or the result of an imitation, where one person as someone else chooses.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said there were evidence of fraud across the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">He said, in particular, alarming about the fraudulent exchange of letters - the older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose a candidate for their choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including the driving of expressions to prove the identity</seg>
<seg id="20">His report states: "As evidence was appropriate, pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exercised, in particular women and young people to choose, in accordance with the will of the elderly, in particular communities with a Pakistani or non-Muslim background.</seg>
<seg id="21">"There were concerns that... State institutions had knowingly ignored such behaviour as a result of" politically correct "over-sensitivity to the ethno and religion."</seg>
<seg id="22">Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including the ban that political activists handle letter-voting documents to stop "whistleblowers."</seg>
<seg id="23">The report, considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and social fraud.</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider options to ask voters before the election.</seg>
<seg id="25">Don't use removable ink on a person's finger as soon as she has delivered her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice.</seg>
<seg id="26">Carry out systematic reviews of a person's nationality to ensure they are eligible.</seg>
<seg id="27">A three-year limitation to applications for an automatic letter.</seg>
<seg id="28">Ban that political activists process complete letter elections and envelopes of letter elections.</seg>
<seg id="29">The police have the power to set up closures around polling stations.</seg>
<seg id="30">A legislative amendment facilitating an indictment of intimidation pursuant to the Representation of the People Act 1983.</seg>
<seg id="31">Shooting ban in polling stations.</seg>
<seg id="32">Request that only English can be used in polling stations (except Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">Stepping up training to make sure employees enforce the rule that voters alone go to the polling booth.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that after the Tower Hamlets case was not put to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="35">"The Electoral Court has said Lutfor Rahman and his deputy for reasons of a litany of corrupt and illegal practices were deemed to be untapped," he said.</seg>
<seg id="36">It has been found guilty by a number of reasons - in line with the high standards of criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="37">It also criticizes the ineffective "abortion checks" of voter registration departments.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Eric said: "The court ruling in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.</seg>
<seg id="39">Our country bears a proud legacy as the mother of the parliaments, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threatens this good reputation.</seg>

<seg id="3">But the 24-year-old Olympionikin is by far this summer not the only one, gold-fighting athlete, who has its own famous double-workers - at least not if you can trust social media.</seg>
<seg id="4">To honour the Rio Olympics and all the famous faces, which are currently flirting on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympics that have more than just a certain resemblance to Hollywood's famous sights.</seg>

<seg id="6">Besides Kaes's double-owner on the bike race, many people on the internet pointed out how to be a certain arch protector of A-Promi Leonardo DiCaprio.</seg>
<seg id="7">The team member of the US team in archery Brady Elliison has caused a storm on Twitter after pictures, on which he sees the Wolf of Wall Street star unknowingly similar, appeared.</seg>
<seg id="8">In fact, the arch protector got the madness in the social media and admitted that he had already been told since his childhood that he looks like Leo.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I myself don't see a great resemblance, with the exception of the face erosion," shared Brady the Huffington Post with.</seg>
<seg id="10">"He's a benign guy, so I think it is a compliment."</seg>
<seg id="11">One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will no doubt be the focus of this year: The striking resemblance between British wide-gauge Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Russian athlete Aliya Mustafina with her great, expressive eyes is to be able to go through as a double-runner for the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.</seg>
<seg id="13">And in the swimming pool, South African swimmers Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to the Glee Star Matthew Morrison for years.</seg>
<seg id="14">One course higher: This user believes Nathan is the "athletic version" of the Inception actor</seg>
<seg id="15">Another sustained comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similar serious eyebrows and lips.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Russian silver medallist, Yulia Efimova, has more than just the sun-brown skin and blonde hair like the actress Annalynne McCord on, while the American Nathan Adrian has been attested by fans to equal an "athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt."</seg>
<seg id="17">Strong women: Football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar facial shape and eyes</seg>
<seg id="18">Not the only one: One Twitter user was very happy that others have raised the similarities</seg>
<seg id="19">Theory put in the room: According to this user, there is perhaps a reason for the similarity of the pair</seg>
<seg id="20">One Twitter Userin declared her satisfaction that "the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical."</seg>
<seg id="21">In fact, the US football star Hope Solo and the Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar facial form and eyes.</seg>
<seg id="22">Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as the gold medal winner in the Turnen Gabby Douglas, which features her own wonderful, wide smile, which resembles that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.</seg>

<seg id="2">Byron MacDonalds analysis of the fourth place of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at dr 4x200m free-style swimming-pool whistles outraged viewers of the CBC-live broadcast of the Olympic Games on Wednesday</seg>

<seg id="5">Macdonald, who had been picked up to the CBS's commentator team to give more "color," could be heard saying: "This little 14-year-old Chesin has lost the connection, baby."</seg>
<seg id="6">To get up, walked out like Muef, died like a pig.</seg>
<seg id="7">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="8">Chinese swimming in Ai Yanhan, 14, swung the second stage of swimming-board 1: 57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck, which allowed Canadians to close the gap to China.</seg>
<seg id="9">Viewers across Canada responded quickly online after being shot by the tone and language</seg>
<seg id="10">Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Hat the CBC commentator just said that the 14-year-old swimming woman from China was" like a pig "???</seg>
<seg id="11">The Idiot didn't train that they were still on broadcast. "</seg>
<seg id="12">Ai Yanhan from China was described as "this little 14-year-old Chesin has lost, baby."</seg>
<seg id="13">The criticism against Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and hard, at which many were talking about</seg>
<seg id="14">Twitter users did not stand back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was</seg>
<seg id="15">Another Twitter Userin Sarah Paradis wrote: 'WoW, # ByrMacDonald.</seg>
<seg id="16">You represent the CBC and Canada and let us look like racists.</seg>
<seg id="17">Short time later, Scott Russel, who moderated the CBC broadcast, was live for the comment of MacDonald and said: "We apologize for being broadcast on a swimming performance."</seg>
<seg id="18">It was an unfortunate wording, we are sorry that it happened. "</seg>
<seg id="19">CBC apologized at the end over 90 times at the people who responded to the notes on Twitter</seg>
<seg id="20">Commentator Scott Russel had to apologise on behalf of MacDonald</seg>
<seg id="21">CBC coped and added his apology to more than 90 other Twitter users complained about MacDonald's comments</seg>
<seg id="22">The network also apologized quickly and issued a notice.</seg>
<seg id="23">We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast.</seg>
<seg id="24">We were quickly apologized to our viewers on the broadcast and our follow-up in social media yesterday night.</seg>
<seg id="25">To make one thing clear, Byron's comments related to the performance of the swimming woman and not to her as a person.</seg>
<seg id="26">Yet they were inappropriate and an unfortunate wording.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized in the broadcast and attempted to justify his comment, saying it was not his intention to be designed as a personal attack.</seg>
<seg id="28">"I would like to take a moment to apologise for the comment that I made after the women's floppies in the CBC Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I have focused on the performance of the swimming woman and not on her as a person."</seg>
<seg id="30">Of course, no disrespect was intended and I am very sorry. "</seg>

<seg id="3">To aggravate the situation, she said, as she told it, she pulled out and put her back to the shelf.</seg>
<seg id="4">They continued and tried four pairs of underpants in a business in the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Primark store in the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone where the woman tested the underpants before she put her back to the shelf</seg>
<seg id="6">A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was at the same time in the business, said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear, "she stopped again and left the business without buying anything."</seg>
<seg id="7">She said: "People couldn't believe what they saw."</seg>
<seg id="8">In the middle of the sales area, she took a pair of underpants from the outlet, pulled her own stockings and pants and tried them.</seg>
<seg id="9">"She didn't even try to find a slightly more discreet place to do it - she was quite simply there, eat like Oskar."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Everyone kicked off when she pulled out the underpants that they apparently didn't like, as she put them back to the shelf."</seg>
<seg id="11">She repeated the same with three other underpants before finally decided that her nothing liked, again and again.</seg>
<seg id="12">"She didn't seem to bother anyone watching - or thinking about the person who might buy the underpants she had tried."</seg>
<seg id="13">Ms Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: 'How disgusted you would think that someone would take underpants with them who had a different person and who were not washed up.'</seg>
<seg id="14">The incident happened Tuesday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="15">Ms Davidson added: "As I have received, staff were trying to pull the garments out of sale after they went - which is just as good."</seg>
<seg id="16">"I would hate to go back home with a new pair of underpants and find out that another woman had angling her and pulled her back and she wasn't washed up."</seg>
<seg id="17">A spokesman for Primark said: "Primark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday, August 9 in our branch in Folkstone."</seg>
<seg id="18">All products in question were drawn from sale.</seg>

<seg id="1">How to protect Krav Maga from gun attacks</seg>
<seg id="2">The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make him a little safer for you.</seg>
<seg id="3">We were talking to Ron Mizrachi, a grandmaster of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from the back, this video shows you how to turn around for your robber.</seg>
<seg id="5">If you get closer to you, then you should first turn around, so you can see your attacker and "get out of the rubble," says Mizrachi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Then take the gun between your front and your shoulder before hitting it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Then beat him to the Least and turn it into the Least, while the attacker stirs up against pain, throwing the weapon out of his hands.</seg>
<seg id="8">At attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the gunpoint, take the gun and turn it, so the attacker can't shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time, shift the weight to the weapon and beat the attacker to the chest, then turn the gun out of his handle before moving backwards and targeting the weapon.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds difficult?</seg>
<seg id="11">Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi imagines.</seg>
<seg id="12">But remember that when you smoke, it's safest to pass your money - unless you're a Krav Maga Grand Master.</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveller Ian Wright shouted for a travel guide his tongue at the dirtiest places in Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller withdrew his immune system and diggereflex of serious scrutiny - by sending out some of Europe's dirtiest and ecclesious places.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, shouted his course on a Euro-shone, a gunman on Piccadilly Circus, a towing of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to demonstrate the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before taking any object, he used a luminometer to stand up and to show what he will get.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprise results to light.</seg>
<seg id="6">The idea to sniff off the flip button of a tractor that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely abortive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen cupboard.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Commissioner Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of Darmbakteries and his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing he left, more than a bad taste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Wright was known to try to test the resistance of his intestine by taking advantage of the world and dreaming about it.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public change to train stations to sprubs of toilets, the task put his immune system definitely under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he told: "Already as a kid I was relatively unconcerned about what my health concerns and I put all possible things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film, he became fair to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he opposed was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His sampling showed a luminometer of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the luminometer is freshly washed hands less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet he refused to leak after its luminometers were more than 4000 units, while freshly washed hands were one of less than 60</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr Wright and the Finnish producer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lockhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the bacterium's number in different locations such as the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">In the film, he says: "That comes close to the worst I've got in a toilet."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more harmful than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I am not going to see anything here because it is outrageous.</seg>
<seg id="21">"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company supplies Mr Wright with Valio Karrius, which includes both dairy and Vitamin C and D to support the promotion of Darmbakteries and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We wanted to really offer consumers something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to see and also explains the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We caused crazy Brainstorms, which ended up saying that we told "Let Us Ian call."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim the interest in colorectal health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a wider context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of colorectal health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in colorectal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we have been able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom HAKALA, who led the film's director, added: "Let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had caught some of the things I instructed him to lick, as the eclectic Russian toilet shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course, there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to sniff them and others where this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad we have included some of these dirty leaks on film. "</seg>
<seg id="33">In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of all respondents, particularly with the well-being of Magen and Darm and 58 percent, said that at least they occasionally use products containing accompanying dairy bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="1">Asocial family demolished before Deloging social apartment in Saltash, Cornwall</seg>
<seg id="2">An asocial family left their social apartment after a delogising with a £50,000 damage because she had terrorised her neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her property in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After being forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing community found the property in an irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls were clashing holes, wooden dikes were blown up, rubbish was scattered on the floor scattered and graffiti was sacked to the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family were relocated and it is believed to now live in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for the house administration at Cornwall Housing, said she feared the apartment could no longer be repaired.</seg>
<seg id="8">She said: "It was an absolute nightmare for people here and I think people don't have to live in this way.</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to take into account, as this property is likely to be seen as not so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and their reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime, and the police said that the terror inflicted on the family, assaults with baseball sleepers, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking, and excessive blows, strikes and floods.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease contract, received an ordinance for antisocial behaviour in June.</seg>
<seg id="13">In some rooms of the house that will be torn down, old rubbish found</seg>
<seg id="14">The property in which drugs traded in the past have been demolished</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours said they had to fight them on the road and regularly called to call police</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing delved her and her partner this week forcibly from the property after they gave them an extended period of 11 weeks to draw up voluntarily.</seg>
<seg id="17">The delogisation was cheated by facilitated neighbors, who said their lives were made to hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">One said: "They didn't hurt anyone."</seg>
<seg id="19">We lived for 20 years alongside them and it was always bad.</seg>
<seg id="20">The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.</seg>
<seg id="21">"This morning we couldn't sleep."</seg>
<seg id="22">We stood up because it was so quiet - we are not accustomed to it!</seg>
<seg id="23">Now that they are finally going away, it will be beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it would have been the family administered to cooperate with local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house to which police were called periodically, for 20 years</seg>
<seg id="26">On the overblown side of the community deal, rubbish and old toys were scrapped</seg>
<seg id="27">He added: "It's a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for her behaviour and that of her family, as a Deloging is always the last step to consider Cornwall Housing.</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case, because the behaviour was extremely difficult and their actions for their neighbours had to be seen terribly.</seg>
<seg id="29">I value all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the congregation who have been brave to us and have given us the information.</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will donate to some neighbours and the message that anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">Fitzpatrick said all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress left back in one of the bedroom after Deloging on the ground</seg>
<seg id="33">Housekeeping workers will now have to remove waste mountains that surround the house</seg>
<seg id="34">In 2014, police conducted a razor in the house and found about 70g cannabis as well as scales, paraphernates and cash worth £1,700.</seg>
<seg id="35">Skeldon received a financial penalty after pleading guilty to the possession of a drug of class B in commercial abdication.</seg>
<seg id="36">She claimed that the money was for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in 2013 in a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="37">After they were without Oldach, Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.</seg>
<seg id="38">A lot of room walls were decorated with graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">Police say they will delete tenants who don't stick to the house order</seg>
<seg id="40">Angela Crow from the police of Devon and Cornwall shared that the Delogisation was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not comply with the house order.</seg>
<seg id="41">"This goes to those who think they can behave without self-accusations as well as to those who were harmed by such behaviour," she said.</seg>
<seg id="42">Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour, which will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.</seg>

<seg id="2">Sunberries in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives</seg>
<seg id="3">A portusitic P-3C Orion plane of air pressure put an incredible storm flight</seg>
<seg id="4">Air forces said it was on a training flight, but insisted that no security risk was above</seg>
<seg id="5">This was the moment when frightened tourists start to panic after a tipping jet crashed over a full beach.</seg>
<seg id="6">Dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft almost flew over the sunk on the beach in Aveiro in northern Portugal.</seg>
<seg id="7">The holidaymakers on, as they were understandably inclined, worried about the noise of the jet engines without first seeing what the clouds arrived.</seg>
<seg id="8">The incident happened last afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.</seg>
<seg id="9">Daniel Fernandes, one of the many holidaymakers who posted videos about the dramatic fly-By in social media, said: "It flew twice really very deeply and there was a moment when it looked as though it would crash."</seg>
<seg id="10">Nuno Arroja added: "I was just watching surfing and it felt like the plane would drop to me."</seg>
<seg id="11">Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were in panic when the plane came out of the dark and was incredibly deep</seg>
<seg id="12">Portuguese air forces today said that the pilot of the P-3C Orion plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to fly so deep that this was the only way to identify them.</seg>
<seg id="13">The spokesman said the jet flew slightly deeper than usual due to poor viewing conditions, but the air pressure forces insisted that safety was at no time at risk.</seg>
<seg id="14">Area fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer, with four people being killed on the island of Madeira.</seg>
<seg id="15">Portuguese air force forces today said the pilot had to fly so deeply, owing to conditions - strong fog and fire - which restricts his view</seg>
<seg id="16">The plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise</seg>

<seg id="2">The leadership of US Republicans is plagued by massive concerns, including in traditionally conservative states.</seg>
<seg id="3">Presidential candidate Donald Trump has now left weaknesses of his election campaign in the past Republican stronghold Utah.</seg>
<seg id="4">A rare moment in which the usually large-scale and self-assured multimillionaire expressed something like concerns, as correspondents reported.</seg>
<seg id="5">After being thrown out of the race in his own Republican camp, doubts about his success in the fight for the White House are now growing.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We have huge problems in Utah," Trump said before evangelical Christians, who asked him about support in key states such as Ohio, Florida, or Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="7">Guilty of false reports of his candidacy, he again took on his known media scarves.</seg>
<seg id="8">Republican strongholds woke up</seg>
<seg id="9">Utah is usually a secure bank for Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to a survey by SurveyUSA from June, Trump and his bankruptcies were on the same line by Democrats, Hillary Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="11">Other institutions see Trump ahead, but not with the distance that is common to Republican candidates in the state.</seg>
<seg id="12">Arizona and Georgia.</seg>
<seg id="13">In an interview by the Senate CNBC, Trump replied to the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton's march again: "Just as I have done so far."</seg>

<seg id="2">The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary commission on the case.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kenya's athletics threats threaten after the second doping affair at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a fraud attempt at a doping control in the Olympic village, Kenya sent a coach to her home.</seg>
<seg id="5">The International Olympic Committee announced that it would immediately set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case.</seg>
<seg id="6">A Kenyan officials had told the former sprinter and today's Coach, John Anzrah, in the Olympic village a Urgin sample under the name of the 800-meter-runner Ferguson Red.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is what the Kenyan team has been reporting on.</seg>
<seg id="8">The IAAF International Federation has asked the IOC of information about the case to impose its own investigations, and shared an IAAF spokesman.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Depending on the findings of the investigation and the following measures by the IOC, the IAAF will evaluate it," it said in an IAAF statement.</seg>
<seg id="10">"He (Anzrah) has gone to the doping control station and has spent as a Ferguson Red, the rehearsal and signed," said Kenya's chief executive of Mission Stephan Arap Soi.</seg>
<seg id="11">He was in possession of the athlete's accreditation, who was on the list for training checks at the World Anti-Doping Agency.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ferguson Red was in 2015 in Beijing World Championship over 800 metres.</seg>
<seg id="13">Four days earlier, Kenyan athletics delegate chief Michael Roich had been deducted from the Rio Games.</seg>
<seg id="14">He is expected to have informed of his country's anti-doping tests.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to media reports he is said to have been arrested at his return at Nairobi airport.</seg>
<seg id="16">Kenya has been under special surveillance for some time now, following numerous doping offences.</seg>
<seg id="17">The announcement by the IOC of more than 2000 doping targets prior to the Rio Games was unusual to suggest that particularly athletes from Kenya and Russia are being notified.</seg>
<seg id="18">The World Anti-Doping Agency had put much pressure on the African country before the summer play in Brazil, creating an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.</seg>
<seg id="19">The law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympic start.</seg>
<seg id="20">As a result, WADA Kenya took Kenya from the list of countries whose anti-doping regime is in conformity with WADA rules.</seg>
<seg id="21">Kenya is seen as a big runners-nation.</seg>
<seg id="22">The country's athletics won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="23">In a series of television reports, the ARD has repeatedly complained that doping funds are easily accessible in Kenya and that there should be a significant mentality of sports fraud.</seg>
<seg id="24">IOC member Richard Charlotte last called for a similar investigation into Kenya, as he employed in the Russian athletics.</seg>
<seg id="25">It has been demonstrated that this type of sport has been completely and systematically dashed.</seg>
<seg id="26">Russia's athletics were subsequently ruled out of summer play.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the Shakespeare year, the Salzburg Festival presents the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic love, similar to Romeo and Julia.</seg>
<seg id="3">With a surprise Cecilia Bartoli.</seg>
<seg id="4">A musical captures Salzburg: The West Side Story, Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.</seg>
<seg id="5">The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and met with the role of Maria a youth room.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the orchestra, the Simón Bolívar Orchestra under the direction of the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm," he warmed.</seg>
<seg id="7">We always say that it is very Latin American.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's a wonderful mixture, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="10">I would say that we have Bernstein's music really in our blood!</seg>
<seg id="11">In this staging, Bartoli plays an older Maria.</seg>
<seg id="12">She remembers her love with Tony while the younger Mary plays and dances.</seg>
<seg id="13">The role of Maria has always fascinated me.</seg>
<seg id="14">First of all because it is musically exceptional!</seg>
<seg id="15">And then there would be Marias's personality.</seg>
<seg id="16">She says it in her song: "I feel prethy, oh so prettty, I feel prethy and witty and bright."</seg>
<seg id="17">So it is smart, of course naïve, and very passionate.</seg>
<seg id="18">"It resembles me very, my Italian character I have as a Roman," laughs Bartoli.</seg>
<seg id="19">Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."</seg>
<seg id="20">It's so an honour for us to work with her.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is an enormous generous person.</seg>
<seg id="22">And Bartoli returns the compliments: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary performer and very passionate!"</seg>
<seg id="23">Digging is a necessity for him.</seg>
<seg id="24">One sees it in each of his movements, in his blacks, it's his life!</seg>
<seg id="25">It's so a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.</seg>
<seg id="26">We both have a more southern temperament, a fire, a passion and a cheerful approach to life, which is very important!</seg>
<seg id="27">For the American director Philip Wm. McKinley is the "West Side Story" highly topical: "This piece is about prejudice and fanaticism."</seg>
<seg id="28">Today we have the refugees, at the time, the Puerta del Sol went to New York and the New Yorkers didn't want them.</seg>
<seg id="29">These are the same issues and they are just as relevant today.</seg>
<seg id="30">59 years later, the piece is still relevant.</seg>

<seg id="3">Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said her family were getting off her death in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was believed to have been killed by a Russian air attack in Raqqa, the group's bullying, reported ITV News on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="5">Sultana was 17 years old and died shortly after she had ordered her to leave the war-torn country and return to England.</seg>
<seg id="6">"One can only hope that the only good is - as a reminder and warning to others that this is the risks associated with it, to go into a war zone - people from ever going to take that decision," said Akunjee.</seg>
<seg id="7">In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from East London rose in a plane to Turkey and then entered a bus to the Syrian border.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sultanas family has been told she has cured an ISIS fighter in Syria - and within a few months to widow.</seg>

<seg id="2">Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate the judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="3">Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.</seg>
<seg id="4">The majority leader in the Senate Mitch McConnell believes the next president will appoint the successor to the late judge at the Supreme Court Antonin Scalia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Reid said on Thursday during a phone conference that he expected to select Garland "with a degree of certainty."</seg>
<seg id="6">A spokeswoman of Reid later said he had yet to speak to Clinton if she would nominate Garland and he would speculate.</seg>
<seg id="7">He praised Garland and said Clinton's team wouldn't care for complacency with a new candidate.</seg>
<seg id="8">Garland is the supreme judge for the US appeals court for the District of Columbia.</seg>

<seg id="2">"Those who don't suit and dress Erdogan sits on packed coffers," says the chair of the Gülen-nearby foundation dialogue and world, Ercan Karakoyun.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Kurdish community in Germany is expecting tens of thousands of vulnerable people fleeing from Turkey to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the medium term, it might even be "some hundreds of thousands," believing the association's chairman Ali Toprak.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Kurdish community of Germany is expecting a mass flight to Germany because of the crackdown of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.</seg>
<seg id="6">"In the short term, I am counting on tens of thousands, in the medium term, with some hundreds of thousands of vulnerable people from Turkey in Germany, when the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," the Association's Association President Ali Toprak says Friday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Because the government had already overturned Kurdish strongholds with straps before months, 500,000 Kurds within Turkey were fleeing.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the doomed coup, secular and opposition ethnic Turks were added.</seg>
<seg id="9">Many will want to start restarting in Europe if they continue to be oppressed in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="10">"It can't be that a state that includes refugees is producing refugees in their own country," said Toprak.</seg>
<seg id="11">The ban was the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in Albanian cities.</seg>
<seg id="12">This will help Erdogan to increase the exit of the Kurds.</seg>
<seg id="13">"They are the last large minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been eradicated or displaced in the last hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member.</seg>
<seg id="14">The secession, the federal government, claimed that the federal government is "as sharp as Austria against Erdogan and its supporters."</seg>
<seg id="15">In Germany, too, a "witch hunt" is being held against Erdogan critics.</seg>
<seg id="16">For the first time I feel no longer safe in Germany for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="17">The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad.</seg>
<seg id="18">More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and opponents.</seg>
<seg id="19">The fire mapping as a Gülen supporter destroys teachers and other academics the professional existence.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Those who do not fit and lose Erdogan sits on packed coffers, incidentally the Kemalists and secularies," said Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen-nearby Foundation dialogue and education, the "world."</seg>
<seg id="21">According to figures from the Federal Ministry of Internal Affairs, as the newspaper reports, the Turks already represented the largest group of applicants recognised for political persecution in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="22">On 30 June, this was 11.386 people and nearly 29% of all identified as asylum seekers (39.625).</seg>
<seg id="23">This survey did not involve the fleeing war, poverty or lack of prospects.</seg>
<seg id="24">Asylentifies according to the basic law are exclusively political, therefore from the state, individually persecuted.</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The locals get nothing from the summer campaign with - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia cannot choose the country's day.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">2021 will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin-duty parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is because, as so far, it is not up to us: Summer holidays, heat and day-to-day competitions - that is one thing.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who are to be persuaded by election fighters, are on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the holidaymakers in the country are on the road to Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee.</seg>
<seg id="8">To this end, practical problems arise: In the holiday, aid workers, who hang up posters, blowing up air balloons, distribute flyers and, at the end of the day, not only sign up.</seg>
<seg id="9">By September 4, 2016, the election and last day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern will have to go back to the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot stage, if you can say it at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, must fear his post.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys.</seg>
<seg id="13">To be exciting, how strongly newcomer AfD cuts and what remains in the end of coalitions.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old, and since 2008 head of government, makes an almost unstoppable campaign, from his grandparents.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels through the country, distributes roses and pauses a little with the people, just as it did his legendary predecessor, Harald Ringstorff.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise, Seering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the fault of the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their refugee policy, their "We created that" have speeded up the rise of rightwilists, which will probably cost him the fine office now.</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its top candidate, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already seen how it is to campaign for the wrong time.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel to the United Kingdom.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, it was more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as the Mecklenburger and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Since was probably the majority from other federal states," said Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in NDR.</seg>
<seg id="22">But it is not a shame of anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise, the Northeast CDU is largely abandoning the usual polling stations on marketplaces and before shopping malls with umbrellas and air ballots.</seg>
<seg id="24">That, he says, is only a "subordinate role."</seg>
<seg id="25">The Union, too, has noticed that it is the source of the fact that it will have to make a great effort to restore a wire to the people.</seg>
<seg id="26">It looks like the Left, the SPD, the Greens: Barely there in the world.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Council of the CDU election fighter, however, coconut to his fellow parties, however, is also self-evident: "You have to go where it does, namely where people are: Dorfeste, Golden Weddings, any birthday party must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because the stakes are high, Sellering has now called for a particularly dedicated campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In surveys, the Social Democrats were last with 22% behind partners, CDU (25) and only just before the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">At the 2011 election, the SPD had still clearly won by 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Greens, small party with seven per cent in the polls, are expected to create the plunge in the land day.</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue out of the holiday need, and largely relocate their campaign to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Online campaign," it calls the councillor Claudia Müller.</seg>
<seg id="34">Otherwise, green election fighters are going to search for local voters among the holidaymakers.</seg>
<seg id="35">Silke Gajek, the world's top candidate, is looking forward to welcoming you.</seg>
<seg id="36">Her impression: "Election leave in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a penalty."</seg>

<seg id="1">B27 remediation: Restaurants suffer as a result</seg>
<seg id="2">At the speed with which the B will be cleaned, there is nothing to get around.</seg>
<seg id="3">For those who are responsible for the construction work, starting at 5.30am, and ending up until 20 p.m., there will be full praise.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Those have made everything quite zakenig," says Elvira Tetzlaff of the jet-gas station.</seg>
<seg id="5">That's a superteam.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no delay.</seg>
<seg id="7">The building site could be moved to the south at the beginning of the week, until the end of October.</seg>
<seg id="8">It will also be commended for those who are responsible for the construction of the works, for example when it comes to the establishment of passenger tickets.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site on Monday to the south and the closure of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen, and therefore the connection to Rottenburg again, the traffic situation in the village has been relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="10">Citizens will now be able to move from Ofterdingen to the east.</seg>
<seg id="11">The doorway through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"There are some significant complaints," says the deputy chief executive director of Florian King, responsible for transport technology management.</seg>
<seg id="13">The inhabitants of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because a lot of dirt trails were sought after, and were more familiar with their navi than the relief.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that a number of lorries in residential areas were franked.</seg>
<seg id="15">As the speed limits have not been met, the congregation called for the measurement vehicle from Mössingen.</seg>
<seg id="16">"There have been significant transgressions," says King, who made himself aware of the situation.</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three per minute were used.</seg>
<seg id="18">The quick-hitting was travelling with 77 stunts in the pace-30 zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">Since the building was further moved, it has become more peaceful.</seg>
<seg id="20">For businessmen on the B 27, it is only a small trost that the street is open again for customers from Rottenburg.</seg>
<seg id="21">People don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the fact that the B-27 has led them to take up sales has led everyone to look through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some more and some are less affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those who have less to do with the "end-user" are produced for other companies, for which the recovery has little effect.</seg>
<seg id="25">Thomas Sulz also speaks of a "not easy decrease," but also admits that "the maturity is obviously missing."</seg>
<seg id="26">At the heart of the road there is a bus stop.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly a crown, finds clear words.</seg>
<seg id="28">That is already existential.</seg>
<seg id="29">Not only him, but all the restaurants have "hit it hard."</seg>
<seg id="30">Customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil failed.</seg>
<seg id="31">We have to be happy about every euro sales.</seg>
<seg id="32">The cost of revenue is higher than 50%.</seg>
<seg id="33">The road landing had "dropped back two years."</seg>
<seg id="34">Half of his staff must have dismissed him.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with a 4,000 staff and half would have been released, the policy would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, President Jörg Schmidt, on a request from Mr Göner, whether there could be financial compensation, with the indication that the host site benefited otherwise from the advantages of the situation on the 27th of the year, it also needs to bear the disadvantages caused by the rehabilitation.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other lands where so much more generous was handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">With all the lawsuits, Göhner is sure his host will continue.</seg>
<seg id="39">Finally, the family business has been here since 1715, referring to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">It is possible to understand that other regular guests are not looking at this time because of the complicated traffic management.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you cannot drive, it's also nice.</seg>
<seg id="42">Göhner has no doubts about the fact that he has returned to work after the end of the renovation work.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises with BSE and avian influenza, Göner considers the impact of the B 27 building on its rally for the biggest crisis that has experienced its host in its longstanding history.</seg>
<seg id="44">There are six months' work, which is already brutal.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the name of the fight against terrorism, laws are being broken down.</seg>
<seg id="2">Following the recent attacks, the Minister for the Interior, Mr de Maizière, now faces a thick safety package.</seg>
<seg id="3">But what is a tolerance status with terror?</seg>
<seg id="4">And what does the coalition partner say to all this?</seg>
<seg id="5">Thomas de Maizière gives the Veröhner.</seg>
<seg id="6">All his proposals are "politically reasonable," the Federal Minister for the Interior says in the presentation of his new security package.</seg>
<seg id="7">They don't overdemand anyone.</seg>
<seg id="8">Others, further points would be discussed at first within the parties.</seg>
<seg id="9">I am also involved in this.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, as a Home Secretary, it is in favour of results and an "achievable consensus" within the Coalition.</seg>
<seg id="11">De Maizière has left a little time after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach before presenting its conclusions on security in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="12">That is all the more important.</seg>
<seg id="13">A lot has already been announced, heralded by the fact that a new security agency is to take care of using encrypted communications.</seg>
<seg id="14">Nor does Germany have to implement several EU directives on passenger data and weapons legislation.</seg>
<seg id="15">The call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is also not surprising.</seg>
<seg id="16">In part, de Maizière is launching a second round of proposals for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD: He wants to criminalise recruitment for terrorist groups and, with dual citizenship, would push the German passport.</seg>
<seg id="17">"That will be difficult points for the SPD," admits the CDU man.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, he believes this is reasonable and I call for nothing to do with the coalition partner anyway.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few new ideas are presented by de Maizière.</seg>
<seg id="20">These have been partly in itself: It plans to make rapid deportation and more opportunities to arrest people before deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees who are targeted in the country should first check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a security review.</seg>
<seg id="22">In cases of rejection for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to put aside some even worse than to date - such as committing crimes or deliberately throwing away their papers to conceal their identity.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of this is politically and legally delicate.</seg>
<seg id="24">Manches also seem to be invisible and leaves questions open.</seg>
<seg id="25">And on some points - in the case of unequal treatment for example - the question arises: What has it actually done with security and terrorism?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, it is important to differentiate between refugees and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But we cannot deny that the perpetrators of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">In addition, many people were concerned about security, given the high number of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="29">And things that are deeply employed by the people have not yet been left out for election campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="30">Internal security has been enormous.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only the attacks in the neighbourhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">Uncertainty is great.</seg>
<seg id="34">And yes, there are election battles.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Union and the SPD have therefore become increasingly active in the field of internal security.</seg>
<seg id="36">Over the past few days, the two parties have been high.</seg>
<seg id="37">Only a garsting dispute over the equipping of federal police, then over a security-policy-thinking collection of some Unions Home Secretary, in which the portfolio chiefs are also calling for a Burka ban and a departure from dual citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="38">De Maizière is also here to make sense.</seg>
<seg id="39">There is nothing to do with the disappearance of the double.</seg>
<seg id="40">We have satisfied the discussion in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">To remake it is not meaningful.</seg>
<seg id="42">And on a burka ban, he has constitutional concerns.</seg>
<seg id="43">Whether his own package is constitutional and whether it is actually "reasonable" for the coalition partner, it is still necessary.</seg>
<seg id="44">There are some things that could cause dispute.</seg>
<seg id="45">But the SPD is also trying to take advantage of internal security.</seg>
<seg id="46">Party leader Sigmar Gabriel signals his willingness to talk openly and says: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything, which helps to further increase security."</seg>

<seg id="1">Volkswagen is still gliding through.</seg>
<seg id="2">Despite diesel scandals, delivery figures are rising worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="3">But it is not running in all markets.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the case, there is confusion about a term.</seg>
<seg id="5">Volkswagen will start the deliveries in the second half of the year.</seg>
<seg id="6">In spite of its many brands and some well-running markets, Europe's largest car can continue to show its biggest car.</seg>
<seg id="7">In July, however, the Volkswagen nuclear brand weakened mainly in Western Europe and thus again had a heavy burden of sales, as the company listed in the Dax listed company.</seg>
<seg id="8">Worldwide, the VW brand sold 1,449100 cars in July, 1.8 percent less vehicles than the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="9">In Western Europe alone, according to China, sales were 14 percent below the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the home market of Germany, deliveries to almost one-sixth fell.</seg>
<seg id="11">Markenverdidief Jürgen Stackmann reduced the weaker figures from July to two sales days less in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, in some core markets, a "changing economic environment" has given a purchase order.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey, the British vote to leave the EU has also been charged, a spokeswoman said.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the United States, where the exhaust flashes first escalated, there is also a minus.</seg>
<seg id="15">Great support for VW is the Chinese market.</seg>
<seg id="16">In total, the largely affected domestic brand of the Lower Saxony is already with the diesel scandal: After the first seven months, only a 0.9 per cent increase to 3.37 million vehicles is to be found.</seg>
<seg id="17">Group sales chief Fred Kappler continued to show a sales gap between January and July.</seg>
<seg id="18">1.3 per cent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen at this time, worldwide 5.904 million.</seg>
<seg id="19">Volkswagen had rigged with a software Aggery.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany alone, VW is calling for approximately 2.5 million cars to upgrade to the workshops.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the course of rearmament, VW confirmed that the conversion of the cars has no negative impact.</seg>
<seg id="22">After the conversion of vehicles, fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power will not deteriorate.</seg>
<seg id="23">The bus station offers customers a "guarantee" certificate, but not of a "guarantee," as was said on Friday in company trips.</seg>
<seg id="24">The reason for this is legal immunity.</seg>
<seg id="25">The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen would now guarantee its German customers a guarantee of equipped diesel models.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would have been confirmed last Monday VW-Representative in the Federal Ministry of Transport.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Department of Transport confirmed that there was this meeting.</seg>
<seg id="28">"VW has met the obligations of my investigative commission and the KBA."</seg>
<seg id="29">Said Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU).</seg>
<seg id="30">VW has taken the guarantee that fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power will not deteriorate after upgrading, and all the type-approval-related vehicles remain unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="31">Volkswagen itself uses the term "guarantee" but not how it was called in business trips.</seg>
<seg id="32">The broad concept of "guarantee" makes Volkswagen the possibility that, for example, customers could come to a shop for six months after the conversion - and this could lead to the new software - even if the damage has nothing to do with it.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is also important for us to avoid, in the interests of our clients, that any other damage, which has nothing to do with the Abgassandal, will lead to uncertainty as regards the possible guarantee arrangements, as stated.</seg>
<seg id="34">For this reason, VW does not use the term "guarantee."</seg>

<seg id="1">The Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee is asking for wealthy savers in the future - as the second Institute in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="2">Bank chief executive Josef Paul said on Thursday: "It's just about 139 customers, who park around EUR 40 million on giro- or daily cash accounts."</seg>
<seg id="3">The Bundesverband German Banks speaks of an isolated case and does not send a signal: Ordinary savers should not fear to pay for their sparkles.</seg>
<seg id="4">Camps banks money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they must pay their 0.4 percent penalty.</seg>
<seg id="5">This fee is required by the Raiffeisenbank Gmund from September of private and corporate customers for deposits over EUR 100 000 to be paid on Giro- or daily cash accounts.</seg>
<seg id="6">"The first 100,000 euros are free."</seg>
<seg id="7">Said Paul.</seg>
<seg id="8">He has had some EUR 40 million for some time, which could be raised from one day to another and which he cannot accept.</seg>
<seg id="9">"They are up to me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 per cent costs," the bank chief said.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I cannot put aside for every million EUR 4000."</seg>
<seg id="11">After the 'polluter pays' principle, the costs are now continuing.</seg>
<seg id="12">If the cash is to be left in the gates of the Raiffeisenbank, it would be far too dangerous to say: "I have already experienced four incidents, not even the fifth!"</seg>
<seg id="13">Most customers would understand and changed to other forms of investment.</seg>
<seg id="14">Few emigrated to other banks.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Bavarian Cooperatives Association said: "The ECB's extreme monetary policy is causing significant costs on all banks."</seg>
<seg id="16">To bear it alone is not "economically viable."</seg>
<seg id="17">Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or remittances.</seg>
<seg id="18">With penalty interest rates for deposits from three million euros, the Thuringian Volks- and Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land had made headlines with its Skatbank branch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="19">Michael Kemmer, chief executive of the banking association, said: "We don't expect private customers to pay nationwide charges on deposits, to do so, competition in Germany is far too strong among banks and savings banks."</seg>
<seg id="20">A banker said at the Tegernsee Lake there is "a clientele that is quite abundant in wealth."</seg>
<seg id="21">"That can be a problem for a small bank," if she's free money.</seg>
<seg id="22">The co-operative bank Gmund founded in 1911 has branches in Bad Wiesee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the region, there are known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Bavarian Cooperative Federation "is currently not aware of any further banks that charge an outlet for deposits of private customers," spokesperson Ernst said.</seg>
<seg id="25">The president of the Federal Association of German People's Banks and Raiffeisen Banks (BVR), Uwe Fröhlich, said at the end of June that the threshold to go into the negatives is very high.</seg>
<seg id="26">The competition is tough, and it droit the emigration of investors to competition.</seg>
<seg id="27">The customers in Germany will not be allowed to fall into the width.</seg>

<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the much-talked resurgence of soundboards is not on a boom in Reuters that want to welcome the novelty of physical objects, but because of midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a plate are forward-looking after age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the 18-24 age group is the most unlikely buyer group.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a horden by amateur collectors - it has an emotional meaning: Older platters retain their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are YouGov's results?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would be a news report on television, I would follow the camera while, in the midst of a busy street in Soho, I am running a modest grey suit and looking wild before I stand, my hands feel and something to say like: "So, let us take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So let us look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings in which once independent sellers were established - there is still a handful of fantastic record shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I am in direct proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and vegetable through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, to which I am from Sister Ray (data number: Two young women, three men middle ages) to Reckless Records (data number: Eight men of middle age, a woman, presumably around the 20) is a day long for a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess already," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These sound boards, above (he sent me the snapshot by email, I didn't go back home), dress up the walls of his caravan.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason he owns such a significant number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: He is now in a position to buy plates that he couldn't afford when she appeared and again bought items he sold when he was young.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Many things I buy are out of the late sixties, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. Things where I was probably something too young to buy it," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and would like to spend time alone, adding: "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.</seg>
<seg id="21">That's my lust.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers who meet him meet on the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he has also noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media pie, people who have heard about the comeback and who have been prompted to buy their old plates again.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations that I have conducted, people have usually escaped from their collection in 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their plates to buy themselves CDs now sell their CDs to buy their plates again, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">That would explain the boom to supporters of the record revision of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes just a few seconds in a business like Phonica to recognize that record shops offer a reassuring community of equestrian.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to Weiz, some of the older customers took an impetus to the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar silhouettes, of objects that wake up happy youth.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a liver or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," says Wez.</seg>
<seg id="32">That's when I am a collector, and I think it is so.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is an easy way to employ mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"We are like their social workers!" We have a staff of a record pile.</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey by the ICM in April revealed that nearly 50 per cent of people bought a plate last month, they haven't heard yet.</seg>
<seg id="36">The poll also found that 41 per cent have a record player they never use, while 7 per cent of those buying a plate don't have a record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this point in the news report, I would probably look very concerned, while I am pillaging by a stack of Bossa Nova complains.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works with Sounds of the Universe (data: Three men of middle ages), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the Revvals.</seg>
<seg id="39">"Someone just came here recently and said:" I don't have a record player, but I would like to buy a Radiohead record plate so that I can put them in the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More product load, less music load.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people saying: 'I don't have a record player.'</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older people, who are only beginning to clean up.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has devoted almost a whole floor to the sound boards, has a blower audience when I go down.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teens and middle ages.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts's latest synonym and sexy-packed pop instead of experimental jazz rhymes out of the speakers - it's good to see such diversity among customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks particularly lonely, but naughty mental trauma is difficult to determine if one is standing next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around for a few minutes in the business and looked at the varietal of the plates for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is more like a shopping cart than a wholesale purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">She doesn't deserve much, therefore collecting plates no real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to hear music from a computer or in other ways, but the beauty of plates is... "she drives up with a loved Sefzer.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I would seem to muster the jeans hotties, I observe a group of young teenagers who are grouped for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter consider buying a Crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">To the left is a staircase house, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: A mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to take them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It's pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But given that any attraction for these items means more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of Sohos for more, there's nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It's no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, is also the one that spends most on luxury items such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if my follow-up shows that the results of YouGov are voting, they, at least in record shops in Soho, leave out the large number of female collectors who exist in reality, record shops and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They certainly do not spend their Thursday morning with safety with the buck through record stores of Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while they are miles to the startling look of an unsuspecting, thirty-year-old false presenter who has left unsuspecting men of middle ages.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court has rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live in.</seg>
<seg id="3">At a court hearing this week, authorities in Calais argued that the state should be empowered to demolish 72 provisional transactions in which people inside the store sell goods, selling cigarettes to Energyrites, offer hairdressing, or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in PISG restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Calais prefecture argued that these places should be demolished because they would be a parallel economy, from which no taxes would be paid and that would have a fire and sanitation risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state-backed union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also said that temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille ruled that there would be no legal basis for the deportation of people running the 72 provisional deals, but admitted that the concerns of Calais's prefecture were "absolutely understandable."</seg>
<seg id="8">Judge Jean-François Molla said food shops, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than merely feeding people who "live in extremely precarious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said the areas offer quiet matches between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places under threat from the Netherlands was the Jungle Book Kids' cafe of the camp, which is commonly operated and consists of 200 meals on the day, English and French classes, and advice on asylum matters for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to keep the Kids' cafe.</seg>
<seg id="12">In a letter to the Guardian, it was said that the closure would be "for these children of a disaster, of which the youngest eight years are old."</seg>
<seg id="13">The two aid agencies Help Refugees and L'Auberge of the Migrants estimate on Friday that the number of those living in the jungle camp had risen to more than 9,000 people - the highest number until now - following a sharp rise in new arrivals over the summer.</seg>

<seg id="2">Germany's grass must be adjusted to the next generation of speed meters: In various federal states, among other things in Hessen and Brandenburg, new flash devices will be tested, which should be particularly effective over the ground.</seg>
<seg id="3">For example, the futuristic actuation trailer of the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used in case of accident areas, where it would be too dangerous to use a mobile measurement by the police.</seg>
<seg id="4">For example, at highway construction sites or connecting bridges with temporary timing, there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that the speed limit is observed there.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, a permanent mobile development can be too dangerous or complex.</seg>
<seg id="6">The driver is self-sufficient: His battery holds five days on uninterrupted measurement operations, the case data being encrypted via a modem.</seg>
<seg id="7">With laser measurement technology, all vehicles can be captured across multiple tracks simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="8">Variable speed limits, as well as traffic bans by time, track and vehicle class can also be monitored.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the high-risk state, the trailer can be used by the manufacturer with a clutch.</seg>
<seg id="10">In order not to simply clad it, it is lowered in the measuring operation, so the wheels are disappearing in the armored and also a smooth outer shell.</seg>
<seg id="11">In addition, a built-in alarmist aims to protect the Blitzer against vandalism.</seg>

<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance at the 7-man rugby came to an abrupt stop on Thursday night at the last hurdle in the shape of the fijis when they were beaten with a score of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji awarded a master class in the handling, Side-steeping, afterward, line-up and raw force to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">Defeat was missed by the not-too-poor price of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament, where they suggested New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the coke, 7-5 in the semifinals on the same day could fall back on them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of this, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in bribery.</seg>
<seg id="7">It might be a trost for GB - but will probably not - at least one Brite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck: Fijis chief trainer Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult way behind.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, she lost at the Adelaide Sevens under Ryan every game.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost just one.</seg>
<seg id="11">That slap will hurt, but progress is astonishing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started out and left the attacks GBs.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the early days Division.</seg>
<seg id="14">With yet four minutes of play, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner he converted.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A hedged Tackle of Mitchell stole the Mount of Man Leone Nakarawa a third gate, but it only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute, JASA Veremuua left a touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new since the rebound and there was still over a minute game time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravuvou preyed by further weak Tackling of the GB team and stormed to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is as if Fiji was born to play 7, while GB is still learning.</seg>
<seg id="22">So it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced fundamental changes to half-time by and closed the fijian gap... for a whole four minutes, which was good for the circumstances of the first half-time, until Josua Tuisova went through a brilliant midplay run by Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton launched an attempt for GB, making a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game was already running for a long time in favor of the south-east of England, whose fans sang smiles, flags and dancing in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire Fijis's playful approach.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame set the i-bag with another try in the final seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The pfiff, the fijis hugged themselves and GB cracked down the lawn.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi-finals with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a tight half-final match from the race - Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the batters forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate under the post in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late tackling of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Asian team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by fight with the trainer's cancer to rudder victory</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no emotine gold than in those games, and that is what you want.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first slide to the last, 220 hard Hieve that came into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an extra significance in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Echo of the trainer Robin Williams was here as she was a second Olympiagold in the second without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British Sports, which laid such a benchmark.</seg>
<seg id="5">Her dominance was absolutely, after all, its 39th unsuspecting bet, which is also unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we are seeing are two brilliant athletes who glide over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the nature of the triumphal.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in the rudder, a Batamillon is stuck to willing heroines that contribute to the incremental advances that make up the difference and it was no euthanising than the coach who did not know 30 months ago whether he would survive that day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said, he was risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, which is operable and they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you don't do that, he spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little to the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio were lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, which kept the interruption to a minimum if that is the right term in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go back again.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">That's how it starts.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is already a challenge, but this makes it an even bigger one.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the insufficiency of the victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerving morning doing something more than usual, trying to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Stanning, who was the main man in the Royal Artillery Regiment in an effort in Afghanistan, said "I was an emotional wreck this week, which is perhaps something extreme, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It just repeats how much I mean, how much I and Helen and Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin, we would be no one, and therefore a massive thank him to him.</seg>
<seg id="25">I would have no better person to train or better coach.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the past five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a tough rhythm, with which their opponents couldn't compete.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 metres, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to finish, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were caught very at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "leaded in the process, sustained in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important not to let go.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not prepared to make something rabies.</seg>
<seg id="33">We did not want a fireworks today, we simply wanted to achieve a good result, go beyond and win the race, which we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover will have to appear on a wedding next week, her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she simply wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that was my last race.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have caused excessive pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">In London, it took about six months to realise that I am an Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="40">It was all so new to me and I was so stressful.</seg>
<seg id="41">Here it took about four minutes.</seg>
<seg id="42">That feels so much better, "she said.</seg>

<seg id="1">31 years for clarity</seg>
<seg id="2">The Managing Director of the Water Funding Federation, Ruppert Göller, is retiring.</seg>
<seg id="3">The association is regarded as "Bavarian."</seg>
<seg id="4">A small frantic drinking water station as an example for the large water producers.</seg>
<seg id="5">This was the name of the Bayerischer Rundfunk some time ago.</seg>
<seg id="6">Little later, the Water Forum of the Government of Lower Frankonia was awarded the purpose board.</seg>
<seg id="7">The work of the Veig group is "Bavarian as exemplary."</seg>
<seg id="8">Behind all this is Rupert Göller, who was 31 years in the Zielband employee, 28 years as managing director.</seg>
<seg id="9">Now he was retired at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The water-purpose Federation of the Veig group, based in Kottendorf, Municipality Breitbrunn, promotes approximately 150000 cubic metres of water every year and provides for 32 places and females with about 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">The municipalities are the municipalities of Kirchlouder, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.</seg>
<seg id="12">For other cities and municipalities there are water supply contracts.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current chairman, Breitbrunn Mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was hired as a water supplier in 1985 and was appointed as the Managing Director of the Zielverband in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"His tasks have been very diverse and they covered water pipeline construction and maintenance work through office and organization activities, budgeting, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations at weekends," the chairperson said.</seg>
<seg id="15">As an outstanding event, she called the start-up and inauguration of the new wells (1994), plots of land in the area of the new wells (1998) and compensation of farmers, the rehabilitation of the high-container (1999), the new creation of a central computer control system (2004) and the re-introduction of water pipelines.</seg>
<seg id="16">There has been no stalemate, and there have always been innovations because water is a means of life and drinking water is the most important food.</seg>
<seg id="17">In her Laudatio, she praised Göller's faithful, reliable and correct service over 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">He has worked with a lot of heart blood for his water base and he has always lived in the water-purpose association as if it were its own business.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he has been able to present the concept of success of the group to the water forum in the district of Lower Frankonia.</seg>
<seg id="20">He received a great deal of recognition and praise.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rupert Göller, for his part, praised Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.</seg>
<seg id="22">He is the best Wasser and he was a faithful cone.</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - lighting for German steel industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-torn and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared by additional costs in millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that the industry threatened to take from eco-flow support are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">It remains in the case of the exemption from the Energi Terbarukan Saja Tidak Cukup energy conversion system for the production facilities of the German steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I am really happy that, after two years of negotiations, we have finally succeeded."</seg>
<seg id="6">The European Commission has therefore initially planned to call on the steel manufacturers to use the gases from the furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the German industry, the steel industry was threatened with an additional cost of EUR 120 to 240 million a year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel said the WAZ will now provide a basic agreement with the EU Commission after talks with Competition Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only when the generators are replaced in the steel plants, all an EEG account for 20 percent.</seg>
<seg id="10">But that too will not be made in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">The IG metal welcomed the unification of Germany with the EU's own electricity production commission.</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that the status quo of the existing regime has been largely established.</seg>
<seg id="13">The success of Gabriel for the steel industry is particularly important.</seg>
<seg id="14">"With regard to our 'steel', future is a first step."</seg>
<seg id="15">"More must follow."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Also in the reform of emissions legislation, climate and employment objectives are to be weighed down," said IG Metall-Chief Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.</seg>
<seg id="17">The steel industry in Europe has suffered overcapacity and a significant price pressure since the 2008 financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year, the situation continued to rise as the world's largest producer country raised the world market in the face of its weakening domestic demand.</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel corporations of price dumping.</seg>
<seg id="20">Over the course of this spring, the situation has eased slightly.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand, import duties on imports of imports have an effect, and on the other hand, the economic outlook in China has emerged.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainable prices are.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry primus Thyssenkrupp the University of Hungary remained cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Last but not least, prices would have stagnated.</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">Most importantly, ThyssenKrupp did not want to exclude the closure of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the German steel industry, some 86,000 people were employed at the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="28">In July, German steel manufacturers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.</seg>
<seg id="29">They produced by 3.4 million tonnes of good six per cent less crude steel than in the previous month, as the Economic Association said on Friday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, spirit, health: Singing does seniors well</seg>
<seg id="2">The Singen has already accompanied Ursel Kipp her whole life: As a young girl she was in the school choir, in the Lehtramt-studying she was the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old is singing in a seniors choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal she feels balanced, cheerful and overall more lively, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she is doing something good for her health and spirit.</seg>
<seg id="6">Singen is a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler from the German seniors league.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the choir and share with peers the joy of the music, describing Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular meetings, seniors can build and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Social and family structures are often solved at age, and a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "Speak out and organize to leave on the other and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of association."</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in the positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">This is because seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">If you ask your lungs on a regular basis, you can't get it out of the pusts.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even if it's about to get the sound of voice in the age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">On older people, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Labour community of seniors organizations.</seg>
<seg id="16">In older generations, the common singing had a much higher value, it belonged to everyday life, both at school and in leisure, she explained.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that the singing or listening of songs to older people awakens many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through song lyrics and especially melodies, even dementia-torn people are suffering from long-standing events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the case of singing, a special performance is also required.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, focusing on their own voice and on a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - that's a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Even older people who live alone are not only focusing on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition given by the singing in the choir, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great compliment.</seg>
<seg id="24">Self-esteem is also growing by singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show itself: If I'm long for something to eat, I'll be better and wake up beyond me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">There are enough reasons to start singing.</seg>
<seg id="27">Who wants to try a new hobby shouldn't hesitate - even if he thinks little talent, advises Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="28">You are not alone - at least 50 people - who are listening to them when they go out?</seg>
<seg id="29">Looking for the matching offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone is out of the audience in a seniors choir, you can easily join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer views over the choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">If you want to sing in a church choir, you can go straight to the village or church.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many seniors can be found via the internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">If you do not have access to the Internet, you can ask the family, friends or neighbours for help with the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="35">If you want to sing, you should join a choir.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul well and has something liberalized - that applies to every age.</seg>

<seg id="1">Cats respond more sensitively than catcher on gunfire of juveniles</seg>
<seg id="2">Biologists have studied in Hannover, which effect has caused cat babies on adult animals.</seg>
<seg id="3">To her surprise, the mistress also didn't let the men go cold - but they always kept in touch with the females.</seg>
<seg id="4">Female cats can recognize the erratic rate of cat babies on the small ones.</seg>
<seg id="5">They respond to ten per cent faster on Lutte from kittens, who are in great distress, as scientists have found out of the Animal Veterinary School and Medical University Hannover (MHH).</seg>
<seg id="6">Catchers also respond to the rufe of kittens - but always equal.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Apparently, the acoustic differences between the mistress of less and sharply raised juveniles for the males are either not perceived or irrelevant," said the biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.</seg>
<seg id="8">She is the first author of the study published this Friday in the journal "BMC Evolutionary Biology."</seg>
<seg id="9">In a previous investigation, the research team had already found that the duration and tone of the kittens is different from the urgency of their aid needs.</seg>
<seg id="10">A total of nine adult catchers and eight patients were observed from the MBH.</seg>
<seg id="11">They were first played for a rufe of little ones, taken for three minutes from the litter box and separated by mother and brothers.</seg>
<seg id="12">On the other hand, they were faced with gunshots of more highly inflated kittens, which were added in addition.</seg>
<seg id="13">The researchers hold their results despite the low sample for meaningful.</seg>
<seg id="14">"All females, even those that had not yet had their own offspring, responded differently to the sheriff," said Konerding.</seg>
<seg id="15">They turned faster to the speaker when this Rufe played off the very erased kittens.</seg>
<seg id="16">This ability may be associated or develop with the gender maturity.</seg>
<seg id="17">"A surprise was that the males reacted at all," the biologist said.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the past, scientists have already investigated the reactions of women and men on baby noises in the past.</seg>
<seg id="19">Also, some studies showed that women responded more sensitively to infants, whether they were mothers or not, reported biologist Marina Scheumann.</seg>

<seg id="2">Hakan sweetness is a football legend in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="3">An arrest warrant has been issued in Turkey against the former football star Hakan Sükiss.</seg>
<seg id="4">He is accused of being a terrorist group.</seg>
<seg id="5">For the first time after the coup attempt, an important football game is taking place in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="6">Before the duel of the archrivals between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul to the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: "Business as usual" is said.</seg>
<seg id="7">Even if the state of emergency was to be imposed after the crash in July, the government, which would not be affected by the everyday life of ordinary citizens.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to Fethullah Gülen, who is responsible for the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="9">This is not the case before football.</seg>
<seg id="10">Against former Starkiker Hakan Sükhr, prosecutors said a warrant was issued.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the meantime, the South of America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.</seg>
<seg id="12">Sükär is to be a supporter of Predicer Fethullah Gülen, who is blamed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is true that the state of emergency of 90 days is still in place until October, but it does not have any effect on the life of most Turks.</seg>
<seg id="14">The night-time "democracy guards" on public places across the country said Erdogan has been declared an end on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sport - like the whole country - is divided into supporters and opponents of Erdogan.</seg>
<seg id="16">Especially fans of the Besiktas working club are traditionally not among the president's friends.</seg>
<seg id="17">But, given the dramatic history of history, the Turks are strongly opposed to military purses.</seg>
<seg id="18">Even even the fans agree - no matter whether their heart beats Galatasaray or Fenerbahce.</seg>
<seg id="19">At the "Gala" Cup, it will be particularly important to arrive at Lukas Podolski.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the past season, the Cologne has proved its sporting value: With 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions, the 31-year-old finished his first time as the top scorer of his association.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the final game against Fenerbahce, he scored the 1: 0 victory.</seg>
<seg id="22">The newspaper "Fanatics" complained to him: "He was the best on the pitch."</seg>
<seg id="23">He finished the season superbly and secured the ball.</seg>
<seg id="24">Thanks to "Poldi," the disappointing season for the record master was a conciliatory conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="25">After the pre-season k.o in the Champions League, the "Löwen" also shoots in the Europa League early.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the South Lig, it was only to rank six.</seg>
<seg id="27">The season wasn't good.</seg>
<seg id="28">The Postal was the only way to win something.</seg>
<seg id="29">"That's what we've got and that's the most important thing," Podolski said.</seg>
<seg id="30">For master Besiktas the match year went better.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks in particular to Mario Gomez, who was the second title to the 14th title with 26 seasons as a South-Lig-Torprotective King.</seg>
<seg id="32">That's also the reason fans continue to hope for the return of the 31-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="33">In doing so, Gomez, who was under the agreement of the AC Florence, had only been informed of the coup attempt, because of the political situation in the country.</seg>
<seg id="34">"If Mario wants to come to us," he must just say "Kicker" Kicker "Kicker" Club chef Fikret Orman.</seg>
<seg id="35">However, to do so, the stuner would have to be prepared to dispense with approximately one-third of his year's estimate of EUR 7.5 million, Orman said: "We cannot pay his salary at Florence."</seg>

<seg id="2">The Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, said Foreign Ministry spokesman Thomas Schnöll, Friday morning.</seg>
<seg id="3">She had suffered cuts and was treated in hospital, but had already been able to leave it again.</seg>
<seg id="4">Her home trip was scheduled for early September.</seg>
<seg id="5">Whether from the other explosions on the holiday island of Phuket and in the southern towns of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon also affected Austrian citizens, it is still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="7">Hua Hin, located about 200 miles south of the capital Bangkok, was initially exploding two bombs on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to police, a Thailand was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrians, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.</seg>
<seg id="9">Friday morning, two pitfalls were again high, and another man was killed.</seg>
<seg id="10">A bomb explosion was also reported in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="11">A taxi driver was injured in the shooting near the nearby town of Patong.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Surat Thani on the southeast coast of the country, then another bomb exploded, killing a municipal employee.</seg>
<seg id="13">The assaults were put into the air, according to the authorities in a floral beets before the coast police moved to the air.</seg>
<seg id="14">Finally, detectives in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast and Chumphon on the south-east coast claimed several injured.</seg>
<seg id="15">A connection with the explosions in Hua Hin said it was.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The bomb attacks bear the same handwriting," said Army director Danai Kritmethavee Friday morning.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We expect it to be a coordinated attack."</seg>
<seg id="18">It is too early to comment on possible motives - but probably the actions of Muslim rebels.</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media, too, wanted to identify a pattern typical for the bombing of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">Thai police, on the other hand, said the attacks were not linked to the Islamist insurgency or international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"That's just local sabotage, which is limited to limited areas and provinces," a spokesman said in Bangkok.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rather, the bombs of opponents of the ruling military junta have been laid down.</seg>
<seg id="23">The authorities would have received intelligence advice on imminent attacks in the South of the country in the past few days - but they were not informed about the exact timing and locations.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear what group behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">Police instructed their officials across the country to strengthen security around important government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and amusement areas.</seg>
<seg id="26">There are still smaller bombings in Thailand, but they are mostly not against tourists.</seg>
<seg id="27">In Hua Hin, a palace was used over the years by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">The Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on its homepage, is strongly recommending that the Thai security authorities be informed.</seg>
<seg id="29">High security risk (3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihen and its surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="30">After clashes between security forces and Muslim populations, they are not going to travel to these provinces.</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased security (level 2) for the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday were few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">It also gives strong influence to the military in the years to come.</seg>
<seg id="34">Junta boss and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-lo-cha said the bombs had been an attempt to stifle chaos, while moving towards stability, improving the economic situation and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The military unta, which took power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, is helping itself to restore stability and order.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, the military has not been able to control Muslim rebels in the far south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have already been killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">Barely a year ago, in Bangkok, an attack on a popular Hindu shrine was killed 20 people - most of them foreign tourists.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was the bloodiest attack of the country's younger history.</seg>

<seg id="1">The "Identity Movement" is in the name of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection.</seg>
<seg id="2">According to a number of national offices, the German Federal Government's constitutional protections have also been monitored.</seg>
<seg id="3">"We see the" Identity Movement "clues to efforts against the liberal democratic constitution," said Constitutional Secretary Hans-Georg Maaßen of the German Press Agency in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="4">In this way, immigrants from Islamic faith or from the Middle East are subjected to extreme violence.</seg>
<seg id="5">That is why we are watching the movement.</seg>
<seg id="6">The "Identity Movement" is a group with French roots, which has been active in Germany since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="7">It turns out against "Multikulti-Wahn," "unchecked mass immigration" and "losing its own identity by alienation."</seg>
<seg id="8">The "identitarian" are already observed in nine German Länder - Bremen, Bayern, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia.</seg>
<seg id="9">Maassen said his authority had agreed closely with the national offices.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Groups like the 'Identity Movement' try to pick up their target group as it stands," the Constitutional Secretary said.</seg>
<seg id="11">In general, extremists are trying to address them with youth, often with poptic music.</seg>
<seg id="12">Those were Islamists, as well as right-wing extremists.</seg>
<seg id="13">This is not a real advertisement for its own.</seg>
<seg id="14">Propaganda is supposed to raise people emotionally.</seg>
<seg id="15">Young people are particularly vulnerable.</seg>
<seg id="16">That is dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="17">Most recently, there have been reports from a number of federal states about the "identitarian" to AfD politicians.</seg>
<seg id="18">Maassen said he had no knowledge of that.</seg>
<seg id="19">For constitutional protection, such contacts are only relevant from a point of view.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is a question of whether or not the party - in this case the AfD - changed its direction and becomes so extremist by certain people who are extremist.</seg>
<seg id="21">So the decisive factor is whether such people have to have a keen influence on the party.</seg>
<seg id="22">That is not apparent.</seg>
<seg id="23">With a view to the significant increase in legally-motivated crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelters, Maassen said he would not yet talk about new rights of terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="24">However, over the past few years, we have established that there can be legislative structures.</seg>
<seg id="25">There was the Group's Old School Society or the Freemer Group.</seg>
<seg id="26">It may well be that other terrorist groups or micro-groups can form themselves, who are planning attacks against asylum seekers, against refugees or attacks from other right-wing motives.</seg>
<seg id="27">A German-wide or Europe-wide management of legal terrorism is not apparent.</seg>
<seg id="28">The previous groups have emerged at regional or social networks.</seg>
<seg id="29">Concerns expressed concern that many attacks went to people who had previously not appeared in the right scene.</seg>
<seg id="30">That is the cause of concern.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many of the suspects on asylum-shelter attacks have not been known before as criminals, politically motivated criminals or supporters of the right scene.</seg>
<seg id="32">"Many people have committed crimes that had previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists, who were perhaps politically indifferent or who, for example, have chosen CDU, the SPD or the Left, who, however, have become radicalized by extremist voting."</seg>

<seg id="2">The Olympic Games or world records do not always determine the headlines at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows the bold appearance of ROBEL Kiros Habte during the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimsuit from Ethiopia was so slow that he was temporarily unable to see the TV pictures.</seg>
<seg id="5">He simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut was selected.</seg>
<seg id="6">In social networks, Habte was subsequently used to go viral.</seg>
<seg id="7">In fact, the 24-year-old finished with a delay of 48 seconds and ranked 59th place of 59 starter.</seg>
<seg id="8">It was rather his not just athletic figure, which attracted attention from the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why the 24-year-old still participates in the Olympics?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopians received a special ruling from the international pool.</seg>
<seg id="11">This will be distributed to make swimming in under-represented countries known.</seg>
<seg id="12">As the majority of athletes run, Habte wanted to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="13">Preparation is all: ROBEL Kiros Habite is ready for the big race.</seg>
<seg id="14">Quickly made the first nickname the round.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some media called him "ROBEL of the whale."</seg>
<seg id="16">In addition to a "welfare belly," the English tabloid "The Sun" made it funny.</seg>
<seg id="17">His time, he suggested just one minute and nearly five seconds over the 100 meters of freedom, played no part.</seg>
<seg id="18">Comparisons with Eric the Eel were also drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">At the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Eric Moussambani's run for median attention.</seg>
<seg id="20">An unforgettable experience was the appearance of the swimming pool of Equatorial Guinea, when he had to compete alone in a pre-run of 100 metres.</seg>
<seg id="21">He was fired at the time.</seg>
<seg id="22">The 22-year-old learned to swim just eight months before Olympia and had never finished so long before the contest.</seg>

<seg id="3">The returns came suddenly - but not quite surprisingly.</seg>

<seg id="5">The global number five of the industry is facing a personal new start.</seg>
<seg id="6">Gfk board chief wants to leave the company at the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board of Arno Mahlert already has effect on 12 September from the supervisory board.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Management Board already took over the previous board member Gerhard Hausruckinger on September 1.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will officially assume the function of a "predator" until a successor to Hartmann was found.</seg>
<seg id="10">As a reason for the recall, the company called "different views" on the long-term business orientation.</seg>
<seg id="11">Details didn't want to call a corporate speaker on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is still unclear to have the market research company in future.</seg>
<seg id="13">In investor prices, it was said Friday that shareholders had been disappointed with the continued success of the restructuring launched years ago.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr Hartmann has been on the GfK tip since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="15">"The fruits of the restructuring are not yet to be seen after 5 years," it said.</seg>

<seg id="1">The charges per cubic metre of waste water from October 1, 2016 for the area of waste water treatment Neudorf / Reth / Welchenkahl.</seg>
<seg id="2">At the airport in Azendorf, the waste water charge will increase once more, if appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="3">After an oversleeved calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf will be at 4.37 Euro per cubic meter.</seg>
<seg id="4">As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, the Council's approval of the budget was determined by the Kulmbach County Council that undercover covers for these waste water plants.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Kasendorf market is subject to legal basis for a cost-free operation.</seg>
<seg id="6">As of 1 October 2016, citizens and industrial companies from Welchschahl, Neudorf, Reth, Azendorf, Lupp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to go deeper into the purse.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As administrative leader Herbert Schmidt revealed to the Body, a recalculation of the charges for the waste water systems of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, even overcover or undercover from the previous period of calculations should be compensated.</seg>
<seg id="10">The serious redundancies made by Schmidt to ensure that there are relatively small facilities with a very low waste water treatment in all three wastewater treatment plants between 6800 and 12000 cubic metres per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Thus, due to the small basis of distribution, for example, expenses for the necessary repairs of thousands of euros would be serious.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, waste water in all three plants is slightly decreasing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, in the declining period of time, all three installations have not been affected by a significant extent, not least due to their age of rehabilitation and repair.</seg>
<seg id="14">The plant in Azendorf was nearly 30 years old, the plants for Welchschahl, Neudorf and Reth and Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lupp almost 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt pointed out that in the Azendorf sewage plant the mechanical ventilation system had to be exchanged due to a damage.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the Pumpwerk Welschchenkahl, for nearly 20 years, the production facilities had to be overtaken by reason, and at the Lupp forest clearing house, after nearly 20 years of operation, the first treatment pond had to be spread, the sewage sludge was disposed of and an additional ventilation facility had to be used to keep the water legal requirements in place.</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: "On these extraordinary expenses, the advanced maintenance and maintenance costs came to be taken into account in the new calculation period."</seg>
<seg id="18">The same is true of electricity costs, which were clearly below the current level in 2011 / 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made clear that in the small waste water case in the three plants, the expenses for operation and maintenance were "fully reflected."</seg>
<seg id="20">Said Schmidt, the market community of large-scale entertainment in the waste water sector over the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="21">The situation for these plants will continue to remain fragile in the view of stonehouses, especially given that it is not possible to expand the area of the Friesenbachtal treatment area for these plants, because they are deficient.</seg>

<seg id="1">Snapchat "Animal" effect as Asian caricature criticised</seg>
<seg id="2">Snapchat says this filter is anime-inspired but some observers say it is insensitive to breeds.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filter tool, Snapchat allows around 150 million daily users to change the reality and to play with identities in such a way that is isolated.</seg>
<seg id="4">They can turn into an pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be made of a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are unfiltered, standalone tools that generate more than 30 million improved selections per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All wrongdoing comes to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have been criticized in the past, in which they were accused of promoting the app Blackface or propelled white skin as a beauty sideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When it was this week that some users suggested a filter, which gave rise to dark teeth, false teeth and dark cheeks, some critics called a racist caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversies were pointing to a larger problem that the company has with diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and outrage were widely circulated Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat shared that it would have deactivated the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: The filter was thought to be a homage to animme characters and not as a caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced raciousness reminded the filter of vulnerable cliches.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an email wrote Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet on the photos was widely shared, that the filter was "vulnerable and to be found to be uncomfortable."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the counter-performance of a very contradictory Asian caricature and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellow-proof, but that it has been pulled into the abyss.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company to cross this cultural stumbling block.</seg>
<seg id="18">American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all keep in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchat's big audience of young people - who are different in terms of race than their older counterparts - could be more likely to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">If one of Snapchat's filters creates an image that is offensive to a user, "this is much more difficult for such things to stay unnoticed than was previously the case," the 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account, asking others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay for medium and in a phone interview, she said that she believes that rabid-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in recruitment practices at Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticized the largely white, only male leader and ended their essay with a hashtag: # DeletSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Either they have no different representation of people with other skin colours in their workforce so that they can make such decisions," said the chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but are not in positions in which they feel safe or well to say what."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely left unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company publishes no figures for the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its staff, but, according to a spokesperson, the company recently hired staff responsible for focusing on underrepresented populations and on internal integration efforts.</seg>
<seg id="28">Zhu said, for its part, that she will leave her Snapchat account closed and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that is not O.K.."</seg>

<seg id="1">Military leadership falsifies ISIS intelligence information, unveiling committee of Congress</seg>
<seg id="2">Military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to mark a more optimistic image of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than it could have allowed the actual conditions on the ground, reported a committee of inquiry in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The preliminary report, created by a Task Force of the Republican members of the Armed Forces Committee, intelligence agencies, and military-related communications, reports from great discontent among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how preliminary their assessments of the American effort changed in the fight against Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, briefly Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Intelligence-based information, which was typically inspired by high-level CENTCOM commanders, regularly recorded a more positive image of the American efforts against terrorism than the actual conditions on the ground and were generally more positive than analyses of other intelligence services," a newspaper article quoted the report.</seg>
<seg id="6">"What happened to CENTCOM is unacceptable - our soldiers are suffering when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, a Republican member of the House of Representatives.</seg>
<seg id="7">The management errors in CENTCOM range up to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The 10-page report reveals detailed problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in training Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">While there is no direct evidence that government posts under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts have faced pressure from their predisposition to draw a more optimistic picture of the Islamic State's threat, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, opinions and statements before Congress were significantly more positive than the facts" set out the report.</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a CENTCOM member publicly disclosed that a military reconquest of Mossuls could start in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mossul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"After months of investigations, so much is clear." Said Mike Pompeo, Republican congressman from Kansas, in an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to mid-2015, the Central Command's peaks changed the intelligence reports to downplay the danger through ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force into life after being attributed to analysts "concerns about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while the investigation will continue.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigations by the CENTCOM reports by the Ministry of Defence's Advocate General are under way.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the intelligence committee published their own findings on Thursday, which agreed with some of the Republican Task Force's conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="19">"In the years of 2014 and 2015, CENTCOM created an overly limited process for the establishment of intelligence assessments to ISIL and Iraqi security services," said the highest-level democrat in the Chamber, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, in an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="20">That process, Mr. Schiff, "delayed the release of intelligence reports," damaged the morality among analysts and "gave overly little room for dissent."</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no indication of the White House's intervention in the CENTCOM analysts about a "certain political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">Preliminary results of the congressional inquiry were published Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon's general inspector, which were taken after complaints from CENTCOM analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lt. Cmdr Patrick Evans, a spokesman for the Pentagon, admitted in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on congressional reports, while the Chief Inspector's investigation is still under way.</seg>
<seg id="25">But he also admitted that "experts sometimes have different opinions about the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense."</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have backlash over the issue of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an allegation that is now being made by a growing number of defence ministry members).</seg>
<seg id="27">But last year's accusations have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism of obedience information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of disobedience of more than ten years ago, when a CENTCOM analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a piece of paper about how the then-government under George W. Bush, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, foreshadowed only a small occupying force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current coverage of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team set up Mr. Hooker, according to government agencies, that, contrary to the government's statements against the Islamic State-held refineries, no significant impact on the terrorist group's financial position would have been in place, as these tentative refineries would have taken place to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">That finding, however, was not published, reported the Times in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcoms, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin went to retirement in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania on, and had the first time with three years a hockey sleigh in hands (her two older sisters played the sport at the Drexel University), with 16 years she became a national player in the US, the youngest in the team's history.</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympics in 2008 as she couldn't qualify for the box.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012, where she and her team went wrong.</seg>
<seg id="15">The following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the national team and thus began to turn things to better.</seg>
<seg id="16">"A cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the working sum in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have been able to take the helm completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday night, Bam opened the torrents in the first half of the game with a backlash from the close range.</seg>
<seg id="20">India had gone into the game without a win in the tournament, but the team showed surprisingly tough and held the game from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into her hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and invited the ball to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Shutout was the first of all of the tournament for the United States, Jackie Briggs, which has so far had a gate in each of the previous games.</seg>
<seg id="24">She's got a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"We're in a good position," said Parnham, but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amid the rise of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, as late as it is, it is the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inescapable, a place of pride between competition and ambition.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning stab, which is used by the bracing protection to the turner to the triathlon.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't switch to the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour's conversation in the caffeshop, without listening to Simone Biles, Katie Leckenny or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there's Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who, for the first time at the Olympics and a women's black girl, would have been able to be among those well-known names sent to the Prime Time, built by sponsors and charity TV advertising if he would be a swimsuit, Turner or even fiery.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forrest, California, is fighting for gold in the Olympic trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shadows are the sports that are not universally accepted: Air pist shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast swimming and will continue to be there for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I should modestly make arguments for my particular love, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline jump has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it was his debut in Sydney, the last 16 years have been so embarrassed that many people, I asked, did not know that it is an Olympic sport at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">That could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the US sent athletes to compete, it has never won a medal in the trampoline game and have had an athlete until 2012, who has won it to the final.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians people to share for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jump has a certain exterior charm, partly because it suits the unenlightened ear for a clown school than the one for the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a born enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humoristic potential - the cartoonist of his never-ending stir - but also the grace of the tournament and diving, the two sports that are essentially united.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoin" comes from the Spanish El Trampolin, which means so much like "springboard."</seg>
<seg id="22">Aspiring victors jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost to 30 feet in the air and have to face a number of falling movements (turning, hay and saltos) before landing on the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">They are assessed according to the official Olympic programme of execution, level of difficulty and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two-time athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medal hoping must continue in their quest for gold, faster, up to the top and down, sometimes to the goal, sometimes to and back, to the top and bottom of the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They don't just hunt down the finishing line or the starting point, but also in the television broadcast, another hitch goal: The world or the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="28">The purposeful pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to even stir a spectator.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I think of these games as something else.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a breathing space.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she prallt from, seemingly heavy as an astronaut, goes up, then downwards, then effortlessly again.</seg>
<seg id="34">Here too, there is competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is like competition in the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="36">The women's skills and endowments will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming around 13.00 Eastern Time; those of men on Saturday, also around 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will broadcast the final hours as part of an afternoon block from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">Amid the Olympic mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in general tumbling.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the raising of consciousness can only be achieved by the anxiety and the objectification of male athletes - as the male US Turner loudly suggested to the The Wall Street Journal - then Mr Dooley expects his new fan.</seg>

<seg id="1">"A generation protest" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the US</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Protesters calling for political change in Ethiopia were at odds with the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say tens of protesters were killed during clashes with police at gunpoint.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia breaking together?</seg>
<seg id="6">Over the past decade, it has been one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But over the past few months, protests against the government rallied over the country and spread to more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed onto the streets and demanded fundamental political change.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organisations, the government's response has been unmerciless.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses said police had shot and killed on tens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">The videos that are circulating about the protests, which are probably the last or earlier this year, show how security people beat young people while they were forced to take a stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Department for Human Rights now calls for an in-depth investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services are working closely with the Ethiopians to combat terror threats beyond the region, particularly in Somalia, and only a few countries in Africa, if all, receive so much Western aid.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a remarkable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">While Ethiopia was far from being a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continued to press the government's repression - the opposition in the country has been constrained, with dissidents effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent to exile or in jail, killed or driven to the walls of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"If you suppress people and those none other options have to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole of the youth is protesting.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation is protesting.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from ground use to the stranglehold of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100% of parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions along the border with Eritrea rise; a fight for this zacky, disputed line called for hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogades National Liberation Front, which in recent years have been forced more or less, would exploit the turmoil and could be armed again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of seclusion are now exploding under the surface in the face of years.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: Smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in the last few years have many Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones have become increasingly common, and improved Internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government is blocking access to Facebook and Twitter, which she does at regular intervals, especially at protests, many people still can communicate about Internet proxies hiding where they are.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians said they gathered so to protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since Aronas, the amharas, which come from an ethnic majority of the Christian Highlands, in the politics and the economy, while exploiting the Oromos, many of which are Muslim and live in lowlands.</seg>
<seg id="37">But that too is changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"We are here to coordinate under one umbrella," said Mulasu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigridge, which account for about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, the intelligence services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr Meles, a former rebel leader, was until his death in an unpublicised disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiopia's prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say he was particularly averse to perceive early signs of dissatisfaction and use special agents to handle opponents and make them unharmed.</seg>
<seg id="45">"The current regime lacks this fundamental skill," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst.</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively opaque reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr Hailemariam arrives south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say he doesn't enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia experienced such a stir was in 2005, after thousands of elections protested, apparently concealed by the government and subsequently stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the ensuing razor, many protesters were killed, even if they were less than in the last few months, and that time the riots went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as their measurable progress in fighting poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this has not prevented the deepening of the Ethiopian Government's internal misfortunes.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, protesters in Gondar, an amorphous city, from Tigray's run, and the hate to the Tigrray are becoming more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as a base for dronenflights over the neighbouring Somalia, even though it recently shared that it has closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile area.</seg>
<seg id="59">"This," Mr Abdi said, "is a very thin grass drain."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his claim Obama had established ISIS was "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump sought to dispel the last controversy on Friday that surrounds his campaign by admitting that his repeatedly repeated claim that President Obama and Hillary Clinton would be the "founder" of the Islamic State's terrorist group would not be taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raised new questions about the communications capabilities of the Republican presidential candidate, whether he was able to communicate clearly and understand with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings together his fellow combatants, who are trying to protect him during an eventful period, in the peculiar position of declaring statements that he could not mean.</seg>
<seg id="5">Having made the suggestion at a campaign event on Wednesday night, Mr. Trump reversed in relation to the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest the president and Mrs. Clinton would have created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was the contrast to the previous day, at which Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews that he thought the accusation was entirely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radomoderator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to help to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential nominee wanted nothing of it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism is based on Mr. Trump, while he tries to steer the focus of his campaign on the economic situation because of falling demand.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump tried again to return to this issue.</seg>
<seg id="12">On Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already raised Sarkasmus to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July, he drew strong criticism when he thought the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but he later declared "Natürlich meant the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then return to change.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are taken by his fans as they arrive, and then, if necessary," said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who observes the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, I also believe that he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Rather than defuse the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more senior tone, as his poll values have continued to decline.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new poll by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, released Friday, showed a lead with great lead in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-in-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is generally trying not to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accused his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstand his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he is stepping up in the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's henchmen have brought his loyal fellow protesters into the uncomfortable situation to face him, regardless of how provocative his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent principals, gave a great deal of trouble to the candidate today in a CNN interview from Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe in what he says legitimate, political comments" said Mr. Giuliani was questioned about the accuracy of Mr. Trump's statements, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had set up the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="24">In this sense, it is true that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backbenches, utterly wrong and therefore it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as the Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread out by making it more aggressive in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="26">Ahead of the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and threw them up on each of his words and being biased against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">He exited the "poor, jemmerious" television experts who try to understand him and said, "You can't it!"</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the Democrats spotted Mr. Trump's apology as just another proof that he was unfit for the presidency.</seg>

<seg id="1">Once squeezed over price from the market, comes cafe in Greenpoint</seg>
<seg id="2">The staff were very friendly and helpful.</seg>
<seg id="3">Of course, prices from his Bedford Avenue Ladies Front have been squeezed out.</seg>
<seg id="4">The business Soap Cherie, the verb, invented in the summer of 2014, sold soap in the form of cupcakes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Indigenous mourned it as the last loss in a gentrified city.</seg>
<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is changing, but I still cannot believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel except and Verb is now a soap business."</seg>
<seg id="7">But if New York is changing, then it's also reinvention.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revived verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north from its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly narrow atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old cafe, owner and manager of the new cafe.</seg>
<seg id="12">He started working in 2001 and stayed there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When he offered a client to provide money for a new outlet, he was excited to do it, he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rodriguez, 36, spared a great deal.</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb used the same distributor for the badge bought the same espresso model.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnings like captains and sauted onions.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are nature-making.</seg>
<seg id="21">The café serves no more beer, there are fresh juices.</seg>
<seg id="22">After nine months, Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Many old customers have also been driven by prices from Williamsburg," he said.</seg>
<seg id="24">Recently on one Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.</seg>
<seg id="25">Oliveira, 34, lived in Williamsburg earlier.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after she was pulled to Greenpoint, she would take the path.</seg>
<seg id="27">After the verb had closed, they gave up the coffee rings a while, she said.</seg>
<seg id="28">"I became clear that it was in the coffee and in the culture in the verb that I liked," she said.</seg>
<seg id="29">Now she's drinking again coffee, even if she ordered a pencil Chai Tea on that day instead of her usual Iced Caffee.</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Rosenthal has been another longtime and loyal customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="31">He went there before the job and always ordered him to die.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I came out of quarter after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket clock and they prepare my Everything Bagel with butter," he said.</seg>
<seg id="33">Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and include new ingredients in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nowadays, Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his Everything Bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.</seg>
<seg id="35">Rodriguez said he did not agree that the soap business has taken the old business room.</seg>
<seg id="36">In fact, the owner of the Soap Cherie offered a special soap for verb with the coffee of coffee as a ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="37">"I think we're going to go back to their offer," Rodriguez said.</seg>
<seg id="38">And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoints have also accepted the cafe.</seg>
<seg id="39">A new customer has translated the menu into the Polish and Rodriguez said he had pretending to put it soon so that his new neighbours feel welcome.</seg>
<seg id="40">The location also has further advantages.</seg>
<seg id="41">A local juice locally wants to fill and sell cold-fried coffee.</seg>
<seg id="42">There is a chance that the cafe will expand to a neighbouring building.</seg>
<seg id="43">For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favourites.</seg>
<seg id="44">Joseph Witt was tribal and said he was destroyed on the ground when the cafe closed.</seg>
<seg id="45">When the new cafe opened, Whitt said that the subject of the locomotive and the bearer was feeling a new coffee as a home return.</seg>

<seg id="1">The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a plentiful meal"</seg>
<seg id="2">In March 1933, shortly after his ascent to the president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch in the Oval Office.</seg>
<seg id="3">As a gourmets, President Roosevelt had a facile for refined delicatessen of Fifth Avenue like Pâte de fosie gras and Maryland Wassschlusdze.</seg>
<seg id="4">His menu on that day was slightly more modest: Stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, potato peree and as dessert a plank pudding.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It was an act of culinary solidarity with leaning people," Jane Ziegelman said.</seg>
<seg id="6">Her husband Andrew Cue added, "It was also a message to Americans how they should eat."</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">Coes last book "Tritate Suey" was made by Chinese cuisine in the US, while Ziegelman was told in her book "97 Orchard" about life in a residential house at the Lower East Side from the food perspective.</seg>
<seg id="9">Her latest collaboration, "A decent meal," which will appear in the Harper publisher on Tuesday, illustrates the story of American cuisine during the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="10">They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter in the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, snowy-like snack at the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive beans, while Coe, 57, turtle with potato peel and vegetable mixture.</seg>
<seg id="12">When the reporter ordered Hackrates, this found the pair fit for a discussion about eating in the era of the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Rich food was very popular," said Ziegelman.</seg>
<seg id="14">There was groundbread, liver cheese and bread.</seg>
<seg id="15">They were made of a ingredient and something cheaper that stretched the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine so many of the things they eat as dinners.</seg>
<seg id="17">Cue grinste.</seg>
<seg id="18">"It has to be in the stomach like lead," he said.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an all-you-Can-eat buffet.</seg>
<seg id="20">Teams of women cooks for male fellows and it was served freshly baked pasta for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Americans sent food to hungry Europeans during the first war.</seg>
<seg id="22">"It was a time when eating for Americans became a central, tense theme," said Cue, why he and his wife wanted to write about it.</seg>
<seg id="23">The new budget diet was just as tense: Mysterious foods such as bread and caskerolen were made to be used as a staple ingredient, the caskeroles as a "wonderful way to recover," said Ziegelman, as chefs were able to hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meat, which has been the focus of American cuisine for years, became a rare serving luxury.</seg>
<seg id="26">Strange mixtures have been tried, as a calorie rich and nutritious satisfaction had priority over flavour or even healthy cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="27">During her search for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a court dating from this era, baked onions with earthbuds.</seg>
<seg id="28">"It wasn't a popular addition to lunch," says Coe.</seg>
<seg id="29">Ziegelmann continues: "It was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Earthbuds and baked onions do not fit each other.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the housekeeping recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">As never before or since then, fiscal economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 to 1943 - fueled the country's eating habits.</seg>
<seg id="33">By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "budgetary politicians" and to respond to the challenge of turning pampes like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.</seg>
<seg id="34">"A Square Meal" is a festival of historic Lectures.</seg>
<seg id="35">In particular, the reports on the government's response to starving citizens are tasty, as President Herbert Hoover's laughter-eating attitude.</seg>
<seg id="36">While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse of his kitchen, he feeds like the millionaire man of the world to which he has become.</seg>
<seg id="37">"He mocks Continental cuisine like fish with cucumber," Coe said.</seg>
<seg id="38">He sat in an almost bursting dining room and wore a smoking.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was wonderfully alien.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if not his wife Eleanor had asked him to declare an expel.</seg>
<seg id="41">As described in the book, the Antheus of a housekeeper with no interest in flavours by Mrs Roosevelt said that the White House produced the most boring meal in Washington, but also one of the most expensive. "</seg>
<seg id="42">Many of the species from the era of the Great Depression, dealing with eating, was discarded once the country came back to the legs.</seg>
<seg id="43">The legacy lies on our continued focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as how science was applied to food.</seg>
<seg id="44">The couple gave birth to the eating habits of Ziegelmans Sheriff's mother, for example as she couldn't throw away food.</seg>
<seg id="45">"She had a real fear of wasting food," Coe said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland shark: The oldest cyclist is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland sharks mostly come to the surface in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed back to the sea following an investigation aboard the Sanna research vessel.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and was floating a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland sharks only get back to 150 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the middle of the North Atlantic, in an hour, it is only 1,220 meters long.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it comes to speed, the five-metre-long animal speeds up to satch 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, this style of longevity seems to be a recipe for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" in any case by a Greenland shark that could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Madness," commented Alexander Schemmelein from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock, which means a world record for vertebrate animals.</seg>
<seg id="12">While the evolutionary biologist suspected that Greenland sharks become stealing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence failed.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland sharks are hard to observe, after all, they live in the icesea above the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of the Greenland sharks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her pace of timing, when they announced six animals with a station before Spitsbergen-altitude peaks.</seg>
<seg id="18">Prey to this sharks nonetheless: In the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had adorned the jaw bone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">They may hunt sleeping animals or patrol on the grounds of the icemether and seek cadavers, which are down from higher water threats downwards.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now investigated 28 Greenland sharks, fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Spitsbergen as a lead from the depths of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long, while the biggest 502 centimetre was measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">To identify the age of the animals, they analyzed the life of sharks with the carbon 14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This center of the eye line already emerges before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein are not renewed later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had fallen down a lot of carbon-14 in the lens.</seg>
<seg id="25">Her birth should therefore be after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons were experimenting with larger quantities of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the third-smallest animal of 220 centimetres in length, the Linsect, on the other hand, included a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons trials, which is expected to celebrate its 50th anniversary in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All the larger Greenland sharks, by contrast, had normal carbon-14 volumes in their lens, resulting from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14-clock showed for a 493 centimeter long Greenland shark an age of 335, while the record shark with 502 centimetres was likely to be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland shark whites only get offspring when they are longer than four metres was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now researchers were able to assign an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">As one of the animals with 392 centimetres is arguably on the threshold of gender maturity, and its age was determined by 156 years, it is obvious that Greenland sharks, with the multiplication, are leaving at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such meteoraleme is mostly living in icy waters is no accident.</seg>
<seg id="34">Even the previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale, in whose bacon at Nocks a 120-year-old Harpunt tip, was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the animal's body often runs on a flat.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and ageing slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to stay warm in cold water, the animals are often particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, by which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much larger than a gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: They have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"A smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many offspring as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist.</seg>
<seg id="42">A very large animal should instead invest its resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="1">Frankfurt benefits from Brexit</seg>
<seg id="2">The City of the Main, therefore, in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg, has the best chance of attracting from London's jobs and companies.</seg>
<seg id="3">"It is very likely that Frankfurt is most likely to benefit from the Brexit vote," says Michael Voigtländer, head of the sphere of the financial markets and real estate markets of the IW.</seg>
<seg id="4">After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether financial firms should continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU.</seg>
<seg id="5">For the so-called EU passport, they are now available in Britain.</seg>
<seg id="6">These are just large US banks.</seg>
<seg id="7">Several banks have already announced to relocate jobs.</seg>
<seg id="8">The "Frankfurt Main Finance" lobby covers the next five years with a total of 10000 new jobs.</seg>
<seg id="9">For Frankfurt, the IW, it is the seat of the European Central Bank (ECB), which combines responsibility for monetary policy and oversight of the eurozone's largest banks, as well as other important authorities such as the EIOPA and the ESRB.</seg>
<seg id="10">In Paris, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), although it has its headquarters, is less important for the financial industry than the ECB.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Proximity to the central bank is important for banks, as they can communicate so directly with oversight," says IW professor Voigtländer.</seg>
<seg id="12">Luxembourg is home to a large fund industry, but as well as Dublin infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">Frankfurt is easily accessible thanks to the large airport.</seg>
<seg id="14">In addition, the city with easily available commercial properties.</seg>
<seg id="15">"In Paris, it's not so easy to find free high-quality offices," says Voigtlaender.</seg>
<seg id="16">In addition, in the Seine, rents for first-class commercial goods are 50% higher than on the Main.</seg>
<seg id="17">Furthermore, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime.</seg>
<seg id="18">In a ranking of the company's consultancy Mercer, the city is ranked seven, Luxembourg on Square 19, Dublin on Place 33 and Paris at 37.</seg>
<seg id="19">Although quality of life is a matter of preferences: "With its already strong position as a financial base for the European internal market, Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors," says the IW.</seg>
<seg id="20">But, despite Brexit's vote, London will remain the main financial centre in Europe, my economic researchers.</seg>
<seg id="21">According to the figures of the Landesbank Helaba, around 144,000 people in the banking sector worked in London in late 2015.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton earns 10.75 million in 2015 and figures 34.2% federal taxes</seg>
<seg id="2">Hillary Clinton released her tax returns for 2015 on Friday, which found a $10.75 million income of $10.75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.</seg>
<seg id="3">In 2015, Clinton donated $1 million for charitable purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton generated nearly $5.3 million in redeonoraries; the former secretary of State gave an income of USD 3 million from the publisher Simon & Schuster for her book about her tenure at the Foreign Ministry.</seg>
<seg id="4">Clinton's candidate for the vice-president, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, shared his tax returns over the past decade with his wife Anne Holton.</seg>
<seg id="5">They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency," Clinton's campaign manager Jennifer Palmieri announced in an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a stark contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and backbenchers on his previous promises to release his tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is customary for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, even though they are not obliged to do so.</seg>
<seg id="9">Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have indicated a tax check by tax authorities as a reason for refusing to do so.</seg>
<seg id="10">"They're on the train," wrote Clinton's campaign heroine Ian Sams on Twitter, citing the Democratic nominee's release.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's special adviser, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish something before the tax exams were not completed.</seg>
<seg id="12">Trump's critics, including the Republican presidential candidate in 2012 Mitt Romney, have already conceded that his refusal raises questions about assets, his donations for charitable organizations, his business and various other ties, particularly with Russia.</seg>
<seg id="13">Clinton has already jumped on the subject and released a video on the internet on Friday, in the senior, in the senior, urging Trump to release his tax statement.</seg>
<seg id="14">On Thursday, she also addressed the issue during a speech on the economy in Michigan.</seg>
<seg id="15">"He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done over the last few decades and to publish his tax returns," she said to the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="16">Politico has reported that Trump did not pay any or only very little taxes during the 1990 "s for two years, and an economic journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax earners and tax advisers on Friday, saying that might still be the case.</seg>
<seg id="17">Federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="18">Clinton supports a scheme named after the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that those more than $1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="19">President Obama also supports the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="20">During a campaign event for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska called Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate here has his seat here to exchange Trump for a meeting on their tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="21">Buffett said he was also subjected to a tax review of the IRS and Trump had "fear" before voters and not before the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="22">Clinton's campaign has published tax returns until 2007.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Clintons, who are now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid an effective federal tax rate of around 32 per cent between 2007-2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Clinton Tax Statement of 2015 showed that these only $100 of their income as a reward, unlike most Americans.</seg>
<seg id="25">Its main success was a cost-effective index fund, from which the Clinton's dividend and yields were to $109,000.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media review after he had betrayed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had not listed any Israeli pre-election, as Arab guests had "requested" according to an employee. "</seg>
<seg id="3">Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah," gave his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.</seg>

<seg id="5">However, the country was not listed among the countries that could be called directly from the hotel room.</seg>
<seg id="6">How is it possible in the year 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and destroyed?</seg>
<seg id="7">Lanzmann wrote.</seg>
<seg id="8">Instead, the Kempinksi Bristol offers a way to choose Israel through its own Call Center.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to a statement, the director turned to the hotel reception.</seg>
<seg id="10">The answer he received there, "shock him," as Lanzmann wrote.</seg>

<seg id="12">The reason behind it was even more fury in the director.</seg>
<seg id="13">"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre-election be deleted," said Lanzmann's employee.</seg>

<seg id="6">For the rest of the world there was a special children's pass.</seg>
<seg id="7">The third trip led to Pforzheim.</seg>
<seg id="8">At the Keltenmuseum in Hochdorf, the group learned a lot about everyday life and food.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Ministry of Justice Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna was on the road on a four-day pilgrimage to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Together, four steps have been taken.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to keep the time until the next morning tour of all the ministries in question, the St. Anna Board of Governors decided to prepare and conduct a multi-day pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various pilgrimage destinations were examined and one decided in the end to the bishops town of Freiburg, where in this year's Holy Year, a special pilgrimage goal was offered to the Holy Year of Mercience.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis from Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Heiligroom made their way on the road.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening, pastor storeroed the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, segregated the pitchers and awarded the pilgrims.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb it was driven by train to the starting point of Villingen, where there was a Munster of Unser Lieben, who was called the pilgrims' path.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the morning and evening, the individual tapestries were surrounded by a short impulse with different prayers, songs and texts.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way, the Minis in field crosses, chapels, or churches repeatedly moved to sing a song from a specially assembled pitcher.</seg>
<seg id="11">For the nights, the local parish churches were available.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the stage goals, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller designed a tasty and enhanced dinner and breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the second day, Haiger went to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">The road to St. Peter, which was the busiest route, had to be climbed by 500 meters of altitude.</seg>
<seg id="15">The deserved reward was a common barbecue on the bathroom.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning eruption on the fourth pilgrim day in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, it went to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="17">Clearly relieved and happy, the Minis met at the Freiburger Münster in the later afternoon and went through the gates of mercy.</seg>
<seg id="18">With a small impulse, God has thanked God.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the evening show in the Munster, the Minis of Cooperator Markus Obert was welcomed.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the worship, pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.</seg>
<seg id="21">The next day was still time for the road map.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the afternoon it went to Horb.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the end, all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong Community experience were marked.</seg>

<seg id="1">Schotte Callum Skinner stormed home, as Brite Gold spends on cycling</seg>
<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner last night in the men's team sprint in the Velodrome in Rio to fame when the British team defended the London 2012 title.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made to Evil.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory over four years, while Hoy took the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after taking a modest sixth place in March, despite the resignation of Hoys, in March.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did so in time as a Hindu.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoy's retirement generated a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton sought to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man where she stayed when she saw potential in the Scots that has now emerged.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hinder, Kenny - who scored four years ago with Hoy winner - and Skinner set up an Olympiarek in the qualification rounds, but in the standings the New Zealand won in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duell with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hinder was barely back after his round, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a big part of the transformation, in which Hindes drove in a higher gear to slow it down and to allow Kenny and, above all, Skinner keep pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked out of his position as a BBC expert and dropped Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they climbed to the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said: "It's a scary comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up an Olympiarek and beat the world champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was simply incredible.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the 2012 triumph to the side of Kenys and Hoys, Hinder admitted that after a weak start, he deliberately fell to the train.</seg>
<seg id="21">He moved that statement later and there was no objection from England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">This time, this time, this is no such problem.</seg>
<seg id="23">Hindes said: "It feels with the whole GB flags on the grandstand like London."</seg>
<seg id="24">We have met in the last three months as a team.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have been so bad for so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">That is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which has won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If that's a barometer of our progress over the past five months, we expect successful five days in the Velodrom.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form Kennys, it's in the area of the possible that he's repeated Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a contest.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (an apparently holy date for British sport; on the day also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - mean an outages of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same from Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the sprint that starts today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I enjoy this only for the moment."</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels something lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">Hindes said: "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the Ritter."</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal contest of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-four-mile race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They came in 3: 51,942 on goal.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, winning gold in London in 2012, was at 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the contest, where Wiggins will certainly be focused.</seg>
<seg id="42">He had met with officers before qualification yesterday, when officials called themselves to measure his body size.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding female competition, which will continue tomorrow and finish tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in Weltrek time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team is relying on its strong train cycling team to dominate the mid-term period of the Olympics and to catch a bowl of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly extraordinary portrayal of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio were down.</seg>
<seg id="46">Dramas played out in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April amid sex and implosion allegations as well as the retirement of sizes like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if you look at the first night of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks like the now legendary name GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, will again be repeated.</seg>

<seg id="1">Future of Portland smashed due to repeal of the Energy Treaty</seg>
<seg id="2">The future of Portland's aluminium melts in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs from workers - are at stake, as the plant operator cancels the energy supply contract and will thus lift all the delivery contracts, as the energy company supplied.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed the government's decision in Victoria earlier this year not to grant further subsidies to operate the facility.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy for 20 years expires in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">Less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">Moreover, it could result in domino effects, as the meltdown consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity generation.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014, Alcoa closed Point Henry, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power station last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">The meltdown of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This follows years of speculation about the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and, last but not least, the electricity price.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the large aluminium meltdown with its Loy Yang A Power Plant in Latrobe Valley, said that three other owners will terminate their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The facility is in the majority possession of a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp maintain smaller shares.</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the port will continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity through the meltdown," the company shared.</seg>
<seg id="14">AGL continued to say that the contracts were so-called "safeguards" to enter into force from November 2016.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Treaties have a 12-month notice period, so they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Therefore, AGL assumes that the Treaties will contribute 17 to the revenue in fiscal year," the electricity supplier said.</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential effects on the revenue to AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the projections of the strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL announced that it had already written off the value of the contracts in its $187 million contract in "expectation of a termination."</seg>
<seg id="19">Alcoa said that the decision to book the contracts, the "ability of alcoas... to run the meltdown or to guarantee the power supply to the meltdown" does not affect it.</seg>
<seg id="20">The US company said it had completed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, who should have entered into force from November this year, even though it is still guilty of why it resigned from the Treaty.</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts are warning about the poor economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Portland meltdown in Victoria and the Tomago facility near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">Referring to the analysts' statements earlier this week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said Portland spends about 600 megawatts annually and Tomago consumes about 900 megawatts of electricity.</seg>
<seg id="23">Should both plants disappear from the market, it would mean a significant reduction in demand for the [electricity market].</seg>
<seg id="24">And for us as an electricity producer, that would not be good, "he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the Vogue's September edition</seg>
<seg id="2">Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of Kardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted september edition of the U.S. Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kendall, who is the trademark ambassador of Estee Lauder, and ran at Fashion Week in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on their Instagram account on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">"In a room full of people I love, brought me the sight of this covers to the wine," Kendall wrote.</seg>
<seg id="5">The cover of the Covers followed a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashian a similar?), scanned reality video that shows the whole Kardashian-Jenner family (except for the problems Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the most popular showbiz onkels and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as they forget the cover of their sister and ending it with a classic twist: They have all planned a surprise story.</seg>
<seg id="6">This makes the bar-treated act almost every birthday episode of a children's release (Seacrest brought the sentence, "Du damit that we would forget you?" With the honesty of a cartoon chanting on a broadcast at 8 a.m. in the morning), but Kris had to somehow let her other girls take part in this publicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of Kardashians has certainly begun.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendalls big sister Kim may have beaten her what the Vogue cover has been, (she and her husband Kanye West were to see it in April 2014), but the cover of the September edition of the magazine is a league for itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September edition is the most sold edition of the year.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a degree similar to a photo tape than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista were 615 pages of advertising).</seg>
<seg id="11">The revelation of his co-star is eagerly awaited, that in the last two years, images of the journal are still under the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women already on the cover included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">Over the past few years, clearly, more were "celebrity queues, which mocks" as "Models that are celebrities" on the cover.</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar prize winner and Dior trademark ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honour.</seg>
<seg id="15">But even at the low chance that Ms. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "muddle" of her generation - falls under the previous category, she is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers of today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even if everything is right).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who are pictured in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had made the release of lemonade one of the most successful years of her career.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course, Jenner's success doesn't everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With her reality TV story, Jenner's position in the fashion world has always been somewhat tense.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June, the one-time Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticised them and called them "the lips of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">Those feelings sounded again high when the news came out with the appearance of Jenner on the Vogue Cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But it seems to me that the point is to go on.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">She's in the truest sense of the word a supermodel.</seg>
<seg id="26">She runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">She makes advertising for your Grande Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">They and all their sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.</seg>
<seg id="29">She sold by her made pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to the journal LOVE.</seg>
<seg id="30">And in her spare time she is in reality TV, presumably only to see her sister Kourtney and their children.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community centres show 160,000 people each year</seg>
<seg id="2">More than 160,000 of the country's most vulnerable countries are being dismissed from community centres each year, while the industry is considering the impact of further reductions on already overburdened transactions.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly elderly people, immigrants, refugees, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who have no means of unjust delogations and similar - will be dismissed when they seek free legal advice and legal advice.</seg>
<seg id="4">Legal services of the community, which have already been overworked, are ready for further cuts.</seg>
<seg id="5">As of June next year, these legal centres will lose another 30 per cent of their federal funding.</seg>
<seg id="6">Queesland's chief executive of Queesland James Farrell said the latest survey by the National Association of Communities Centres found that thousands of people are already being dismissed every year.</seg>
<seg id="7">Farrell said the situation would only be even worse without a repeal of the federal government decision.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Queensland's community centres are chronically underfunded, meaning that thousands of people will be dismissed from key services you need," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">People who leave violent relations, people with inconspicuous and irrefutable debts, families who go through divisions, workers who were unfairly dismissed - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need.</seg>
<seg id="10">The federal government will cut funds by 30 percent from June 2017, meaning that thousands of more vulnerable people from Queensland will be forced to deal with their legal problems without any help.</seg>
<seg id="11">We are calling on the Attorney-General, Federal Justice and Defence Minister and Senators of Queensland George Brandis to lift these funds immediately, so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems.</seg>
<seg id="12">Last year, the state government met its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance on the national average.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is now time to look at the needs of community centres and their customers, and to invest in this important work by the Palaszczuk government.</seg>

<seg id="2">New York: Donald Trump's campaign has been indicted for alleged inaction after it was told that her campaign leader for North Carolina in February put a gunshot on a staff while driving in February in a jeep.</seg>
<seg id="3">The incident is described in an indictment filed Wednesday at Charlotte's national court by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in that state.</seg>
<seg id="4">Bordini admitted to have waited months for the matter to be settled internally before reinventing that "that wouldn't happen."</seg>
<seg id="5">The campaign leader, Earl Philip, "drew a pistol, put his right-hand finger on the withdrawal, and rammed the run in Vincents Knikehill," gave Bordini in his indictment.</seg>
<seg id="6">Having complained to the local and regional campaign management, Bordini noted that at least four more people had already made the same experience with Phillip.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Weapons don't have to be fired to cause damage," said Bordini.</seg>
<seg id="8">The indictment comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate sparked a stir when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment people" - gungun owners and gun fans - should take measures if his rival Hillary Clinton were elected and judges appointed.</seg>
<seg id="9">Trump's campaign made it clear that the media would have torn his words out of context and that he would not incite violence.</seg>
<seg id="10">Monday's complaint claims damages caused by the campaign for breach of due diligence and from Philip for bodily harm and sustained psychological damage.</seg>
<seg id="11">Trump's press spokesman Hope Hicks was unable to reach an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="12">Try to contact Philip as well.</seg>
<seg id="13">WCCB, a local news outlet in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer staff of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="14">Calls to his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, did not respond.</seg>
<seg id="15">Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has so far led a controversial campaign.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the forthcoming elections in the Bundesländer Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September), significant losses are recorded for the government parties SPD and CDU.</seg>
<seg id="3">This gave representative surveys of opinion research institute INSA for the "Bild" Zeitung (Friday).</seg>
<seg id="4">While the red-black government coalition could continue to rule in the North, this is not possible in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="5">In both federal states, the SPD would be the strongest party, and would thus have a good chance of continuing to hold the head of government.</seg>
<seg id="6">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD crashed from 35.6 percent over five years to 24 percent.</seg>
<seg id="7">The party, according to the survey, would only be close to the CDU, which could come back to 23 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">The third place is controversial between the Left and the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Left would be down 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the country's day.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Greens have been reluctant to return to the Schwerin farm day despite a slight loss of 6 percent (previously 8.7 percent).</seg>
<seg id="11">NPD and FDP would not be represented with 3 percent in the land day.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the Berlin Chamber of Labour, the survey showed that only 23% (election 2011: 28.3%) would be the SPD of the poll.</seg>
<seg id="13">The CDU only reached 18 percent after 23.4 percent.</seg>
<seg id="14">They would still be behind the Greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6%), but before the left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).</seg>
<seg id="15">The AfD would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the Chamber of Deputies.</seg>
<seg id="16">By 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, but the Pirates would miss the move, unlike 2011.</seg>

<seg id="2">E-mail and internet in timeline: 20 years ago, the Nokia Communicator came to the market.</seg>
<seg id="3">The successors today dominate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The device wog up nearly half kilograms and was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was thick and bigger, so it was not good enough.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was quite patchy.</seg>
<seg id="7">The built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which would be enough for roughly two selfires today.</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" arrived exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, into the shops - and it was the first smartphone.</seg>
<seg id="10">For a few euros, lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet, but they are somehow out of the start of the internet age.</seg>
<seg id="11">20 years ago, however, the Communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier on the computer fair Cebit in Hannover as a "office in the Western Enthusiasm."</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the new mobile phone was able to send and receive SMS and e-mails, even by fax.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even access to web pages was possible via HTML browser, albeit slowly.</seg>
<seg id="15">A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna, and the phone could be folded similar to a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then there was a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was quite proud of the price: 2700 D-Mark, about 1400 euros.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">No one could see in August 1996 that the Communicator would become the start of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since then, everything has changed.</seg>
<seg id="22">The smart phones are a success story, if not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Finns' cell phone sparse experienced an unprecedented disaster, eventually sold to Microsoft and managed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The market is dominating today, all of which came a lot later than Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="25">Always online, that is today for a lot of people.</seg>
<seg id="26">In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="27">Some 1.4 billion devices, Samsung and Apple account for 555 million.</seg>
<seg id="28">The worldwide turnover of the equipment is around EUR 400 billion.</seg>
<seg id="29">This includes the well-running shops of the countless app-provider and telecommunications companies.</seg>
<seg id="30">Around the smartphone is now a whole industry.</seg>
<seg id="31">The decisive breakthrough in the mass market came only in early 2007, at that time, Apple's chief executive Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhones on the Mac World.</seg>
<seg id="32">He promised three devices in one: A music player, a phone and an internet communicator, all by touch screen easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="33">Apple's victory, yet today the iPhone is the main product of the Group.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who dominated the market, had the afterthought.</seg>
<seg id="35">She eventually disappeared, Blackberry got to fight.</seg>
<seg id="36">The seed now has Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung.</seg>
<seg id="37">The smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention.</seg>
<seg id="38">Today, on average, every German now looks at his mobile phone 88 times a day.</seg>
<seg id="39">"We must all learn to get the smartphone away," said Janina Kugel, in the Siemens Executive Board for Personal Information.</seg>
<seg id="40">Permanent accessibility is now considered as a curse and a blessing.</seg>

<seg id="6">For our local communities, we will already have 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.</seg>
<seg id="7">Just as they were ahead of us in London in 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of the enlargement of Heathroads is too big.</seg>
<seg id="8">I have been told that England will never be ready for the Games and that we will be blaming ourselves on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers each asked question.</seg>
<seg id="11">Like the Olympics, Heathrow is for many and not a infrastructure project.</seg>
<seg id="12">Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211bn of good growth and a legacy of skills and employment both to the airport and to the whole of GB.</seg>
<seg id="13">We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion infrastructure investment programme in the time and budget, from the T5 - which was chosen as the world's best airport terminal for five years - to the T2, which was built in the middle of the world's two most frequented career.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now they are ready to deliver a third run, which is backed by £16 billion in private investment.</seg>
<seg id="15">The 2012 London Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that Heathrow's enlargement will also be one.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is time for us to steer this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, secure our future trade, and create a legacy of skills and employment to which England can be proud.</seg>

<seg id="1">Adblock Plus, Facebook in the "Katz-and Mehel" about ad blocking</seg>
<seg id="2">For companies that are making money with online advertising, one of the software manufacturers tries to circumvent the ad blocking system, a "cat and mouse game."</seg>
<seg id="3">On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block display lockouts on its desktop side, released Adblock Plus posted a blogpost, noting that users could update their filters in the program to block again advertising in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Tuesday, Facebook shared that its desktop side would change coding as regards its advertising show, to make it more difficult to identify which part of the site is advertising.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that it found a new way to circumvent the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">In a blogpost, Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of Hin-and-Her fight between the Anzealous Open Source community and the reunions has already been underway since the invention of display lookers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fact that the world's biggest social media company has been in the fight is a strong indication of how worrying the industry has become.</seg>
<seg id="8">Worldwide, according to a study from the last year of Pagefair and Adobe about 200 million people ad loosers; almost four times so much in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="9">With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile advertising makes up 84 percent of advertising revenue.</seg>
<seg id="10">The company has it on display blockages on Desktop PCs, as mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebooks mobile app for the social network and Instagram, shared a spokesman.</seg>
<seg id="11">Advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficient large share of revenue, so Facebook makes the investment of such a step as rewarding.</seg>
<seg id="12">On Tuesday, Facebook shared that it would update its "display reference tool" to have people more control over their targeted advertising.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblocks would be worrying about new filters because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising.</seg>
<seg id="14">"For users, this is not a positive experience, so we plan to address the problem," shared a spokesman for Facebook in an email message.</seg>
<seg id="15">Ad blockers are a stunned tool, which is why we have focused instead on developing tools such as ad Preferences to put more control into people's hands.</seg>

<seg id="1">Woman overrides on Swiss highway</seg>
<seg id="2">The victim was in the middle of the night on the highway.</seg>
<seg id="3">Police are calling for witnesses after a woman was overturned on a highway in the early hours of Thursday at a suspected suicide of several vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incident happened on the A1 in the vicinity of Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.</seg>
<seg id="5">A woman placed himself in the dark "in an act of desperation" on the street and was hit by several cars, police said in Vaud.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is obvious that a silence in the age of 49, which was overturned by several vehicles, including a load car, wanted to kill himself.</seg>
<seg id="7">She still died on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="8">Several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, said police urging them and any witnesses of the incident to report.</seg>
<seg id="9">It has opened an investigation procedure, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, shared Gilles Hofstetter to Le Tribune de Geneve.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="11">Was a clash avoidable?</seg>
<seg id="12">That's something the prosecutor has to decide, "Hofstetter said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Two similar cases over the past five years show drivers will not be held responsible.</seg>
<seg id="14">In each of the two cases - where one person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that motorists should not assume that a pedestrian was on the motorway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper said.</seg>
<seg id="15">Last year, a policeman was acquitted of the negligent killing after driving a man and killed, who was in August 2014 a night on the A1 near Payerne.</seg>
<seg id="16">The 22-year-old victim had drunk and has been left unconscious on the street.</seg>
<seg id="17">The court found that the policeman -- who had responded to a emergency call -- drove on a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a "perfectly exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.</seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone who has further information on the incident on Thursday in the vicinity of Morges should report to police under the case number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.</seg>

<seg id="1">NASA climate model: Venus was once resident</seg>
<seg id="2">According to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably resident.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have raised once similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, erdged-like atmosphere and yet slowly turned on.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably has more dry areas than de Earth, but had previously enough water and geographical variability to house life and protect against faster evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun, which was 30 percent matter.</seg>
<seg id="10">"In the Giss model simulation, the slow rotation of the Venus exits their daily side of the sun for nearly two months," said Gisas's scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warmed the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which looks like a rainscreen to shield the surface from much of the sunrise.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are a few degrees cooler than that of Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought up a history of Venus, which resembles the evolution previously suspected by planetary researchers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although she was probably resident, Venus -- over the course of several billion years --was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapour was burned away from the ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As her Hydrogen entwarted, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained behind a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know today.</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model at the Geophysical Research Letters.</seg>

<seg id="2">Patrick Roy resigned as coach and vice president Of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, leading to too little co-determination in the team's decision-making process.</seg>
<seg id="3">Alternatively-President / General Manager of Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the club will be looking for a new coach immediately.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Over the past three years, I have met my duties as chief trainer and Vice President Of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and honesty," the 50-year-old Roy said in an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="5">Over the summer I have been thinking a lot about how I could improve this team to give him more depth, that it needs and to bring it to a higher level.</seg>
<seg id="6">To achieve this, the vision of the trainer and vice president of hockey operations needs to be perfectly aligned to the organisation.</seg>
<seg id="7">He must also have a right of co-determination in decisions that influence the team's performance.</seg>
<seg id="8">These conditions are not currently being met.</seg>
<seg id="9">Sakic, who had hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Patrick has informed me today about this decision," Sakic said.</seg>
<seg id="11">We value all that he has done for our organisation and wish him the best for the future.</seg>
<seg id="12">Roy became the winner of the League's best coach during his debut season at the Avalanche in 2013-14.</seg>
<seg id="13">He led the club to 112 points and on the first place in Central Vision, but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the Playoffs of Minnesota and missed out in each of the last two years the afterseason.</seg>

<seg id="2">Labor battles over pay for North Sea oil workers will be suspended, while all the armed forces are campaigning for a new round of talks, negotiators said.</seg>
<seg id="3">Strikes against the oil field provider Wood Group have been conducted sporadically on platforms in the North Sea, operated by Royal Dutch Shell.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Wood Group as well as the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of the current dispute," says a joint statement.</seg>
<seg id="5">We will hold a few full-day sessions in the next few weeks, starting early next year to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="6">The unions said their last strike, which is the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible pay cuts of up to 30 percent.</seg>
<seg id="7">Wood Group has cut the rates to its counter-operations in the North Sea by about 9 percent this year due to negative market pressure.</seg>
<seg id="8">The company's clearance rate follows a 10-result decrease for onshore contractors in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="9">The company said additional cuts will give the company the required space to get through the market downturn.</seg>
<seg id="10">Shell has dismissed for its part of thousands of people and has announced plans to abandon its oil and gas activities in up to 10 countries, as it rationalises its business activities as a result of its mega-merger with the UK energy company BG Group.</seg>
<seg id="11">Energy companies are under pressure because of lower crude oil prices, an economic situation that had intensified by the British decision in June to leave the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers gather the most complete catalogue of rotation rates among the stars of the startling of the plejades.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data help astronomers understand why stars are rotated in the star clusters as well as in the context of rotation periods.</seg>
<seg id="4">"We hope that by comparing our results with other starches, more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his age and even history of his solar system," said Luisa Rekull, a researcher at the Caltech's infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The star of the plejades lies 445 light years from Earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this starry, which emerged about 125 million years ago, now reach the adult age.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now turning to the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">At peak rotation rates, these mature stars emit large amounts of star winds.</seg>
<seg id="9">As these winds travel through the star's magnetic fields, they have a brake effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">When a star is ageing, its rotation rate begins to slow down.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measured the rotational rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star dome -- such as sunglasses --.</seg>
<seg id="12">The latest catalogue of rotation rates suggests that more massive stars are slower than less massive stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rethull compares the stars with dancers, with larger stars slower pirouts turn up as smaller ones.</seg>
<seg id="14">"In the" Ballet "of plejacks, we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, while more rapid rotors tend to be very bright stars," Reull said.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is the ideal cosmopolitan laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The star shooting of the plejades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," Reull said.</seg>
<seg id="17">There is still a lot of things we would like to know more about, how the How, When and Why Stars slow their rotation rates and hang their "dance shoes."</seg>
<seg id="18">Rethull and her colleagues have extensively reported in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the plejades that will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.</seg>

<seg id="1">A controversial baseball star enters</seg>
<seg id="2">The tears ran at Alex Rodriguez faster than the US baseball star in best days from Base to Base.</seg>
<seg id="3">After his emotional resignation announcement, the 41-year-old professional on August 12 against the Tampa Bay Rays will be wearing a last-minute tribute to his New York Yankees.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I love this game and this team."</seg>
<seg id="5">"I say 'Goodbye'," explained Major League Baseball's 14-and-one All-Star Game contestants.</seg>
<seg id="6">Three times, Rodriguez was elected to the league's most valuable player, in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees.</seg>
<seg id="7">His signature under a ten-year contract awarded him $27 million a year since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="8">Until the end of the contract on December 31, 2017, he will act as an advisor and youth coach - in full salary.</seg>
<seg id="9">As players, Rodriguez paid back a long time with performance.</seg>
<seg id="10">With 696 homerus, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("Runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and since 2005 the Yankees gave him some milestones.</seg>
<seg id="11">With the Hall-of-Fame member Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two other baseball players in the main statistics show similar values.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, the 41-year-old is not likely to be included in baseball's fame.</seg>
<seg id="13">Because so successfully Rodriguez - nicknamed "A-Rod" - was on the field, so controversial is his appearance outside the place.</seg>
<seg id="14">Already in 2009, the superstar was admitted to "ESPN" between 2001 and 2003.</seg>
<seg id="15">In August 2013, he was blocked for 211 games due to a development in the so-called Biogenesis scandal.</seg>
<seg id="16">Rodriguez is considered to be the main suspect to have received performance-enhancing funds for years over an anti-aging clinic in South Florida.</seg>
<seg id="17">After a lawsuit, the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The league could even have done me a favor in 2014, because I've played through 20 years without a break," Rodriguez said at the time.</seg>
<seg id="19">His absentee days did not go quiet too.</seg>
<seg id="20">While many baseball legends were still getting the big stage in their final games, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench.</seg>
<seg id="21">"My job does not include a goodbye tour."</seg>
<seg id="22">"My job involves trying to win every game," said Yankees coach Joe Girardi.</seg>
<seg id="23">After all, Rodriguez, who was married to actress Cameron Diaz, and who will follow the relationship with pop star Madonna and actress Kate Hudson, received sympathy from the fans of the Yankee archrival Boston Red Sox.</seg>
<seg id="24">"We want A-Rod," sang supporters at the 4: 9 defeat against the Rodriguez team.</seg>

<seg id="2">Blurring: Due to a positive test of doping, Adrian Zielinski from Poland should not start in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympics are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.</seg>
<seg id="4">A learned athlete would have won almost a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the seventh race day, the first official doping cases have become known to the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Chinese swimming in Chen Xinyi, 3000-meter-impeachment helicopter Silvera Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Polish-born winner Adrian Zielinski were positively tested and excluded in Brazil - immediately before the start of the already critical athletics competitions came to light.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Chen last Sunday, Diureticum Hydrochlorothiazid had already been proven to be used as a mascot for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">The International Sports Court CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympics on Friday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday, the 18-year-old had the fourth place in the final over 100 m butterfly, only 0.09 seconds missed by the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday, Chen would have to take part in the proceedings over 50 metres of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="11">Chen has requested the opening of the B sample and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee (IOC).</seg>
<seg id="12">The national association takes the matter "very serious and demands of Chen full cooperation in investigations," Xinhua said from a notice: "We will work with the International Sports Tribunal CAS and will accept the verdict."</seg>
<seg id="13">For the first time in history is no longer the IOC, but the CAS for the sanctioning of athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also in the night of Rio, news about the positive rehearsal at Danekowa, the 33-year-old went into the offensive.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," this was "an incredible shock," she told the Bulgarian TV broadcaster BNT.</seg>
<seg id="16">She was innocent, "the only explanation could be food supplements," the athletic said.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the report, the banned substance is supposed to act as an EPO.</seg>
<seg id="18">Danekowa has been provisionally suspended, according to BNT.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgaria's Prime Minister Bojko Borissow immediately spoke to the athlete with criticism.</seg>
<seg id="20">"I don't understand why athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said: "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been ruled out."</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, all the figures from the chronic dysfunctional nation must not take part in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">On Friday it was also known as the "Adrian Zielinski," the London Olympic champion in class up to 85 kg, as his brother Tomasz had been tested positive for the anabolic steroid Nandroll three days earlier.</seg>
<seg id="23">Both deny taking, but both must not start in class up to 94 kg.</seg>
<seg id="24">Prior to the launch of athletics, the Danekowa case is another heavy blow to the reputation of the entire sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The International Federation of IAAF had banned the entire Russian team until an exception because of systematic doping, including the Läufernation Kenya in Rio many bad news.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the swimming sport, in addition, the earlier offences in China also made a difference between athletes.</seg>
<seg id="27">So the Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang.</seg>
<seg id="28">"Sun Yang pinkelt purple."</seg>
<seg id="29">"If I see the podium above 200 m of freedom, I want to pass," Lourt said in the French radio.</seg>
<seg id="30">Sun was also at the heart of a clash with Australia's Mack Horton.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I don't have time and no respect for doping fraudsters," he said.</seg>
<seg id="32">Sun was positively tested in 2014 with the Chinese championships, but had to leave only a three-month lock.</seg>

<seg id="1">Data clau: So perfide invents hackers her ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of extortion Malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey by the malware prevention specialists, Malwareytes, among 540 companies in North America, the United Kingdom and Germany, 40 per cent of the companies surveyed have been in the past 12 months at least once, in part, many of them victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, just 20% of the companies were already committed to Ransomware blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 per cent of the victims paid willingly the rangers demanded by the perpetrators to re-use the systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specifically specialise in their extortion software, according to the observations of Malwareyites, on attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they succeed there, the potentially far-reaching ranger is significantly higher than in private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of the malware," explains Malwareboy boss Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world."</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most Malwareprogrammes were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered Erblackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private users were the target, but the change to company attacks has been appalling in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works after a simple pattern: Once a victim's computer is active, it is looking for recently modified files such as Word-, Excel or database files, and archives for images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the Ransomware and delete the originals.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the demands of the extenders.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the final encryption code to get the files, the victim needs money - usually in the form of the Cryptocurrency Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, where private users use the personal photo database at stake, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production is closed.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage is higher when a Ransomware is added.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of German companies reported sales losses by Ransomware, 13 percent had even had to interrupt business completely, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, many hospitals have been victims of attacks whose patients may be threatened by the loss of hospital records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"We always tell the victims: Does not pay, it will only promote the problem," explained Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 per cent of the firms who pay will get their data back again.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers, it is difficult to reject the perpetrators "demand, given the stalemate in the operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, F-Secure's security researchers have been investigating the benefits of use and contact with the extenders, and come to the result: The perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain their victims by chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, sending freely accessible support websites or decrypt for example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And, as a result of payments from a few hundred euros, companies will have to negotiate and pay five-digit sums to get their data back unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potentially high and relatively risky gains from the Ransomware blackmail, the hackers will always be professional and share the job, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski from the Antivirus provider Sophos: "A single person can write a Ransomware about within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more likely to be three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software component to the actual extenders.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous malware kits emerged, by purchasing the malware itself, advice and additional tools for a unique fixed price between 1,000 and $10,000.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Included is an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The exters then seek further hackers to spread the freshly bought software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service economy.</seg>
<seg id="34">So, in one of the forums in the underground, you can buy the set of a criminal, and assign another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is made for a machine.</seg>
<seg id="36">"Usually the criminals then ask for spammers," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known to many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of the companies in the Malwareytes survey trust Ransomware to be able to escape from file bag-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">As a result, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"If the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful performance, the perpetrators will instead threaten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="41">This means that the potential for damage is much higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">In future, the perpetrators could, in future, have completely new objectives on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Despacon conference Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the internet.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter, so many casualties could well be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators were to block a whole production road in a factory, instead of the heating in the future, Ransomware could also become an issue in the industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="1">One for all cases</seg>
<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and everyday</seg>
<seg id="3">In the small HR-V, Honda wants to pack everything: A little SUV, a little coupe and even the versatility of a minivan.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds fairly overloaded, but the HR-V, constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, is actually proving to be very flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V is rather small, the passengers have plenty of space in both the first row and the Fond.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the interior are well-processed and have a pleasant impact, only the cockpit top is falling.</seg>
<seg id="7">The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is not only available in 453 litres of high and 1026 litres on the left hand side, but there are the Magic Seats.</seg>
<seg id="9">This is less magical than it sounds: The seats of the backbench can be flushed up like chin-chairs and thus provide vacuum space, which is high from the ground to the ceiling of 1.24 metres.</seg>
<seg id="10">The boot is well-ventilated, but it is a bit higher than the comparable Peugeot in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-l-diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide rotation loads very powerful.</seg>
<seg id="12">But he is expected to make his work a bit more leaner.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is pleasant to see the everyday consumption of 4.7 litres / 100 km.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another motorization: A 1.5-l-petrol with 96 kW / 130 horsepower.</seg>
<seg id="15">An all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">Driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamism and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, steering is probably something more direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">The equipment can no longer be desired in the "Executive" category.</seg>
<seg id="19">The security systems include the City emergency brake (works by speed 32), the collision alert system and the spacing wizard.</seg>
<seg id="20">The collision warning is sometimes irritated by assessing many obstacles as "approaching objects."</seg>
<seg id="21">The distance assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the smart Temporezer reacts to traffic character recognition and modifies the speed.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, full connectivity is available only for top-up: 7-inch touchscreens, Navi, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB and a HDMI book are under the armrest and are therefore easily accessible.</seg>
<seg id="25">The around 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are in order.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who do not want to invest so much will get the petrol from 20000 Euro, the diesel from EUR 23000.</seg>
<seg id="27">The engines meet the Euro-6 exhaust gas standard.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday-like car.</seg>

<seg id="1">Airline is not liable: Fall on passenger bridge</seg>
<seg id="2">An airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge.</seg>
<seg id="3">Because a liability can only be found on dangers typical of the air transport, the Oberland Court argued in Düsseldorf (Az.: 18 U 124 / 14).</seg>
<seg id="4">The plaintiff had broken a knee disc in the fall.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general living risk, so the dish said.</seg>
<seg id="6">The airline had to pay the man no compensation.</seg>

<seg id="1">Disease: When the organiser pays</seg>
<seg id="2">Once you have visited the hotel, you will be able to get back if the cause of the disease can be found in the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, this is only the case if more than ten per cent of guests have proven the same symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the missed case, a family on the second day of their door to Turkey was severely affected by confusion and destruction.</seg>
<seg id="5">She spent almost the entire holiday in the room.</seg>
<seg id="6">Her illness caused holidaymakers to return to a defective treatment plant that allegedly polluted sea water.</seg>
<seg id="7">The family was of the opinion that the journey was deficient - and against the organiser.</seg>
<seg id="8">In court, the plaintiffs had no success.</seg>
<seg id="9">The waste water treatment plant was indeed defective.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, the organiser did not return to it until late.</seg>
<seg id="11">He had to assume that the sea water was fine.</seg>
<seg id="12">So he did not violate his information obligations, so the verdict.</seg>
<seg id="13">No contamination has been found in the samples of the water.</seg>
<seg id="14">The illness of several hotel guests - possibly by contagion - belonged to the general life risk.</seg>
<seg id="15">Of 691 guests were only 38.</seg>

<seg id="1">De Maizière said following the violence perpetrated by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were concerned about further attacks.</seg>
<seg id="2">The state must also respond to terrorist threats.</seg>
<seg id="3">Surely: Our country will not answer the perpetrators' violence with hate and division.</seg>
<seg id="4">We will not treat the terrorists to this triumph.</seg>
<seg id="5">If criminals were to leave the country more quickly, however, they would also increase the security and strength of the population for refugee policy.</seg>
<seg id="6">De Maizière aims to implement the proposals by 2017.</seg>
<seg id="7">He also announced a further human-security reinforcement of the security forces, "in mid-quarters over several years."</seg>
<seg id="8">The role of sympathies for terrorism must be punished again.</seg>
<seg id="9">Video surveillance is to be improved, the arms right is so novel, that it is particularly difficult to buy weapons on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="10">The most recently-discussed secrecy for doctors is to be maintained after de Maizière.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, in dialogue with the medical profession, he wants to look for solutions to reduce the vulnerability of the citizens, "he said, with a view to seeing mental difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="12">To counter the radicalisation of refugees, the Minister considers better social care.</seg>
<seg id="13">Teachers need to be better prepared for dealing with traumatic experiences.</seg>
<seg id="14">To prosecute criminals in specific areas of the Internet (Darknet), de Maizière plans to use covert investigators.</seg>
<seg id="15">SPD boss Gabriel said: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security."</seg>
<seg id="16">It is important that the Home Secretary clearly expressed its opposition to actionism.</seg>
<seg id="17">"That was an earrings for the hinges in the CDU / CSU," Gabriel told the newspapers of the Funke Media Group (Friday).</seg>
<seg id="18">De Maizière had previously denied Rufe from the Union following a burka ban and the abolition of dual nationality.</seg>
<seg id="19">A general ban on full concealment is problematic for constitutional reasons.</seg>
<seg id="20">You cannot ban everything you reject and I reject the bear of the Burka.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can talk about rules about road transport or for witnesses.</seg>

<seg id="1">Better traffic flow on the motorway</seg>
<seg id="2">It is regularly on the bypass.</seg>
<seg id="3">But that is to change: The process of redress will be extended.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is good news for all drivers who are on the road to the road on the road line every night when driving through the motorway (A 43).</seg>
<seg id="5">In the area between the Hammer Straße and the departure Weseler Straße, the German road construction company extends the legal machine by 700 metres.</seg>
<seg id="6">Motorists can enter directly from the Hammer Strasse to the right.</seg>
<seg id="7">The big advantage: Traffic is becoming more early on, improving the overall process on the multi-way section of the Parkway 51.</seg>
<seg id="8">The idea with the extended exit had the CDU group in the district representation of Münster-West.</seg>
<seg id="9">The train ride on the Zugern nerves the motorists especially between 17 and 19.</seg>
<seg id="10">From the beginning of the 19th century, the bridge over the Albersworth road and sometimes beyond.</seg>
<seg id="11">The reason is the Nadelör on the B 51 shortly before the departure Weseler Straße.</seg>
<seg id="12">From here, traffic is only diverted via the motorway bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">The second track had to be rebuilt well in three-quarters.</seg>
<seg id="14">The reason: Static calculations have shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary capacity to absorb heavy traffic in particular.</seg>
<seg id="15">As long as this bottleneck and the related performance of this bottleneck will continue, the local authority cannot say.</seg>
<seg id="16">The bridge has an official rest until 2034.</seg>
<seg id="17">For the extension of the legal system, the local authorities have deliberately chosen the weaker than expected time in the school holidays because they are expected to be subject to a disability.</seg>
<seg id="18">Traffic will be handed over to the building site on Tuesday and Wednesday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing night: Tips against sleep disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">The staff were very friendly and helpful.</seg>
<seg id="3">That is all but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, such problems are in good society: According to the Robert Koch Institute, for example, a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten per cent experience their sleep often or permanently.</seg>
<seg id="5">How are sleeping problems or sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleeping disorders, and there are many reasons for which they can be used.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, what you can see is the inomnie, that is, an intrusion disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is precisely the sleep that many people feel as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, a board member at the German Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">This may include organic, mental or behavioural factors, but also drugs.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rarely is the sleep disorder expression of another disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Very early awakening is mostly in the case of a depression," Weeß says.</seg>
<seg id="14">And it may be that different factors depend on each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, if you do not have a bandbreak case, you can go for two to three hours.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should there be sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">If you don't sleep well over a month in at least three nights a week, you should go to the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impact can be very different: It is sealed, tired, unabashed, has trouble with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical complaints such as stomach or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">To relieve sleep disorder, it is important to find out what causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">The treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioral therapy, or drugs - classical mud tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="22">Established sleep medics exist in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="23">For this reason you should contact the doctor in case of sleep problems.</seg>
<seg id="24">The problem is whether the problem is a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should get into the mess and what happened?</seg>
<seg id="26">For example, in order to study in the sleeping laboratory, doctors, for example, are advised of breathing with the respiratory tract, in the case of disease of the daytime, in sleep converters or if you do not find the cause of confusion.</seg>
<seg id="27">We need to prepare for the inquiry.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Please don't make any lunch," says Fienets.</seg>
<seg id="30">After the cabling you go to bed to the bed.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes on the body, a nasal glasses, a chest belt and a foils are pressed.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera on the ceiling captures the sleeping.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can those affected the problem?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a few points of order that can be used for better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">The staff were friendly and helpful.</seg>

<seg id="2">Former German swimmers Markus Deibler has commented on Facebook's disappointing cuts to the DSV team at Olympis.</seg>
<seg id="3">In December of 2014, he was awarded gold for the first time in Doha.</seg>
<seg id="4">Now the former DSV-athlete Markus Deibler via Facebook has put protection against his ex-team mates.</seg>
<seg id="5">"In a country in which an Olympians get 20,000 €premium and a jungle king £150,000 shouldn't be surprised," said the 26-year-old in the night on Friday on his Facebook page.</seg>

<seg id="7">In this way, we cannot compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not see or even pursue doping.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, a few lindenbakks, one of the rest of the cobblestones: The Riga Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not affect the first sight, but the police are one of the city's "dangerous places."</seg>
<seg id="2">Walk from the east to the west, you will find playgrounds, a fresh nursery and a biolades.</seg>
<seg id="3">The facade of a grey house has someone "ugly!" Sprayed.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is already under construction: A house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be created by 2017.</seg>
<seg id="5">Articles about this "trendy borough," as the real estate firm Friedrichshain calls, will be preferred in recent weeks with burning cars.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is the home with the number 94: Once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have leased, but on the ground floor there are still spaces and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Berlin Innenenator Henkel, in particular, had repeatedly argued for a crackdown on the project since the beginning of the year, calling for the "no-go zone" for police officers and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After 22 June, the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadtersmiths, with 300 police officers were cleared, patrol the police for three weeks, according to official statements, with 30 to 40 officers and three teams on the ground, closed parts of the street and kept visitors from entering the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile renovated construction workers commissioned the premises on behalf of unknown homeowners.</seg>
<seg id="10">On July 13, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that clearing was illegal, and a day later police and construction workers withdrew under the jubilee of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon, the street acts peacefully: Parents walk with children, people sit on the pavement in front of the houses in the sun, others entertain Vorm Späti.</seg>
<seg id="12">A primary school and kindergarten are nearby.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left-wing violence is not the main concern of many inhabitants: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in Kiev since 1999, and Jana *, who is here with three children here, are mainly from the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the residents of the house projects, they share the concern of rising rents and genetic testing.</seg>
<seg id="15">It doesn't sound like a jaw, which was a majority of police guard against vandaling Left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The grass, which the Berliner Innensenator and police make up between the housekeepers and their neighbours, does not seem to exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the East of Berlin, Friedrichshain was actually a traditional working district, which also has a low average income and high risk of poverty today compared to the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="18">In 1990, many of the houses in the former GDR were occupied, including almost the entire Mainzer Strasse near Riga.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer was cleared under great police conditions in a veritable street slump, many of the projects were legalized in the Riga and are still being inhabited by the people they occupied 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, in recent years, the borough has become a magnet for tourists and voters from all over the world: They now share their Kiev-era residents and former housekeepers.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also apparent in rents, which have risen by nearly 60% since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the reconstructions in the Riga are being attacked as symbols for this development: They can be recognized by the painted slices or freshly-pressed facades that have been thrown with color bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road has been mentioned this year, so often with the words of "leftist violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason that not all neighbours consider this to be a problem could be that crime is not necessarily affected: Crimes like body injury are, according to statistics, almost exclusively against police.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the offences are being made up of property, which tend to hit the newly constructed and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rental house next to the contested 94 in a rental house for 17 years, there can be no mention of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As far as violence is concerned, it is patently obvious: People in the 94 are their neighbours who have not been appointed.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars no longer exist in Riga.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied Architektin, her street is not a forensic burning point, on the contrary: "Here you can help each other, live along the street and get more from each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately drawn to the Riga street - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">For this reason, it was also so important that residents get their road back: From police, politics and the media, which in July all suddenly claimed sovereignty over the borough.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer, the street continues to be removed: By careless new buildings in former building blocks that are pushing the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"These are, in fact, property housing, which are not interesting for many here - rather people who are not so well-known," she says.</seg>
<seg id="34">"I totally disagree with" violence and destruction. "</seg>
<seg id="35">But what to do if you never hear someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration at all sides, including the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">For the sake of getting rid of color bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: The house projects and the left scene belonged to the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who draw up should be aware of this - just like someone who runs into a pub district, who can complain badly about noise there.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons presented with first-name names have asked not to be called with their right name</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deusle is new refugee officer</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deusle is the contact person in the field of integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July, Annika Deuschle has been the refugee officer for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the management team around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees herself as a contact person for all actors: Refugees, the Intervention of Refugee Assistance, the administration, the authorities and anyone else.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine's customer from the working circle suggests that the honorary official is more than grateful that Deasle is now there, the iron-grade wool mill, which is above all a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">Some - less spotless than in fact - meant that the number of requests had to be replaced when the administration wanted to write.</seg>
<seg id="9">An administrative professional with a talent for languages and people has been sought, coupled with a long-term experience in the field of social work, which is an iron-milder.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deusle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organizing, work with people on the ground and behind the scenes and network activities.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been in existence for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 per cent point in three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"It was high time," says Regine Kunde, which supports Annika Deishle and principal actors.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small problems, organisational, human and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem has been found for some time to find housing for the connecting refugees who have been recognised.</seg>
<seg id="18">Local authorities are responsible for connecting them.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must shelter the refugees in their own or rented homes.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of building, rent or renovating these accommodation must bear the local authorities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the landing board to commune and job center.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: There are free objects, but not every rental wants to offer its apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been proving very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the administration does not find private housing.</seg>
<seg id="25">It doesn't work so far, however, if you need to rely on private apartments, so Deasure.</seg>
<seg id="26">Public housing must therefore be intimidated, as is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers are placed in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with housing is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, are Regine Kunde and Annika Deusle agreed.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a firm lead, there are traineeships, training centres, school grounds, Euro-euro jobs and assistance to refugees and migrants who have to be folded or established.</seg>
<seg id="31">"More places would be good," says Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building house or help house master, perform charitable work - and the motivation and very well, as Annika Deusle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that work for the community will lead to positive external action.</seg>
<seg id="34">That is' not employment therapy '.</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity doesn't just mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a solid structure, say Deishle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People should develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So there need to be offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rr.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is also where administration and honorary official are jumping.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is vital that refugees get the feeling that they are hoping and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of proceedings is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They need to explain to the refugees that it will take time and that they can make sense, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Anyone who creates the feeling that he can't help in Urbach cannot work and is pointless.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">However, problems exist, says clients honestly, "people who do nothing at all."</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: Have the two people afraid of radicalization, also in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"No," says Regine Kunde.</seg>
<seg id="50">The aid workers are made aware.</seg>
<seg id="51">These events are also about refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">Those would have been afraid that the perpetrators of the attacks would be completely discredited.</seg>
<seg id="53">"They want to show that they have nothing to do with that," says Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">It is therefore important to keep the local and the volunteers on the ground and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always found that a new stop to refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly, politics is shy.</seg>
<seg id="59">It is unfair to put them on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="60">"In Urbach, we are not there yet," says Annika Deusle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would ease the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine's customer also makes it clear that the former companies are already busy integrating the existing people.</seg>
<seg id="63">This is currently around 100 people, mostly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But if people are in need, they need to help, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world is so complicated, there are no easy answers.</seg>
