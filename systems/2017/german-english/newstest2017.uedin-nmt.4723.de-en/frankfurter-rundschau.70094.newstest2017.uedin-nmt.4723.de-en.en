Turkey: Kurdish community expects mass exodus
"If you don't adapt and Erdogan praises, sit on packed suitcases," says the chairman of the G端len-nearby Foundation Dialogue and World, Ercan Karakoyun.
The Kurdish community of Germany reckons in the short term with tens of thousands of protection seekers fleeing from Turkey to Germany.
In the medium term, it could even become "a few hundred thousand," believes the association's president, Ali Toprak.
Because of the crackdown by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan following the coup attempt, the Kurdish community of Germany is expecting a mass exodus to Germany.
"In the short term, I expect tens of thousands, in the medium term, with a few hundred thousand protection seekers from Turkey in Germany, if the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," says the association's chairman Ali Toprak of the "World" Friday.
Because the government has already covered Kurdish strongholds with punitive actions months ago, 500,000 Kurds inside Turkey are on the run.
After the thwarted coup, there would still be secular and opposition ethnic Turks.
Many will want to start anew in Europe if they continue to be suppressed in Turkey.
"It cannot be that a state that even takes in refugees produces refugees in their own country," Toprak said.
The union chief lamented the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in alevitic cities.
As a result, Erdogan wants to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kurds.
"They are the last large minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been eradicated or displaced in the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member.
The union chief called for the federal government to "position itself as sharply as Austria against Erdogan and its supporters."
In Germany, too, a "witch hunt" is taking place against Erdogan's critics.
I don't feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months.
The German branch of the G端len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and opposition activists.
The branding as a G端len supporter wiped out teachers and other academics' professional existence.
"Those who don't adapt and Erdogan praises are sitting on packed suitcases, by the way, the Kemalists and secularists," said Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the G端len-affiliated Foundation of Dialogue and Education, the "World."
As the newspaper reported, citing figures from the federal interior ministry, the Turks already represented the largest group of asylum seekers recognised for political persecution in Germany before the coup.
On the cut-off date of 30 June, this figure was 11,386 people, accounting for almost 29% of all those eligible for asylum (39,625).
This survey does not include those fleeing war, poverty or lack of perspective.
Asylum rights under the Basic Law are exclusively political, in other words from the state side, individually persecuted.
