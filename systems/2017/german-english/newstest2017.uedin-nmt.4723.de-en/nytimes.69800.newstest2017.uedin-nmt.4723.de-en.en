Amid the Rage of the Olympics, the Zen of trampolins
Wherever you are, how late it is, it's the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inevitable, a rapid relay between competition and aspiration.
It's as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning baton that is passed from the bravado to swimmer to Turner to the triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour's conversation in the queue in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the battle between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there is Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is at the Olympics for the first time and a woman's swarm with greats, could well have been among those well-known names to be sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising if he were a swimmer, Turner or even Flood.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the Olympic trampoline.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event.
Further from the centre, partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally recognized: Air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always have breast swimming and may rule it for a long time.
But if I'm likely to make arguments for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline jump has already been an Olympic event since 2000, when it made its debut in Sydney, it has been so sparse the last 16 years that many of the ones I had interviewed didn't know that it was an Olympic sport at all.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the US sent athletes to compete, it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping and, by 2012, had an athlete who made it to the finals.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians to share for women.
Dong Dong of China and Rosie MacLennan of Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
The trampoline jumping has some outsider charm, in part because it sounds more appropriate for the unenlightened ear for a clowns school than the one for the Olympics.
At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, just an earthbound enthusiast.
It has humoristic potential - the cartoonish tremor of his never-ending cloudy impact - but also the grace of the gym and diving, the two sports that essentially unite it.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means as much as "springboard."
Up-and-coming victors jump on a gigantic trampoline, shooting almost up to 30 feet in the air and having to make a series of falling movements (turning, lifting and saltos) before landing on their feet.
They are assessed according to execution, difficulty and "flight time," according to the official Olympic programme.
Two-time athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.
Medal hopes must go on in their quest for gold, faster, up and over, sometimes to the finish, sometimes up and down, up and down in the playground.
They are chasing not only the finish line or the output wall, but also another derisive target in television broadcasting: That of the world or the Olympic cords.
The purposeful pursuit is nobel, admirable, even fanatical - and it's enough to even stir a bystander to tears.
But it's also what I feel even while watching these games as something tiring.
Of this, the trampoline offers breathing space.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is above.
A forward movement is not the goal.
He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.
Again, there is a competition, of course, not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no frenzied attack on the target, no wobble into the distance, just the dreamlike, elegant lifting of time and gravity.
It's as Zen as the competition at the Olympics can only be.
The women's qualifying and finals will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; that of the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.
NBC will broadcast the finals as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00.
Amid the Olympic mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in the general tumult.
If the raising of consciousness can only be achieved through the angling and objectification of male athletes - as the male US Turner recently suggested, according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley expects his after-air, new fan base.
