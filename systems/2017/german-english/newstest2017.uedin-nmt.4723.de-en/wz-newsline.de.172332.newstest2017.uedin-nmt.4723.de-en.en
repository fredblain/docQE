Airport: Gang of baggage thieves arrested
Professional thieves at Düsseldorf Airport
Civilian investigators from Dusseldorf police managed the arrest of two women and two men, aged 50 to 61, on Thursday.
The suspects had committed multiple bag and baggage thefts as a gang.
At around 9.30pm, civilian officials in the area of Düsseldorf Airport recognized a gang known to police officers from past theft offences.
The two women and two men had committed several offences since mid-July this year, acting collectively, in a collaborative and particularly professional manner.
The specialists of the crime commissioner, 34, can prove four acts to the thieves who had entered Germany specifically to commit crimes.
In doing so, they had grabbed a total of over £15,000.
