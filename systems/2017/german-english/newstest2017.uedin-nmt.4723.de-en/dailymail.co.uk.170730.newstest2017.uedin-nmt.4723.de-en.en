Buyers in Primark outraged by woman who tries shamelessly underwear in the middle of the shop
Buyers didn't know where they should look when a woman pulled out her clothes in the midst of a Primark to try undergarments.
To make the situation worse, she mustled as she looked into it, pulled her out and put it back on the shelf.
She continued to stab and tried four pairs of undergarments in a shop at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone.

A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the business at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear, "she moved back in and left the business without buying anything."
She said: "People couldn't believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the sales floor, she took a pair of undergarments from the outlay, pulled out her own tights and trousers and tried them.
'She didn't even try to find a slightly more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, freaking like Oskar. '
'Everyone stared when she pulled out the undergarments that obviously didn't like her as she put her back on the shelf. '
She repeated the same with three more undergarments before she finally decided that she didn't like anything, pulled up again and went out.
'She didn't seem to bother that she was watching someone - or thinking about the person who, in some circumstances, would buy the undergarments she had tried. '
Ms Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: "How disgusting to think that someone would take undergarments with home who had a different person and who were not washed."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms Davidson added: "As I got involved, the staff tried to pull the garments out of the sale after she went - which is just as good."
'i'd hate to go home with a new pair of undergarments and find out that another woman had her and pulled it out again and they weren't washed. '
A spokesman for Primark said: "Primark is aware of the incident, which occurred on Tuesday, August 9 at our branch in Folkstone."
All the products in question have been pulled from the sale.
