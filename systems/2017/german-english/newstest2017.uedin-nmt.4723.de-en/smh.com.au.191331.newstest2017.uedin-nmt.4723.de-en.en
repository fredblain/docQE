Donald Trump election campaign charged after staff allegedly pulled gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign has been charged with alleged inaction after she was told that her campaign manager for North Carolina turned a firearm on an employee in February while traveling in a Jeep in February.
The incident is described in an indictment filed Wednesday in the National Court of Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in that state.
Bordini admitted to waiting for months that the matter would be dealt with internally before he realised that "this would not happen."
The campaign manager, Earl Philip, "pulled a pistol, put his right index finger on the deduction, and rammed the run in Vincents knee throat," Bordini admitted in his indictment.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign board, Bordini noted that at least four other people had already made the same experience with Phillip, he admitted in the indictment.
"Guns don't have to be fired to cause harm," Bordini admitted.
The indictment comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate sparked an uproar when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment people" - firearms owners and gun lovers - should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton is elected and appoint judges.
Trump's campaign made it clear that the media had taken his words out of context and that he would not incite violence.
Bordini's complaint requires compensation from the campaign for the violation of due diligence and from Philip for assault occasioning bodily harm and bleaching psychological damage.
Trump's press secretary, Hope Hicks, could not be reached for comment.
Attempts to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local news channel in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer an employee of the campaign.
There has been no response to calls to his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has led a controversial campaign so far.
The procedure is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
