England must steer the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and across London, but across the country.
For me, this represented the biggest attraction of Heathrows, just as it was back in 2012 in London, when we ran a big effort to ensure that all of our nations and regions benefited from the Games.
The Olympics brought great benefits for Stratford and the East End.
And that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and firms near Heathrow.
For our local communities, we will already create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.
Just as they were ahead of us at London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of enlarging Heathrows is too great.
I have been told that England will never be ready for the Games and that we will embarrass ourselves on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question put to him.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many and not for individual.
Expansion is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in weather-related growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across GB.
We have a great team at Heathrow, which has implemented a £11bn expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from the T5 - which was chosen five years in a row to become the world's best airport terminal, to the T2, which was built in the midst of the world's two busiest catwalks.
Now they are poised to deliver a third catwalk, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment.
The 2012 London Games have been a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.
It is time for us to steer this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, while securing our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.
