More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September edition of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner clan Kris is on the cover of the coveted September edition of US Vogue.
Kendall, who is the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran on the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to the wines," Kendall wrote.
The revelation of the cover-up was followed by a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians similar?), scripted reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (with the exception of the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the much-loved showbiz uncle and producer of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest) as they have forgotten the cover of their sister and that ends with a classic twist: They have all planned a surprise party.
This represents the cliched plot of almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest brought the phrase, "You thought that we would have forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon canine on a broadcast slot at 8 in the morning), but Kris had to somehow let her other girls take part in this publicity.
With regards to the September issue of Vogue, certainly a new era of the Kardashians has begun.
Kendall's big sister, Kim, may have beaten her in terms of the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were seen on it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself.
The September issue is the most selling edition of the year for Vogue.
With a scope more akin to a picture band than a fashion magazine, the output attracts a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista were from the 832 pages of the tome's 615 pages advertising).
The unveiling of his cocoon is so eagerly awaited that in the last two years, images of the magazine were leaked even before the official announcement.
Women already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have clearly been more "celebrities who are mocking" as "models that are famous" on the cover.
Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honour.
But even at the low chance that Ms. Jenner - described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the former category, she is in good company.
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or young people of today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even if it all applies to Jenner).
They are really talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the final cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, Jenner's success doesn't please everyone.
With her reality TV history, Jenner's position in the fashion world has always been somewhat fraught.
In June, incoming Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticised her and called them "the mistpieces of the moment."
Those feelings boiled over again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenner on the Vogue cover.
But riding on the resentment seems to be at the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
She is literally a supermodel.
She runs for Marc Jacobs.
She makes adverts for your primer of Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.
She sells from her made images of Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine LOVE.
And in her spare time she is seen on reality TV, presumably only to see her sister Kourtney and their children.
