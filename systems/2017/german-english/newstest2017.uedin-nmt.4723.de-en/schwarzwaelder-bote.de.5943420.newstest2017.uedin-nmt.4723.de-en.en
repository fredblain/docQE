Nagold: Game and fun at summer release
Eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the social-educational day group / social group work of the child protection group Nagold with their carers on their summer free time in Nussdorf, near M체hlacker.
In the quietly located leisure home Hardtwasldle, the life-loving group was quarantined during the first school holiday week.
Several full-day trips were on the programme.
For one thing, it went to Bretten with the visit of the petting zoos.
On the other hand, to Maulbronn, where there was a special children's guide in the world-famous monastery.
The third outing led to Pforzheim.
At the Celtic Museum in Hochdorf, the group learned a lot about the everyday life and food of the Celts.
On the hot days, the group had fun at the Tiefensee in Maulbronn, which invited you to jump, swim and plan.
Children and caregivers have been pampered with their self-prepared meals, such as the Sauren Sp채tzle, the Seebronner Pf채nnle, Iselshauser-Bloff, the English Breakfast and T체binger Bolognese.
In workshops, tanned, beautiful pieces of pearls and stones were created or made of wood a Roman-mill game.
Other highlights of the leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond, the evenings on the fire and the final "Bunte evening."
On the day of the journey home, the sun laughed and the children and young people returned home.
