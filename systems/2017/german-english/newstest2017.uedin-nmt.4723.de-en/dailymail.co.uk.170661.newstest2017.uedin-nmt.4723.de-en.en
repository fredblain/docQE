Assistant doctors want to organise more strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 assistant doctors who voted in an election rejected him.
In July, Hunt unveiled plans to forcibly introduce the contract and said that the NHS would be in a "no-man's land" and that any further delay would be harmful to staff and patients.
The first assistant doctors are to be given a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend work to improve care at inhospitable times.
Dr Ellen McCourt, the chair of the BMA committee for assistant doctors told reporters last night in a statement: "Assistant doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and fail to treat all doctors fairly."
At just eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress must be made and time is running out.
Efforts by the BMA to resolve the disputes through talks met with the government's reluctance to participate, and sometimes on deafening silence.
This was the result of a promise that Jeremy Hunt had made only last month that his door would always be open.
'Jeremy Hunt must act now, lift the imposition and address the concerns of assistant doctors. '
If he fails to do so, the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are willing to carry out further industrial action.
The latest strike in late April saw a reprieve of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and specialist doctors were included to provide cover to doctors on the strike pot chain.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting the reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants a better weekly wage for the 54,000 assistant doctors who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, director general of NHS staff, urged assistant doctors to end the strike.
Mr Mortimer said: "Labour force measures do not achieve any of the little, but already charge over-burdened teams and service providers, and prepare patients, nurses and their families only to worry, distress and interruption."
Over the past two months, we have spoken to the committee of assistant doctors and responded positively to concerns about guardianship and whistleblowing with the Department of Health and other ministries.
Employers hoped that continued positive engagement on other major issues - such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a professional timeout, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were about complying with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.
