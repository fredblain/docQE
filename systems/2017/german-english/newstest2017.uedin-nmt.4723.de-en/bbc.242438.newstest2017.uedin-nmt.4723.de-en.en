Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson fired after he beat producers
Gibson was involved in a physical altercation on the set of the series in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced its termination in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized publicly on Thursday before announcing his termination.
On set, there were artistic differences and a disagreement.
I regret the incident, "he said in a note.
Details of how the character Gibsons is written out of the series, which follows a team of FBI agents, are expected to be released at a later date, according to the opinion of ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old, who previously starred in the sitcom Dharma & Greg, had been with him since the first season of the series in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put my whole heartbreak down the last 12 years," Gibson said in a statement released on Friday.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but that will not be possible now.
I'd just like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you can only wish for a series.
The planned airing of the twelfth season is scheduled for September 28.
