Who is building Braunschweig's cheap apartments?
The SPD and the Greens believe that investors should be given much greater responsibility in the future.
How do you respond to the bad news that Brunswick will lose nearly 1300 affordable homes over the next few years?
The SPD proposes a "concept of living" at the next Council meeting.
But controversy is programmed.
First and foremost, the question is: Who should actually build the affordable housing?
There is no regulation so far.
Obama group chairman Christoph Bratman thinks: "We agree with the Greens: If you want to build on urban land, in the future, 20 per cent of all apartments will have to be designated as social housing."
However, the affordable apartments can also be found in the stock.
However, the big talking point at City Hall is, according to Bratman: "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private land?"
'We want investors to build at least 10 per cent on such land, but as much as 20 per cent of homes as social housing. '
A new urban housing support scheme, which will cost millions and still needs to be funded, is designed to provide incentives.
The problem, according to Bratman: "There is still no agreement between the groups at the moment."
The CDU wants to give investors as few rules as possible.
The left still wants tougher requirements for investors.
Despite this, according to Bratman, there is a tightening of the situation in the housing market.
If the concept of action is implemented, this will provide for additional tasks in the building administration.
More staff will be needed.
It's unclear whether we will get the professionals.
But the programme is not yet complete: The approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.
But how do you compare the loss of another about 1300 affordable housing, the promotion of which will be phased out over the next few years?
There will be 500 homes by 2020 alone.
To prevent this from happening, according to planning policy spokeswoman Nicole Palm, now expiring ties should be bought from the city.
In addition, consideration would have to be given to bringing housing back into price fixing.
This is possible in the western city.
At one stroke, the problem could be solved.
Because in the western city, deadlines expire at the end of the year.
Some 1800 apartments could be brought back there in price fixing for affordable housing.
Only: That's what the owners want, the housing associations don't.
Because, once again, the number of social housing in the western city will be dramatically increased, away from the goal of so-called mixing.
A concentration of social weak in just a few neighbourhoods should no longer exist.
The Greens reckon there will still be movement in the discussion.
Group Chairman Holger Herlitschke says: "For a broad majority, the CDU must be on board."
The has focused on more building sites for single-family homes.
But that does not mean that a compromise cannot be found.
