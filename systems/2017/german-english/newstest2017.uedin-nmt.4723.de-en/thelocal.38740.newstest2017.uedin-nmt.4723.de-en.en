Woman overpowered in suspected suicide on Swiss highway
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are calling for witnesses after a woman went overboard in the early hours of Thursday in a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a highway.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight.
A woman put himself on the road in the dark "in an act of desperation" and were hit by several cars, police in Vaud said.
It is obvious that a Swiss woman, aged 49, who was overpowered by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill himself.
She still passed away on the ground.
Several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, said police, who are urging these as well as any witnesses to the incident to sign up.
An investigation has been opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen if any of the drivers will be displayed.
Was a collision avoidable?
That's something the prosecutor has to decide, "Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases over the past five years show that drivers are not being held accountable.
In each of the two cases - where a person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that motorists don't have to assume that a pedestrian walks on the highway in the middle of the night, as stated in the newspaper.
Last year, a policewoman was acquitted of negligent homicide after she overpowered and killed a man who was lying on the A1 near Payerne in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and has become unconscious on the street, arresting the court.
The court found that the police officer -- who had responded to an emergency call -- drove in a justified manner and that the presence of a man on the street was a "completely extraordinary and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone who has any further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact police under the number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
