This was the moment terrified tourists start to panic after a tipped jet crashed over a full beach.
Dramatic video footage showed how the military plane flew almost in tangible proximity over the sun's ankles on the beach section in Aveiro in northern Portugal.
Holidaymakers sped up when they understandably began to worry about the noise of the jet engines without first seeing what was coming through the clouds on them.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many holidaymakers who posted videos about the dramatic fly-by on social media, said: "It flew twice really very deep and there was a moment when it looked like it was going to crash."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was falling down on me."

The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to fly so deep that this was the only way to recognize them.
The spokesman said that due to poor visibility, the jet flew slightly deeper than usual due to poor visibility, however the Air Force insisted that security was at no time at risk.
Wildfires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer, which also killed four people on the island of Madeira.
