Old buildings, a few lime trees, some remaining cobblestones in between: The Rigaer Stra√üe in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not look like it at first glance, but the police rank them among the "dangerous places" of the city.
Walking down the road from east to west, you arrive at playgrounds, a fresh-coated nursery and a biolade.
On the facade of a grey house, someone sprayed "ugly!"
Opposite a Lidl, which is also soon to be demolished, is already being built: By 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new rentals will be created here.
However, articles about this "trendy neighborhood," as the relevant real estate firm Friedrichshain calls it, are preferred with burning cars in recent weeks.
The reason is the house with the number 94: Once it was occupied, the residents now have rental contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.
In particular, Berlin interior senator Henkel had argued several times since the beginning of the year for a crackdown by police against the project, describing the area as a "no-go zone" for police officers and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.
After, on June 22, the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadtermiths, with 300 police officers had been cleared, police patrolled three weeks of official statements, with 30 to 40 officers and three team cars on the ground, closed parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94.
Meanwhile, construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners.
On July 13, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the eviction had been illegal, and a day later, police and construction workers moved under the jubilation of sympathizers and residents.
On this summer afternoon, the street looks peaceful: Parents walk with children, people sit on the pavement in front of the houses in the sun, while others entertain prep spenders.
In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens.
Left-wing violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in Kiev since 1999, and Jana *, who is raising three children here, are mainly terrified by the police presence.
With the residents of the house projects, they share concerns about rising rents and gentrification.
It does not sound like a Kiev, the majority of whom wanted police protection from vandalizing left.
The ditch that the Berlin interior senator and police make up between housemates and their neighbours does not appear to exist.
Friedrichshain in eastern Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district, which even today has a low average income and high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city.
In 1990 a large number of houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Main Street in the vicinity of the Rigaer.
While the mainstays had been cleared under a large police lineup in an outright street battle, many of the projects were legalised in the Rigaer and are still inhabited by the people they occupied 26 years ago.
At the same time, the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and voters from all over the world in recent years.
This is also noticeable in rents, which have risen by nearly 60 per cent since 2009 in new rentals.
Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols of this development: They can be seen on discarded windows or freshly painted facades, which have been pelted with paint bags.
No other road has been mentioned so often this year along with the words "left-wing autonomous violence."
One reason that not all neighbours view this as a problem may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: Crimes such as injury, according to statistics, are almost exclusively against police officers.
Most of the crimes make property damage, which tends to hit new buildings and newly renovated homes.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a rental house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, there can be no talk of uncertainty.
As for acts of violence, it is appeasement: The people in the 94 are their neighbours, who certainly were not.
Even the famous burning cars no longer exist in the Rigaer any longer.
For the studied architect, their street is not a criminal flashpoint, on the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the street and get more from each other than elsewhere."
Neugebauer is deliberately drawn to Rigaer Street - and stayed.
That's why it was so important to her that residents get their street back: From the police, the politics and the media, who in July all suddenly claimed the interpretive power over the district.
But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road will continue to be taken away from them: Through faceless new buildings in former construction gaps that outnumber the old residents.
"These are, after all, condominiums that are not interesting to many here - here are more people who are not so well-behaved," she says.
"I absolutely do not approve of violence and destruction."
But what should you do if someone never listens to anyone?
There is frustration on all sides, including the police and residents.
For Zudrew, who is annoyed by color bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: The house projects and the left-wing scene were part of the Kiez.
If you're coming in, you should be aware of this - just like someone who moves to a pub district can complain badly about noise there.
