Group rises at start-up for live video game broadcasts
Watching other people playing video games is a huge thing - that's what Microsoft wants to benefit from.
The technology giant is buying the start-up Beam, which specialises in this hobby.
How much money is flowing for the takeover, Microsoft did not disclose on Thursday.
Beam only went to the start with his offer in January and already has more than 100,000 users.
You can watch others while playing, but also intervene yourself.
For example, they can give up missions and confront enemies as well as provide equipment.
Gaming giant Activision Blizzard is launching a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sports.
On the way to the global media event, Facebook is expected to help.
The advertising industry is already hovering.
Staff at the start-up, which has its headquarters so far in Seattle in the D.C. area, are moving to Microsoft headquarters in California's Redmond, according to Beam co-founder and chief executive Matt Salsamendi.
As a result, the transaction will not change for customers.
Beam will be integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console, according to Microsoft.
The market of live streaming of video game activities is currently growing rapidly.
Well-known platforms are twitch and YouTube gaming.
Twitch was bought by online retailer Amazon in 2014 - for nearly $1 billion.
YouTube Gaming is part of Google's mother Alphabet.
