The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a plentiful meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his rise to president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch in the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt had a penchant for refined delicacies of Fifth Avenue like p√¢te de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup.
His menu that day was slightly more modest: Stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, potato puree and as dessert a plum pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," Jane Ziegelman said.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added, "It was also a message to Americans about how they should eat."
The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coes's last book "Chop Suey" acted from Chinese cuisine in the United States, while brick was told in her book "97 Orchard" about life in a residence on the Lower East Side from the food perspective.
Her latest collaboration, "A decent meal," which will appear at Harper Publishing on Tuesday, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a reporter at the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, sniffing snack in the Flatiron District, which has already been in business since the stock market crash in 1929.
Brick man, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, ate turkey with potato puree and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered pecking, this found the pair fit for a discussion about eating in the era of the Great Depression.
"Rich food was very popular," Ziegelman said.
There was groundnut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.
They were made from an ingredient and something cheap, stretching the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.
Coe grinned.
"It must have laid in the stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table was an All-You-Can-Eat buffet in an American household, especially in rural areas.
Crews of women cooked for male field workers and it was served freshly baked pastes for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War.
"It was a time when food became a central, tense topic for Americans," Coe begged why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Just as tense was the new budget diet: Mysterious dishes such as brows and casseroles became staple foods, the casserole as a "wonderful way to reuse food leftovers," brick man noted, as chefs were able to hide unsavoury ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dry fruit.
Meat, which was the centre of American cuisine for years, became a rarely serrated luxury.
Strange blends have been tried, as calorie-rich and nutritious gratification took precedence over taste or even healthy cooking.
During her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from that era, baked onions with peanut butter, too.
"It wasn't a popular addition at lunchtime," Coe says.
Brickman continues: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter and baked onions don't match each other.
It was typical of many of the home business recipes.
Like never before or since, budget economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 to 1943 - drove the country's eating habits in such a way.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "household politicians" and to live up to the challenge of turning pep like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
"A Square Meal" is a celebration of historical delicacies.
Particularly palatable are the reports of the government's response to starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's Lass-me-cake-eating attitude.
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farm kitchen of his kitchen, he fed up like the billionaire man of world to whom he has become.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He ate in a nearly gold-plated dining room and wore a smoker.
He was delightfully out of touch with reality.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if not his wife, Eleanor, had asked him to set an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, the hiring of a housekeeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs. Roosevelt meant that the White House produced the most boring meal in Washington, but also one of the most defiant. "
Many of the species from the era of the Great Depression, dealing with food, was discarded once the country got back on its feet.
The legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food, Ziegelman said, as well as on how science was applied to food.
The pair admitted to the book's writing to better understand the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother-in-law - for example, how she couldn't throw away food.
"She had a real fear of wasting food," Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled: "She was actually making people sick."
There was the windbag incident.
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, she and Coe drew a dessert they had prepared at home: The plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate at noon.
"It's called Prune Whip," Ziegelman said, adding that it was a nasty trick to miss humble recipes a chic name.
There was no beaten cream, just plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone appeared somewhat reluctant to put a spoon in the taller, brown glibber.
Amazingly, it didn't look bad.
CoE picked up an aftershock three times.
Like a Can-Do budget maker, he said to his wife, "A few chopped walnuts would help."
