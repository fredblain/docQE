Heavy rains, flooding gives rise to rescues in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rains and widespread flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with more rain expected throughout Saturday.
Numerous rivers in southeastern Louisianas and the south of the Mississippis flooded their shores and threatened with widespread flooding after extreme rains, the National Weather Service reported.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards told reporters that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and that aid to the affected communities is already on the way.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, told reporters that requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags increased.
Steele said that alone the community of Tangipahoa would have requested ten thousand sandbags.
A flood warning system will be deployed across much of southern Louisianas through Saturday.
The weather service reported that an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in that area.
A flood alert system was used in southern Alabamas on Friday, while it continued to rain in the Mobile area.
The River Comite near Baton Rouges and the River Amite near Denham Springs, which are both in Louisiana, are likely to reach record levels over the weekend.
The metereologist Alek Krautman says that both rivers could flood many homes in suburban neighborhoods near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a downstream flooding in Ascension Parish is a danger, as these will only slowly flow into Lake Maurepas across the rivers.
The River Tickfaw, south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday.
Rescue teams still added people from the floodwaters in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and his stepson were among those rescued near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 400 feet from his home, rose sharply overnight.
He said that another stepson who lives nearby would have warned him.
"We woke up and the water poured in and poured in," Hansford said.
It reached my waist.
His wife told Hansford that she'd never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years she lived there.
Hansford said that he and his family members all had disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim.
Hansford said that Nothelfer had rescued all three in a large military truck and had taken them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they were housed until Friday.
Krautman said that the exuberance had "spread quickly" as there continued to be heavy rainfall and that authorities were considering evacuation instructions.
According to Krautman, an observer near Livingstone reported from midnight to Friday morning of 13.75 inches of rain.
Krautman said that the ground was considerably full-blown by the rains since Wednesday.
Authorities said that heavy rainfall and street flooding caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and teaching failure in five school districts.
CBS affiliate WWL reported that an inmate in Tangipahoa gave birth to 200 flooded homes.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, which have now both been inundated.
The foreman of the community of Robby Miller said that authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets who were washed up by the flooding.
Shelters have been set up in the cities of Amite and Hammond to house the evacuees.
"Once the water starts to go back, they will be able to go back to their homes," he said.
In the town of Hammond of the municipality of Tangipahoa, nearly two dozens of roads were closed due to flooding and sandbags provided for residents to take part, hoping to keep the water from their homes and shops.
"The last major flooding we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum of the City Council.
This appears to be a similar incident.
In Mississipp, emergency manager Rupert Lacy of the Harrison Countys said that it continued to rain on the Gulf Coast.
According to his data, a handful of homes are believed to have been reported as inundated on Thursday, but on Friday, none have been reported until now.
Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has already lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," Townson said, "and it's still coming."
