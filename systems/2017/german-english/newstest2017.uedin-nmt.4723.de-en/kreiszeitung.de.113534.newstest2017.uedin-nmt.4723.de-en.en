Podolski Takes With 'Gala' After Supercup
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, an arrest warrant has been issued against former football star Hakan Sükür.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time after the coup attempt, an important football match is taking place in Turkey.
Before the duel of arch-rivals between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolski's Galatasaray Istanbul around the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: "Business as usual" is required.
Even when the state of emergency was imposed after the crash in July, the government argued that the everyday lives of ordinary citizens should not be affected.
However, this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is blamed for the coup attempt.
It does not stop even before football.
Against former heavy icker Hakan Sükür, the prosecution issued an arrest warrant.
So the South Coast, now living in America, is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
South Coast is said to be supporters of preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is blamed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup attempt.
While the state of emergency initially imposed for 90 days is still valid until October, in fact this has virtually no effect on the lives of most Turks.
The late-night "democracy guards" in public places across the country declared Erdogan to quit on Wednesday.
The sport - like the whole country - is divided into supporters and opponents of Erdogan.
Especially fans of the Besiktas Workers' Club are traditionally not among the president's friends.
But what unites the bulk of the Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military coups.
That's where even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
In the postseason "Gala" there will be a special return to Lukas Podolski.
Cologne proved his sporting value in the previous season: With 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions, the 31-year-old finished his first season as his club's top scorer.
In the final game against Fenerbahce, he scored the 1-0 victory.
The newspaper "Fanatics" cheered him: "He was the best in the place."
He completed the season in an excellent way and secured his team the trophy.
Thanks to "Poldi," the disappointing season for the record holder found a conciliatory conclusion.
After the runner-up K.o in the Champions League, the "Lions" also scored early in the Europa League.
In the Süper Lig, it was only six.
The season was not good.
The trophy was the only way to win something.
"That's what we've done and that's the most important thing," Podolski said.
For champions Besiktas, the game year ran better.
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who laid the base for the 14th title with 26 seasons as a Southern League goalscorer.
This is also the reason fans continue to hope for the 31-year-old's return.
After the coup attempt, the Gomez, who was under contract with AC Florence, announced that he would not return because of the political situation in the country after his Euro holiday.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say it," the trade magazine "Kicker" quoted club leader Fikret Orman as saying.
To do that, however, the striker would have to be willing to give up on about a third of his $7.5 million annual salary, Orman stated clearly: "His salary at Florence we can't pay."
