Laws are constantly being slashed in the name of counter-terrorism.
After the recent attacks, Interior Minister de Maizière is now laying out a hefty security package.
But what does a tolerance status have to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say about all this?
Thomas de Maizière gives the conciliator.
All his proposals are "politically reasonable" to the coalition partner, the federal interior minister says at the presentation of his new security package.
They don't overcharge anyone.
Other, more far-reaching points would initially be discussed within the parties.
I am also involved in this.
As Home Secretary, however, he was keen on results and on a "recoverable consensus" within the coalition.
De Maizière took a little time to pass after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach before presenting his conclusions for security in the Republic.
But they are all the more extensive.
Some things are already known, announced, pitted: That a new security agency should take care of the crackling of encrypted communications is not new.
Nor is the fact that Germany has to implement several EU requirements on passenger data and gun law.
The call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security agencies comes as no surprise.
In part, de Maizière is launching a second attempt for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD: He wants to criminalise sympathy advertising for terrorist groups, and jihadists with dual citizenship take the German passport.
"These will be difficult points for the SPD," the CDU man conceded.
Nevertheless, he believes that this is reasonable and does not call for anything that has no chance at all with the coalition partner.
A few new ideas presents de Maizière, too.
They have it in part: He plans fast-track procedures for deportations and more opportunities to incarcerate people from deportation.
Refugees who are targeted in the country are expected to check their smartphones before and disclose social media accounts for a security review.
In acquiescing for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse than before - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to conceal their identity.
Some of this is politically and legally sensitive.
Some of the work is still unspent and leaves questions unanswered.
And on some points - in the unequal treatment of the patient, for example - the question arises: What does this actually have to do with security and terror?
Yes, says de Maizière, it's important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror.
But there is no denying that the bombers of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people were worried about safety, given the high numbers of refugees.
And things that people deeply engaged in could not be left out in campaign times as well.
Internal security has been hugely focused.
First the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The uncertainty is great.
And yes, there are election campaigns.
The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly in position on the issue of internal security.
In recent days, it has been high between the two parties.
First a garish battle over the equipping of the federal police, then via a security ideas collection of some Union interior ministers, in which departmental chiefs are also calling for a burqa ban and a move away from dual citizenship.
De Maizière is also struggling here for conciliatory sounds.
He doesn't think anything of a move away from the double pass.
We have pacified the discussion in Germany.
Remaking it doesn't make sense.
And in the event of a burqa ban, he has constitutional concerns.
Whether his own package is constitutional on all corners, and whether it is actually "reasonable" for the coalition partner, has yet to show up.
There is a lot in it that could cause controversy.
But the SPD is also currently trying to stand up on the issue of internal security.
Leader Sigmar Gabriel first signals cautious willingness to talk and says: "The SPD is willing to talk about anything that helps to further increase security."
