Greenland shark: The oldest vertebrae is nearly 400 years old
Rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually only come to the surface in winter.
This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship Sanna.
He was born in 1624 and swims with well over a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day.
Greenland sharks only get up with 150 years of offspring.
The Greenland shark swims along the bottom of the North Atlantic, and in an hour it reaches an average of just 1,220 metres.
Only when it gets on, the five-metre-long animal accelerates to a hefty 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a robotic with this top speed.
This lifestyle characterised by slowness, however, seems to be a panacea for a high age.
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal Science, at least, of a Greenland shark that could be 392 years old.
"Madness," comments Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates.
While the evolutionary biologist has long suspected that Greenland sharks will be stone-aged.
Just lacked the evidence.
Greenland sharks are hard to watch, after all, they live mainly in the ice sea off the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in winter.
About the lifestyle of Greenland sharks, researchers know correspondingly little.
They measured their slow pace when they replaced six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitsbergen.
Prey still make these sharks: In the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a robotic, another had swallowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear.
They may be chasing sleeping animals or patrolling at the bottom of the ice sea and looking for carcasses that are torched from higher water layers to the bottom.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland sharks that caught fishermen between 2010 and 2013 off Greenland or Spitsbergen as a by-catch from the depths of the North Atlantic.
The smallest shark was just 81 inches long, while the largest 502 inches measured.
To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens core of sharks using the carbon-14 method.
This center of the eye lens is created even before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it are not renewed later.
The two smallest sharks had striking a lot of carbon-14 in the lens core.
Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960 "s, when nuclear weapons attempted to inject greater quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
In the third-smallest animal, with 220 centimetres in length, the lineman, on the other hand, contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons tests, so it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday during its investigation in 2012.
All the major Greenland sharks, by contrast, had normal carbon-14 quantities in their lens core, which is caused by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon-14 watch for a 493 centimetre Greenland shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark is likely to be 392 years old at 502 centimetres.
That Greenland shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four metres, it was known.
Now, researchers of the length could be assigned an age.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres was probably on the threshold of sexual maturity and his age was determined at 156 years, Greenland sharks are obviously at least one and a half centuries old.
This, too, is likely to be a world record for vertebrates.
The fact that such methane is mainly found in icy waters is no coincidence.
Even the previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale in whose bacon on the neck put a 120-year-old harpoon top, was caught off Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on asparagus.
So they mature later - and age more slowly.
In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are often particularly large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat.
The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much greater than that of a gram elephant.
Another advantage: They have fewer enemies.
"So a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as early as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.
A very large animal, on the other hand, should invest its resources more in a long life.
