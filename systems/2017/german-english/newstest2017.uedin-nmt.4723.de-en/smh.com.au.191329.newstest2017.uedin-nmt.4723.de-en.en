Community legal centres point out 160,000 people each year
More than 160,000 of the country's aid needs are dismissed annually by community legal centres, while the industry is grappling with the impact of further funding cuts on already overstretched transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly older people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, and those who do not have funds for unfair Deloitte and the like - are being turned away at their request for free legal advice and legal counsel.
Legal services of the community, which are already overly busy, are getting ready for further cuts.
As of June next year, it is envisaged that these legal centres will lose another 30 per cent of their federal funding.
The director of the community centres of Queesland James Farrell said that the latest survey by the National Association of Community Law Centres found that thousands of people are already being turned away each year.
Farrell said that the situation would only get worse without a repeal of the federal government's decision.
"Queensland's community legal centres are chronically underfunded, meaning thousands of people are being turned away from important services you need," he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with unmanageable and crushing debts, families who go through divides, workers who have been unfairly dismissed - all these people have problems of a legal nature and this survey shows they can't get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent from June 2017, meaning thousands of more vulnerable people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the attorney general and federal regulators, as well as senators of Queensland George Brandis, to immediately lift these funding cuts so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems.
Last year, the national government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of community centres and their client communities, and that the Palaszczuk government is investing in this important work.
