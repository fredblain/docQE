Post rises in trade in electric transporters
An electric delivery vehicle of Deutsche Post in action.
The interest of other firms in the brew appears to be large.
The Post plans to sell its electric vehicle StreetScooter, too.
In due course, the corporation intends to start trading in the van.
The Post wants to offer its electric vans on the free car market from next year as well.
"We want to get into the sale to third parties," a Post spokesman said Friday.
The company has been considering for months whether to sell its self-developed StreetScooter, with the letters and packs, to be sold to other businesses as well.
Post board member JÃ¼rgen Gerdes had said there were ongoing enquiries, for instance, from tradesmen.
According to the news magazine Der Spiegel, the Bonn Group intends to enter the mass production of vehicles in the near future.
In the poaching factory, the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift.
Gerdes had announced that the corporation wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and ply a complete conversion to the eco-friendly vehicles in the long term.
"We will make a very, very robust move towards 2020," he had said in late July.
I can imagine we're going to change the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on Germany's roads since 2014.
