Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania: "Go where it hurts"
Strange Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania: Locals don't get anything from the summer campaign - and holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to vote the country day.
In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, they understood.
In 2021, the assembly election will not take place again directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided earlier this year.
Because stupid as yet, it's not: Summer holidays, heat and land election campaign - that is biting.
The locals, who are to be persuaded by the campaign fighters, are on holiday.
The vast majority of holidaymakers who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so are not allowed to choose the country day.
In addition, there are practical problems: During the holidays, aid workers who hang up posters, blow up balloons, distribute flyers and, in the end, count out votes, only to find out.
Until September 4, 2016, the election and last day of the holiday, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania will have to continue campaigning narrowly on the people.
The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.
And it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, must fear for his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls.
What's exciting is how heavily novice AfD is cutting off and what's left in the end of coalition dust.
Sellering, 66 years old and has been chief executive since 2008, makes an almost unobtrusive campaign, you can see from his big posters.
He travels through the country, handing out roses and chatting a little with the people, just as his legendary predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.
Otherwise, Seelering has got cold feet and is blaming Chancellor Merkel for the flourish of the AfD.
Her refugee policy, her "We create this" has accelerated the rise of right-wing populists, which will now probably cost him the beautiful office.
The CDU with its top job, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already seen how it is when you are campaigning in the right place at the wrong time.
She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to major rallies; Merkel's general election constituency is in the north-east.
But the target group did not agree, it was more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony there as Mecklenburger and Vorpommern.
"There was probably the majority from other federal states," complained Vincent Kokert, general secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently in NDR.
But it does not pity anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel.
Otherwise, the Northeast CDU largely abandons the usual campaign stalls in marketplaces and in front of shopping malls with parasols and balloons.
This, Kokert argues, only plays a "subordinate role."
The Union, too, has realised that it is crumbling down the ground in the country, that it has to make a great effort to find a wire to the people again.
It is like the left, the SPD, the Greens: There is little in the country's expanses.
However, the council of the CDU election campaigner Kokert to his co-workers is also self-exposing: "You have to go where it hurts, which is where the people are: Dorffeste, Golden Weddings, every birthday party must be used."
Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called his SPD into a particularly dedicated campaign.
In polls, the Social Democrats were last with 22 per cent behind partner CDU (25) and just ahead of the AfD (19).
In the 2011 election, the SPD still clearly won by 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).
The Greens, small party with seven per cent in the polls, are likely to make the leap into the country day.
They make a modern virtue out of the holiday need and largely move their campaign to the Internet.
"Online campaigning," it calls the country's president, Claudia Müller.
Otherwise, green election campaigners are embarking on track-searching for native voting citizens among holidaymakers.
Silke Gajek, the front-runner, just curls with a houseboat through the mecklenburgian lakes and still finds it beautiful.
Her impression: "Election holiday in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania is not a punishment."
