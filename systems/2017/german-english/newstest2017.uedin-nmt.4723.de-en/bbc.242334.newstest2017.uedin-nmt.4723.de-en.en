Russia and Turkey: An "alliance of outsiders"?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare an official end to the eight-month-long war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.
There was the handshake, yes.
But Putin's smile seemed shaky and he was barely radiating heat, even for his restrained conditions.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke repeatedly of his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report full five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old levels before the crisis, but will even improve.
The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have behaved as if anything bad had never happened.
To me, his enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite.
But a sustainable boldness demonstrated by Putin showed that the leader of Russia had forgotten nothing.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: The firing of a Russian warplane on the Syrian border by Turkey.
Moscow's reaction at the time was wrenching.
Putin told and accused Ankara of dropping Russia in the back.
The offence was even greater as it was committed by a would-be friend.
Rebuilding the vetoes will be difficult, if not impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media conducted a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara.
At one time, it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.
Most serious were the accusations by senior officials that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from the illegal oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He has vehemently denied this.
But in St.Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan that he wanted to hear.
Russia was able to win some sort of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are clear.
Erdogan primarily needs all the friends he can get after he was almost stripped of his office last month in a failed coup.
Repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - particularly the ban on charter flights, which typically bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has decreased by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights resume.
They count on a late-seasonal rush to the Mediterranean.
This week, state television forecast cheaper fruit and vegetables once Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.
As a report in Vedemosti put it: "Tourists there long, tomatoes here long."
But the visit had added political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West as it views its response to the attempted takeover as a weak response.
This is followed by persistent resentment over the snail's pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey's relationship with the West.
The Russian leader certainly won a bonus in Ankara for calling for support for elected state bodies after the attempted coup.
This is, of course, a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change.
The summit in this lacklustre palace on the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portray one, as one analyst once described to me, "Alliance of outsiders": Two countries that are in breach of the West and feel ill-treated and are now allied.
Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still major differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave itself the role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It could be significant that after nearly three hours of initial talks, both presidents testified at the news conference that they hadn't even leveled the issue.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize it.
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator on Syria can be found.
But after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a complete disaster, when NATO member Turkey shot down the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better for the two heads of state to at least talk to each other again.
