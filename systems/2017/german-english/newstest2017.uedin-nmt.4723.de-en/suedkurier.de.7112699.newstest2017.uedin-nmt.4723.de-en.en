Berlin / Schwerin: Poll ahead of country elections: SPD and CDU lose
In the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September) there are significant losses for the governing parties of the SPD and the CDU.
This resulted in representative surveys of the opinion research institute INSA for the Bild newspaper (Friday).
While the red-black coalition government in the north could narrowly continue to rule, this is not possible after the polls in Berlin.
In both federal states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would have a good chance of continuing to be the leader.
In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, the SPD plunged from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
The party would be just ahead of the CDU, according to the poll, which could come back to 23 percent.
Third place is controversial between the left and the AfD.
The left would be on 19 per cent (previously 18.4 per cent), while the AfD would be represented at 19 per cent for the first time in the county.
The Greens are hesitating, despite slight losses, with 6 per cent (previously 8.7 per cent) back in the weigh-in country day.
NPD and FDP would not be represented in the country with 3 percent each.
In the Berlin Chamber of Deputies, according to the poll, the poll would be only 23 percent (election 2011: 28.3 percent).
The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
It would still be behind the Greens with 19 per cent (2011: 17.6 per cent), but ahead of the left with 15 per cent (previously 11.7 per cent).
The AfD would be represented at 14 per cent for the first time in the Chamber of Deputies.
With 5 per cent, the FDP could be hoping for a return, but the pirates would miss entry in contrast to 2011.
