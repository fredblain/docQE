Improving the flow of traffic on the motorway
It stumps regularly on the bypass - here's a picture of November.
But this is about to change: The legal absentee is to be extended.
This is good news for all car ­ drivers who are in traffic on the ambient road every night when they drive through the highway ­ feeder (A 43).
The state-run road construction extends next Tuesday and Wednesday (16 / 17 August) in the area between Hammer Street and the exit of Weseler Street, the right-wing lane by 700 metres.
Motorists can then walk directly from Hammer Street on the right.
The big advantage: The traffic is divided early, improving the overall process on the busiest section of the Federal Highway 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district of Münster-West.
The carriageway on the feeder is annoying motorists especially between 5pm and 7pm.
On weekdays, the backlog extends to the bridge over the Alberslog path and sometimes beyond.
The reason is the bottleneck on the B 51 just before the exit of Weseler Strasse.
From here, traffic is channelled only one-way through the motorway bridge.
The second track had to be built back just over three-quarters years ago.
The reason: Static calculations showed that the bridge no longer has the necessary capacity to absorb heavy goods traffic in a two-way way.
How long this bottleneck and the associated day-to-day congestion will continue, the relevant national operation cannot say.
However, with years to be expected: Because the bridge has an official residual benefit period until 2034.
For the extension of the legal absentee, the country's operations deliberately selected the traffic-weaker time in the school holidays because with disabilities to be expected.
Traffic will run one-way past the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday.
