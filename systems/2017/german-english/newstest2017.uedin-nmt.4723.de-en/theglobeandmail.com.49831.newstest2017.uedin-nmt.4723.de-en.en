Adblock Plus, Facebook in "cat and mouse game" regarding ad blocking
For companies that make money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers, attempts to circumvent ad blocking are tantamount to a "cat and mouse game."
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad lockdowns on its desktop site, Adblock Plus released a blog post announcing that users could update their filters in the program to again block advertising on the social network.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop site would change coding regarding its advertising ads to make it more difficult to detect the detection of which part of the site is advertising.
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to circumvent the new codes.
In a blog post, the spokesman for Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of back-and-forth fight has already been underway between the antimised open source community and the revellers since the invention of ad blockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution.
The fact that the world's largest company has entered the fight on social media is a strong indication of how worrying ad blockers have become for the industry.
Globally, according to a study published last year by Pagefair and Adobe, some 200 million people use ad blockers; nearly four times as much in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via their mobile terminals, mobile advertising makes up 84 per cent of advertising revenue Facebooks.
The company has it on ad blockers on desktop PCs, as mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a spokesman said.
Advertising on desktop PCs accounts for a sufficient amount of revenue, so Facebook considers the investment of such a step to be worthwhile.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update its "ad preference tool" to allow people to have more control over advertising aimed at them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters would be worrying because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising.
"For users, this does not represent a positive experience, so we plan to address the problem," a spokesperson told Facebook in an email message.
Ad blockers are a blunt means, which is why we have instead focused on developer tools like Ad Preferences to put more control in people's hands.
