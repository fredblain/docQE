The US wins fourth match in women's field hockey, a showdown with Britain imminent
A day after she scored three goals during a 6-1 win over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the women's American field hockey team in a match Thursday against India that the American won 3-0.
Five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she couldn't remember having ever done that.
"I have no idea," she said.
I am not one of the people who keep their goals in mind.
However, she knows that: American women are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the Britons in the first place, who remain unbeaten after their 2-0 win against Japan.
Britain and the United States will clash on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which of the two within their group of six teams will each gain first and second place.
The first-place finish will leave the strong Dutchman a little longer out of the way leading the other group.
Whatever Saturday's game may run out, the American people have caused a surprising buzz through their success story, four years after they landed on the last of 12 seats at the past London Games.
BAM was part of that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had a hockey bat in his hands for the first time with three years (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), at 16, she became a national player of the United States, the youngest in the team's history.
She missed the Olympics in 2008 as she could not qualify for the cadets.
Then came 2012, in which everything went wrong for her and her team.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, became coach of the national team and so things started to turn to the better.
"A culture change, a mental change and a physical change," Bam said.
We didn't have the workload in London that we have now.
We've been able to grab the helm completely.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the goalless in the first half of the game with a backhand shot from close range.
India went into the game without a win in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and held the game level from 1-0 down into the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.
She performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and lured the ball into the gate to give the American women a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.
The shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the goalkeeper of the United States, Jackie Briggs, who has so far had one goal in each of the previous games.
She has a run.
Just like Bam.
"We're in a good position" said Parnham, but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday.
