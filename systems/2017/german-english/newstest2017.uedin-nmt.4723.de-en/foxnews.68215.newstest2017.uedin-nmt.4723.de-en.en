Treats want nude kalendar for "women and for men"
The Treats magazine is working with photographer David Bellemere to bring out a 1970s Pirelli-inspired Kalendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they would like to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muses Kalendar for 2017.
The editor-in-chief of Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude magazine was distinguishable from Oldschool Playboys, since "Playboy is for men."
I do this for women.
He seems to believe that the Kalendar does, too.
"We need to return to the display of timeless and classic nudity, where both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body," Shaw said in a press release on the release of the Kalendars.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a wonderful work of art.
Models can submit their pictures online or in person at open casting call in Los Angeles and New York.
