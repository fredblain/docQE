Airline not liable: Fall on passenger bridge
An airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
The High Court of DÃ¼sseldorf (Az.: 18 U 124 / 14) argued that liability is only possible in the case of dangers typical of air transport.
The plaintiff had broken a knee ligament in the fall.
However, the accident could have happened anywhere - it was a general risk of death, according to the court.
The airline did not have to pay damages to the man.
