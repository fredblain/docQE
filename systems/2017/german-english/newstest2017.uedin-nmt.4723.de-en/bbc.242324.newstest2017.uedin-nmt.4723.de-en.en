Assistant doctors strike: Calls for new labour force action
Deputy assistant doctors have called on their union to approve new labour force measures in their disputes regarding a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called on its entire council to approve more labour force measures from early September.
The JDC said that ministers had failed to address concerns about the contract.
Assistant doctors and medical students voted in July on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday evening, the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government had remained "persistently quiet" to problems, which led to the contract being rejected.
She said: "In light of this, the JDC board has voted to completely reject the proposed new contract and requested official renegotiations on all your concerns."
In response to the government's silence, the JDC board today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing program of escalating labor force action, which begins in early September.
The disputes resulted in assistant doctors striking six times this year, the first total cancellations in the history of the NHS.
The head of BMA assistant doctors Dr Johann Malawana stepped down after the election to reject the agreed contract terms that had been recommended by the BMA.
He told BMA members during the meetings, which took place even before the vote by 54,000 assistant doctors and medical students, that the contract was beneficial and should be accepted.
After the vote, the Health Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said that the contract would be forcibly introduced for doctors in England.
