A seat in the front row to the stunning architecture of the Central Library of Los Angeles
Learn more about the history of the Central Library in the city centre, as the Society of Architectural Historians / Southern California Chapter holds a salon with Arnold Schwartzman and Stephen Gee, the authors of the new book "Los Angeles Central Library: A History of Its Art and Architecture."
