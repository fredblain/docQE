Community, spirit, health: Singing does seniors well
The singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life: As a young girl she was in the school choir, in Lehramt studies she finished the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.
"Singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.
After a sample, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall more vibrant, she says.
By the way, she is doing something good for her health and her mind.
Because singing is equally from multiple perspectives a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler of the German Senior League.
Most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describes Hackler.
Through regular gathering, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts.
Because often social and family structures are solved in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "To talk down and organize, to be able to rely on the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of togetherness."
Singing can be exhausting in the positive sense, Hackler suggests.
Because in doing so, seniors exercise deep and controlled breathing.
If you ask for your lungs regularly, you don't get out of the puddle in everyday life as well.
Even when it comes to maintaining the sound of voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.
On older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Labor Association of senior organizations.
In the older generations, common singing had a much higher priority, it belonged to everyday life, both at school and in leisure, she explains.
Lenz frequently observes that singing or listening to songs in older people raises many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their adolescence.
Through lyrics and especially melodies, even dementia-stricken people remember long-running events.
When singing, the head is also required to perform a special performance, explains Lenz.
At the same time focusing on your own voice and on a given rhythm, adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.
It's just older people who live alone, so don't just focus on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition experienced by singing in the choir, according to Hackler.
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.
Self-esteem is also growing by singing in the chorus.
To show yourself: If I do for a long time for something, I will get better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens.
Good reasons to start singing, so there is enough.
If you want to try a new hobby, don't hesitate - even if he thinks they have little talent, Lenz advises.
You are not alone in singing - with 50 singing people, who hears when a sound goes next?
Looking for the right offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.
Singing someone from the acquaintance's circle in a senior choir, you can just join in.
Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.
If you want to sing in a church choir, you can turn directly to the community or the church precinct.
Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.
If you don't have access to the Internet, you can ask the family, friends or neighbours for help with the internet search.
Those keen to sing should definitely join a chorus, Hackler advises.
Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that's true of any age.
