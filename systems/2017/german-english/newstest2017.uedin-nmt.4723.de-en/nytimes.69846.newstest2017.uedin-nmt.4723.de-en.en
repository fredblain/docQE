"A generation protesting" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters demanding political changes in Ethiopia met with violent resistance from the government.
Witnesses say that tens of protestors were killed during the clashes with police during gunfire.
Is Ethiopia about to collapse?
Over the past decade, it has been one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months, protests against the government rocked the country and expanded into more and more areas.
Last week, thousands of people stormed into the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.
The government's response was ruthless, according to human rights organizations.
Witnesses said that police officers shot and killed on tens of unarmed protesters.
Videos in circulation about the protests, which are believed to be from the last or early this year, show how security guards beat young people with sticks, while these have been forced to make a handstand against a wall.
The head of the UN Human Rights Agency is now demanding an in-depth investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
After Nigeria, Ethiopia is Africa's most populous country and its stability is appreciated by the West.
American military and intelligence agencies are working closely with the Ethiopians to combat terror threats beyond the region, particularly in Somalia; few countries in Africa, if any, receive so much Western aid.
Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital, Addis Ababa.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously cited repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, with dissidents effectively silenced.
Many were sent into exile or sent to prison, killed or driven into the expanses of the desert.
But that could change.
"If you suppress people and these have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia.
All the youth are protesting.
A generation protesting.
There are numerous complaints covering everything from land use to stranglehold in relation to power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 per cent of parliament.
At the same time, tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea; a battle over this jagged, controversial line claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less defeated in recent years, could exploit the turmoil and rearm themselves.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness are now exploding after years of crashing beneath the surface.
The first seems harmless: Smartphones.
It was only in recent years that very many Ethiopians were able to communicate via social media, as cheaper smartphones were becoming more common and Internet services improved.
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, which it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies that hide where they reside.
Several young Ethiopians said that they so gathered to protest.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
Since aeons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia's predominantly Christian highlands, have prospered in politics and economics, while exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslim and live in lowland areas.
But that, too, is just changing.
"We are in the process of coordinating under an umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of Oromos.
The biggest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, who make up around 6 per cent of the population and who are dominant in the military, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years until his death on an undisclosed illness in 2012.
He was viewed as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.
Analysts say he was particularly adept at perceiving early signs of discontent and using special representatives to process opponents and make them harmless.
"The current regime lacks this fundamental skill," said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected for relatively obscure reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.
Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.
Many fear the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such a riot was in 2005, after thousands protested against elections that, according to analysts, were seemingly botched by the government and subsequently stolen.
During the subsequent raids, many protestors were killed, even though it was less than in recent months and this period of unrest went over relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction.
But it appears that this has not prevented an intensification of the internal resentment of the Ethiopian Government.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protestors in Gondar, an amhardy city, attacked Tigray, and hatred of the Tigray is becoming increasingly common on social media.
Analysts say that the protests put the U.S. and other Western allies in a peculiar position.
The American government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it has closed that base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile area.
"This," Mr. Abdi said, "is a very thin tightrope."
