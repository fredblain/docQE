Once pushed over the price from the market, cafe comes back in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby cafe in Williamsburg where you could only pay cash, which had no Wi-Fi, but served 15 years of good coffee.
Of course, prices were pushed out of his Bedford Avenue shopfront.
The business Soap Cherie, which replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of Cupcakes.
Locals mourned it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is exempt and verb is now a soap business."
But if New York is change, it's also reinvention.
A revitalised Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old cafe, who is the owner and managing director of the new cafe.
He began working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When he offered a customer to provide funds for a new outsider, he was excited to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, maintained a lot of things.
Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnishes like capers and saucy onions.
There are natural rice bowls.
The caf√© doesn't serve beer, there are fresh juices for that.
After nine months, Rodriguez said he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.
"A lot of old customers were also pushed out by prices from Williamsburg," he said.
Recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one such customer.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would take the path.
After the verb had closed, she gave up the coffee drink for a while, she said.
"It became clear to me that it was on the coffee and on the culture in the verb that I liked," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, even though she ordered a Blended Chai Tea that day instead of her usual Iced Coffee, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal has been another long-time and loyal customer since the start of the verb in 2003.
He went there before work and invariably ordered the same.
"I came quarter after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Everything-bagel with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu.
Nowadays, Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his Everything-bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said that he had no grudge about the fact that the soap business took the old business space.
In fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered to produce a special soap for verb with the cafe's cold-brewed coffee as an ingredient.
"I think we're still going to go on their offer," Rodriguez said.
And the traditional, Polish residents of Greenpoints have also accepted the cafe.
A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said that he pretends to exhibit them soon, so that his new neighbors feel welcome.
The location also has other benefits.
A local juice local would like to fill and sell the cold-brewed coffee.
There's a chance the cafe is expanding to a neighbouring building.
For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favourites.
Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said that he was destroyed on the ground when the cafe closed.
When the new cafe opened, Whitt said that entering the site and ordering a new coffee felt like a return home.
"I had to smell that," he said.
