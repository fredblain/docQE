Soprano Anna Netrebko goes open with the autism of her son Tiago - and turns to other concerned parents: "You have to have the courage to talk about it."
"Medicine has made great progress," the 44-year-old told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.
When the disease was detected in her son, she believed she had to die.
However, the now eight-year-old Tiago is well ahead and is now learning privately in New York, where there are the best therapists.
"To give an example: If I ask him something that is two years back when I sang at the Milan Scala, he remembers nothing," Netrebko said.
But he's the happiest person on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebko's connection with the bass baritone Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to the tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
