Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that's worth it
It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time staring at screens, has been lamented by many in the last decade.
Pokemon Go is about getting people off the sofa and getting more active.
The time on screen was initially on the TV, then on video games and most recently limited to smartphones.
So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.
I refer, of course, to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters first created for video games in the 1990 "s (later created a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).
Like many phenomena of pop culture, interest fell somewhat before the release of the game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that the servers overloaded.
Within days, Pokémon Go had more users than tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, the players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokémons, who are tracked down with a GPS and, once found, can be "photographed" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "captured."
A generation that played the game when she was even younger, joined the loo and jumped for the search from the sofa.
In the US, the game led to a significant rise in moves that put the "average" person back every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, told The Washington Post recently that within two days of the game's launch, the number of tracked people who train for 30 minutes each day jumped from 45 per cent to 53 per cent.
The company doesn't know who is playing Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data for performance enhancement.
Many public health awareness campaigns that want to get people to "take 30 minutes" to "get off the sofa" and "be active every day" met on deaf ears because many public messages to health are boring and come from people who look miserable.
Yet the importance of sport cannot be overrated.
If you do sport regularly, you reduce your chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it causes people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.
Some people even join in the hunt for new friendships.
As always, there are also grumpy game-changers who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could run against a door.
What's it like?
A breakthrough has occurred.
Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit have been able to track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to drive sports, as this game does.
The new will lose its appeal and the use will fade with time.
However, due to Pokemon's success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activist in the real world, helping many people in the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.
