Still, Volkswagen is coming through lightly.
Despite the diesel scandal, delivery numbers are rising worldwide.
But not in all markets it runs around.
During the recall, there is buzz around a term.
Volkswagen will start operating in the second half of the year at the time of deliveries.
In spite of its many brands and some well-run markets, Europe's biggest automaker continues to be a plus, despite its many brands and some well-run markets.
But in July, the core brand VW weakened mainly in Western Europe and again impacted overall sales, according to the company listed in the Dax.
Globally, the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles in July with 449100 cars than the same month last year.
In Western Europe alone, after China the second most important market, sales were 14 percent below the same month last year.
In the home market of Germany, deliveries plummeted by almost a sixth.
Brand sales chief JÃ¼rgen Stackmann attributed the weaker figures from July in particular to two sales days less in Europe.
In addition, there has been a buy-back in some core markets through "changing economic conditions."
In addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey, the UK voted to leave the EU, a spokeswoman explained.
In the US, where the exhaust fumes first escalated, a low is also on the rise.
Big support for VW is the Chinese market.
Overall, the mainly affected house brand of Lower Saxony is in any case further benign due to the diesel scandal: After the first seven months, there is only an delivery minus 0.9 per cent to 3.37 million vehicles.
Group sales chief Fred Kappler continued to provide a sales boost from January to July.
1.3 per cent more vehicles delivered to Volkswagen in that time, worldwide 5.904 million.
Volkswagen had been rigged with a software exhaust test.
In Germany alone, VW calls about 2.5 million cars for conversion to the workshops.
As part of the conversion, VW reiterated that the revamp of the cars did not have a negative impact.
After the conversion of the vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance.
The automaker is issuing a "guarantee" certificate to customers after the conversion, but does not speak of a "guarantee" as it was in corporate travel on Friday.
The reason is legal niceties.
The "Focus" reported that Volkswagen now guarantees its German customers a guarantee for revamped diesel models.
This would have been confirmed by VW representatives in the Federal Department of Transportation last Monday.
It was confirmed by the Department for Transport that there was this meeting.
"VW has to comply fully with the requirements of my commission of inquiry and KBA."
"Deviations from this are not accepted," Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) declared, according to the ministry.
VW has accepted the guarantee that there will be no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance after conversion and that all type-approved vehicle values remain unchanged.
Volkswagen itself does not use the term "guarantee" as it was in corporate travel.
Under the broad term "guarantee," Volkswagen sees the possibility that, for example, customers may come to a workshop six months after conversion, for example, with an engine damage - and this could be attributed to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
In the interests of the customer, it is also important to avoid that any other damage, which has nothing to do with the abortion scandal, will lead to uncertainty as to possible guarantee schemes, as has been said.
That is why VW does not use the term "guarantee."
