Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
E-mail and Internet in slow motion: 20 years ago the Nokia Communicator came on the market.
The successors dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed nearly half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it wasn't well in hand.
On the contrary, it was pretty knock-on.
The built-in memory initially was eight megabytes, which would be enough today for roughly two selfies with high resolution.
An iPhone is now shipped with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" came into business exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996 - and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age.
Twenty years ago, however, the Communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair Cebit in Hannover as an "office in Westentaschenformat."
In fact, the new mobile phone could do a lot for then standards: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax was to reach the Communicator.
Even access to websites was possible via HTML browser, albeit agonisingly slow.
A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the phone could be folded up in the same way as a laptop.
Then found a small keyboard and a black and white screen.
Pretty proud was the price: 2700 D-Mark, which is about $1400.
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was $392 in 2015.
No one could have guessed in August 1996 that the Communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.
Everything has changed since then.
The smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.
The mobile phone division of the Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster, eventually sold to Microsoft and settled.
Today, the market is dominated by suppliers, all of whom came much later than Nokia.
Always and everywhere online, this is today for a lot of people everyday.
In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.
About 1.4 billion devices have been sold, and Samsung and Apple alone account for 555 million units.
Global sales with the devices are around 400 billion euros.
This is followed by the well-running business of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies.
Around the smartphone, an entire industry has since emerged.
The crucial breakthrough to the mass market came only in early 2007, at the time Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced on Mac World the introduction of the iPhone.
He promised three devices in one: A music player, a phone and an internet communicator, all by touch screen easy to use.
Apple's winning streak began, even today the iPhone is the group's most important product.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, which dominated the market, had the sequel.
They eventually disappeared, Blackberry has struggled.
The ire now has Apple and Asian suppliers such as Samsung.
The smartphone is self-evident 20 years after its invention.
On average, every German now looks at his mobile phone 88 times a day.
"We all need to learn to move the smartphone away, too," said just Janina Ball, in charge of the Siemens board of staff.
Permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time.
