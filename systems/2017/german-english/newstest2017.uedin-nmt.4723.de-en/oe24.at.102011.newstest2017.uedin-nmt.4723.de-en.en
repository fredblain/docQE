Killed in bomb attack: He was the hero of Aleppo
He put his own life at risk to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria.
He risked everything to save others' lives.
Now the 30-year-old himself has died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the "White Helmets," a civil protection group that, according to Bild newspaper, has so far saved close to 60,000 people.
2900 volunteers are risking their own lives to draw people from bombed homes and to provide first aid in the war zone.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: A video of the civil guard showing him during an 11-hour rescue of an infant from the rubble of a house, went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrians the shining symbol in the horrors of war.
However, as a hero, he never saw himself, saying, according to Bild: "For me, this is the real jihad."
'If I'm dying to save lives, I think God sees in me a martyr. '
Just before Omar himself fell victim to an attack, he had spoken in a video about the latest bombing in Syria.
The helicopters have dropped four barrel bombs over the Alzadia district, one was filled with chlorine gas.
A woman and two children died, seven people suffering from breathlessness.
"We are now eliminating the toxic remains of the bomb so that not children play with it," the image quoted his last words before he died.
The Assad regime's deadly bomb had been intended to hit terrorists.
