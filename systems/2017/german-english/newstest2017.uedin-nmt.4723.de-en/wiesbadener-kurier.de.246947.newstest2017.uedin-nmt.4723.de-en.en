Case of illness: When paid by the organiser
Diseased holidaymakers will only get money back after their journey if the cause of the disease is beyond doubt in the hotel.
However, this is only the case when more than 10 per cent of guests have been shown to show the same symptoms.
In the negotiated case, a family was seriously ill with diarrhoea and vomiting on the second day of their Turkish holiday.
She spent almost the entire holiday in the room.
Her illness led holidaymakers to a faulty sewage treatment plant that had allegedly polluted the seawater.
The family felt the trip was deficient with this - and complained against the organiser.
In court, the plaintiffs had no success.
It is true that the treatment plant was defective.
But the organiser only learned about it shortly before leaving the plaintiffs.
He had to assume by then that the seawater was fine.
So he did not violate his information obligations, according to the ruling.
Especially since no impurities were found in the samples of the water.
The disease of several hotel guests - possibly by contagion to each other - is part of the general risk of death.
Of 691 guests, only 38 were ill.
