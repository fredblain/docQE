Cats react more sensitive than hangover on cries of juveniles
Biologists have been investigating in Hanover what effect the cries of cat babies have on adult animals.
To their surprise, this also left the males not cold - however, in contrast to the females, they always behaved the same.
Female cats can recognize the grounding level of cat babies at the mistress of the little ones.
They respond by 10 per cent faster on laughs of kittens picking up in great distress, according to scientists from the Animal Medical College and the Medical University of Hanover (MHH).
Hangovers also respond to the cries of kittens - but always the same.
"Apparently, the acoustic differences between the mistress of less and severely erratic juveniles for males are either imperceptible or not significant," said biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
She is the author of the study, published this Friday in the journal BMC Evolutionary Biology.
In a previous investigation, the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the kitten's screams differed with the urgency of their need for help.
There were a total of nine adult hangovers and eight kittens from the MHH's livestock.
They were played to a cries of little ones who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings.
On the other hand, they were confronted with cries of more erratic kittens, which were additionally uplifted.
The researchers consider their results to be meaningful despite the small sample.
"All the females, even the ones who have not yet had their own offspring, responded differentiated to the screams," Konerding said.
They turned more quickly to the speaker when that cries of the very errant kitten played off.
This ability may be incensed or developed with sexual maturity.
"One surprise was that the males reacted at all," the biologist said.
In the past, scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men to baby noises several times in humans.
Also, some studies showed that women reacted more sensitively to infants, regardless of whether they were already mothers or not, the biologist Marina Scheumann reported.
