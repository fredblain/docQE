Rain rather than stargazing: Hope for weather improvement
The weather has made the star-studded gucker in south-west Germany a dash of the bill in the night of Friday - but there is still hope.
The night was ill-suited because of clouds and rain to watch the sky spectacle, the chairman of the observatory Welzheim, Hans-Ulrich Keller, said on Friday morning.
Our hope is on the night of Saturday.
The weather is supposed to be good, then we certainly see a lot of stargazing in the sky.
The star scales are Perseids, which, at 216,000 kilometres per hour, are among the fastest stargazers.
They have their name because they seem to come from the constellation of Perseus, which goes up in the north-east.
