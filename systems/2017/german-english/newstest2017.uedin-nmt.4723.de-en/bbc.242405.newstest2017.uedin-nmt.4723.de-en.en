Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available to customers outside Scotland
The RBS brand is expected to be reduced to a back-office role, according to the bank's chief executive.
Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank has since distanced itself when it nearly collapsed and rescued eight years ago.
During this time, brand strategists have used "RBS" to protect other end-consumer financial brands.
She supported international sport with millions of pounds in sponsorship, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now it has decided to focus more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, devolved headquarters and stock market listing will switch to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already being used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for retail banking that will be given more prominence - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RSB brand will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our staff will be employed as we now become more of a bank of brands."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I am now saying that we are not pursuing global goals but local goals.
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our staff will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already said that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the visibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship.
"It's time for us to develop into the bank of brands, because how do we focus inside (we asked) to make this a better bank for customers?" The chief executive said.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we were going to be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think you will see a lot of changes.
We can launch these brands again, so I think the time has come.
