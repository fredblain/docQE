Donald Trump acknowledges ″ huge problems ″ in campaign
The US Republican leadership is plagued by massive worries about losing their majority even in traditionally conservative states.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump has now admitted weaknesses in his election campaign in the previous Republican stronghold of Utah.
A rare moment in which the normally pompous and self-confident multimillionaire expressed something like concerns, as correspondents reported.
Having thrown 16 rivals within his own Republican camp out of the race, there are now growing doubts about his success in the battle for the White House.
"We have huge problems in Utah," Trump told evangelical Christians he asked for support in major states like Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
Blaming false reports about his candidacy, he again took on his well-known media scorn.
Republican strongholds wobble
Utah is normally a safe bank for Republicans.
According to a survey by SurveyUSA from June, Trump and his rival from the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, equalised.
Other institutions see Trump ahead, though not with the distance that is common for Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also considered to be at risk.
In an interview on CNBC, Trump responded to the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton's advance again: "Just as I've done so far."
And snaps afterwards: This will "either be successful, or I will make a very nice, long holiday."
He doesn't do anything other than "telling the truth."
If it wasn't enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that's OK, Trump said.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the Trump party is said to have threatened to scrap funds to support his campaign should he not be able to present better polls.
Instead, they want to give more support to the Republican candidates for Congress.
