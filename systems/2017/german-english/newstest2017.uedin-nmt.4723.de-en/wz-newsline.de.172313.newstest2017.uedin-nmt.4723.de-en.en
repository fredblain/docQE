What the Jungle camp has to do with missing medals in swimming
Former German swimmer Markus Deibler has commented on the disappointing cut of the DSV team at Olympis via Facebook.
In December 2014, he first picked up gold at the short-track world championships in Doha, while at the same time setting his first world record.
Now, former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has faced criticism from his ex-teammates via Facebook.
"In a country where an Olympic champion gets a £20,000 premium and a jungle king £150,000, no one should be surprised about missing medals," the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page on the night of Friday.
The support system in swimming is bad, but the doping controls are very good.
In this way, we cannot compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look so closely or even operate on the subject of doping.
"I'm not saying that the controls should be stopped here," he continued.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler would have to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti-Doping Agency of Germany (NADA).
That is exactly how we should keep it with countries.
"Anyone who cannot be controlled a certain amount of time before World Cup / OS by independent inspectors of WADA / FINA may not be allowed to participate," claims the election hamburger, who now runs an ice cream shop.
