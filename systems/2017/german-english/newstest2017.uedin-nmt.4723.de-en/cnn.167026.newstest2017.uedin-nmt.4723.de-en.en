Why We Need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I imagine under the women's Olympic team in the turkey and that for more than a reason.
First, I've been at every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.
And second, this team has three turners, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who were inspiring for many young girls of other skin color.
The structure of this team, which is Aly Raisman, who is Jewish and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the United States.
It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
In the last four years, number one among female turners has been an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.
That shows strength.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion and America cheered.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez as they delivered unexpected, yet masterful gymastic routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American who won gold at an individual multi-campaign event for women.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We're seeing the top of this sport, but that's how gym classes across the country don't look out of place.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all struck the same path as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.
They are the "last five" because the next Olympic team will have only four turners in the team, and this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainee.
But the reality is that turkey is an expensive sport and Turner is primarily in private gym clubs, which are maintained by parents who pay for the training, deployment, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the coaches and their Turner and families).
The majority of these gym clubs are in affluent suburbs that can support the business.
In these clubs, Turner will receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started with the turkey.
We need to provide the communities of countless, young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a more affordable and easily accessible gym.
I started my gym foundation of 20 years.
At my events, we have offered free and affordable turkeys in Harlem for over 15,000 urban young people (mainly black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer youth high-quality turkeys that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Turns develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for educational and professional success.
It's the inspiration of this team to get thousands of young girls to be interested in the turkey and that's great.
It's so important to participate in sport, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real portrayal of "Girl Power" by the Holen of the Olympic team golds and thank you, fass her so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
