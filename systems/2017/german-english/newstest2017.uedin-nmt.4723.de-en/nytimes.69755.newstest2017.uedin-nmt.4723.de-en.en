Military leaders falsify ISIS intelligence information, notes committee of Congress
Military personnel from the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than it would have allowed actual conditions on the ground, an investigative committee of Congress reported in a report on Thursday.
The preliminary report, created by a task force of Republican members of the Armed Services Committee, Secret Service commenters and the conscientious objector, reported huge dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how precincts changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against Islamic State.
The Central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Intelligence information typically gendered by senior CENTCOM commanders regularly recorded a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism than it would have allowed actual conditions on the ground and were consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence services," a newspaper article quoted the report as saying.
"What happened at CENTCOM is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when poor analyses are presented to our political leaders," Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives, noted.
The leadership flaws in CENTCOM extend to the top top of the organization.
The 10-page report shows detailed persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.
Although there is no direct evidence that government leaders under Obama have given instructions to alter the reports, it shows how analysts faced pressure from their pre-laws to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, opinions and statements before Congress were significantly more positive than the facts," the report noted.
For example, a CENTCOM member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, remains under the control of Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, so much is clear," Mike Pompeo, Republican congressman from Kansas, said in a statement.
From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the leaders of Central Command changed intelligence reports to downplay the danger posed by ISIS in Iraq.
Republicans launched the task force after they were told that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.
The report, published on Thursday, will still be completed by more detailed findings while the investigation continues.
In addition, further investigation of the CENTCOM reports by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Defence is underway.
Democratic members of the intelligence committee released their own findings on Thursday, which agreed with some of the Republican task force's conclusions.
"In 2014 and 2015, CENTCOM created an overly restricted process for creating intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi security services," the highest-ranking Democrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, announced in a statement.
That process, Mr. Schiff said, "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," damaging the morale among analysts and "gave overly little room for dissent."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they found no evidence of an intervention by the White House at the CENTCOM analysts regarding a "certain political opinion."
The preliminary results of the congressional investigation were published on Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon's inspector general, which was recorded following complaints from CENTCOM analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a press officer at the Pentagon, admitted in a statement that the Defense Department would not comment on any reports from Congress, while the inspector general's investigation is still underway.
But he also admitted that "experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Department of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense."
The investigation has repercussions beyond the issue of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim now made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).
However, last year's accusations have raised questions about how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
Criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of more than a decade ago, when a CENTCOM analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document about how the then government under George W. Bush, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, provided only a small occupying force in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against current coverage of the Islamic State.
Last year, the team around Mr. Hooker notes, according to government agencies, that contrary to the government's statements, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would not have a significant impact on the financial position of the terrorist group, as these temporary refineries would have been in operation to sell oil on the black market.
However, that finding was not released, the Times reported in September.
Centcom's then-commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
