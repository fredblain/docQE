NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
Venus was likely once habitable, according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to discover Venus's past using tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, watery surface and carbon-dense atmosphere, might once have had Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously hinted that the slow turn of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus may have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and yet slowly turned on.
The model also illuminated the topography of early Venus.
The planet probably pointed to more dry neighborhoods than de Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to house lives and protected against rapid evaporation.
The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 per cent matter.
"In the Giss model simulation, the slow turn of Venus exposed its day side of the sun for nearly two months," Giss scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the sun's heat.
The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those of Earth today.
The model spawned a history of Venus that resembles the evolution previously believed by planetary scientists.
Although it was once believed to be habitable, Venus -- over the course of several billion years -- was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans darkened and their water vapour was burned away by the ultraviolet light.
As her hydrogen escaped, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide was left with a deadly greenhouse effect -- Venus, which as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.
