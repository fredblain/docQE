Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
Thus, in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg, the city on the Main has the best chance of attracting jobs and firms from London.
"It's very likely that Frankfurt will benefit the most from the Brexit vote," says Michael Voigtlands, head of the IW's competence field and property markets.
After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether financial institutions will be allowed to continue to operate from London from financial operations across the EU.
For the so-called EU passport, they have so far been granted authorisation in the UK.
That's just using big U.S. banks.
Several banks have already announced plans to shift jobs.
The lobby association "Frankfurt Main Finance" expects 10000 new jobs on the Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, according to the IW, the seat of the European Central Bank (ECB), which combines responsibility for monetary policy and oversight of the eurozone's largest banks, as well as other key authorities such as the European insurance watchdog EIOPA and the Risk Board of ESRB.
In Paris, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has its headquarters, but it is less important for the financial industry than the ECB.
"The proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate so directly with supervision," says IW professor Voigtlands.
Luxembourg has a large fund industry, but, like Dublin, it is worse off when it comes to infrastructure.
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport.
In addition, the city has easily accessible commercial real estate.
"In Paris, it's not so easy to find free high-quality offices," Voigtlands says.
In addition, on the Seine, rents for first-class commercial real estate are 50 per cent higher than on the main.
In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good health care and infrastructure, as well as less crime.
In a ranking of consultancy Mercer, the city stands at number seven, Luxembourg at number 19, Dublin at number 33 and Paris at 37th place.
Even though quality of life is a matter of preferences: "With its already strong position as a financial location for the European single market, Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors," the IW concludes.
London, however, will remain the main financial centre in Europe despite the Brexit vote, the economic researchers say.
There is also the balance of power: In London, according to figures from Landesbank Helaba at the end of 2015, some 144,000 people worked in the banking sector, and in Frankfurt there were 62500.
