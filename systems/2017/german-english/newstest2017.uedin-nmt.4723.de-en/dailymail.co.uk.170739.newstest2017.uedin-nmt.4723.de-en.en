How to protect yourself with Krav Maga from gun attacks
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make him a little safer for you.
We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, a grandmaster of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at near distance.
Regardless of whether you're approaching you from the front or from behind, this video will show you how to turn the mirror around for your robber.
If you look at you from behind, you should first turn around so you can see your attacker and "get out of the firing line," Mizrachi says.
Then seize the gun between your front arm and your shoulder before hitting him in the face with your free elbow.
Then beat him with his knee in the bar and twist, while the assailant curls up in pain, put the gun out of his hands, beat him with the run in the face and move backwards while they put the gun on him.
With attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the firing line, seize the gun and twist it, so the attacker can't shoot.
At the same time, shift the weight to the gun and beat the attacker on the chest, then twist the gun out of his grip before moving backwards and turning the gun on him.
Sounds difficult?
Watch the video to see exactly how it predates Mizrachi.
But remember that in the case of a robbery, it is safest to hand over your money - unless you are a Krav Maga grandmaster.
