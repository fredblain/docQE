Bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian woman injured - Multiple deaths
The Austrian embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, Thomas Schnöll, said Friday morning.
She suffered cuts and had been treated in hospital but has already been able to leave it again.
Their journey home was planned for early September.
It is still unclear whether the further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket, as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon, are still unclear.
The State Department is in constant contact with local authorities in this regard, according to Schnöll.
In the roughly 200 miles south of the capital, Bangkok, Hua Hin first exploded two bombs on Thursday night in a nightlife area.
According to police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
Friday morning, then again, two explosives went up, while another man was killed, according to the authorities.
A bomb explosion was also reported from Phuket in the morning.
A taxi driver was injured during the detonation near the seaside resort popular with holidaymakers, according to police figures.
In Surat Thani on the south-east coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing an urban employee.
The explosive device went into the air in a flower frame in front of the repose of coastal police, according to the authorities.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast as well as in Chumphon on the south-east coast claimed several casualties.
You go from a link to the explosions in Hua Hin, they said.
"The bomb blasts carry the same handwriting," army general Danai Kritmethavee told journalists Friday morning.
'We assume it is a coordinated attack. '
It is too early to comment on possible motives - but it is probably the actions of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also wanted to identify a pattern in the attacks that is typical for the bomb blasts of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
Thai police, on the other hand, said the attacks were not related to the Islamist insurgency or with international terrorism.
"This is just local sabotage, which is limited to limited areas and provinces," a spokesman in Bangkok said.
On the contrary, it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta.
Authorities have received intelligence evidence of imminent attacks in the south of the country in recent days - however they have not been informed of the exact timing and locations.
It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.
Police instructed their officials across the country to step up security around key government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.
There are always minor bomb attacks in Thailand, but they are usually not directed against tourists.
In Hua Hin lies a palace used for years by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
Following today's bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends that the Thai security authorities follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities.
High security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla, as well as Preah Vihear and surroundings.
After confrontations between security forces and Muslim populations, there is no need to travel to these provinces.
Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.
This gives the military great influence over the coming years.
Junta leader and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to incite chaos, while the country was moving towards stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.
The military unta, which had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, is self-sustaining, bringing the kingdom back to stability and order.
However, the military has also failed to get to grips with the insurgency of Muslim rebels in the far south of the country for years.
More than 6500 people have already been killed in the conflict.
Just over a year ago, 20 people were killed in Bangkok in an attack at a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.
It was the bloodiest attack in the country's recent history.
