Witnesses sought: Drink market invaded in forest broil
A robbery has been carried out on the drinks market of Rewe XXL at Waldbröler Gerberstraße on Thursday night.
Under preoccupation of a firearm, three dark-clad people who had conjoined their faces demanded the release of cash from the employee of the drinks market and then fled first on foot and then presumably with a silver-coloured VW Golf.
How much money was extracted is not shared by the police.
The perpetrators are believed to have been between 1.60 and 1.70 feet tall, so relatively small.
The beverage market is directly accessible and poorly accessible from the parking deck of the Rewe market.
After the raid in the direction of Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg, the perpetrators must have fled from the car park opposite the car park entrance with the silver-coloured car, possibly in the direction of B 256 (Schladernring).
Anyone who made observations at the time of the offence (at around 7.45pm), which is in connection with the robbery, is expected to report to police as a matter of urgency.
