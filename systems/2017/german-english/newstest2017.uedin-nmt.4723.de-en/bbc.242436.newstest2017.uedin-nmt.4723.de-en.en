Russia's Putin flaunts Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly sacked his chief of staff, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of Putin's closest trust group for many years.
The 63-year-old has been appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
In a statement from the Kremlin, it says that Putin, without giving reasons, "ordered the dismissal of Ivanovs from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration."
Anton Vaino, who had been Ivanov's deputy since 2012, was appointed his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he made his degree at the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the embassy in Tokyo.
On the Kremlin's website, it says (in Russian) that he was later a protocol chief and chief of staff of the government staff.
Speaking about his appointment, he said to Putin: "Thank you for your confidence."
I think that it is the government's most important task to support your work as Head of State regarding draft laws and controls on the implementation of your instructions.
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Convince the smiling faces?
This move has mystified Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of the closest confidants of Vladimir Putin and works as he does for Soviet intelligence, the KGB.
As chief of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which aired on television, both men claimed that the chief of staff was resigning at his own request.
But despite the smile for the cameras, few are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So is this the result of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows at the moment.
But the official claim - that a man once touted as a potential president at one time wants to guide Russian environmental policy - met with great skepticism.
In his remarks to Putin quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said "it is true that I asked you in a conversation in early 2012 to entrust me with this very complicated post - you could almost say - arduous post for four years.
As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took the post in December 2011.
Previously, he was deputy prime minister and defence minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the State Security Service KGB.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB) that replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov as one of five people he most trusted.
It was once assumed that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin's second term, as Putin's third term would have violated the constitution.
But that post was taken by another, close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before becoming president three-and-a-half years later.
