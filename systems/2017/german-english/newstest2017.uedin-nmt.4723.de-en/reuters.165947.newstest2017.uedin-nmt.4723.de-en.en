US-backed troops say they have regained full control of Manbij from Islamic State
U.S.-backed troops have recaptured full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city left them, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
The Democratic Forces of Syria (DKS) comb through the city after the excerpt of the remaining group of fighters buried inside the city.
They have freed over 2,000 civilians held hostage by the militants, Sharfan Darwish of the Manbij Military Council, allied with the DKS, told Reuters.
"The city is now under complete control, but we are just carrying out clearances," he told Reuters.
