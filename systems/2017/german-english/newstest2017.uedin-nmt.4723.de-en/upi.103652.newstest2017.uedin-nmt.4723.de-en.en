Kepler measures rotation rate of stars in star pile of plejades
The latest mission with the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates under the stars of the Plejades.
The new data will help astronomers understand why stars in starlings rotate at different rates, as well as in what context the rotation periods are with the planetary formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The star pile of the Plejades is 445 light-years away from Earth.
Many stars in this star cluster, which emerged about 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.
They are turning fastest now.
At peak rotational rates, these mature stars emit large amounts of star winds.
As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a slowing effect on the stars.
When a star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a discernible stellar fleece -- like sunspots --.
The latest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars turn more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with larger stars turning slower pirouettes than smaller ones.
"In the" Ballet "of the Plejades, we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said.
As the star pile of the plejades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates.
"The starlings of the Plejades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
There is still much in front of us that we would like to learn more about, such as how, when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and, so to speak, hang their "dance shoes."
Rebull and her colleagues have reported extensively in three newspaper reports on their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Plejades, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
