Police use tear gas & rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to demonstrate against the government's reforms to the public education system.
Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The difficulties began when police officers tried to disperse students, resulting in police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their dismay at the plans.
According to proposals from the governor of the federal state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, slightly fewer than 100 public schools will be closed, while 300,000 students are being implemented to save money.
Some of the protest participants saw graffitits against interim President Michel Temer spraying on walls.
The recent protests occurred a few days after protesters took to the streets in crowds to support suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been removed from office by a Senate vote on her dismissal.
