Restful night: Tips against sleep disorders
In the evening, you walk around forever, at night you wake up for hours, in the morning it is no longer possible to think of sleep well before the Weckerringing.
This is far from relaxing.
After all, you are in good company with such problems: According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than 10 percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing.
What about sleep problems or sleep disorders?
There are several forms of sleep disorders, and they can be based on a variety of causes, says Hans-Günter Weeß, Executive Director of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
What you understand landly underneath, though, is the Insomnie, that is, an entry and sleep disorder.
It is precisely this sleep that many people find unsatisfactory or insufficient, says Jens Wagenknecht, a member of the board of the German House Medical Association with practice in Lower Saxony.
What's behind sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
This can include organic, psychological or behavioural factors, as well as medicines.
Not infrequently, the sleep disorder is an expression of another disease.
"Very early waking is especially common in a depression," Weeß says.
And it may be that different factors are interdependent.
If you have a bandwagon, for example, can be bad, wake up every two to three hours, and may start to grate about everyday problems and worries, Weeß gives an example.
This leads to strain, and sleep is no longer possible.
When should I go to a doctor with sleep disorders?
If you don't sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is impaired on the day, you should go to the doctor, Weeß advises.
The impairment can look quite different: One is cut off, tired, unspent, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily delightful, has mood swings or physical ailments such as stomach or headache.
To ease the sleep disorder, it's important to find out their causes.
Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioral therapy, or even medicines - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks.
Low-level sleep doctors hardly exist in Germany, says Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical centre of the Charité University Medicine Berlin.
Therefore, in the case of sleep problems, you should first contact the family doctor, Weeß advises.
The can deal with investigations into whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should go to the sleep lab, and what happens there?
To study in the sleep lab, physicians advise, for example, in snoring with breathing enforcers, at sick day fatigue, at sleep converters or if you don't find the cause of a sleep disorder, Fietze explains.
You don't really have to prepare for the inquiry.
You should spend the day normal.
"Just please don't do a midday sleep," Fietze says.
After dressing down, you go to bed at his normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body, one wears a nose brille, a chest strap and a faucet on the finger.
In addition, a camera on the ceiling records the sleeping.
How can people get to grips with the problems?
There are quite a lot of job cuts where you can start for a better sleep.
What counts is: Regular sleep and rest periods, not being in bed for too long, do not sleep on the day, do not watch TV to fall asleep, avoid alcohol and do not look at the clock at night - then you start to reckon immediately, and that is not conducive at all.
