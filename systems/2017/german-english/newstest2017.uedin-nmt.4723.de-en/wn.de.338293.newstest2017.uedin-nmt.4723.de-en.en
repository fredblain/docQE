Intercultural travel: Cultural offers for schools
The international class of forest school attended the play "The invisible house."
The club NIMA's and the Young Theater are now planning a music project.
The association NIMA's enables young people with an immigrant and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Class International" of the Waldschule Kinderhaus has attended a presentation of the award-winning play "The invisible house" of the Young Theater Münster.
In the context of the "intercultural journey" initiated by the association NIMA's, 19 students between the ages of 11 and 15 attended the staging at the Little House.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which aims at the cultural integration of young people with an immigrant and refugee background, has been offering schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project.
Most young people in the class have come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016, among others, from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria, and speak little English.
Thanks to the choreographies, the Shakespearean images and video animations, they were able to follow the course of action, according to the press release of the boy Theater Münster.
The association NIMA's, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel, and the Young Theater will work together in the upcoming season as part of a musical theatre project.
From October to December, young people with and without an escape and migration background between the ages of 14 and 20 will be given the opportunity to attend professional courses in the fields of singing, dance, acting and music.
Offers for children and families in the area of theatre play and theatrical language mediation are in the planning.
The "Intercultural Travel" project continues.
Given the increased numbers of refugees, the association is counting on many classes that want to participate.
