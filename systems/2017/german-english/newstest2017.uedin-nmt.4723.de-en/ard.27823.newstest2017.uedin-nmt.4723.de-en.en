Clinton's and Trump's economic policies in comparison: It's all about the money
Invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade deal - that's what both Clinton and Trump want.
However, the two US presidential candidates are divided on tax and energy policy, as well as on a matter of principle.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is based on a fundamental, more philosophical difference.
The, about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns about how the state can hurt the economy - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.
He himself, by contrast, would be very different, Trump claims.
He will drive back regulations massively, and he is pushing for far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for businesses.
Clinton, by contrast, says: The state has certain tasks to perform, he has disadvantaged opportunities to open up and needs money for it.
That's why taxes would be increased for the rich, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to the issue of infrastructure.
In the need to be invested, Trump and Clinton say almost eloquently.
The Democratic candidate is even announcing the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II.
Government investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are strongly opposed, for example, by the state-critical Teaparty wing of the Republican Party.
So on Trump, there could still be bipartisan discussions.
The differences in energy and climate policy are clearer.
Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and ramp up coal production in the United States.
Oil production is also expected to be possible in previously protected areas, the Paris climate change agreement he wants to announce.
Clinton, by contrast, explicitly wants to expand renewable energy with her investment programme, demanding: "A country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs."
'it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be. '
But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart.
TPP, the Trans-Pacific Trade Agreement, both do not want to sign.
At the same time, however, both do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply to better protect American jobs.
Those are then also expected to be paid better, asking about Clinton.
The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a pittance.
He wants to increase it to $15 an hour.
What Trump wants to do on this issue is not entirely clear: Once he says: The minimum wage has to go up, then he says he should not be changed.
But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more about the tax policy of the two camps.
On one side is Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth.
His critics keep telling him that would only increase the budget deficit.
On the other hand, Clinton, who at least wants to require the rich to pay more tax, and whose critics say: More tax is not the solution either.
