Here comes the Enforcement trailer
Germany's turf will have to adjust to the next generation speed gauge: In various federal states, including in Hesse and Brandenburg, new flash devices are being tested, which are supposed to transfer tempos particularly effectively.
The futuristic Enforcement trailer of the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used, for example, at accident areas where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, at motorway construction sites or to rehabilitate bridges with a temporary speed limit, there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that the speed limit is observed.
However, a permanent mobile build-up can be too dangerous or time-consuming.
The Enforcement trailer is self-sufficient: Its battery lasts five days during uninterrupted measurement operation, the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem.
With laser measuring technology, all vehicles can be captured simultaneously across multiple tracks.
Variable speed limits as well as transit bans by time, lane and vehicle class can also be monitored.
In the high-risk state, you can move the trailer, according to the manufacturer, with each car with a hitch.
So that it is not simply cloned, it is lowered in the measuring operation, so that the wheels disappear in the armoured and, by the way, even shadowy outer shell.
In addition, a built-in alarm system is designed to protect the Lightning from vandalism.
Since 2015, the trailer has been tested in different federal states, according to Vitronic, and has now been used.
Foreign authorities are also blushing with the new technology: Recently, France has reordered 100 pieces, following an order of 150 pieces last year.
