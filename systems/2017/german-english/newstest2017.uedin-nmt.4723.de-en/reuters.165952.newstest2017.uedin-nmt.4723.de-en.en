Clintons earn $10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton released her tax returns for 2015 on Friday, which resulted in an income of $US10.75 million for the Democrats' presidential candidate and her husband, and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charities, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton generated nearly $US5.3 million in speaking fees; the former secretary of state gave an income of $US3 million from publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her tenure at the State Department.
Clinton's candidate for the vice presidency, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, is publishing his tax returns of the last 10 years, along with his wife, Anne Holton.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency," Clinton campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri admitted in a statement.
In a stark contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and backers in relation to his previous promises to release his tax returns.
It is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, although they are not required by law to do so.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have indicated a tax audit by tax authorities as the reason for his denial.
"They're on the train," Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams wrote on Twitter, in reference to the release of the Democrats' presidential candidate.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's special adviser, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish anything before the tax audits are not completed.
Trump's critics, including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, have already vowed that his refusal raises questions about wealth, his donations to charities, his business conduct, and various other connections, particularly with Russia.
Clinton has already toppled on the issue and released a video on the internet on Friday in which high-ranking Republicans are urging Trump to release his tax returns.
On Thursday, she also addressed the issue during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and publish his tax returns," she said to the crowd.
Politico has reported that Trump paid no or very little tax during the 1990s for two years, and a business journalist at the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advisers on Friday, saying that this could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become an issue in the campaign.
Clinton supports a settlement named after the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, who would ensure that people who earn more than $US1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During a campaign event for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska called for Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate has his seat here, to exchange Trump to a meeting to discuss their tax returns.
Buffett said he had also been subjected to a tax audit of the IRS and that Trump was "afraid" of voters rather than the tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has released tax returns dating back to 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid on average an effective federal tax rate of about 32% between the years 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
The Clinton's tax returns of 2015 showed that these were only $US100 of their income as a wage, unlike most of all Americans.
Their main asset was a low-cost index fund, from which the Clintons taxed dividends and earnings of $US109,000.
