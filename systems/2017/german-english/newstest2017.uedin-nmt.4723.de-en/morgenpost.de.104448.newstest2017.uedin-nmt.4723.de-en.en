CSF leadership resigns after disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK swaps its boss Matthias Hartmann.
The resignations came suddenly - but not entirely surprising.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK foresaw that the chair of Chief Executive Matthias Hartmann becomes all the more uncertain the longer the successes he has promised.
Turmoil at the top of the Nuremberg market research firm GfK: After again disappointing business rates and the resignation of corporate governance, the industry's world number five is facing a human fresh start.
CSF's CEO wants to leave the company at the end of the year.
The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board, Arno Mahlert, is already leaving the supervisory board with effect from 12 September.
The leadership on the board already takes over the previous board member, Gerhard Hausruckinger, as of 1 September, the company said.
He is expected to officially take over the function of a "CEO" until a successor to Hartmann is found.
As a result of the resignations, the company cited "different views" on long-term business policy direction.
Details declined to name a company spokesman on Friday.
Who will run the market research company in the future is still unclear at the moment.
In investor circles, it was said on Friday that there was a great deal of disappointment among shareholders about the continued success of the restructuring that began years ago.
Mr Hartman has been at the GfK top since 2011.
"The fruits of the restructuring, however, are still not visible after 5 years," it said.
Given the recent poor GfK business figures, each shareholder will eventually be unsettled.
"If that were the case with BMW, that would also make the quandts that way," they said.
The company had also been unable to stop its losing drive in the second quarter of 2016 after setbacks in the previous quarter.
At $361.2 million, sales were up 6.1 per cent below the level of the comparable year-on-year quarter.
Related to the first half of the year, sales shrank by 3.4 per cent at $721.2 million.
Profit in the second quarter mainly impacted the company's lowered value in the face of its difficult economic situation.
The company value write-off of EUR 139 million, which was necessary in the Consumer Experience Division, gave the Group a loss of EUR 148.2 million.
In the second quarter of 2015, GfK still generated a net profit of 19.7 million.
