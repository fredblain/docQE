Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee officer
Annika Deuschle is the contact person in terms of integration and organizer.
She is also a social worker on the ground.
Since July, Annika Deuschle has been the refugee officer for Urbach.
The social educator supports the management team of Achim Grockenberger.
She sees herself as a contact person for all actors: Refugees, Labour's refugee agency, administration, authorities and anyone else involved.
Regine's customer from the work group suggests that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the icy wool milk sau, which mainly has a problem.
So some - less spotty than rather aimed at the multitude of desired areas of responsibility - meant when the administration wanted to tender the place.
An administrative expert has been sought with a talent for languages and people, combined with many years of experience in the field of social work.
But administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deuschle.
Above all, it is about organisation, working with the people on the ground and also behind the scenes as well as network activity.
The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.
It has limited a 50 per cent point to three years.
"It was prime time," says Regine's customer, that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time actors.
There are large and small problems, organisational, human and communication problems.
Soon, new containers are in the water road
It has been a serious problem for some time to find housing for the connecting refugees that have been recognised.
Local authorities are responsible for the follow-up.
They have to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living spaces.
The cost of building, renting or renovating these shelters must be borne by local authorities themselves.
The responsibility changes from the estate agent to the municipality and job center.
Problem: There are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been very difficult for some time.
De facto, the administration does not find private housing.
So far, it is not working, relying on private housing, according to Deuschle.
Therefore, public housing must be taken care of, as it is so nicely called.
So new containers will soon be erected in the Wasenstra√üe.
But only with apartments it is not done.
Perspective is the cue, Regine's customer and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to a permanent lead, there are internships, training places, school places, one-euro jobs and relief activities for refugees and migrants who need to be folded or set up.
"More places would be good," Regine's customer reports.
Many work in the building yard or help house masters, do charitable work - and that's motivated and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports.
It hopes that work for the community will lead to a positive external impact.
This is "no employment therapy."
Activity, however, does not just mean work.
The day needs a fixed structure, say Deuschle and customer.
People need to develop a sense of belonging.
So there need to be offers like sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
So here, too, administration and volunteers are jumping in.
It's central that the refugees feel they are wanted and welcome in Germany.
The long duration of the procedures is a problem.
You have to explain to the refugees that it just takes and they can bridge the time in a meaningful way, for example with language courses.
If you eventually develop the feeling, he can't help anyone in Urbach, should not work and be unnerving, who will never integrate.
The clear majority is motivated.
The work of Deuschle and the customer is therefore always to motivate others.
All of this is already a "mammoth task."
A difficult question: Do the two have fear of radicalisation after recent events, even in a small community like Urbach?
"No," says Regine's customer quite clearly, "which some may call naive," but a residual risk cannot and would not rule them out.
However, the aid workers are already aware of this.
These incidents are also an issue among refugees.
Those would have the fear that the bombers will bring them completely into disrepute.
"They want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine's customer.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
So primary and volunteers must look for activities on the ground and in the region.
In doing so, they always have in the background that soon a new blast of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.
Does Germany need a ceiling?
To answer this question clearly is to shy away from politics.
Actually, it's unfair to put them helpers on the ground.
"In Urbach, we have not yet arrived where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would ease the situation.
Regine's customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher is already busy integrating the existing people in a reasonable way.
These are currently around 100 people, mostly young men.
But when people are in need, you need to help them, both women agree.
The political world is so complicated, there are no easy answers.
