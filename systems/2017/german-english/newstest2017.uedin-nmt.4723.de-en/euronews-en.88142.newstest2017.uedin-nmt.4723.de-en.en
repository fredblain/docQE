London schoolgirl who joined Islamic State was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join IS, reportedly died in Syria.
The lawyer, Tasnime Akunjee, said that her family learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
It was believed she was killed by a Russian airstrike in Raqqa, the bulwark of the group in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and died, according to her family, shortly after she pretended to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
"One can only hope that the only good thing in it is - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war zone - stopping people from ever making that decision," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London stepped into a plane towards Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultanah's family have been told she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months.
