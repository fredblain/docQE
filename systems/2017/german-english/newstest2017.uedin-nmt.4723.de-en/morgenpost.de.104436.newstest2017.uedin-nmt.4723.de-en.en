Trump sees the threat of election defeat not so tight
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a campaign event in Florida.
If there is nothing to do with the election to the US president, Donald Trump already has an alternative video.
He then just goes on holiday.
If Donald Trump loses the US presidential election in November, he would be relatively indifferent: "Ultimately it will either fold, or I have a very, very nice, long holiday," the Republican candidate said in a phone interview with US television channel CNBC.
If it wasn't enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that's OK, Trump said.
So he described US President Barack Obama and the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton, as the founder of Islamic State (IS) militants.
Within his party, there was more and more resistance.
