Gilead receives legal costs from hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A U.S. District Court judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc was entitled to the refund of the legal costs incurred by her from the Hepatits C legal battle with pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was freed from a $200 million compensation payment for the violation of two patents by Merck, which was related to the blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead, after a U.S. judge uncovered a pattern of misconduct on the part of Mercks, including the Meineides and other unethical acts.
In collecting the lawsuit on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead was entitled to enactment of the costs incurred while defending the case.
Merck is trying to equalise with Gilead, which dominates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and took ownership of laboratory work involving Sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead's drugs.
