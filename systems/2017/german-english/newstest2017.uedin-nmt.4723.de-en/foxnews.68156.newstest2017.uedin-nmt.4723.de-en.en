Reid says Clinton will remain as a candidate for the Supreme Court in the case of an election victory at Garland
Harry Reid, leader of Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell believes that the next president will appoint the successor to the late judge on Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reid said Thursday during a conference call that he expects Clinton to select Garland "with a degree of certainty."
A spokeswoman for Reid later said that he had not yet spoken to Clinton whether she would nominate Garland and he was speculating.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team would not cause unrest with a new candidate.
Garland is the chief judge for the U.S. appellate court for the District of Columbia.
RAID said Republicans who blocked Garland's nomination are Lakers and heroines of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also noted that Donald Trump is unsuitable for president.
