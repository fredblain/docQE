Destination records: Who is actually buying records?
Lonely middle-aged men love plates.
Before you rush to the comment section to oversow him under the pseudonym non-AlleEinsamenmen's middle age with harsh insults, this statement derives from current data.
According to YouGov, the much-talked-about revival of records is not due to a boom in millennials who want to embrace the news of physical items, but on midlife nostalgia.
Those who recently bought a record are likely to be aged between 45 and 54.
In fact, the 18-24 age group is the most unlikely buyer group.
It's also no hordes by amateur collectors - it has an emotional meaning: Older record buyers tend to keep their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time on their own (69% vs. 66%).
But are the results of YouGov?
If this blog were a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I was running in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest grey suit and sitting wildly, holding my hands and saying something like: "So, let's take a closer look at it."
So, let's take a look at it.
Even though the heart of Sohos is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where once independent sellers were based - there are still a handful of fantastic record specialty stores.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and spirits through observation.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (data count: Two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (data count: Eight men of middle age, one woman, presumably around the 20), is a day out because of a meeting in London and going through the shops to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
"I guess so," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, shown above (he sent me the snap by email, I didn't follow him home), dress up the walls of his living room.
The reason he owns such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: He is now able to buy plates he couldn't afford when they appeared and again bought items he sold when he was young and bankrupt.
"A lot of things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12... things where I was probably a little too young to buy them to me," he says.
He agrees that those who buy plates are more introverted and happy to spend time on their own, adding: "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.
That's my loner.
WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes many customers he meets apply to the YouGov profile.
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people being influenced by the media dog, people who have heard about the comeback and are prompted to buy their old records again.
From the conversations I have had, people usually got rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records again, "he says.
That would explain the boom to supporters of the record revivals of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional importance of records?
It only takes a few seconds in a business like Phonica to recognize that record stores offer a reassuring community of like-minded people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers took offense at the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record hulls, from items that wake up happy youth memories.
"I think sometimes it can be the filling of an emptiness or possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation," says Wez.
This is the case with me as a collector and I think that's the case with a lot of people.
It's an easy way to engage mentally.
"We're like their social workers!" Infuriated an employee from a record stack.
A survey by the ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to them.
The survey also found that 41% own a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record don't own a record player.
At this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried while blowing through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data count: Three middle-aged men), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revival.
"Someone only recently came in here and said," I don't own a record player, but I'd love to buy a Radiohead sound plate so I can put them on the shelf, "he says.
This is not a large percentage, but it definitely happens.
More product-based, less music-related.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not older ones, who are only slowly getting in.
Fopp, which has dedicated the records to almost an entire floor, has a bungled audience when I go in.
There are couples around the 70, tourists who take photos, teenagers and middle-aged women.
Even though the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the above deals - Wild Beasts's latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz drunks from the speakers - it's good to see such diversity among customers.
None of them look very lonely, but niggling psychological traumas are hard to determine if you're standing next to someone 30 seconds long.
Elanora, 27, has been running around in the business for a few minutes and considers the variety of records for sale.
She is more likely to do a shop shop than a big buy.
It doesn't deserve much, so collecting records is not a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It's easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of plates is... "she drives off with a loving sigh.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I give the appearance of wearing jeans hotpants, I watch a group of young teenage girls grouped around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter consider buying a Crosley record player.
To the left is a stairwell, a wall full of plates by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: A mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are only purely decorative, some so far up, that it is impossible to touch them.
It's pure "record art."
But considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain about.
It's no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends most on luxury items such as plates.
Even though my research showed that the results of YouGov are true, they do not take into account, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors who exist in reality, record stores and in online forums.
These people probably work hard at school or in offices.
They certainly don't spend their Thursday morning strolling through record shops of Berwick Street and the leaves through plates, while avoiding the startling look of an uncanny, 30-year-old fake presenter who towers over the shoulders of nothing suspecting middle-aged men.
