Salzburg's "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare year, the Salzburg Festival will present the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic daredevil, similar to Romeo and Juliet.
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: The "West Side Story," Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.
The artistic director, Cecilia Bartoli, wanted to bring the musical to the Temple of the Classic and fulfilled a youth dream with the role of Mary.
In the orchestral dig the Simón Bolívar orchestra led by the venezonal conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm," he shrugs.
We always say that it is very Latin American.
There are a lot of Latin American ingredients in their pace and their tune.
It's a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say that we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this staging, Bartoli plays an older Mary.
She remembers with grudge to her loved one with Tony, while the younger Maria plays and dances.
The role of Maria has always fascinated me.
First, because she's musically extraordinary!
And then there would be Mariah's personality.
She says it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright."
So she is wise, of course, naive, and very passionate.
"She resembles me very much, my Italian character, which I have as a Roman in," laughs Bartoli.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It's such an honour for us to work with her.
She's an immensely generous man.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
Conducting is a necessity for him.
You see it in every one of his movements, in his looks, it's his life!
It's such a huge opportunity to be able to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a more southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a cheerful approach to life, which is very important at all!
For American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the "West Side Story" is highly topical: "This piece is about prejudice and fanaticism."
Today we have the refugees, at the time the Puertorians went to New York, and the New York residents didn't want them.
It's the same issues, and they're just as meaningful today as they were then.
59 years later, the play is still relevant.
