Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid
His experiences on the horse are manageable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer, with some colleagues, was looking for a bit of variety with a walkout on the beach.
For the 58-year-old, it was a first.
Chio: 'Golden sports pyramid' for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses were reminded of their holidays, they joked in the fast gallop home to the feeding comforters.
One kilometre at that pace, I've been scared.
"It wasn't a good experience," Langer says.
And that ended the riding career again.
On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament victories - was back near horses.
He left with his family over the plant of the ALRV, on a horse he swung not even for photo purposes.
Long was the first time in Aachen and therefore also at the CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
German Sport Relief handed over to the man from Anhausen as part of a small gala the Golden Sports Pyramid.
The likeable athlete is not lacking in awards.
Federal treasurer, silver laurel leaf, Champions Tour player of the year...
Even the British Queen has already adored him.
Langer is the 18th winner of the sports pyramid.
In Aachen, he met the first prize winner, Hans Günter Winkler, on Saturday.
"This award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it is awarded not only for sporting successes but also for social engagement."
For decades, Langer has been promoting the young.
And so he also gave the prize money of $25,000 right away.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time U.S. Masters winner was inducted into the "Hall of Fame of German Sports" on Saturday.
Among the excluded are athletics Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, Turner Eberhard Gienger, the fussy Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumper Alwin Shockemöhle and posthumous handyman Erhard Wunderlich.
Many of these sports legends had come to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrious company wandered into the jumping stadium, where the Lavazza price ran.
Bernhard Langer kept distance to the big animals.
