Escape: "Every winged woman has experience of sexual violence"
Sexual violence is almost an everyday occurrence for women who flee on their own.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatised.
A house offers sanctuary.
Four women sit in a large kitchen.
Each has a baby that is no more than a year old.
One has put her little son in his arm.
He guesses with big eyes curious in the room.
His mother stares at the table plate.
Until she realises she's watching.
She smiles briefly and kisses the little one.
The scene looks normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is division manager of Condrobs, a carrier for social support services in Bavaria, and deals with the issue of women on the run, among others.
The four women in the kitchen have fled.
They live in Munich's north in one of the few decentralised shelters for all-fleeing women and their children in Bavaria.
In January, Condrobs opened up the facility along with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid.
It has recently been officially opened.
Sixty people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
Men don't exist - even as visitors.
The exception is a guard at the door.
"It's not an exaggeration to say: Every woman who arrives here has made experiences of sexual violence on her escape," Bahr says.
"Men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically, because they face torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as hopes," she told me.
In women, there are other reasons for the escape: "Many secretly steal from it because they see no other way out."
In their homeland, they have experience of sexual violence, forced marriages, honour killings, slavery or forced prostitution.
That's what drives them.
On the run, this continues.
"The fact that smugglers are asking for a sexual act for a bottle of water, for example, is not uncommon," Bahr says.
And the women are on their own, they are not protected by their families.
Those who believe that the end once they arrive in Germany are mistaken, Bahr tells us.
Again, single women in refugee shelters would often be considered inferior and abused at worst.
As a result, about 90 per cent of women living in accommodation in Munich's north are traumatised, she estimates.
'Some of the children are certainly not born voluntarily. '
A lot of women are so used to saying they don't say anything.
'or they don't dare to talk openly about the experience because the shame is too big. '
Since they often don't know to help, there needs to be more accommodation only for them, Bahr claims.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for housing refugees.
On the question of whether they knew of a similar project as in Munich in their area of competence, some say no.
In the Oberpfalz and Oberfranken, for example, there is no such thing in government accommodation.
Even in Swans, winged women alone are not housed separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press secretary of the government.
In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Central France, there are floors or houses only for single women and their children.
The exception is Lower Bavaria, where there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men.
In a study published for the committee, it said: "It is very important that men and women are housed separately."
"Lack of privacy or being able to accommodate men and women together can lead to - continuing - violence against women."
In particular, the washrooms should be separate and easily accessible to women, the study says.
How much women feel this need for protection can be seen in the crowd that exists on the house in Munich.
"Since getting around that it's us, we have a long waiting list," Bahr says.
You could easily make up a second house.
