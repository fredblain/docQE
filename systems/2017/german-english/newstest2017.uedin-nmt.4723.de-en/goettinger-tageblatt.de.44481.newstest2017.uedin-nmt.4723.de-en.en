The Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee requires rich savers to pay punitive interest rates in the future - as a second institute in Germany.
Bank chief executive Josef Paul said on Thursday: "It's only about 139 customers who park $40 million on current or day money accounts."
The Federal Association of German Banks speaks of an isolated case and does not see it as a signal: Ordinary savers "should not be afraid to pay for their asparagus penalty rates."
Store banks money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they have to pay their 0.4 per cent penalty rate.
This fee requires Raiffeisenbank Gmund from September from private and corporate customers for deposits over $100,000 on current or daily money accounts.
'the first £100,000 is free. '
"The next 100,000 will cost $400 a year in the future," Paul said.
He has been wary of £40 million for some time, which could be relegated from one day to the other and which he could not exploit.
"Those lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 per cent costs," the bank chief said.
'i can't put down for every £4,000. '
In accordance with the 'polluter pays' principle, the costs will now continue.
Leaving the cash simply in the safes of the Raiffeisenbank would be far too dangerous: "I've already experienced four overs, I don't like the fifth!" The bank chairman said.
Most customers would understand and switch to other forms of investment.
Few migrated to other banks.
The Cooperative Association of Bavaria stated: "The ECB's extreme monetary policy rate is causing significant costs for all banks."
Carrying it alone is "economically not possible on a permanent basis."
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or credit transfers.
With punitive interest rates on deposits starting at $3 million, the Thurston People's and Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land had made headlines with its Skatbank branch in 2014.
Michael Kemmer, chief executive of the Banking Association, said: "We do not expect retail customers to have to pay blanket fees for deposits, so competition in Germany among banks and savings banks is far too strong."
One banker said that at Tegernsee there is "a clientele that is a little more exuberant by the wealth."
"This can become a problem for a small bank" if it hunted for free money.
The cooperative bank Gmund, founded in 1911, has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Ewen, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
Well-known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region.
The Cooperative Association of Bavaria "is not currently aware of any other banks that charge an outlet rate for deposits from retail customers," spokesman earnest said.
The President of the Federal Association of German People's Banks and Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), Uwe Fröhlich, said at the end of June: "The threshold of going negative towards the private customer is very, very high."
The competition is tough, and it is threatening the exodus of investors to the competition.
Customers in Germany won't like that in width.
