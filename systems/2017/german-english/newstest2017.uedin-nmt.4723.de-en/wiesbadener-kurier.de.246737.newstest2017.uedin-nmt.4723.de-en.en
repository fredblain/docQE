One for all cases
Honda HR-V is flexible and all-consuming
In the small HR-V, Honda wants to pack everything: A little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan.
Sounds quite overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.
Although the only 1.60m high HR-V looks rather small, the passengers have a lot of space both in the front row and in the rear, it doesn't work closely at any point.
The materials of the interior are well-processed and look pleasant, only the cockpit top falls slightly.
More versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR-V in the storage space.
It's not just a trunk of 453 l at high-placed and 1026 l at overturned backrests available, but there's the "Magic Seats."
This is less magical than it sounds: The backbench seats can be folded up like cinema chairs, offering storage space that is 1.24 m high from the ground up to the ceilings.
The boot is well loaded, but the charging height of 650 mm is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1.6-litre diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in a wide speed range.
However, he is likely to do his job a little more quietly.
Pleasing is the daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km.
There is another engine: A 1.5-litre petrol with 96 kW / 130 hp.
A four-wheel drive is not offered.
Driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamism and comfort.
However, the steering is likely to be a little more direct.
The equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the tested top variant "Executive."
The security systems include the City emergency brake assistant (working up to speed 32), the collision warning system and the track assistant.
The collision warner sometimes irritates because, at Rangers, he assesses many obstacles as "approaching objects."
The remote light assistant works very reliably.
And the smart speed regulator responds to traffic character recognition and throttles speed when needed.
However, full connectivity is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, Navi, app integration and more.
Two USB and an HDMI socket are under the armrest and are therefore somewhat awkward to reach.
The roughly $29,000 for the well-equipped top diesel is fine.
Those who don't want to invest so much will receive the petrol from £20000, the diesel from £23,000.
The engines meet the Euro 6 emissions standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
