Simone Biles creates gold in women's turkey
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all that.
Dynamic on the jump horse.
Effortless on the beam.
Stunning on the floor.
Absolutely brilliant.
And now, finally, Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American turkey yelled to the multi-match title on Thursday and widened the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympics.
Their overall score of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the silver medallist and "Final Five" team mate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medallist Aliya Mustafina.

Biles is the fourth heterosexual American to win a multi-game title and overall the fifth, while consolidating her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.
She broke down in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment came to an end.
This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who has brought their sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated her sport the last three years, winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a mix of ambition and precision that the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Rescue told her that she is "the best turner I've ever seen."
It expected it to be a final test in Brazil, a contest that didn't go so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between it and a load of outsized expectations.
Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be considered a disappointment.

Biles picked up the first medal Tuesday while serving on the farewell party of retiring team coordinator Martha Karolyi as an exclamation point.
Although Biles insisted, during her long walk on the lead, never planned the future, that's not really true.
Part of their ground exercises - which include her typical Tumbling pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the road outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
This is no coincidence.
This girl, who was adopted by her grandparents as a young child and discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the gym where Boorman trained, became a force.
She has not lost a multi-match contest since the summer of 2013, a winning streak that will last as long as Biles wishes.
Even though Mustafina easily led by two turns, the picture was trending.
Floating beams and ground turkeys - in which Biles holds the world championship title - lurched.
She picked up again with 15.433 on the balance beam - and still put one on it with a 15.933 on the floor.
Raisman gently hugged her as she awaited her Endergbnis - a mere formality - and tears poured on Biles's brilliantly red, white and blue Eyeliner as the vision she once described in her collection book became a reality.
Raisman's performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago, when she struggled for third place, but the bronze medal in a Tiebrake went to Mustafina.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, dubbed "grandma" by the Americans, had a head start.
After her ground exercise, she accused the audience of Kusshunds, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed doubtful.
As for Biles, the fast-spreading tweet of the 19-year-old from earlier this week has a whole new meaning:
