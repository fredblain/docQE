Supercup: Barca with concerns about Sevilla
Sevilla - FC Barcelona are fighting for the first step to the first title win in the new football season on Sunday.
The Catalans compete in the dugout for the Spanish Supercup against FC Sevilla, the replay rising three days later at the Camp Nou.
The doublewinner has to give up in the crofting dinner with the outspoken Cupfinalist and ruling Europa League champion among others on Neymar, who is disputing the Olympic football tournament with Brazil.
Also missing is Goalie Marc-Andre ter Stegen.
The German suffered a blizzard in the knee in training, making the one-on-one issue at Barca, at least for now, cleared in favour of Claudio Bravo.
The Chilean International and Ter Stegen have been competing for status as number one in Barcelona for two years.
Coach Luis Enrique has so far refrained from making a clear decision in this respect, leaving Bravo in the league, but Ter Stegen takes the lead in most of the remaining contests.
Before the first must-win of the new season, at the Spanish Masters, there are doubts about the fitness condition of the team, which was humiliated at 0-4 on Saturday in a Test match by Liverpool.
Even at 3-2 in the Probegalopp against Sampdoria on Wednesday, Lionel Messi and co still didn't really know how to convince.
Sevilla, in turn, have to digest the 2-3 defeat after extension in the European Supercup against Real Madrid and is aiming for the second triumph at the "Supercopa de Espana."
Barcelona, with eleven successes so far, are the record winners in this competition.
