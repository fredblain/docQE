Police: 3 victims shot in serial murder case during music hearing in car
According to police reports released on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot dead, who died in one of the deadliest attacks for a decade in the first serial killing of Phoenix while they were staying in the car and listening to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis's daughter Maleah were shot on June 12 while the car was parked in a driveway, authorities said.
The offender fired eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, is read in the report.
Police said that the triple murder did not appear to have been the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900, which was owned by one of the adult victims.
Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard's police spokesman said that the shootings led investigators to take a closer look at whether it is linked to four previous attacks.
In total, seven people were killed and two others injured, mainly in Hispanic neighborhoods within four months in nine attacks.
"It is happening in a residential area in front of a house," Howard told KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, earlier this month.
It is believed that the suspect used several vehicles, including a brown Nissans from the late 1990 "s, a black BMW from the late 1990" s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to her injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis's daughter Maleah still died on the ground.
A witness told police that it was not unusual for her to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
Authorities also released a police report on the shootings, aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and assumed it was the work of the serial killer.
Investigators found patronage and secured a bullet from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine room.
