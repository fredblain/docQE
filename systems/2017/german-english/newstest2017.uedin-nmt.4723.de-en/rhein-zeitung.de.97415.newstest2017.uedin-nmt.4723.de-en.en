Councillor decides unanimously: No Kioskneubau at St Goarer's Rhine bank
Normally, the St. Goarer investment projects by tradespeople with Kusshand - the retail sector in the heartland is considered to be significantly expanding.
However, the City Council unanimously rejected the request for the construction of a sales kiosk on the banks of the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rheinbalkons under construction.
"In principle, we welcome new tradespeople, but at this location in an exposed location on the banks of the Rhine, this kiosk does not fit in," explained Michael Hubrath for the CDU group.
