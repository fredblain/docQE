Building ground in double pack
With issues around building, the council has focused on the most recent meeting.
With relief, the panel took the message from Mayor Robert Putz that "finally the marketing of the recently designated residential areas can begin."
The sale of land in the residential areas "Straslweg" and "Schönau-West" (Binderstraße - expansion section 1) is no longer an obstacle to the sale of land in the residential areas "Straslweg" and "Schönau-West."
The local council is convinced that the building areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schönau address young families and troubled seniors alike.
As it was said, builders can now report to the town hall, about the awarding of the plots, the council is expected to advise at its September meeting.
In order to be able to comply with requests for the settlement of other commercial enterprises, linked to job creation, the local council decided to amend the land-use plan, which was only re-created in the spring of this year, in sub-areas.
For example, in the area of Unterzeitlarn, the industrial area already designated there is extended by two plots in the direction of State Route 2112.
