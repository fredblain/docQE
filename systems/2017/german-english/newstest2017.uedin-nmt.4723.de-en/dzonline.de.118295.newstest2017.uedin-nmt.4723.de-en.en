Olympics: Triple fraud in doping test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary commission on the case.
Kenya's athletics faces mischief after the second doping affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
After a fraud attempt at a doping check in the Olympic Village, Kenya sent a coach home.
The International Olympic Committee was told to immediately set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official had been told that the former sprinter and current coach, John Anzrah, gave a urine sample in the Olympic Village under the name of the 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich.
This was reported to Kenya's team management by the doping inspectors.
The world governing body IAAF has asked the IOC for information about the case to initiate its own investigations, an IAAF spokesman said.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent actions of the IOC, the IAAF will make an assessment," they said in an IAAF statement.
"He (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and turned out to be Ferguson Rotich, cast and signed the sample," explained Kenya's chef de mission Stephan Arap Soi.
He was in possession of the athlete's accreditation, which was on the list for the training controls of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
Ferguson Rotich had become World Cup fourth over 800 metres in 2015 in Beijing.
Four days earlier, Kenyan athletics delegation chief Michael Rotich was withdrawn from the Rio Games.
He is said to have informed against money-paying athletes from his country about pending doping tests.
According to media reports, he is said to have been arrested on his return at Nairobi airport.
Kenya has been under special observation at the IOC after numerous doping offences.
In announcing the more than 2,000 doping target checks set up by the IOC before the Rio Games, it has been unusually pointed out beforehand that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are being targeted.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country before the Summer Games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was passed a few weeks before the Olympics began.
As a result, WADA took Kenya from the list of countries whose doping control is compliant with WADA rules.
Kenya is considered a great runner nation.
The country's athletics won the most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.
In a series of television reports by ARD, there have been repeated accusations that doping funds are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a significant mentality of sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he employed them in Russian athletics.
It has been shown that this sport has been widely and systematically doped in this sport.
Russia's athletics were subsequently excluded from the Summer Games.
