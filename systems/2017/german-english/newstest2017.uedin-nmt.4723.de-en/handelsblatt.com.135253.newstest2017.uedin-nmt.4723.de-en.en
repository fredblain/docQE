Despite Olympic disappointment: Martin remains combative
Despite his disappointing appearance in the Olympic time race, cyclist Tony Martin doesn't want to be let down.
"I continue to keep the World Cup in view, stay confident and continue to fight," the 31-year-old wrote on Facebook on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro.
He doesn't have an explanation for his miserable 12th spot on the sugar rush.
"I honestly find it hard to comment on yesterday's time drive," Martin remarked.
He had to calmly analyse the reasons for the debacle.
At the October World Cup in Qatar, Martin actually wanted to fight for the title.
'i'm going to look at everything we've changed in recent times. '
"This includes my position," wrote the three-time time-driving champion, who had lost on Wednesday on the 54.5 km more than three minutes to Olympic champion Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland).
