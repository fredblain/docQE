Jewish director smashes Berlin hotel because Israeli preselection was removed after 'Arab' call - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media call after he revealed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list an Israeli preselection as it had "requested" Arab guests, according to an employee.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah" left his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel's pre-election list.
However, the country was not listed between the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and deleted?
Wrote Lanzmann.
Instead, the Kempinksi Bristol offers a way to choose Israel through its own call center.
According to a statement, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The response he received there "shocked him," as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel worker said that the measure was a "deliberate decision by the management of the Kempinski Hotels."
The reason behind it sparked even more anger in the director.
"Most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the preselection be deleted," Lanzmann's employee was quoted as saying.
Israeli Ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great shame," the Süddeutsche Zeitung reports.
We were appalled and dismayed by this event.
This is really very shameful.
The fact that this has happened in Germany in precisely this hotel chain is an even greater shame.
This needs no explanation.
We expect the hotel to "draw the right conclusions," the appointee said.
The incident sparked a pretty big response on the internet, where people called the whole thing a scandal.
Some told the Kempinski Hotel that it would have "caved in" to the alleged calls of Arab guests.
"Ashamed of you," it said in another post, noting that the hotel, located at the noble Kurfürstendamm, is near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly dismissed all accusations of himself and called the incident an "oversight" and "apologized" at Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reports.
"There has never been a direct instruction" not to include Israel in the quick-vote list, "the Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman for the Kempinski Hotel as saying.
It adds that the country preselection has now been added.
