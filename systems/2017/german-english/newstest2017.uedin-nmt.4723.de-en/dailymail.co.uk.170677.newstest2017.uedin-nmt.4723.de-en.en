Culture of Political Correctness allows electoral fraud to flourish in Muslim neighborhoods
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year at the instigation of a government report for corruption
A culture of political correctness has meant that widespread voter fraud in Muslim communities is knowingly ignored, as a damning government report revealed today.
Former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles is verbally attacking the police, election observers and town halls for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse due to "over-sensitivities regarding ethnicity and religion."
The former minister for integration and local government, who is now an anti-corruption king, said that intimidating voters from religious motives would be so bad that police should be allowed to set up shutters outside polling booths to protect intimidated voters.
He recommends that voters should carry an ID to prove their identity in elections.
At the moment, a voter only has to name his name and address.
The report suggests not wearing removable ink on a person's finger when they cast their election vote to prevent anyone from voting twice.
Whistleblowers should be given more protection, says Sir Eric.
He calls for the press to have more access to community records and decisions from non-official committees or working groups.
"This serves not only against electoral fraud, but also to protect local government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that comes with it," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlets election scandal in east London.
Last year, a special electoral court ruled that the current mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from his office after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman "would have perverted" the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical manner" and that he would have silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobic abuse.
Rahman is said to have "run his campaign on the basis that it is the reliever duty of Muslims to elect him."
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the consequence of an imitation where a person chooses as someone else.
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud across the country.
He was particularly alarming about the fraudulent briefing - where older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice.

His report said: "As evidence has been given that pressure has been put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, particularly women and young people, to vote according to the will of the elderly, particularly communities with a Pakistani or Bangladeshi background.
"There were concerns that... state institutions had knowingly ignored such behaviour as a result of" politically correct "oversensitivities regarding ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric spoke to 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including the ban on political activists editing briefing papers to stop "election harvests."
The report, which is being considered by Theresa May, also requires tougher registration reviews to prevent the electoral register from being used on immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask voters before the election according to your ID.
Don't use removable ink on a person's finger as soon as they cast their vote to prevent anyone from voting twice.
Carry out systematic reviews of a person's nationality to ensure they are eligible to vote.
A three-year limit on requests for an automatic postal vote.
Ban that political activists process full postal elections and envelopes of postal elections.
Give the police the power to set up shutdowns around polling stations.
A change in the law that facilitates a charge of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Ban on photography at polling stations.
Requirement that only English can be used in the polling stations (with the exception of Wales).
Intensifying training to ensure that staff enforce the rule that voters go to the polling booth on their own.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that no criminal charges have been filed after the Tower Hamlets case.
"The electoral court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy to be unfit due to a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.
He was found guilty for a number of reasons, in accordance with the high requirements in the criminal proceedings.
He also criticizes the ineffective "abortion controls" of the town halls "electoral registration departments.
Sir Eric said: "The court ruling in Tower Hamlets from last year was a warning signal.
Our country, as the mother of parliaments, has a proud heritage, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial by some authorities threaten this reputation.
