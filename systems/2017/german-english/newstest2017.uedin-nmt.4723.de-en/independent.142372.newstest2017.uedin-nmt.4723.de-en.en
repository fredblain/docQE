Britain picks up silver in 7-yard rugby after Fiji Masterclass picks up gold
Britain's impressive performance at 7-under rugby came to an abrupt halt at the final hurdle in the form of the Fijis in the final on Thursday night, when they were beaten with a score of 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave a masterclass in handling, side-stepping, follow-up, line running and raw power to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was sweetened by the not-so-bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth that day - and they could well be proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The Boks' significant defeat, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall back on them in the final.
But regardless, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team at best in this form.
It could be a consolation for GB - but it probably won't - that at least one Briton will have a gold medal hanging around his neck tomorrow: Fijian's head coach Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult path behind.
Eight years ago, they lost under Ryan every game at the Adelaide Sevens.
Here, they lost only one.
This setback will hurt, but the progress is amazing.
Fiji started miraculously and allowed the attacks to hit GBs out of fun.
It felt for the captain, Tom Mitchell, and co, as if running into moving buses... the World Series winners went 5-0 up when osea Kolinisau ran out in the corner.
With still four minutes of game time, Jerry Tuwai added yet another attack from the right corner, which he converted.
12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.
A howling Tackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain from man Leone Nakarawa to score a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute, JASA Veremalua leaped a touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the restart and there was still over a minute of game time... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou prepped through more weak tacklings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a goal.
The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.
It is as if Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB is still learning.
So it is.
GB introduced fundamental changes at half-time and closed the Fijian gap... for a whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half until Josua Tuisova ran through after a brilliant interim play by Fiji.
Dan Norton started a try for GB, making a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went on for a long time in favour of the South Seas, whose fans sang, flags waved and danced in the public gallery.
It was not hard to admire the playful approach of Fijis.
Mata Viliame set up the i-bag with another try in the final seconds.
The pantomime sounded, the Fijis embraced and GB kickstarted damning beaten into the turf.
Earlier in the day, Fiji defeated Japan in the semi-finals at 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa out of the race in a tight semi-final match - Britain's conversion of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the Boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal under the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late Tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-side team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.
