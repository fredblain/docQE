Patrick Roy resigns as coach of Avalanche
Patrick Roy stepped down as coach and Vice President Of Hockey Operations of the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday and introduced too little co-determination in the team's decision-making process.
Alternatively President / General Manager of Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed that decision and noted that the club will look for a new coach immediately.
"Over the last three years, I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Hockey Operations of the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," the 50-year-old Roy said in a statement.
I've been thinking for a long time and a lot over the summer about how I could improve this team to give him more depth, need it and bring it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the coach and Vice President Of Hockey Operations must be perfectly matched to that of the organization.
He must also have a co-determination right in decisions that affect the team's performance.
These conditions are not being met at the moment.
Sakic, who had hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions for the team.
"Patrick informed me of this decision today," Sakic said.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future.
Roy was named the best coach in the league during his debut season at the Avalanches in 2013-14 as the winner of the Jack Adams awards.
He led the club to 112 points and on first place in Central Vision, but Colorado was beaten in the first round of Minnesota's playoffs and missed the post-season in each of the two final years.
The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 mark in the 2015-16 season and fell behind the Wild for a second wild-card spot in the Western Conference by five points.
As a Hall of Fame goalkeeper, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two plays with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
