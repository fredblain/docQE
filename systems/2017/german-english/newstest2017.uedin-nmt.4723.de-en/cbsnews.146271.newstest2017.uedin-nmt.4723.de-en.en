Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: 'It will be better'
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But like the least of his age, Edmund has microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder about which his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, knew nothing during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, I'm not able to do that.
I don't manage that.
I didn't engage in that.
Which is not true at all -- of course you got into it, "she said.
Her husband Vincent and her have been told that Edmund will never be able to recognize them in some circumstances and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far as to propose to institutionalize him.
"My first response to that was' I didn't know that people still do, '" explained Picciuto.
Edmund can run with the help of a walking aid.
Edmund could not sit or crawl until his third year of life and he still can't speak.
But he is slowly making progress.
He can run with support and bike rides.
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund devised for "Please sing me something before."
"We bring him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not a typical sign language -- she says. Edmund invented some characters on his own.
Microcephaly has a variety of causes: Genetic as with Edmund, as well as infections with viruses such as measles or the Zikavirus during pregnancy.
The symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it will affect the lives of those with the Zikavirus infected.
Picciuto remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I asked all the time, what will happen?
What will happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven't asked for the forecast for a long time because I don't expect them to really tell me anyone.
But Picciuto has a hopeful piece of advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zikavirus.
It's going to be better.
You know it will be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
