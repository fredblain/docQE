Chimps: Burglars sought by helicopter
The police helicopter flew different areas for about an hour - unsuccessfully.
Two unidentified men forcibly entered an apartment in a dormitory in the Lindenweg at around 8.50am on Friday morning.
The resident surprised the two and struck the inquest into the escape.
The two men were about 1.65 to 1.70 feet tall, probably masked, wearing both Bluejeans and black hooded pullis.
They fled towards the city centre.
For the search, police deployed several strike crews as well as a police helicopter.
The search proceeded without success.
Possibly, the unknowns before the fact fell close to the apartment or during their escape.
