Olympics 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
Caught: Because of a positive doping test, weightlifter Adrian Zielinski may not start from Poland in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympics are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.
An evaded athlete would have almost won a medal.
Before the seventh day of competition, the first official doping cases have become known as the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-metre obstacle runner Silwia Danekowa of Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski have been tested positive and ruled out in Brazil - just before the start of the already critically acclaimed athletics contests, these messages come at an unstoppable time.
In the case of Chen, last Sunday, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazid was shown to be used as a masking tool for doping substances.
The International Sports Court of CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympics on Friday afternoon local time.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old finished fourth in the final over 100m butterfly, only by 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.
On Friday, Chen would have been expected to take part in the precincts over 50m freeway.
Chen has requested the opening of the B sample and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
The national federation takes the matter "very seriously and requires Chen's full cooperation in the investigations," Xinhua quoted from a statement: "We will cooperate with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the ruling."
For the first time in history, it is no longer the IOC but the CAS responsible for sanctioning athletes with positive cases.
Also on the night of Rio, the news leaked about the positive sample at Danekowa, saying the 33-year-old went on the offense himself.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," saying this was "an incredible shock," she told Bulgarian TV station BNT.
She is innocent, "the only explanation could be dietary supplements," the athletics explained.
According to the report, the banned substance is said to be the blood-doping drug EPO.
Danekowa was provisionally suspended, according to BNT, the B sample is also said to have already been positive.
Bulgaria's Prime Minister Bojko Borisov immediately spoke with criticism of the athlete.
"I don't understand why athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said: "We Bulgarians are under observation so many have already been ruled out."
For example, all weightlifters from the chronically doped nation are not allowed to participate in Rio.
On Friday, the case was also known as "Adrian Zielinski," the London-based Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg, as his brother Tomasz tested positive for the anabolic steroid Nandrolon three days earlier.
Both deny the intake, but both are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg.
Before the start of athletics, especially the Danekowa case is another major blow to the reputation of the entire sport.
The world governing body, IAAF, had banned the complete Russian team except for an exception due to systematic doping, including the runner-up Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio.
In addition, in the swimming sport, the earlier offences in China had caused fierce clashes between the athletes as well.
So Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang harshly.
"Sun Yang pinches purple."
"When I see the podium over 200m freeway, I want to pass," Lacourt said on French radio.
Sun was also at the centre of a confrontation with Australian Mack Horton.
"I have no time and no respect for doping fraudsters," this one said.
Sun had tested positive for the stimulant trimetazidin in 2014 at the Chinese championships, but only had to sit down a three-month ban.
