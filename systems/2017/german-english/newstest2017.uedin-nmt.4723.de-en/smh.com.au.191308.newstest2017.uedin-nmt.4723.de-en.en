Future of Portland's melting down due to lifting of energy contract questionable
The future of Portland's aluminium smelting in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs from workers - is at stake, as the plant operator will terminate the energy supply contract and thus lift all supply contracts, according to the supplying energy company.
That move followed the government's decision in Victoria earlier this year not to award any further subsidies to operate the facility.
A subsidy set for 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs at Alcoa's plant in Portland are at stake.
No fewer than 2,000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure.
In addition, there could be knock-on effects, as the melting process consumes about 10 per cent of the total power generation Victorias consumed.
In 2014, Alcoa completed the Point Henry melting, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa's melting in Portland is losing money and risking closure.
This move follows years of speculation about the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the electricity price for the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminium smelter with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, said that it assumes that three other owners will terminate their contracts.
The plant is in the majority possession of a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and Japan's Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
"AGL assumes the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity by melting," the company said.
AGL continued to say that the contracts are so-called "backup operations," which should have come into effect from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period so they will end in 2017.
"As a result, AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenue in fiscal year 17," the electricity supplier said.
Any potential impact on AGL's revenue from FY18 is currently limited by forecasts of strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said that it had already written off the value of the contracts in its annual total of $187 million in "expectation of a termination."
Alcoa said that the decision to book out the contracts did not impair the "ability of Alcoas... to do the melting or to ensure the power supply to the melting."
The US company said it completed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which should have come into effect from November this year, even though it is still guilty of an explanation as to why it resigned from the contract.
Analysts are warning of the industry's poor economic conditions ahead of the possible closure of the Portland melting plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.
Referring to the analysts' statements earlier this week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes about 600 megawatts and Tomago about 900 megawatts of electricity each year.
If both plants were to disappear from the market, that would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [electricity market].
And for us as generators, that wouldn't be good, "he said.
