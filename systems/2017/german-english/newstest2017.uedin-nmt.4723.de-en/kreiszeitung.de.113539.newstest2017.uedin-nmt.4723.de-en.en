The issue of doping continues to make the headlines at the Rio Olympics.
Russian swimmer Julija Jefimowa, who had been suing her starting right just before the Games after a doping ban, was mercilessly booed and booed at her start (100 metres chest).
It offered a bizarre scenery: With a set smile, she was still stumbling into the hall and had provoked with her appearance.
When determined that she was not going to fetch gold, the audience erupted into a jubilant storm.
But there are still numerous other athletes to launch despite doping past at the Rio Olympics.
Here's an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100m relay / USA): The 34-year-old is among the most controversial figures in athletics.
He had already been banned two times for doping (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his spell, the 2004 Olympic champion and former world champion has been running even faster than before, he is the number one in the world over 100 metres in 9.80 seconds and is considered the biggest challenger to Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100m relay / Jamaica): The two-time Olympic champion and seven-time world champion had to sit down a six-month ban in 2010 after she was shown taking the painkiller oxycodon.
She had strong toothache after surgery, defending the 29-year-old.
Sandra Perkovic (Diskus / Croatia): In 2011, the 2012 Olympic champion, world champion of 2013 and European Championships from 2010 to 2016, tested positive for the banned stimulant drug methylhexanamine.
Perkovic denied the wistful take and was banned for six months.
The four furthest litters this year go to the account of the big gold favourite.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400m relay / USA): The Beijing Olympic champion and two-time world champion over 400m, was tested positive in 2010 and banned for 21 months.
A means of penis augmentation was responsible, Merritt pleaded.
This year, the 30-year-old is over 200 and 400m the fastest man in the world so far.
Iwan Tichon (Hammersmith, Belarus): Hardly an athlete has been awarded so many medals.
So Tichon lost his 2005 World Cup title nine years later, after he was found guilty of testosterone doping.
The now 40-year-old also had to make Olympic silver in 2004 because of steroid doping and the 2006 Euro title because of testosterone abuse.
He also received the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games as a result of a ruling by the International Sports Court, CAS.
At 80.04 m, he is ranked second in the world rankings.
Liu Hong (20 km walking, China): The world record holder and gold favourite only tested positive in May, but may still start in Rio.
At the 29-year-old world champion, evidence of taking a banned dietary supplement was found, the ban by the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA fell mildly and ran as early as July 13.
