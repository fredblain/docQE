28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco mall
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local shopping centre.
The victim's brother said that he can't imagine anyone who would want to harm him, "Finally, he went uphill again."
The body found in the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, the forensic department in San Francisco said.
The San Francisco Police Department said that the death was classified as murder and that the investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABS broadcaster KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who used to work as a chef in Boston, had his dream job as a chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokesman for the Sons & Daughters said that they were "shocked and destroyed on the ground" over his death.
"We are a small team that works like a close family and we will sorely miss him," the spokesman said.
Our thoughts and condolences are at this difficult time at Franks' family and friends.
Louis Galicia admitted that Frank initially lived in hostels, but that "things finally went uphill for him."
"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend," Louis Garcia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said that he could not imagine anyone who would want to harm his younger brother.
He was a kind man with a big heart.
Connecting his way with his family was to always cook us something, prepare us for dinner, "Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to participate in any kind of confrontation.
He was the brother who swam with the electricity.
"With everything that's going wrong in the world, he was this unscripted diamond that lit brightly every day," he said.
