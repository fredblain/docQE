Snapchat 'anime' effect criticised as Asian cartoon
Snapchat says this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it's insensitive to breeds.
With its filter tool, Snapchat allows around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in a way that already borders on the absurd.
You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The filters are outspoken, self-twisted tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies a day.
All missteps are sent to the public.
Snapchat filters have drawn criticism in the past in which they were accused that the app would promote Blackface or propagate white skin as a beauty sideal.
When, this week, some users suggested a filter that gave them slit eyes, false teeth and darkened cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - "yellowing."
They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a bigger problem that the company has with diversity.
The news and outrage became widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced that it would have deactivated the feature.
The company offered an apology: The filter was intended as a tribute to anime characters rather than a caricature of Asians.
But outsiders who have experienced racists reminded the filter of vulnerable clich√©s.
Others strongly rejected the anime comparison.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet was widely circulated about the photos, said that the filter was "vulnerable and, to say the least, unpleasant."
She added that "it's difficult to argue with the juxtaposition of a very disgusting Asian caricature and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow-proof, but that the yellow face has been drawn into the derogatory extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company to cross these cultural stumbling blocks.
American culture seems to be implicated in an endless diversity and integration struggle, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand.
And Snapchat's large audience of young people - who are in terms of race various than their older opponents - might be more likely to expect sensitivity.
If one of Snapchat's filters creates an image that is offensive to a user, "so it's much harder for such things to go unnoticed than it used to be," 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account urged others to do the same.
In an essay for Medium and in a phone interview, she said that she believes that race-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in hiring practices at Snapchat.
Zhu criticized the largely white, only male leadership and finished her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.
"Either she doesn't have a diverse representation of people with other skin colours in their workforce so they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colours working there but are not in positions where they are safe or comfortable to say what to do about it."
Others share their opinions, a complaint that has left Snapchat largely unanswered.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a staff officer focused on underrepresented populations and on internal integration efforts.
For her part, Zhu said that she will have her Snapchat account closed and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to be able to say that this is not O.K."
