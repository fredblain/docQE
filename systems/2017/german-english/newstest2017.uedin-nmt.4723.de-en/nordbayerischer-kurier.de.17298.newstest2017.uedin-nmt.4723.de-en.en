The fees per cubic metre of waste water are from 1 October 2016 for the area of sewage plant Neudorf / Reuth / Welschenkahl 3.44 instead of €2.10; for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp €3.36 (previously $2.26) and for Azendorf €3.64 (previously $2.18).
At the plant in Azendorf, the sewerage fee will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary.
After an overblown calculation, the sewage price in Azendorf will then be $4.37 per cubic meter.
As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, when the budget was approved by the estate agent Kulmbach, it was established that undercover was running out for these sewage plants.
On the basis of a legal basis, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the plants in a cost-effective manner.
From 1 October 2016, citizens as well as commercial and industrial companies from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to dig deeper into the purse.
The fee increases are between 48 and 67 per cent.
As managing director Herbert Schmidt showed up to the panel, a re-calculation of charges for the sewage systems of the market community was necessary.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, it will also be possible to compensate for over- or undercover from the previous calculation period.
The serious fee increases were justified by the fact that all three sewage systems were relatively small, with a very low level of waste water, which is between 6800 and 12000 cubic metres per year.
For example, due to the low distribution basis, for example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.
In addition, the volume of waste water in all three plants is declining slightly.
Furthermore, in the past calculation period, all three installations, not least because of their age, have incurred a considerable amount of recovery and repair costs.
The plant in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the plants for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth, as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years.
Schmidt pointed out that in the Azendorf sewage plant, the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage.
In the pumping plant Welschenkahl, the nearly 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be overtaken from scratch and, after almost 20 years of operation, the first sewage pond, which disposed of sewage sludge and an additional ventilation facility, had to be installed in order to continue to comply with the water regulations.
Schmidt: "To these extraordinary expenses came the continued maintenance and maintenance costs, which must be taken into account in the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs, which were still well below current levels in the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012.
Stone houses made it clear that in the case of the low sewerage in the three plants, expenses for the operation and maintenance were "fully pierced."
In doing so, Schmidt added, the market community has been spared major entertainment costs at sewage facilities over the past 20 years.
In the view of stone houses, the situation for these plants will remain precarious in the long term, especially as the supply area of the Friesenbachtal Sewerage Association could not be extended to include these facilities, because they are loss-making facilities.
