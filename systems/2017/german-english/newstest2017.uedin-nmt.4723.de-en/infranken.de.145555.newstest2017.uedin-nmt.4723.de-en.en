31 years of exemplary clarity
The managing director of the water-purpose association "Veitensteingruppe," Ruppert Göller, is retiring.
The association is considered "Bavarian-wide exemplary."
A small fringed drinking water association as a role model for the big water producers.
So it was said some time ago in the original tone in a post by the Bavarian broadcaster.
Soon after, the water forum of the government of Unterfranken honored the Zweckverband.
The work of the Veitensteingroup was "Bavaria-wide as exemplary."
Behind all this is Rupert Göller, who has been a staff member for 31 years, including 28 years as managing director.
Now he was retired at the age of 65.
The Drinking Water Association of the Veitensteingroup, based in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, promotes about 150000 cubic metres of water every year and provides 32 places and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants.
Member communities are the municipalities of Kirchlouder, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the town of Baunach.
There are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities.
The current chairman, Breitbrunns Mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was hired as a water keeper in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director in 1988.
"His duties have been very diverse and they stretched from the waterline construction and maintenance work through office and organisational activities, budgeting, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency interventions on weekends," the chairwoman said.
As an outstanding event, she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells (1994), land purchases in the area of the new wells (1998) and compensation of farmers, the rehabilitation of the high tanks (1999), the reconnection of a central computer control system (2004) and the partial renewal of water lines.
There has been no standstill and there have been repeated innovations, because water means life and drinking water is the most important food.
In her laudato, she praised Göllers' loyal, reliable and correct service over 31 years.
He has used himself with a lot of heartache for his water-ring association and he has really lived the water-ring association as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a true practitioner, he was allowed to present the concept of success of the Veitensteingroup to the nitrate reduction in front of the Water Forum of the district of Unterfranken.
He received a great deal of praise and praise for that.
Rupert Göller, for his part, praised water keeper Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.
He's the best water keeper and he was a loyal crap.
Together we were an unbeatable team.
As highlights from his point of view, he described the fountain construction and the restructuring of the purpose-building association.
The biggest challenge and the most difficult effort, however, was the pipe break at the high tank at Kirchlouder on a January 3.
Here we had to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night so that the towns could be provided with water.
Once again, the supply of Neubrunn could only be maintained, because the Pettstadt reservoir was filled with hoses.
The management of the Drinking Water Association was handed over to Daniel striker from Lauter, who is taking over the succession of Rupert Göller.
