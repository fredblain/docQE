Jennifer Aniston: I'll always be put in drawers
Jennifer Aniston doesn't always have to be perfect or successful.
That's what the Hollywood star made unequivocally clear in an interview now.
'i'll always put in drawers or get glued from the outside label, which usually has little to do with me and the reality. '
'i myself don't have the desire to always be perfect and successful. '
'to be honest, these things are more snug to me. '
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh at the fact that she is considered "Miss Perfect," as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan."
Preferably, the actress spends her time at home, pre-TV with loose Dutton and Mexican food, the magazine says.
To the whitewash, she raises the question of the child's wish: "We women don't have to be married or have children to be perfect," according to the Hollywood star.
In her new film "Mother's Day - Love is not a breeze," Aniston is seen as a single mother of two sons.
The film runs with us from August 25.
