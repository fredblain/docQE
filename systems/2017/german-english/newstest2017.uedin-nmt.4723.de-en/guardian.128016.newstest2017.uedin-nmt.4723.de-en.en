French court rejects bid over demolition of shops at Jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected a bid by authorities in Calais to break down dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Jungle of Calais where thousands of refugees live.
At a court hearing this week, authorities in Calais argued that the state should be empowered to bring down 72 temporary shops where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offering hairdressing services or selling tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.
The Calais prefecture argued that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which pose a fire and sanitation risk.
Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the government-backed association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They also said that temporary shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of people running the 72 provisional deals, but acknowledged that the concerns of the Calais prefecture were "absolutely understandable."
The judge, Jean-François Molla, said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than merely feeding people who "live in extremely precarious conditions."
He said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the low-rise was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the Camp, which is operated by the public and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as a consultation on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the kids' cafe.
In a letter to the Guardian, it said that the closure "would be a disaster for these children, the youngest of whom are eight years old."
The two aid agencies Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the Jungle camp had risen to over 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in new arrivals during the summer.
