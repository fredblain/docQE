Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men have "good luck still to be alive"
Three men are "lucky to still be alive" after being thrown from their fishing boat off Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station struck at 13: 20 BST on Friday after a crew observed the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulty swimming to safety while their boat moved on on their own.
"We saw how the boat turned around in its vicinity and confronted us the worst," the head of Moelfre Vince Jones' rescue station said.
"Fortunately, the strong winds have already waved the boat out of their reach until we left to water," he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man, aged 60, was exhausted and found at a Boje hanging without a rescue vest.
They all came on board the coastal rescue boat and were taken back to the rescue station
Mr Jones said: "The three men thrown into the water are lucky to be unharmed and still alive.
The boat engine had an emergency stopper, but the boat was removed by the person who was driving the boat.
Someone was waking up about these men today.
