Mystery of fish that landed in garden in Banff
A resident of Banff called for help in identifying the fish, which appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks it could be the 75 fish around Sandaale, which were lined out by a fountain.
Mr Bain, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, posted a video of the spectacle on Periscope in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inch long fish.
