Condoms with chilipuder, fireworks promote Tanzanian elephant protection
Conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to stop elephants from going to inhabited settlements in people - they throw condoms on them filled with chilipudes.
The method has proved effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which already had the idea to do so years ago, has intensified its promotion, along with US conservation, by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-step method to protect their homes and crops without injuring animals.
Previously, many spears used to defend themselves.
Friday is world phone day dedicated to animal welfare.
"Since we developed the... toolkit, we have been able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities, being much more confident that they can stop the elephants from their fields without harming the elephant in it," the managing director of Honeyguide Damian Bell said in a note.
The first two steps include lighting the elephant with a torch and the bubbles in a horn.
If he is not deterred, a so-called "Chilicloud" is thrown.
Chilipuder mixed with earth is packed together with a fireworks body into a condom, the end of which is turned down to the ignition.
When it is lit, the condom bursts with a bang and spits fine dust to Chilipuder into the air.
A touch quite usually already out to chase the elephant.
One last possibility is a scorer who shoots a gold fire in the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
