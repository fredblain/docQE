Rio 2016: ROBEL Kiros Habte becomes an internet hit
Not always the Olympians or world records determine the headlines at the Olympics.
This is shown by the bold appearance of ROBEL Kiros Habte at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro.
At the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that at times he was no longer seen in the TV images.
He simply disappeared - no matter how far the cutout was selected.
On social networks, Habte subsequently became a viral internet hit.
In fact, the 24-year-old finished his pre-race with a lag of 48 seconds and finished in the 59th place of 59 starts.
It was, however, more his not exactly sporting figure that drew the attention of the international media.
Why the 24-year-old still attends the Olympics?
The Ethiopians got a special starting right from the international swimming federation.
This will be distributed to promote swimming in under-represented countries.
As most athletes run in Ã„thopia, Habte simply wanted to do something else.
Preparation is everything: ROBEL Kiros Habte is getting ready for the big race.
Quickly, the first nicknames made the rounds.
Some media described him as a "ROBEL of the whale."
In reference to a "wealth bump," the English tabloid "The Sun" made fun of him with "Dad Bod."
His time, he struck only with a minute and nearly five seconds over the 100 metres overhead, played no part in it.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.
At the 2000 Sydney Olympics, the run of Eric Moussambani caused media attention.
Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea when he had to compete on his own in a run-up over 100 metres.
Fittingly, Moussambani was fired at the time.
The then 22-year-old only learned to swim eight months before Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the contest.
