Steel - bright spot for German steel industry
The crisis-battered and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared an additional cost of millions of dollars.
Financial burdens that threatened the industry from oil production are off the table.
It remains with the exemption from the renewable-energy levy at the inventory facilities to so-called self-electricity production in the German steel industry, Federal Industry Minister Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) told the Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ, Friday edition).
"I am really pleased that we were finally able to achieve this after two years of tough negotiations."
The European Commission had therefore initially planned to ask the steel manufacturers to use the gases from the blast furnace to produce electricity for their own consumption.
The steel industry threatened additional costs of $120 to $240 million a year, according to the German Industry Association.
Gabriel told WAtoday there was now a landmark agreement with the European Commission after talks with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
It is only when the generators are replaced in the steel works that an EEG-surcharge of 20 per cent falls.
But this, too, is not raised in the steel industry.
The IG welcomed Germany's agreement with the EU Commission on self-energy production.
This largely enshrines the status quo of the current regime.
Gabriel's successful effort for the steel industry is of particular importance.
'in terms of our campaign 'steel is future' this is a first step. '
"More must follow."
"There are also climate and employment objectives to be weighed up in the reform of the emissions trading scheme," said IG's chief executive JÃ¶rg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
The steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacity and significant price pressure since the 2008 financial crisis.
Last year, the situation worsened further as the world's largest producer country, China, threw mass steel on the world market in the face of weakening domestic demand.
European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel companies of price dumping.
Over the course of this spring, the situation has eased somewhat.
On the one hand, import tariffs imposed on imports have an impact, and the economic outlook in China has brightened.
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.
German industry leader Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.
Most recently, prices have tended to stagnate.
The industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
At the same time, ThyssenKrupp did not want to rule out the closure of individual works.
Around 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015.
In July, German steelmakers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.
They produced a good six per cent less crude steel at 3.4 million tonnes than in the same month last year, according to the Business Association of Steel on Friday.
After a brief increase in May, the produced crowd now went back the second month in a row.
Since the beginning of the year, production has been two percent lower than the previous year.
The association expects rising emissions in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation.
