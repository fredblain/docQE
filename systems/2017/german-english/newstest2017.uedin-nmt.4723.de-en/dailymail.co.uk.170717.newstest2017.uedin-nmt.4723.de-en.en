CBC commentator for the Olympics apologises for his statement that Chinese swimmer "died like a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the fourth place of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at dr 4x200m free-form swimming squadron outraged viewers of the CBC live broadcast of the Olmypal Games on Wednesday
Canadian broadcaster CBC had to apologise after one of its commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "went off like tenants" and during the race like "a pig died."
The commentator Byron MacDonalds thought that his microphone was switched off when he cast his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m free-form swimming squadron.
Macdonald, who had been picked to the commentary team of the CBS on board to lend more "color," could be heard saying: "This little 14-year-old Chinesin has lost the connection, baby."
Too excited, went off like Mief, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second leg of the swimming squadron 1: 57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, which allowed Canadians to close the gap with China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly online after being shocked by the tone and language
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Has the CBC commentator just said that the 14-year-old swimmer from China" died like a pig "????
The idiot hasn't captioned that they were still on show. '
Ai Yanhan from China was described at the final 4 x 200m free-form swimming squadron for women: "This little 14-year-old Chinesin has lost the connection, baby."
The criticism against Byron MacDonald on Twitter came fast and hard, with many asking him to speak
Twitter users didn't hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: "WoW, # ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and let us all look like racists. # angeekelt.
A short time later, Scott Russel, who moderated the CBC broadcast, apologised live for MacDonald's comment and said: "We apologise that the comment was broadcast on a swimming performance."
It was an unfortunate chosen phrase, we're sorry it happened. '
CBC apologized at the end over 90 times among the people who responded to the notices on Twitter
The commentator's colleague Scott Russel had to apologise on behalf of MacDonald
CBC coped and added his apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments
The network also quickly apologized and issued a message.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast.
We quickly apologised to our viewers on show and our followers on social media last night.
To make one thing clear, Byron's comments related to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person.
However, they were inappropriate and an ill-chosen wording, and Byron is very sorry for what he has said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized in the broadcast and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention for it to be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I'd like to take a moment to apologise for the comment I made after the women's swimming staffer in the CBC Olympian, he said.
'i was referring to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person. '
Of course, no disregard was intended and I'm very sorry. '
