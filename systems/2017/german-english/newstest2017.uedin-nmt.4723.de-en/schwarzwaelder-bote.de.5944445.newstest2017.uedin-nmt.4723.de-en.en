Haigerloch: Pilgrims to the gate of mercy
The miniseries from the watchdog Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were en route on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Together, four stages have been completed.
In order to bridge the time until the next Roma pilgrimage of all miniseries in probably two years, the Oberministrantenround St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.
Various places of pilgrimage were examined and it was finally decided for the bishop city of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of mercy with the gate of mercy at the Freiburger Münster, a special pilgrimage destination was offered.
16 Minis from Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Heiligenrooms made their way.
On the evening before, pastor Storost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrimages and gave the pilgrimages.
From Horb, it was driven by train to the starting point of Villingen, where there is also a Muster of Our Lady, and so the pilgrim from Münster took place.
The individual day tours were framed in the morning and in the evening by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and texts.
But also along the way, the Minis on field crosses, chapels or churches repeatedly made roast to sing together a song from specially assembled pilgrim song booklet.
For the nights, parishes of the local parishes were available.
At the stage targets, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty as well as strengthening dinner and breakfast.
Further on, the second day went through furlongs to Gütenbach.
On the way to St. Peter, which was the most demanding route, they had to get off at an altitude of about 500 meters at the end of the season.
In the evening, the deserved reward was a common grilling at the Badweiher.
After the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, the final stage went to Freiburg.
Visibly relieved and happy, the Minis met at the Freiburger Münster later in the afternoon and passed through the gate of mercy.
With a little impulse, God was thanked here.
In the evening fair in Münster, the Minis arriving at the pilgrim's destination were welcomed by co-operative Markus Obert.
After the service, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.
The next day was still time for the Breisgaumetropolis.
In the afternoon, it went back to Horb by train.
In the end, all participants agreed that the days were marked by spirituality and a strong community experience.
