<seg id="1">Clinton's and trump's economic policies compared: It's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">In infrastructure investing, and the trade agreements TTP prevent the want to both Clinton as well as Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">Divided the two US presidential candidates are, however, tax policy and energy policy, as well as a question of principle.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, was a General, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">Of the, about the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep the software small, and warns how the government can damage the economy with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wool tax the economy to death and regulate death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He would himself, however, is quite different, says Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will go back to the regulations, solid, and he makes for a far-reaching tax reform, with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton, however, says: The state has to fulfill certain tasks, he has to give Disadvantaged opportunities and needs for money.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore, the taxes would be increased for the Rich, she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interesting, both are very close to the subject of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the needed to be invested in, say, Trump and Clinton the same, almost word.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate announces the biggest investment in new jobs since the Second world war.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in infrastructure are the classic democratic politics, and to be rejected by the state critical tea party wing of the Republican strictly.</seg>
<seg id="16">To Trump so the party could face internal discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">More marked are the differences in the energy and climate policy.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and coal production in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be in previously protected areas, the Paris climate protection agreement he wants to terminate.</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton wants to expand their investment program, specifically the Renewable energy and calls for: "A country will be the super power of the clean energy and millions of Jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"It will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be there."</seg>
<seg id="22">However, not only in the infrastructure, even in the case of international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the TRANS-Pacific trade agreement, not want to both sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time both don't want to isolate but the U.S. from the international trade - but just American Jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">Which should be paid better, asks about Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 dollars is a pittance.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What do Trump in this question is not very clear: Once he says: The minimum wage needs to go up, then he says that he ought not to be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">However, the big discussion in the coming months is likely to develop has more to do with the tax policies of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the burden on the economy and the citizens, in order to stimulate growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics hold him, so that the budget deficit would only get bigger.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least to demand of the Rich that they pay more tax, and whose critics say: More taxes are the solution.</seg>

<seg id="1">Escape: "Any refugee woman has experienced sexual violence"</seg>
<seg id="2">Sexual violence is for women who flee alone, almost everyday.</seg>
<seg id="3">When you arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house provides shelter.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen, four women sit.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each of them has a Baby that is not more than a year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">A laid her little son in the Arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks with big eyes curious in the room.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother is staring at the tabletop.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until she realizes that she is observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles briefly and kisses the Little one.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene is normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until we speak with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">She is area Director of Condrobs, institution for social assistance in Bavaria, and deals with the topic of women on the run.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are Refugees.</seg>
<seg id="16">You live in the North of Munich in one of the few decentralized accommodation for all Inge escaped women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January Condrobs has opened the facility together with Pro Familia, and the Munich-based woman help.</seg>
<seg id="18">Recently it was officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - approximately 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">Men, there is none - not even as a visitor.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a security guard in front of the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"It is no exaggeration to say that Every woman that comes here, has made it on their flight experiences with sexual violence," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Men flee because of Wars, because they are politically persecuted, because of torture, or the death, or because their families send hope to Europe," she says.</seg>
<seg id="24">In women, other reasons for the escape outweigh that: "Many steal secretly away, because they see no other way out".</seg>
<seg id="25">In their homeland they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honour killings, slavery or forced made prostitution.</seg>
<seg id="26">You continue driving.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run, the list goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"That tractor demand, for example, for a bottle of water, a sexual act, is not uncommon," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">Those who believe that the end, once you come and ask in Germany, is misleading, says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here, too, single women in refugee would accommodation, often considered inferior and, at worst, abused.</seg>
<seg id="32">The result is that about 90 percent of women living in accommodation in the North of Munich, are traumatized, and appreciates you.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Some of the kids are certainly not created voluntarily."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so used, that they say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Or you do not dare to speak openly about the experience, because the shame is too great".</seg>
<seg id="36">Since you don't know help often, need it more accommodations just for you, calls for Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bavaria, the seven district governments for the accommodation of refugees, in charge.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the question of whether they knew of a similar project in Munich in the area of its competence, the answers some.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the upper Palatinate and upper Franconia, about there is no such thing in accommodation of the governments.</seg>
<seg id="40">Also in Swabia alone, refugee women are housed separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press Secretary of the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In upper Bavaria, and middle Franconia, there are some community accommodation floors or own-houses for single women and their children.</seg>
<seg id="42">The exception is Bavaria, there are two Central properties exclusively for women.</seg>
<seg id="43">Also, the Committee "women's rights and gender equality" in the European Parliament demands that women must be segregated from men, are housed.</seg>
<seg id="44">In a study published for the Committee, said: "It's very important that men and women are separated houses."</seg>
<seg id="45">"The lack of privacy, or men and women be housed together, it can - the continuous violence against women".</seg>
<seg id="46">Especially, the washing should be separated, and for women, shall be easily accessible, in the study.</seg>
<seg id="47">How the women feel this need to protect, you can read the crowd on the house in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Since around spoke, that it gives us, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="49">You could easily open a second house.</seg>

<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: An "Alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended in a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday, to give the hands and proclaim a formal end to the eight months lasting war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But as Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish opponents in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, in the reception, I can not honor me the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation to the most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, Yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin seemed to Smile, tight-lipped, and he radiated almost no heat, even for his laid-back circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke, however, repeated his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to your old level before the crisis, but even be improved.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have had to be in a daze, as if never happened something Bad.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me, his enthusiasm seemed to be rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But a Putin-emitting, sustainable Coolness showed that the head of state of Russia had nothing to forget.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the First thing he mentioned in his introduction words: the shooting down of a Russian combat aircraft to the Syrian border by Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin informed and accused Ankara to be Russia in the back like that.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Offense was even greater because it was perpetrated by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The trust will establish difficult, if not impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media waged a fierce, full attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At once it seemed as if the Turks would carry the blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">The most serious of the allegations by senior officials that Erdogan would have benefited his own family from the illegal Oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic state.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has vehemently denied.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this Meeting took place only because Putin received from President Erdogan the excuse he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia has achieved a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of weapons are at a standstill.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was dismissed last month in a failed coup almost of his office.</seg>
<seg id="28">Again terror took attacks on Turkey have shaken him also.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular, the prohibition of Charter flights that bring out every year, usually several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and Charter companies will be facilitated if the flights will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">You can count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the state television predicted that cheaper fruit and vegetables, as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports to be allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">A report in Vedemosti put it as follows: "tourists there are long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is on the West angry, since it is acquisition, whose response to the attempted power as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">The persistent resentment on the snail's pace of the EU accession negotiations, and Putin is eager to draw from the cool mood Use and to reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian head of state won in Ankara with a Bonus that he called after the attempted coup, support for the elected organs of the state.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is for Moscow, mind you, as a matter of course, the self has to change a deep-seated fear of the Regime.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit of this glittering Palace on the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey, as described to me by an analyst, "Alliance of outsiders" to represent two countries which are in breach from the West and ill-treated feel, and now ally.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation between the two is still large differences.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role as a peacemaker, but where do Russia and Turkey have opposing sides to support.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after nearly three hours of initial talks, both presidents at the press conference stating that they would not have touched on the topic once.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey avoided it intentionally to a question about their differences to the answers, while Putin emphasize this decided to.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus, where there is a common denominator to Syria can be found.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and, given the potential for a complete Disaster, as NATO-member Turkey shot down the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state at least talk to each other again.</seg>

<seg id="4">Ross McEwan told the BBC Scotland that the RBS brand associated with the global ambitions of the Bank.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Bank has distanced itself since then, as you had to be collapsed eight years ago nearly, and saved.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this time, brand strategists "RBS have used" to protect other consumer financial brands.</seg>
<seg id="7">She supported the international Sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship, from the Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.</seg>
<seg id="8">But now she has decided to back more national brands in the focus.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be for customers in Scotland are available, but will not be initialized.</seg>
<seg id="10">In England and Wales, all of the RSB references, the decentralized headquarters and the stock exchange listing will change to NatWest.</seg>
<seg id="11">The brand Ulster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are other, smaller brands for the private customer business, which will get more importance - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.</seg>
<seg id="13">McEwan was during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in Inverness-shire interviewed.</seg>
<seg id="14">He told BBC Scotland: "The brand of the RSB will be to our investors, brand and to the brand under which our employees, because we are now more and more a Bank of brands."</seg>
<seg id="15">As the Bank was itself a global brand, was RBS's global brand.</seg>
<seg id="16">I say now, that we have no global targets but local targets.</seg>
<seg id="17">Each of these brands in their own communities for something completely different, and our staff will work under these brands with the customers.</seg>
<seg id="18">RBS has already said that it will not be Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the visibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship.</seg>
<seg id="19">"It is time for us to evolve to the Bank of the marks, because, as we focus on the Inside (we asked) to make this a better Bank for customers?" said the chief Executive.</seg>
<seg id="20">It would have been three years ago, very cynical, if we had said that we would have for our customers a great Bank, and these brands launched.</seg>
<seg id="21">But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think, will see many changes.</seg>
<seg id="22">We can launch these brands, therefore, I think that the time has come.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia's Putin fires chief of staff Sergei Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly fired its chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ivanov was for many years part of the closest circle of trust circle of Putin.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-Year-old was as special representative for environment and transport matters is appointed.</seg>
<seg id="5">In opinion of the Kremlin is that Putin had arranged, without giving reasons, "the dismissal of Ivanov of his duties as Chairman of the Russian presidential administration".</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, since 2012, Ivanov's Deputy, was appointed his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former Diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 1972, in the Estonian capital, Tallinn, was born, he made his degree at the prestigious Moscow State Institute for International relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Website of the Kremlin it says (in Russian) that he was later head of Protocol and chief of the government staff.</seg>
<seg id="10">On his appointment he said to Putin:"Thank you for your trust."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think that it is the most important task of the government is, your activity as the head of state concerning draft legislation and to support controls for the implementation of its instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his Post and Vaino as his successor I recommended.</seg>
<seg id="13">The smile convincing faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow shrouded in mystery.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was for a long time one of the closest to Vladimir Putin's and working for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As chief of staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a Meeting with President Putin that was broadcast on television, claimed both men, that the chief of staff, at his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smiles for the cameras, here are just a few convinced - especially now, shortly before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">The result is a kind of here is so the fight makes?</seg>
<seg id="20">No one knows currently.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official statement - that a man who was once touted as a potential President, would like to redirect to once the Russian environmental policy - met with great skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin, cited on the Kremlin Website, said Ivanov, "it is true that I asked you at the beginning of 2012, in a conversation, to me this is very complicated Post - one might almost say arduous Post for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I am for four years and eight months, Chairman of the Russian presidential administration.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took up the Post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of defense.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian security Council, and like Putin a former member of the state security service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was Chairman of the Federal security service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov appointed his Deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">As Putin came to Power, was he named Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was once believed that Ivanov could be Putin's second term in office, President of Russia, since a third term in office, Putin would violate the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this Post was taken from another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin, the Prime Minister was before he was three and a half years later, President.</seg>

<seg id="4">It is the first of four welds of the "deck blower", the approach of the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long, and weighs 30,000 tons.</seg>
<seg id="6">He has over 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 inclined in a hurry.</seg>
<seg id="7">The £ 1.35 billion expensive project is to be completed by may 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Economy Minister Keith Brown visited the site a visit today and was one of the First that went from the country up to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said: "This is an historic and symbolic Moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossings.</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of an art of engineering from a truly epic dimensions in this project, with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel, which were alone used for that part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">In spite of the massive size and weight of the bridge, is the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity, which require extremely precise tolerances for the fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">A total of 79% of the total bridge decks are almost in place, and the last section of the deck gets today in Rosyth on a concrete casting for the Deck, which means that the entire Deck is ready to be on the bridge in its place lifted.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, project Director of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "The first closure represents for each bridge project, a significant milestone.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the case of this fantastic project, the closure of future - oriented High-rise and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the Installation of the last street deck section and its connection with the Expansion of the existing North tower deck, we had to close then, the still existing gap on the North or land side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by Pulling the Northern Shuttle bridge 700 mm in the South.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Solid, because the viaduct is 222 meters long, approximately 6,000 tons of weighs and at a slope of approximately 3 % to the top had to be drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">Tricky, since the tolerances the Team is working towards, were tiny - on each side, they amounted to only a few millimeters.</seg>

<seg id="1">Who builds the city cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="2">The SPD and the greens think that investors will in future have to be taken much more responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="3">How to respond to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose in the next few years, almost 1,300 affordable apartments?</seg>
<seg id="4">The SPD proposes to the next meeting of the Council, a "concept of Housing".</seg>
<seg id="5">But the dispute is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost, the question is: Who should build the affordable housing?</seg>
<seg id="7">A control is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">SPD parliamentary group Chairman Christoph Bratmann says: "We are with the Greens agree: Who wants to build on city land, must in future designate 20 per cent of all housing as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="9">The cheap apartments, however, can also arise in the portfolio.</seg>
<seg id="10">The major point of contention in the town hall, however, so Bratmann: "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private land?"</seg>
<seg id="11">"We want investors to build on such land at least 10 percent, but preferably 20 percent of the apartments as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">A new urban housing assistance program, which will cost millions and still has to be financed, is to provide incentives.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Problem, Bratmann: "There is currently no agreement between the factions."</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors a minimum number of rules.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Left wants yet requirements for investors hardness.</seg>
<seg id="16">Notwithstanding the foregoing, so Bratmann, to make an aggravation of the Situation on the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">The action concept is implemented, it will provide for additional duties in the construction administration.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the professionals.</seg>
<seg id="20">But still the program is not entirely Because of the approximately 1260 new apartments should be built.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how you can compensate for the loss of a further approximately 1300 affordable housing, the development of which will expire in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">Alone up to the year 2020, there will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">To prevent this, the planning policy spokeswoman Nicole Palm, should now be expiring at the end of bonds of the city purchased.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, would have to be thought about, to bring apartments back into the price-fixing.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is in the West side of the city.</seg>
<seg id="26">At a stroke the Problem could be solved.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in the West end of the city, the time limits run of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Approximately 1800 homes, you could get there and back in the price fixing for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: The owners, the housing associations do not want to.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because the number of social housing units in the West side of the city is increased dramatically, it moves away from the target of the so-called mixing.</seg>
<seg id="31">A concentration of socially weak in a few city, there will be no more parts.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens expect that there will be any movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">Group Chairman Holger Herlitschke says: "For a wide majority, the CDU must be in the boat."</seg>
<seg id="34">The have focused on more building sites for single family homes.</seg>
<seg id="35">Which is not to say, however, that is not a compromise can be found.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunting after health and happiness, is worth it</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to watch how the world is changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">That a Teenager and child to Play and not go outside, but rather, prefer to spend their free time on screens to stare at, it was complained in the last decade by many.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Pokemon Go to get people off the Sofa and active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then video games, and most recently on Smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore, it is not great to see that technology and activities to exclude Outdoor each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">I refer of course to the Pokémon Go-delusion, an App based on the characters that were initially created for the video games in the 1990s (and later a cartoon series, game cards, and other Spin-Offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">How many phenomena of popular culture decreased, the interest prior to the release of the game in the United States, Australia and new Zealand at the beginning of July something.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market introduction in other countries has been postponed due to the massive demand that overloaded the Server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days pokemon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short the player is told to go with their Smartphones out and are looking for Pokémons that will be followed with a GPS tracked and, once they have been found, "photographed" (can be taken via a Screenshot on the phone) or "caught".</seg>
<seg id="13">A Generation that played the game, when she was younger, joined the craze and jumped for the search of your Sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the USA the game has led to a considerable increase in steps the "average" Person puts in every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an App for Apple Watch, which follows 35.000 users post, told the Washington Post recently that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of post people who train every day for 30 minutes, followed by 45 percent to 53 percent started.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays of Pokémon Go - it only provides the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public awareness campaigns for health, the people want to take "30 minutes," "come from the Sofa" and "to be active every day" fell on deaf ears, because many of the public messages on health are boring, and people come, the misery of appearance.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sports cannot be overstated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who exercised regularly, reduced their chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, Diabetes and a long list of benefits is too long to cite here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonder is full to Pokémon Go, that it brings the people to do something Outdoors that is fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus, the three pillars of health are exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people close to hunting and even new friendships.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there are also grumpy party-pooper, who must always complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And Yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What's the point?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has been a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if Smartphone Apps such as Fitbit already track our activity, they gave us no reason to go in for sports, as it does in this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The New one will lose its appeal and the use will abate with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because of Pokemons success, but there will be more games, Apps and virtual reality with the active associations in the real world, and many people on the hunt will help you to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="15">This success puts them in the same League as unique athletes such as Michael Phelps, have brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has dominated the last three years of your sports, 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - amazing Exercises won, which include a mixture of ambition and precision, that the Olympic champion of 1984, Mary Lou Retton from her said that she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">It was expected to be a final test in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and the Rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not with a handful of Gold to return back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be viewed as a disappointment.</seg>

<seg id="22">A part of your floor exercises - which contain the typical Tumbling Pass is aligned with Latin American music, the home would fit on the street outside of the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This is a girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child, and coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip in the gymnasium was discovered in the Boorman trained, was to the force.</seg>
<seg id="25">She has lost since the summer of 2013, no more fight, more competition, a winning streak that will continue as long as it wishes Biles.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even if all around title, led by two spins easily, trügte the image.</seg>
<seg id="27">Balance beam and Floor exercise - in which Biles holds the title of world champion - lurked.</seg>
<seg id="28">She repeated with 15,433 on the balance beam again, and continued with a 15,933 on the floor.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman hugged her gently as they awaited their end result - a pure formality - and tears streamed on Biles shiny red, white and blue Eyeliner, as the Vision that you once described in your collection, became reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance Raismans was a revenge for the last Time four years ago, as they fought for third place but the bronze medal went to a Tiebrake in all around title.</seg>
<seg id="31">This Time the 22-year-old team captain, called by the Americans "grandma" had a head start.</seg>
<seg id="32">After her floor exercise, she threw the audience a kiss, hands, overwhelmed by a Comeback that seemed sometimes doubtful.</seg>

<seg id="5">The structure of this team, Aly Raisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, rounding, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team reflects, finally, the United States.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is black and Hispanic has solidified ash female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one was under the female gymnasts an African-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby #1 and #2.</seg>
<seg id="10">The shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was cheered a surprising Olympic medallist and America.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now, the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three-time world champion, Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as you unexpected, however, masterful gymastik routines provided.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American, who won an individual more fight event for women Gold.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won the silver.</seg>

<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby, and Laurie were all in the same way as Aly and Madison, to make it to the Olympic Team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "Final Five", because the next Olympic team will only have four gymnasts in the team. In addition, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive Sport, and Turner, primarily in private gymnastics clubs that are obtained from parents for the training, equipment, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the Trainer and the gymnasts and families). The list can go on and on.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these gym clubs are located in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these Clubs, the gymnasts received their entire Training, and this is for the families of an expensive and long-term commitment.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, both have trained their athletes since she started with gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We need to allow the municipalities to do so on countless young girls, inspired by Simone, Gabby, and Laurie, a leistbareres and easier to understand turn training.</seg>

<seg id="2">The world outside is a dangerous place, but this Video of Dailymail.com could it make for you a bit safer.</seg>
<seg id="3">We spoke with Rhon Mizrachi, a Grand master of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.</seg>
<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you will show approaches you from the front or from the rear watch this Video to see how you turn around for your robber, the tables.</seg>
<seg id="5">If one approaches you from behind, then you should turn around First, so you can see their attacker and "out of the firing line," says Mizrachi.</seg>
<seg id="6">You take the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder before you hit him with your free elbow into his face.</seg>
<seg id="7">You beat him then with the knee in the bar, and twist, while the attacker bends in pain, the weapon from his hands. You beat him with the barrel face and you move backwards while pointing the gun at him.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the case of attackers who approach from the front, is the technique similar to move your body out of the line of fire, grab the weapon and twist it so that the attacker can not shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">You shift at the same time the weight of the gun and hit the attacker in the chest, then twisting the gun from his grip, before moving backwards and the gun at him.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds difficult?</seg>
<seg id="11">Watch the Video to see exactly how it's Mizrachi's dominance.</seg>
<seg id="12">But remember that when a robbery is safest to hand over your money - unless you are a Krav Maga are the Grand master.</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania: The Locals get nothing from the summer election campaign and the holiday makers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to select the diet.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern you have understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2021, the state election will not take place directly at the end of the summer vacation, has decided the Schwerin Parliament already in the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">As stupid as so far it's not: summer holidays, heat, and state election campaign - the bite.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Locals to be convinced of the choice of fighters are on a holiday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the vacationers who are in the country, on the island of Usedom, Rügen and Hiddensee on-the-go, are not Natives, they are not allowed to select the diet.</seg>
<seg id="8">These are practical problems: In the holiday volunteers, the posters are inflating, balloons, distributing flyers, and at the end of vote counting, just hard to find.</seg>
<seg id="9">To 4. September 2016, the election and the last day, must of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania once again the election campaign, at the people passing endure.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot Phase, if one can even say, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: the Prime Minister, Erwin Sellering, the leader of a SPD/CDU coalition, has to fear for his office.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD since 1998, the strongest party, is now in the polls, well behind the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting it is, how strong is a newcomer to the AfD is performing and what remains at the end of the coalition-grade left.</seg>
<seg id="14">Selle ring, 66 years old, and since 2008 the head of government, makes an almost inconspicuous-looking election campaign, one of his large posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels the country, distributed roses and plauscht a little with the people, so as to be legendary taciturn predecessor, Harald Ringstorff, fact.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise soul ring got cold feet and Chancellor Angela Merkel to blame for the Bloom of the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their refugee policy, you do have accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists, which will cost him now will probably be the nice the office.</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU, with its top candidate, the Minister of the interior Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it is like when you at the wrong time, right place campaign.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has twice been invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large rallies; Merkel election to the Bundestag circle is located in the North-East.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target audience is wrong, it's more of North Rhine-were-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as the Mecklenburg and Western Pomerania.</seg>
<seg id="21">"As the majority of other States was likely," said Vincent Kokert, Secretary-General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently in the NDR.</seg>
<seg id="22">But it is a pity also to anyone from other parts of Germany, even Angela Merkel to listen to.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise, the northeast, the CDU largely dispenses with the usual election campaign stalls at market places and shopping malls with parasols, and air balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">So, Kokert assumes only play a "subordinate role".</seg>
<seg id="25">The European Union has also noticed that her wegbröselt on the Land base that you have to work very hard, to find a wire to the people.</seg>
<seg id="26">She's like the Left, the SPD, the Greens: in the far reaches of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Council of the CDU-choice of fighter Kokert to his comrades-in-arms, however, is also self-revealing: "you have to go where it hurts, namely, where the people are: village celebrations, Golden weddings, any birthday celebration needs to be used".</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much is at stake, selle ring called on his SPD to a very dedicated campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In polls, the social Democrats were last with 22 percent, behind Partner, the CDU (25) and only just ahead of the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">In the 2011 election, the SPD had gained a clear yet with 35.6 percent of the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Greens, a minor party, with seven per cent in the polls, is likely to make the leap in the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="32">You make the vacation-Not a modern virtue, and transfer its election campaign in large part to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Online campaign", announced the Chairman Claudia Müller.</seg>
<seg id="34">Otherwise, green choice fighters go in search of tracks according to the local voting citizens and visitors.</seg>
<seg id="35">Silke Gajek, the top candidate, just curves with a house boat through the Mecklenburg lakes, and finds it beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="36">Your impression: "election holiday in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania is not a punishment".</seg>

<seg id="5">This is a super team.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is also no delay.</seg>
<seg id="7">The site could be laid out at the beginning of the week to the mid-term schedule according to the South, until the end of October, everything should be done.</seg>
<seg id="8">Praised the the the works responsible, for example, when it comes to the establishment of makeshift rides.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site is moved on Monday to the South, and the blocking of the Asperg road was repealed in Ofterdingen, and thus the compound according to Rottenburg, has eased the traffic situation within the town.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now travel on Ofterdingen from the B 27 and again on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The diverted traffic through the village seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"There were partially significant discomfort," says the transport Management of the rehabilitation managers, Deputy head office head Florian King.</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of Bach set of road, stone, salmon street, Hafner road, and pond rain had to contend with more traffic noise, because many of the back roads were looking for and more, set your GPS to the familiar as the signs.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to some of the Truck in a residential verfranste areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">Also, since the speed limits have not been complied with, requested that the municipality strengthens the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.</seg>
<seg id="16">"There were significant Overruns," says King, who made himself the whole time about the situation competently.</seg>
<seg id="17">Since two to three have been flashed per Minute.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fastest was 77 kilometres per hour in the Tempo-30-Zone on-the-go.</seg>
<seg id="19">Since the site has moved on, it became but quiet.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the business people on the B 27, it is only a small consolation that for clients in Rottenburg now the road is open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the cards business, people do not like it.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the B 27-restructuring has led to decline in sales, everyone that asks.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some more and some less affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">Who produced to do with the "end users", less so for other companies, for the restructuring has consequences.</seg>
<seg id="25">Also at Autohaus Maier Thomas Sulz speaks of a "slight decline", but admits also that, of course, "the walk-in customers missing".</seg>
<seg id="26">Most of the Local along the road are buffeted.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert goehner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly the crown, finds clear words.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is existence-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="29">Not only him, but all the restaurants have "hit hard".</seg>
<seg id="30">It is the customer from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.</seg>
<seg id="31">We have to be happy about every Euro of sales.</seg>
<seg id="32">The loss of revenue he estimated at "well over 50 percent".</seg>
<seg id="33">The road rehabilitation have thrown the business, "two years back".</seg>
<seg id="34">Half of his employees, he had to be dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half would have been fired, would he have reacted to the policy differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, the President of the government, Jörg Schmidt on a request from goehner has answered, whether there could be a financial compensation, with the note, the restaurant benefit from the advantages of the location on the B 27. Now she had to bear the disadvantages arising from the redevelopment.</seg>
<seg id="37">Goehner know of other districts where such a thing generous was handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the case of all claims arising out of goehner is sure his restaurant will continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="39">Finally, the family-run business since 1715 settled here, he refers to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">That the other regulars are now looking, due to the complex traffic management less frequently in the past, can he understand.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't drive, it's somewhere else nice.</seg>
<seg id="42">Its regular clientele after the end of the renovation work comes back, it Göhner has no doubts.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises with BSE and bird flu goehner considers the impact of the B 27-construction works on its clientele for the biggest crisis, which has seen its restaurant in its long history.</seg>

<seg id="4">And what the coalition partners have to say about all this?</seg>

<seg id="7">You overwhelm anyone.</seg>
<seg id="8">Other, further points would first be discussed within the parties.</seg>
<seg id="9">Also due to the fact I participate.</seg>
<seg id="10">As interior Minister, he was located but results in a "recoverable consensus" within the coalition.</seg>
<seg id="11">De Maizière after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach a little time to elapse before he presented his conclusions for the security of the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="12">The fall for now, however, the more extensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">A lot is already known, proclaimed, target: a new safety authority to Crack encrypted communications to take care of, is not new.</seg>
<seg id="14">Not even the fact that Germany needs to implement a number of EU regulations on air passenger data, and weapons law.</seg>
<seg id="15">The call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security agencies is not as surprising.</seg>
<seg id="16">Part of de Maizière starts a second calls for proposals that were not make with the SPD so far: He wants to make sympathy advertising for terrorist groups and jihadists will not be so forgiving with dual citizenship, German passport.</seg>
<seg id="17">"It will be difficult points for the SPD," admits the CDU-man.</seg>
<seg id="18">He think it is still acceptable to them and also call nothing, what have the coalition partner anyway, no chances.</seg>
<seg id="19">A couple of new ideas presented to de Maizière.</seg>
<seg id="20">Have it be partially: He plans to fast-track procedure for deportation and detention of people facing deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees, who are specifically brought into the country, to let your smartphone check-in and Social-Media Accounts for a security check.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Short-for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to commit some of the worse places than previously - for example in the crimes or their papers aware of throw away, in order to disguise your identity.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of it is politically and legally sensitive.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some of it also seems half-baked and leaves open questions.</seg>
<seg id="25">And at some points - in the case of the unequal treatment of Tolerated, for example - the question arises: What has this to do with security and terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and Terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be denied that the assassin of Ansbach and Würzburg refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">In addition, many people were given the high numbers of Refugees.</seg>
<seg id="29">And things, the employees, the people deeply, also in times of election campaigns does not exclude.</seg>
<seg id="30">The internal security is extremely in focus.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only the stops in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, and nice.</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The uncertainty is large.</seg>
<seg id="34">And Yes, it's an election fights.</seg>
<seg id="35">Union and SPD to bring the issue of internal security, therefore, is increasingly in the position.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the past few days, it went between the two parties.</seg>
<seg id="37">A nasty dispute over the facilities of the Federal police, then a security-political ideas-a collection of some of the Unions-the Minister of the interior, the Department heads are calling for a burqa ban and a move away from the dual citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="38">De Maizière strives even here to conciliatory tones.</seg>
<seg id="39">Of a departure from the double-pass he don't believe in.</seg>
<seg id="40">We have pacified the discussion in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">They re-open, would not be meaningful.</seg>
<seg id="42">And in the case of a burqa ban, he had constitutional concerns.</seg>
<seg id="43">Whether its own package is to all corners of the Constitution and whether or not it is actually "reasonable" for the coalition partner, must only still show up.</seg>
<seg id="44">There is a lot in there, what could make for a fight.</seg>
<seg id="45">But the SPD is currently trying to make a name for themselves on the subject of internal security.</seg>

<seg id="26">This was confirmed last Monday, VW's representative in the Federal Ministry of transport.</seg>
<seg id="27">From the Ministry of transport, it was confirmed that there was this Meeting.</seg>
<seg id="28">"VW has to meet the requirements of my inquiry Commission of the KBA in full."</seg>
<seg id="29">"The deviations are not acceptable," said German transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), according to the Ministry.</seg>
<seg id="30">VW has taken the guarantee that in the case of fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance after the conversion, no deteriorations are taking place all type approval relevant vehicle values unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="31">Volkswagen itself does not use the term "warranty" but, as it was called in business circles.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the case of the broad term "warranty" looks to be a Volkswagen, the possibility that customers may come, for example, half a year after the conversion, for example, with a damage to the engine in a workshop - and this could lead back to the new Software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.</seg>
<seg id="33">Also in the customers interest, it is important to avoid that it comes in the case of any other damages that have nothing to do with the exhaust of the scandal, to uncertainty regarding the possible warranty provisions, as it was called.</seg>
<seg id="34">That's why VW don't use the term "warranty".</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination plates: who buys vinyl records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely middle-aged men love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you rush to the comment section to ravage him under the Pseudonym of all the lonely men of middle age, with harsh insults, this statement is derived from the current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the much talked about resurrection of vinyl records not on a Boom in Millennials, who want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to Midlife is due to nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently purchased a plate, are expected to be between the ages of 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 are the most unlikely group of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes is collectors by Hobby - it has an emotional meaning: older record-buyers to keep their feelings more to themselves (56 % vs. 53 %) and enjoy spending alone time (69 % vs. 66 %).</seg>
<seg id="8">But the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this Blog is a news report would be on TV, would follow me the camera while I walk in the midst of a bustling street in Soho, a modest gray suit and wild gestuliere, before I stop, my hands and something Decisive to say: "So, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let us take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart of SOHO is losing slowly its charm - Hotels, Restaurants, and offices fill the building, in which independent vendors were located - there are a handful of fantastic plate specialty shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would ask the camera man probably, the camera for the next part off, I am in close proximity to different men in such transactions, and attempts, your age and state of mind through observation to assess.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, the I result of Sister Ray (number of Data: two young women, three middle-aged men), Reckless Records (number of Data: eight middle-aged men, a woman, probably around 20), is a day long due to a meeting in London and going through the shops in order to fill the couple of hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">He is a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, shown above (he sent me the snapshot by E-Mail, I'm not followed him home), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and Singles, is the result of his disposable income he is now able to buy plates, which he could not afford, as they appeared, and to buy again the items, which he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Many of the things I buy are from the late' 60s, early ' 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. Things I was probably a little young to buy them for me," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy plates, are more introverted and like to be alone, to spend time, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my truck.</seg>
<seg id="22">GMT, 25, works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers he meets, apply to the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he has also noticed a new wave of people that are affected by the Medienhpe to buy people who have heard about the Comeback and forced to see again your old plates.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations I have had, got rid of people in General, so around 1998 or 1999 your collection.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers, selling their records to buy CDs, sell your CDs, to buy back your plates," he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">That would explain the Boom trailers of the plate revivals of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what is with the alleged emotional meaning of the plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It only takes a few seconds in a shop like Phonica, to recognize that record shops provides a calming community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to GMT, some of the older customers took offence at the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some of the plate's fans feel from the digital world, overwhelmed and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record sleeves back, of items, the happy youth memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can Fill a Void, and the ownership of material possessions as a kind of consolation," says Wez.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is for me as a collector, and I think that it is for many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal with mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"We are like social workers!" trills an employee of a plate stack.</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of the ICM in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who have bought last month a record that you have not listened to yet.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41 % have a record player you never use, while 7 % of those that buy a plate, do not have a record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this stage of the news report, I look probably very worried, while I flip through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, works at Sounds of the Universe (number of Data: three middle-aged men), has noted a "trophy aspect" of the Revivals.</seg>
<seg id="39">"Someone just recently came in here and said: "I don't have a record player, but I would like to buy a Radiohead record, so I can put them on the shelf," he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a great percentage, but it happens definitely.</seg>
<seg id="41">More product heavy, less music-heavy.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I don't have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older people, which will only come slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has been dedicated to the records, almost an entire floor, has a more colorful audience, as I'm going in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are a couple of the 70, tourists take photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere relaxes a little less than in the above-mentioned transactions, the Wild Beasts of the latest synth - and sexbepackter Pop instead of experimental Jazz blaring from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity in the customer.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them seem to be very lonely, but lingering psychological trauma are difficult to determine, if you are standing next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, is running around for a few minutes in the store and seen the variety of the for sale boards.</seg>
<seg id="49">Makes you more of a window shopping than shopping in bulk.</seg>
<seg id="50">You are not worthy of much, therefore the collection of disks is not a real Option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to listen to music from a Computer or in any other way, but the beauty of plates is..." she pushes with a lovestruck sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it is truly unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last Stop is a business where, it is said, that a new Generation of record lovers inspired to have: Urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the appearance, to patterns, Jeans-Hotpants, I watch a group of young teenage girls, the group for a Moment to Polaroid cameras, before a father and his daughter decide to buy a Crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">To the Left is a staircase, a wall full of records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential boards for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one looks at it - maybe because they are just purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible for them to handle.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "plate art".</seg>
<seg id="59">But in view of the fact that any attraction could mean for these items is more money for the industry and some customers in the Depths of SOHO for a more chic, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no Surprise that a group of people that has more time and money than others, is also the one the most on luxury items such as plates will be issued.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if my Research showed that the results of the YouGov vote, at least in record shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors, and record lovers that exist in reality, record stores and in online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">You don't have to spend your Thursday morning with the Stroll through the record shops of Berwick Street and scroll through panels, while the rigid look of a creepy, 30-year-old false Moderator to avoid that rises over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.</seg>

<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Trio was lucky that he had treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, was about to begin, what is the interruption kept to a Minimum, if at all, under such circumstances, even the right term.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so it had to go me better soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran to the Station, around 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time, as you said that few steps are sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="18">So it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">The rowing itself is a challenge, but that makes it even greater.</seg>
<seg id="20">The immediacy of victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, the grueling a nervous Morning for something to spent more than to talk otherwise, and thus tried to handle his own Fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Stanning, who was a captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment on a mission in Afghanistan, said, "I was this week an emotional wreck. Perhaps that's a little extreme, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It's only repeating of how much this means to me, how much I and Helen and Robin have worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin we would be nobody, so a massive Thank you to him. He is the best coach in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I couldn't imagine a better Person to Train or a better Trainer of your choice.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have lost in the last five years, not a race.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Couple had a hard rhythm, with which their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters, as the Teams from new Zealand and Denmark started to catch up, had to Stanning and Glover too much in Reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very caught up in the Moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen cried, "stay in the process, stay in the process".</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important not to get carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good Start, and at the same time, we were not there to make something Great.</seg>
<seg id="33">We wanted to today, no fireworks, we just wanted to get a good result, to go out and win the race, which we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The Couple will take a one-year break, before it will make decisions about his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover needs to appear next week at a wedding of their own with the TV adventurer Steve back hall.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now you want to just enjoy the Moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that this was my last race.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have meant too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">In London, it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="40">It was all so new to me and I was so stressed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Here, it took about four minutes.</seg>
<seg id="42">It feels so much better," she said.</seg>

<seg id="19">Thai media wanted to detect the attacks, a pattern for the bomb attacks by Muslim separatists in the South of the country is typical.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police stated, however, that the attacks were in connection with the Islamist insurgency or international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"This is just local acts of Sabotage, which is restricted to limited areas and provinces," said a spokesman in Bangkok.</seg>

<seg id="1">The rights of the "Identitarian movement" has come to the attention of the Federal office for the protection of the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="2">After several land offices of the constitutional protection authorities have asked the Federal government, the group under observation.</seg>
<seg id="3">"We see in the case of the 'Identitarian movement' evidence of efforts against the free democratic basic order", said the protection of the Constitution CEO Hans-Georg Maassen, the German press Agency in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="4">So immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East to be defamed in extremist way.</seg>
<seg id="5">Therefore, we observe the movement now.</seg>
<seg id="6">The "Identitarian movement" is a group with French roots, which is since 2012 also active in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is directed against "Multicultural madness", "uncontrolled mass immigration" and the "loss of one's own identity through Domination".</seg>
<seg id="8">The Constitution protectors in nine Federal States of Bremen, Bavaria, Hesse, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, North Rhine-Westphalia, lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - watch the "Identitarian" already.</seg>
<seg id="9">Maassen said his Agency had coordinated with the decision closely with the country offices.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Groups such as the 'Identitarian movement' to try, your audience is there to pick up where she stands," said the protection of the Constitution boss.</seg>
<seg id="11">In General, extremists, and reach "youth-friendly" language, often with pop music.</seg>
<seg id="12">Did Islamists as extremists.</seg>
<seg id="13">This is not a betuliche advertising for the own business.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Propaganda is designed to appeal to people emotionally.</seg>
<seg id="15">Young people are in particular vulnerable.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="17">Recently, there had been from several States, reports of contacts of the "Identitarian" AfD politicians.</seg>
<seg id="18">Maaßen said that he had no knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="19">For the protection of the Constitution possible contacts of this type are only from a certain point of relevance.</seg>
<seg id="20">It depends on whether the party will change, in this case, the AfD by certain persons that are extremist, its purpose, and so extremist.</seg>
<seg id="21">The decisive factor is therefore whether such individuals tax have influence on the party.</seg>
<seg id="22">This was not apparent.</seg>
<seg id="23">With a view to the significant increase in the number of right-motivated crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugees accommodations, Maaßen said that he would not speak in this connection of the new right, terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="24">But we have found in the past few years that it can give to terrorist structures.</seg>
<seg id="25">There was the group of 'Old-School Society', or the free fundamental group.</seg>
<seg id="26">It may well be that other legal terrorist groups or micro-groups, the attacks against asylum seekers, against refugee homes or attacks from other right-wing extremist motives plan.</seg>
<seg id="27">A Germany-wide or Europe-wide control of legal terrorism is not identifiable.</seg>
<seg id="28">The previous groups were created at the regional level or in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="29">Worried Maaßen said that many Assaults went on the account of people who were not previously entered into the right scene.</seg>
<seg id="30">This gives us cause for Concern.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum accommodation had not previously been Criminals, and politically motivated offenders, or followers of the right scene.</seg>
<seg id="32">"Many people have committed offences that had before, with right-wing extremists, nothing in the hat, the were, perhaps, politically indifferent or, for example, the CDU, the SPD or the Left have chosen, have radicalized, however, by right-wing extremist propaganda".</seg>

<seg id="18">The American culture seems to be in an endless Diversity and integration-the battle of conference rooms up to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in the Hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchat's large audience of young people - in terms of race more diverse than their older counter - players are more likely to assume, to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">If one of Snapchats a picture Filter created for a User offensive, "so it is much more difficult that such things go unnoticed, as was previously the case," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an Interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product Manager and engineer for Medium decided to your Snapchat account delete called on others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay for Medium, and in a telephone interview, you said that you believe that race-related Controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the recruitment practices in the case of Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticized the largely white, male leadership and finished snapchat your essay with a Hashtag: #Delete.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Either you have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so that you can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or you have people with other skin colors who work there, but not in positions in which they feel safe, or comfortable, to say something about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share your opinion, a complaint, Snapchat is largely unanswered left.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish Figures on the diversity of its workforce and draws attention to its Status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday it declined to Snapchat to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees, but according to a spokesperson, the company has set recently a recruiter that focuses on under-represented population groups and to internal integration efforts.</seg>
<seg id="28">Zhu said that they will leave your Snapchat account was closed and added, "I wonder if you need more Users like us, to not be able to say that this is o. K."</seg>

<seg id="2">Members of the military of the United States Central Command, altered intelligence information to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic state in Iraq and Syria as it would have allowed the actual conditions on site, pending an investigation Committee of the Congress in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The preliminary Report created by a Task Force of Republican members of the armed services Committee, intelligence Committee and the military budget kommites, reports of great discontent among Central Command intelligence analysts have reported on how managers changed their assessment of the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic state.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, in short, Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Intelligence information, a senior Centcom commanders were typically rubber-stamped manner, signed regularly, a more positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism than it would have allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence services", - quoted a newspaper article on the report.</seg>
<seg id="6">"What happened at Centcom, is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer, when bad analyses of our political leaders are presented," said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the house of representatives.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Leadership failure in the Centcom reach up to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten page report shows detailed persistent problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct evidence to suggest that the government have given tips under Obama's instructions, to change the reports, it shows how analysts are going to put the pressure of their pre-exposed to saw, to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic state, also known as ISIS or ISIL,.</seg>
<seg id="10">"During the first half of the year 2015, many of the Central Command press releases, goods, opinions, and statements before Congress, stated significantly more positive than it corresponds to the facts" of the report.</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a Centcom announced pair publicly that a military reconquest Mossuls could already begin in April or may 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic state.</seg>
<seg id="13">"After months of investigation, this much is clear." said Mike Pompeo, a Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="14">By the middle of 2014 until the middle of the year 2015, the leaders of the Central Command changed the intelligence reports that the threat by ISIS to play in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force, after you tool that analysts are Worried regarding the Manipulation of Reports to the Islamic state.</seg>
<seg id="16">The on Thursday released the report by more detailed findings completed during the investigation will be continued.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigation of the Centcom reports by the inspector General of the defense Ministry are in progress.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the intelligence Committee, published on Thursday their own findings, which were consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"In the years 2014 and 2015, the Centcom created an unduly restricted process for the preparation of intelligence assessments of ISIL and the Iraqi security services", announced the highest-ranking Democrat in the Committee, a member of the house of representatives Adam B. Schiff, in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="20">This process, Mr. Schiff, "delayed the publication of intelligence Reports," damaged the morale among analysts and "excessively little room for dissenting opinions."</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. ship-and the Democrats claimed to have no information on Intervention of the White house in the Centcom analysts in terms of a "political opinion" found.</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the investigations of the Congress were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast".</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported that investigations by the inspector General of the Pentagon taken after complaints from the Centcom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a spokesman for the Pentagon, said in a statement that the Ministry of defence would comment on the reports of the Congress, during the investigation of the inspector General are still in progress.</seg>
<seg id="25">But he also admitted that "experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions regarding the Interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of defence welcomed a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense."</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim which is now made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of defence).</seg>
<seg id="27">The accusations of the past year have, however, raised the question of whether President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of the military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism with regard to the intelligence information about the Islamic state are reminiscent of arguments from more than ten years ago, as a Centcom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, a piece of writing wrote about how the then government under George W. Bush, did, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, only a small occupation force in Iraq and little time transformations, to think about the consequences of the Invasion of 2003 thoughts.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current system of reporting on the Islamic state.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the past year, the Team of Mr. Hooker, after giving the government notes that, contrary to the statements of the government air strikes against the Islamic state-held refineries would have no significant impact on the financial position of the terrorist group, as these makeshift refineries would be put into operation, in order to sell Oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">This finding, however, was not released, reported the Times in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcoms former commander, gen Lloyd J. Austin III, has been criticised by members of the legislature because of his overly positive evaluation of the war situation, at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin was in April, retired and was replaced at Central Command by gen Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I am not one of the people who keep their goals in mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">You know: The Americans are 4-0 in Olympic Competition and are neck and neck in their group with the British in the first place, after their 2-0 victory against Japan unbeaten.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the midst of the Rage of the Olympic games, the Zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, it is the Olympic games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro to feel resistant, and inevitably, a frantic relay race between competition and striving.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is, as the Olympic torch itself would be a burning rod, which is passed from the archers to the float to Turner for triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper, or at the call of your neighbors in the queue in the coffee shop listening without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there are Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, for the first Time at the Olympics and a heartthrob with the dimples, would definitely build among these well-known names to be sent to the Prime Time, through sponsors and feel-good TV ads, if he was a swimmer, gymnast or even fencers.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, of Lake Forest, California, is fighting in the Olympic trampoline gymnastics Gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame lights every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, partly in the shadow of the sports that are not generally recognised: air gun shooting, archery, Badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the Breaststroke, and may it reign be long.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I could humbly make arguments for my particular favorite, then let me attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline to steer.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline since 2000, an Olympic event, as it had in Sydney, made his debut, there has not been perceived in the past 16 years, so sparse, that a lot of the, I had interviewed knew that it is an Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the United States has sent athletes to the Competition, it has never won a medal in jump on the trampoline and up to 2012, athletes had made it to the finals.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to be the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians share the for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend this year, her gold medal from London.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline has jump a certain outsider charm, partly because it sounds for the uninformed ear, more suitable for a clown school than for the Olympic games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I'm no expert, but just an earthbound Enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is humorist has potential - the cartoon-like Shaking of his never-ending thunderous impact, but also the grace of the gymnastics and diving, the two sports that unites it.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El Trampolin, which means "diving Board."</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging the winner, jump on a giant trampoline, shooting almost up to 30 feet in the air and a number of the movements (Turn, dive, and somersaults) must, before you land on your feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">You will be assessed according to the official Olympic program after the execution, difficulty, and "flight time".</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio against each other.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is a straight line.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medal hopeful must go in their quest for Gold further, faster, up and over, sometimes up to the target, sometimes there and back, up and down on the Playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">You are not just chasing the finish line or the starting wall, but in the TV broadcast also another scornful aim: to make the world or Olympic record.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal-oriented striving is noble, admirable, even fanatical, and it is enough to stir even an audience to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel when watching these games as a little tiring.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a pause for breath.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline jumper is at the top.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless as an Astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back to the top.</seg>
<seg id="34">Here, too, there is competition, of course, not without difficulty, but during the Exercise there is no frantic attack on the target, not a Dome in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is so Zen like, the competition at the Olympic Games is only can be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and finals of the women will be held on Friday afternoon, in the Streaming at 13: 00 Eastern Time and the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days, starting at 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of Olympic-mania, the promise of a quiet, nice Moment, one that is overlooked in the General hubbub probably.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the Awareness-raising can only be through the Gapes and the object classification of male athletes - as it is the male American gymnasts, according to The Wall Street Journal recently suggested - then Mr Dooley expects his air ring to the end of that new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="1">"A Generation of protest" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the United States</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators calling for political changes in Ethiopia, met with a violent resistance to the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that tens of Protesters were killed in the move during clashes with the police when shot.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia a break just to match?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West, with a fast-growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last few months-torn protests against the government of the country, and expanded in more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week, stormed thousands of people to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The response of the government was, according to human rights organizations relentlessly.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses reported that police officers shot at dozens of unarmed protesters shot and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the circulation of Videos of the protests are believed to be from the last or beginning of this year, show how security guards beat young people with sticks while they were compelled to do a Handstand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN's Commission on human rights now requires a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"It has always been difficult for this country to keep together and in the future it will be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project Manager of the Horn of Africa, International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia to Nigeria, the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated from the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians in order to combat terrorist threats beyond the Region, particularly in Somalia. Only a few countries in Africa, if at all, get as much help from the West.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a remarkable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital, Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was not a model for democracy - human rights organizations have continuously led the repression by the government - the Opposition in the country was restricted, where dissidents have been effectively Silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or to prison, killed, or in the vast Expanses of the desert driven.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"If you oppress people and they have no other options to protest unless it breaks," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="23">All of the youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A Generation of protest.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints, covering everything from land use to the stranglehold of Power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a widely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the Opposition and are now in control of 100 percent of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea; the jagged, controversial line called for in June, hundreds of lives.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that the separatists, such as the Oromo liberation front or the National liberation front in the Ogaden, which were defeated in the last few years, more or less, take advantage of the turbulence and could arm.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of resentment after years of to explode in front of Hinköchelns under the surface now.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless enough: Smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in the last years, a great many of the Ethiopians were able to communicate by means of social media, cheaper smart phones were becoming more common and the Internet improved services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter what you are doing at regular intervals, especially during protests, will be able to communicate a lot of people still on the Internet Proxies, which hide where they are.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians said that they gathered to protest.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since Eons, prosper, the Amharas from Ethiopia containing predominantly Christian countries, in politics and the economy, while Stripping the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims, and in lowland areas of life.</seg>
<seg id="37">But even that is changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"We are to co-ordinate under one umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests were held in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by way of members of the ethnic group, the Tigray, which account for approximately 6 percent of the population and are in the military, in the intelligence services, in the trade and of the policy dominant.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the riots was the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr Meles, a former rebel leader, was until his death, at a non-public-made disease in the year 2012 for 17 years, Ethiopia's Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in the early signs of discontent and to use a special representative, to edit, to opponents and to make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"The current Regime there is a lack of this basic skill," said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst.</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, has been selected from a relatively obscure reasons, the position of Mr Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray Region of Northern Ethiopia, Mr Hailemariam is from the South.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he enjoys the confidence of the Tigray-controlled security services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last Time Ethiopia had experienced such turmoil in 2005, after thousands against election protested, the were bungled, according to information from analysts appears to be from the government, and then stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the subsequent raids, many of the protesters were killed at the end, even if it were less than in the last few months, and this time the riots went by relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for its measurable progress in the fight against poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously, this has not prevented the intensification of internal resentment of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And she takes on a dangerous ethnic Form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, protesters attacked the end in Gondar, Amharic, city of Tigray-run business, and the hatred towards to the Tigray is usual in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests will bring the United States and other Western allies in a peculiar Position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, even if they recently announced that it has closed on this Basis.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West wants to give clear support to the democracy, he does not want that his ally collapses in an already volatile area.</seg>
<seg id="59">"This," said Mr Abdi, "is a very thin tightrope."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his statement Obama had been was founded ISIS "sarcasm" </seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to disperse on Friday, the last controversy surrounding his campaign, he stated that his multi-repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would be the "founder" of the terrorist group Islamic state, was not meant seriously.</seg>
<seg id="3">This raised a clarification, new questions on the communication skills of the presidential candidate of the Republicans, if he was able to communicate clearly and understandably with the American Public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is also his comrades-in-arms, the effort brings him during an event Phase, to take into protection, in the peculiar Position statements explain that he might not have even meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">After he had made the suggestion at a campaign event on Wednesday evening, rowed back to Mr. Trump in respect of the claim on Thursday and insisted in Interviews that he really had not intended to imply, the President and Mrs. Clinton ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early-morning Tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just being sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Tweet was the contrast to the previous day, at which Mr. Trump said in a series of Interviews, he said the accusation is completely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">As the conservative radio wanted to help the moderator Hugh Hewitt, Mr. Trump, the statement is to mitigate a little by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, wanted to know the Republican presidential candidate, none of that.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism rains down upon Mr. Trump, while he has to steer trying to take the focus of his campaign because of falling poll numbers on the economy.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton gave Speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return again on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="12">On Twitter reporting he warned that Mrs. Clinton would lead the proposals for higher taxes and that he is to have found your speech to be boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has argued sarcasm already to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July, he drew strong criticism, as he said, the Russians should chop Mrs. Clinton's e-mails, however, he explained later, "of Course, I was attempting to be sarcastic".</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allowed Mr. Trump to move the linguistic boundaries in the policy and to return it on demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages will be received by his Fans, as they arrive, and then, if necessary, "to clarify", depending on the reaction. " said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert, observed that the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also believe, he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">To defuse rather than set the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump accepted an even etching their sound, as his poll numbers continue to decline.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new poll from NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, which was released on Friday, showed a lead with a large margin in the States of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado, and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump tried to have for his provocative Statements, not to apologize, he blames his critics often to distort his statements, or to understand his sense of Humor wrong.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while the attention is an increasing focus in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. trump's jokes, brought his loyal comrades-in-arms in the uncomfortable Situation to have to stand by him, regardless of how provocative like his statements.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York, and one of trump's most prominent advocates, took great pains to defend the candidate today in a CNN Interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"I think what he says legitimate, political comments," Mr. Giuliani said, he was questioned as to the correctness of Mr. Trumps statements, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton would have established the Islamic state.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is in this sense true that prior to Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called backbenchers, utterly wrong, and that's why it happened, because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the Mainstream Republicans try to argue that the government, under Obama, served in the Mrs. Clinton as Secretary of state, it allowed ISIS to spread by allowing it to bring the Situation in the Middle East, aggressive under control.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them, on each of his words ride around and against him is biased.</seg>
<seg id="27">He mocked the "poor, wretched" television experts who try to understand him, and said, "you can do it!".</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the Democrats mocked Mr. trump's apology as just a further proof that he is for the presidency to be unsuitable.</seg>

<seg id="3">Of course, it was supplanted by the prices from the Bedford Avenue store front.</seg>
<seg id="4">The business of Soap Cherie, the replaced in the summer of 2014, sold soap in the Form of Cupcakes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Locals mourned it as the last loss in a gentrifizi city.</seg>
<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change, but I still can't believe, that CBGB except for dead, the Chelsea Hotel, and the Verb has now a soap business."</seg>
<seg id="7">But if New York is change, then it is also a reinvention.</seg>
<seg id="8">A reanimated Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile North of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new Verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similar simple atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old Cafés, owner and managing Director of the new cafes.</seg>
<seg id="12">He began in 2001 to work at Verb, and remained there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a customer offered money for a new outdoor site to provide, he was excited to do it, he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things.</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb used the same Distributor for the Bagels the same espresso machine model bought.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even used the same lamps from the old Verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said that he also wanted to experiment with.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the menu are Sandwiches with bacon and cheese and onion are toppings such as capers and sauteed.</seg>
<seg id="20">It's brown rice bowls.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Café serves beer, there are fresh juices.</seg>
<seg id="22">After nine months, Rodriguez said that he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.</seg>
<seg id="23">"A lot of old customers were replaced by prices from Williamsburg," he said.</seg>
<seg id="24">Recently, on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.</seg>
<seg id="25">Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and visited the Verb is regular.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after they had moved to Greenpoint, would you take the path up.</seg>
<seg id="27">After the Verb had closed, gave you a while drinking coffee, she said.</seg>
<seg id="28">"I realized that it was the coffee and culture in the Verb, which appealed to me," she said.</seg>
<seg id="29">Now she's drinking coffee again, even if you ordered that day instead of your usual Iced Coffees a Blended Chai Tea, which is another new addition.</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Rosenthal is since the beginning of the Verb, in 2003, another long-standing and loyal customer.</seg>
<seg id="31">He went there before work and ordered inevitably always the Same.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I came at a quarter past seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and prepare my Everything Bagel with Butter," he said.</seg>
<seg id="33">Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to include experimentation and new ingredients into the menu.</seg>
<seg id="34">Today, Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his Everything Bagel with bacon, Egg and cheese.</seg>
<seg id="35">Rodriguez said that he harbored no resentment about it, that the soap business has taken the old business room.</seg>
<seg id="36">In fact, the owner of the Soap Cherie offered a special soap for a Verb with the cold-brewed coffee in the cafes as an ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="37">"I think we will take her up on her offer," said Rodriguez.</seg>
<seg id="38">And the traditional Polish inhabitants "green points" have accepted the Café.</seg>
<seg id="39">A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said that he intends to issue soon, so that his new neighbors feel welcome.</seg>
<seg id="40">The location also has other advantages.</seg>
<seg id="41">A local juice locally to fill the cold brewed coffee into bottles and sell it.</seg>
<seg id="42">There is a Chance that the cafe is expanding to an adjacent building.</seg>
<seg id="43">For many customers, a new Verb is enough to get your old favorites.</seg>
<seg id="44">Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said that he was devastated when the cafe lock.</seg>
<seg id="45">As the new Café opened, said Whitt, the Entering of the premises, and the Order felt like a new coffee as of a homecoming.</seg>

<seg id="2">In March 1933, shortly after his ascent to the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, his lunch in the Oval Office.</seg>
<seg id="3">As the Gourmets, had President Roosevelt a soft spot for the refined delicacies of Fifth Avenue as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup.</seg>
<seg id="4">The menu that day was something more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and as a Dessert a plum pudding.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.</seg>
<seg id="6">Her husband Andrew Coe added,"It is also a message to the Americans was, as you eat."</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple Heights lives in Brooklyn and both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">CoE's last book, "Chop Suey" was about the Chinese cuisine in the United States, while Ziegelman writes in her book "97 Orchard" about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective.</seg>
<seg id="9">Their latest collaboration, "A decent meal", which will appear on Tuesday in the Harper publishing house, illustrates the history of the American kitchen during the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="10">They showed culinary solidarity, as a Reporter in Eisenberg's Shop Sandwich meet for dinner, a small, pure Snack bar in the Flatiron District, which is already since the stock market crash of 1929 in the business.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cheese sandwich with olives pieces, while Coe, 57, Turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate.</seg>
<seg id="12">As the Reporter meatloaf ordered, this was the Pair for a discussion about food in the Era of the Great Depression fits.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Rich food were very popular," said Ziegelman.</seg>
<seg id="14">There was peanut bread, liver, cheese, and beans bread.</seg>
<seg id="15">They were made from one ingredient and a little Cheap, the stretches of the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine, eating so many peanuts that they serve you as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">Coe grinned.</seg>
<seg id="18">"It must have been in the stomach like lead," he said.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the years before the Great Depression of the table in an American household, especially in rural areas, an All-You-Can-Eat-Buffet.</seg>
<seg id="20">Teams of women boiled for a male field worker and it was served freshly baked Pie for Breakfast, lunch, and dinner.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's the Americans, sent during the first world war of food to starving Europeans. "A Square Meal" records the ways by which the country will no longer be treated to be the land of milk and honey.</seg>
<seg id="22">"It was a time in the food for the Americans is a Central, tense theme," begündete Coe, why he and his wife write about it wanted.</seg>
<seg id="23">Just as tense, the new budget diet: secret full meals like loaves of bread and the cashier were exploit to roll staple, the Fund's role as a "wonderful Art, food scraps reuse," said Ziegelman, da chefs were able to hide unsavory ingredients in a creamy Sauce.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meat was for years the center of the American kitchen, it was to rare to be served a luxury.</seg>
<seg id="26">Peculiar blends have been tried, as a high-calorie and nährhafte satisfaction takes precedence over taste or even healthy kitchen mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">During your Research for the book, which includes recipes, prepared Ziegelman, a court of this epoch, baked onions with peanut butter.</seg>
<seg id="28">"It wasn't a popular addition on the Mittagst," says Coe.</seg>
<seg id="29">Brick man continues:"It was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and fried onions do not fit to each other.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was for many of the home Economics recipes typical.</seg>
<seg id="32">Like never before, or since, driven home economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics to host between 1923 to 1943 - the eating habits of the country such.</seg>
<seg id="33">By published recipes and articles in Newspapers and magazines, encouraged women to "budgetary policy" and the challenge to turn to Mush as creamy Spaghetti with carrots in a delicious meal.</seg>
<seg id="34">"A Square Meal" is a Feast of historic delights.</seg>
<seg id="35">Especially tasty are the reports on the government's response to the starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's Let-me-cake-and-eat attitude.</seg>
<seg id="36">While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farm house kitchen, his kitchen, fed it as the million dollar man of the world, he's become.</seg>
<seg id="37">"He liked continental cuisine, such as fish with cucumber sauce," said Coe.</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in an almost gold-plated dining-room, and wore a Tuxedo.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was delightfully out of touch with reality.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt might have committed the same error, if not to his wife Eleanor with him and was prompted to make his stomach an example.</seg>
<seg id="41">As described in the book the Hire a housekeeper led with no interest in flavors by Mrs. Roosevelt to the White house brought the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most bleak Prepared."</seg>
<seg id="42">Many of the species from the Era of the Great Depression, with food deal, was discarded as soon as the country got back on its feet.</seg>
<seg id="43">The legacy is our continued focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as how science is applied to food.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Couple were to have during the Writing of the book, the eating habits of the brick Mans mother-in-law is better understood - for example, as food could not throw away.</seg>
<seg id="45">"She had a real fear of food waste," said Coe.</seg>
<seg id="46">Ziegelman said: "you made people actually sick."</seg>
<seg id="47">There was the bag of wind incident.</seg>
<seg id="48">After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, they moved and Coe a Dessert that they had prepared at home: the plum dessert, the President Roosevelt to lunch.</seg>
<seg id="49">"It's Prune Whip called," said Ziegelman, and added that it is a common Trick was not to miss a modest of the recipes a fancy name.</seg>
<seg id="50">There was no whipped cream, only plums, flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.</seg>
<seg id="51">Everyone dipped a little reluctantly, a spoonful of the viscous, brown goo.</seg>
<seg id="52">Surprisingly, it tasted not bad.</seg>

<seg id="1">Grönlandhai: The oldest Vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare Sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Grönlandhaie come mostly in Winter to the surface.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return after an investigation aboard the research vessel Sanna into the sea.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624, and swim with a 1 km/h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Grönlandhaie get only 150 years young.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely the Grönlandhai floats at the bottom of the North Atlantic, along, in an hour, he comes in an average of 1,220 meters.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only if it comes down to it, it accelerates the five-Meter-long animal to a whopping 2.6 km/h and this maximum speed is half as fast as a seal.</seg>
<seg id="9">This slowness embossed living style seems to be a recipe for a ripe old age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" in any case, from a Grönlandhai that could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Madness," says Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max-Planck-Institute for demographic research in Rostock, this life-span, the means for Vertebrates a world record.</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolution is suspected, a biologist for a long time that Grönlandhaie be as old as the hills.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was lacking.</seg>
<seg id="14">Grönlandhaie are difficult to observe, finally, they live mainly in the Arctic ocean in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because water temperatures prefer to six degrees Celsius, at the surface usually only in the Winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">About the life style of the Grönlandhaie researchers know correspondingly little.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their slow pace, they measured, as they provided prior to Spitsbergen six animals with a transmitter equipment.</seg>
<seg id="18">Prey of these sharks still In the stomach of an animal, researchers found the Remains of a seal, another had taken the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">You may hunt sleeping animals or patrolling at the bottom of the Arctic ocean and search for carcasses, the stagger from the higher water layers to the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues studied 28 Grönlandhaie, the Fischer between 2010 and 2013, in front of Greenland, or Spitsbergen as a by-catch from the depths of the North Atlantic, it was picked up.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 inches long, while the largest 502 centimeters in dimension.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the carbon-14 method the lens nucleus of the sharks.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is the center of the lens of the eye develops before birth, the sharks, the proteins are not renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks were striking a lot of carbon-14 in the lens core.</seg>
<seg id="25">Your birth should be, therefore, to the early 1960s, when nuclear tests threw large quantities of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the 220 centimetres, the length of the third smallest Tier of the lens nucleus contained a small Excess of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons tests, it is expected at the time of his examination in 2012, his 50. Celebrated the birthday.</seg>
<seg id="27">All of the major Grönlandhaie had in your lens core, by contrast, the normal carbon-14-quantities produced by cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 clock showed a 493 centimetre long Grönlandhai an age of 335 years, during the record-breaking shark is likely to be 502 centimeters even be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Grönlandhai-females can have offspring, if they are longer than four metres, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now, researchers at the length were able to assign an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">As one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably on the threshold of sexual maturity, and his age was determined to be 156 years, Grönlandhaie with the propagation seem to be at least one and a half centuries of time.</seg>
<seg id="32">Also for vertebrates is currently the world record.</seg>
<seg id="33">Such Methusaleme life, especially in icy waters, is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">The previous record holder, a 211 year-old bowhead whale, in the Speck on the neck of a 120-year-old harpoon tip was in, was caught off the coast of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there on the back burner to be running frequently.</seg>
<seg id="36">They Mature later and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep in the cold water is warm, the animals are also often very large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, by which the animal heat is losing.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss from one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"A smaller animal is so hazardous, and should focus on, to have as early as possible as many as possible offspring," explains evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.</seg>
<seg id="42">A very large animal should invest its resources more in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="5">They repeated the Trick, after you picked up in March at the world track Championships in London despite the resignation of Hoys only a modest sixth place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Problem is between Beijing and London, the replacement of the Anfahrers Jamie Staff was.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in a timely manner as Hindes appeared.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retirement created a gap, Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton were trying to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man, they remained, as they saw potential in the Scotsman, which has now developed.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - the won four years ago, with Hoy and Skinner sat in the qualifying rounds, an Olympic record, but in the standard rounds were won by the new Zealanders in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British Trio won the duel with Gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hindes fell after his round, tight, but Kenny brought the Team to the front, and Skinner thought it was.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy was a big part of the Transformation, in the Hindes in a higher gear drove to slow it down and allow it Kenny, and especially Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked out of his Position as a BBC expert, and it occurred to Skinner, Kenny and Hindes, as these rose to the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">The 23-year-old Skinner, from Glasgow, said: "It is a flattering is the comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my Best and to make a name for myself.</seg>
<seg id="17">We have placed in the final round, an Olympic record and the world champion defeated.</seg>

<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the Triumph of 2012 on the side of Kenny's and Hoys Hindes admitted that he fell after a weak Start on purpose on the train.</seg>
<seg id="21">He withdrew this statement later, and there is no right of appeal of England's rivals came.</seg>
<seg id="22">In a stunning victory this Time there was no such Problem.</seg>
<seg id="23">Hindes said: "It feels with all the GB flags on the grandstand as London."</seg>
<seg id="24">We came together in the last three months as a Team.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have titles with so many of the World's so bad, that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the Nation which won seven of 10 titles in both Beijing and in London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a Barometer of our progress in the last five months that await us successful five days in the velodrome.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the Form of Kenny's, it is Possible that he medals Hoys win three Olympic gold in a competition repeatedly.</seg>
<seg id="29">This would be for Kenny - exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, also on 23. March, was born (apparently a sacred date for the British sports; on the day, Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger were born Bannister) - a yield of six gold medals and one silver medal mean.</seg>
<seg id="30">It would be the same of Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes the next Sprint, which starts today, and in three days will go.</seg>
<seg id="32">The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I'm enjoying this just for the Moment."</seg>
<seg id="33">The Team event is always best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely, to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">Hindes said: "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be knighted."</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there was more good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-man, Four-kilometre race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived in 3:51,942 on the target.</seg>

<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) take place today on the second day of the Wettbewers, in the case of the Wiggins with a focus on safety and security.</seg>
<seg id="42">He had a fight yesterday with the representatives of the qualification, as officials called for, to measure his body size.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding Women's event, which continues tomorrow and finishes, advanced Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world-record time in 4:13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB Team relies on its strong track Cycling team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic games and to pick up a bevy of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly exceptional display of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio have been shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">It is drama being played in the Background, the resignation of the technical Director Shane Sutton in April, in the midst of sexism and bullying allegations, as well as the retirement of greats such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">If you look at the first night of competition at the velodrome, it looks as if the now legendary reputation of GBs, the has reached the perfect Moment of his climax could be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="1">The future of the Smelter at Portland due to cancellation of the power contract is questionable</seg>
<seg id="2">The future of the aluminum melt of Portland in Victoria - as well as the hundreds of jobs from workers - are at stake, as the plant operator to supply the energy contract terminate, and all supply contracts will pick up, as the supplying energy company announced.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year, to be awarded any further subsidies to the operation of the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A 20-year subsidy runs out in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Alcoa in Portland.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 jobs -direct and indirect - could be at risk in the case of a closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, there could be Domino effects, since the Smelter consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity generation in Victoria.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014, Alcoa completed the Point Henry Smelter, and what led last year to a closure of the Anglesea power plant.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Smelter of Alcoa in Portland is losing money and the risk of a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the year-long speculation regarding the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and, most recently, due to the price of Electricity for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, the large aluminium smelter supplied with its Loy Yang A power station in the Latrobe Valley, announced that it expects three more owners will cancel their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The facility is located in the majority ownership of a Joint Venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and Japan's Marubeni Corp to hold smaller shares.</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL anticipates that the facility in Portland will continue to be operated, which means a further physical demand for electricity by the Smelter," the company said.</seg>
<seg id="14">AGL said that the contracts were so-called "hedging transactions" that should occur would be November 2016.</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so you will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Therefore, AGL assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenue," said the electricity supplier.</seg>
<seg id="17">All of the potential impact on revenue to AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the predictions of the strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL announced that it had written down the value of the contracts already in its Annual financial statements in the amount of $ 187 Million in "anticipation of termination".</seg>
<seg id="19">Alcoa said that the decision to derecognise contracts to ensure the"ability to Alcoa's... to operate the Smelter or the power supply to the Smelter" affect.</seg>
<seg id="20">The U.S. company said that it had completed in 2010, a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which should occur by November of this year would be in force, even if it is still a Declaration is guilty of, why it has withdrawn from the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn due to the bad economic condition of the industry prior to the possible closure of the Portland Smelter in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">In reference to the statements of the analysts in the beginning of the week the Head of Operations, Stephen Mikkelsen, said that Portland annually consume around 600 MW, and Tomago, around 900 megawatts of electricity.</seg>
<seg id="23">Both systems should disappear from the market, it would mean a significant reduction in the demand on the [electricity market].</seg>
<seg id="24">And for us as a producer of electricity that would not be good," he said.</seg>

<seg id="5">Scientists have previously suggested that the slow Rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest Simulation suggests that Venus might have had a thin atmosphere similar to earth's, and still slowly turned.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also highlighted the topography of the early history of Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Planet was probably more dry areas than de earth, but once had enough water, and geographic variability, to accommodate life and faster evaporation protected.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.</seg>
<seg id="10">"In the GISS model simulation Expo the slow Rotation of Venus returned to your day side of the sun for almost two months," said GISS scientists Anthony Del Genio, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This heats the surface and produces the rain which creates a thick layer of clouds that acts as a rain screen, the surface shield of a majority of the sun's heat.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest Mission-the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers the most complete catalog of rotation rates to collect under the stars in the star cluster of the Pleiades.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data will help astronomers to understand why stars rotate in the Star cluster at different Rates, as well as the context in which the rotation periods of planet formation.</seg>
<seg id="4">"We hope that we will be told by Comparing our results with other star clusters, and more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of the solar system," Luisa Rebull, a research scientist at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Star cluster of the Pleiades is located about 445 light years away from earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">A lot of stars in this Star cluster, which originated approximately 125 million years ago, are now reaching adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">Turning now to the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">To launch top-of-the rotation rates of these Mature stars, large amounts of stellar winds.</seg>
<seg id="9">As these winds by the magnetic fields of the star are traveling, you will have a brake effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">When a star ages, it begins its rotation rate to slow down.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star, by detecting the time between the appearance of a recognizable star-spots -- sun spots--.</seg>
<seg id="12">The latest catalog from rotation rates indicates that more massive stars rotate slower than less massive stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with larger stars rotate slower pirouettes than smaller ones.</seg>
<seg id="14">"In the "Ballet" of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotors tend to be solid, whereas the faster the rotors will tend to be very bright stars," said Rebull.</seg>

<seg id="17">According to the report, it should be of a prohibited substance to the blood doping agent EPO.</seg>
<seg id="18">Danekowa has been provisionally suspended, according to the BNT, the B-sample is already positive.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgaria's Prime Minister Boyko Borisov, reacted immediately with criticism of the athlete.</seg>
<seg id="20">"I don't understand why the athletes draw the right conclusions," he said: "We, Bulgarians, are under observation, as many have already been excluded".</seg>

<seg id="1">Data theft: So perfidious hackers to extort their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmer of blackmail Malware attack is currently targeted company and are successful in doing so.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey by the anti-Malware specialist Malwarebytes under 540 companies in North America, the UK and Germany, 40 percent of companies surveyed in the past twelve months have been at least once, some several times the victim of an attack with malicious Software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, nearly 20 percent of the companies were already the target of a Ransomware extortion.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of victims paid willingly by the perpetrators demanded ransoms to the compromised systems and data re-use.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize your blackmailer Software according to the observations of Malwarebytes increasingly to attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">You are successful, the potential to gouge the end of ransom is significantly higher than for private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Today we are seeing a terrifyingly rapid Evolution of malicious software," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski in an interview with the "world".</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most of the malware programs were designed, to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators of the blackmail Software discovered for.</seg>
<seg id="11">First-time users were private the goal, but the change to the company's attacks took place in the past few months, shockingly fast.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: on the Computer of a victim actively seeks you are specifically looking for recently modified files, such as Word, Excel, or database files as well as archives of images and Videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files are encrypted the Ransomware and delete the originals in a sustainable way.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then the Software presents the demands of the blackmailer.</seg>
<seg id="15">In order to get the Endschlüsselungs-Code the files, you must transfer the victim's money - usually in the Form of the crypto currency Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where in the case of private users, the personal photo-database on the game.is company sensitive customer data, or project databases, without which the production is at a standstill</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the higher the damage is, if a Ransomware hits.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of German companies reported sales losses caused by Ransomware, 13 percent had to the business activity complete interrupt, in one case, people in life danger.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, houses were already multiple sick victims of the attacks, the patients can be threatened by the loss of medical records in acute.</seg>
<seg id="20">"We say to the Victims is always: don't Pay, you are promoting the Problem," says Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="21">However, 80 to 90 percent of the firms pay to get your data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers, it is difficult, in the face of deadlock in the operation, the requirement of the offender to reject.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers know this and try everything to have a good Reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, security researchers from F-Secure have studied the User interfaces and the contact with the Extortionists, and come to the conclusion that The perpetrators actually try, a kind of customer service to build, to make more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">You explain to your Victims via Chat, as you by Bitcoin, can pay, free-to-access Support Websites, or to decrypt free sample files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And private redeemed people after the payments of a few Hundred Euro, companies need to negotiate, in part hard and five-digit numbers sums to your unencrypted data back.</seg>
<seg id="27">Due to the potentially high and relatively risk-free profits from the Ransomware extortion, the Hacker will always be professional and share the work, says security expert Chester Wisniewski, from anti-virus vendor Sophos: "A single Person can write a Ransomware approximately within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">More likely, however, is that there are three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their malicious software in the Form of a Software module to the actual blackmailer.</seg>
<seg id="30">The existing Malware Kits created by the Malware itself, advising, and additional Tools were purchased for a one-off, fixed price between 1000 and $ 10,000.</seg>
<seg id="31">"In the scope of supply, an adjustment tool is included, so that smaller configurations, appearance and Branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmailer then look for more hackers to the fresh purchased spread Software among the Victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service economy.</seg>
<seg id="34">You logged out in one of the forums in the underground, buy the Set of a Criminal, and instructs another in order to install the Software on as many PCs.</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is made per infected computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"Usually, the Criminals then instruct spammers with the spread," explains Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now used at many companies are known, which can secure your data better.</seg>
<seg id="38">About 50 percent of corporate IT managers in the Malwarebytes-survey trust, a Ransomware with file-Back-ups and scanner software to fend off.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"If the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful Erpessung more, threaten the perpetrators instead, with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thus, the damage potential is depending on the type of data to be many times higher than it was before.</seg>
<seg id="42">Also, the offender could take in the future, entirely new targets on the Internet of things.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the hacker conference Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they were able to get an Internet-connected Thermostat under your control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of the Winter could be the activation of such blocked heating some of the victims quite a ransom value.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators of the block then instead of the heater, in the future, a whole production line in a factory, could Ransomware are also in the industry 4.0 a topic.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="1">Old buildings, a couple of Linden trees, between a Rest cobblestone: The Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain, at first glance, not so, however, the police is considered to be the "Dangerous places" in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">If one goes from East to West along, you will find playgrounds, a freshly painted nursery and a health food store.</seg>
<seg id="3">On the facade of the grey house, someone has sprayed "ugly!".</seg>
<seg id="4">Opposite a Lidl, which is also supposed to be soon demolished, will be built by 2017 here is a house with high Windows and 133 new rental apartments.</seg>
<seg id="5">Article about this "trendy" as the competent real estate company Friedrichshain called, are illustrated in the last few weeks, however, preferably with burning cars.</seg>
<seg id="6">Reason, the house with the number 94 is: Once it was occupied, in the meantime, the residents of leases have, on the ground floor are, however, still occupied space, and can be used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Especially the Berlin interior Senator Henkel had spoken since the beginning of the year several times for tough action by the police against the project, the area as a "No-Go-Zone" for police officers and the 94 as the starting point of Autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After on 22. June, the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, had been cleared with the 300 police officers that patrolled the police for three weeks, the official said that 30 to 40 officers and three squad cars on site, locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, renovated a construction worker in behalf of the unknown owner of the house, the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">13. July, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the eviction had been illegal, and a day later the police and the construction workers withdrew to the cheers of supporters and local residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon, the street is peaceful: parents with children walking, people sitting on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk in front of the Späti.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects, a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left-wing violence is not the main of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives since 1999 in the neighborhood, and Jana*, the draws here are three children, concern, are annoyed especially by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the residents of the house projects you share concerns about rising Rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It doesn't sound like a neighborhood, the police wanted the majority of the protection against vandaliere Left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The trench, the Berlin Senator for the interior and the police, occupants between the house and their neighbours open the door, so does not exist apparently.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in former East Berlin, a traditional working-class district, which has today, compared to the Rest of the city with a low average income and high poverty risk actually was.</seg>
<seg id="18">Also squatting, and the out-housing projects have long been the neighborhood in 1990, a number of houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost all of the Mainzer road in the vicinity of Riga.</seg>
<seg id="19">During the Mainz squad under a great deal of police in a street battle had been cleared, many of the projects legalized in Riga, and are partly inhabited today by the people which they had occupied before the age of 26.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district is in recent years increasingly become a magnet for tourists and Berliner-by-choice from all over the world to become: With you local residents from the GDR now share-times and former squatter in their neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also the case of the Rents, which have risen since 2009, in the case of new leases to nearly 60 percent.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the buildings in Riga are attacked as symbols of this development: they have inserted slices or freshly painted facades that were thrown at bags with the color.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned so often this year, together with the words "left-wing violence".</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason for this is that not all of the neighbors see this as a Problem, it could be that you are not affected by the crime: crimes such as personal injury are addressed according to statistics, almost exclusively against the police.</seg>
<seg id="25">The largest part of the offences, damage to property, which tend to be more likely to make the new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives for 17 years in a tenement house, in addition to the controversial 94, can be a uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As for violence, it is uplifting: The people in the 94 are your neighbors, not all of them had been determined.</seg>
<seg id="28">The famous burning of cars, it is not directly in the Riga.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architect your street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary, "Here, help each other, living together on the road and gets more from each other than anywhere else".</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately drawn in the Riga road and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">That's why it was so important that the residents get their road back: the police, politicians and the media, which in July all of a sudden the sovereignty of interpretation claimed for the district.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, in the eyes of residents, such as Neugebauer on the road is taken away from them, By faceless new buildings in former vacant lots, displacing the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Yes, ultimately, ownership of dwellings, which are not for many people here, interesting people here who are not so well-heeled well-'ll be more," she says.</seg>
<seg id="34">"Violence and destruction, I can't countenance."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what are you supposed to do when a never-someone is listening?</seg>
<seg id="36">As a on all sides of the Frustration, even the police and the residents.</seg>
<seg id="37">For newcomers, the resent color bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer little understanding: The in-house projects and left the scene belonged to the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="38">Who drags, you should be aware of this - just like someone who draws in a bar district, there are bad noise can complain.</seg>
<seg id="39">All first names only featured people have asked to be with her correct name</seg>

<seg id="5">The social worker supports the Team in administrative Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees herself as the contact person for all actors involved: refugees, working group on refugee assistance, administration, authorities and who will be involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer from the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the eggs legend Jack of all trades, has a Problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">Some had less mocking and more on the variety of desired tasks in targeted areas - meant, as the administration wanted to contest the point.</seg>
<seg id="9">Was looking for an administrative professional with a Talent for languages and people, connected with many years of experience in the field of social work, a Jack of all trades.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, administrative work is not your main area, says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Especially going to be the organization, working with the local people and behind-the-Scenes, as well as network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-Year-old for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">She has a temporary 50-percent point, to three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"It was high time," says Regine customer that Annika Deuschle honor - and the main support of official actors.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and small problems, organisational, human and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon a new Container in the Wasen road</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious Problem is there since some time, to find housing for the connection of the refugees who have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">For the follow-up accommodation are the responsibility of municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="19">You need to the refugees in their own or rented residential premises.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost for the construction, rental, or renovation of these properties will have to bear the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the district office to the municipality and the job centre.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: There are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search is on for some time as very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the management finds no private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">It's not working so far, you had to rely on private dwellings, Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, municipal apartments need to be upgraded, as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon to be placed in the new Container in the Wasen road.</seg>
<seg id="28">But with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective, the keyword is Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a fixed place to Stay, there are internships, training places, school places,-Euro-Jobs and Temporary jobs for refugees and migrants, the gefundnen or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"More places would be good," says Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">A lot of work in the yard or help house masters, do non-profit work and the motivated and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reported.</seg>

<seg id="34">The "no-work".</seg>
<seg id="35">Activity does not mean only work.</seg>
<seg id="36">Of the day need a solid structure, say Deuschle and the customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">The people would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So there is a need for programmes such as Sport, contacts with the Locals, and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are scarce.</seg>
<seg id="40">So, administrative and Volunteer to be a jump here, too.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is Central that the refugees get the feeling that you were in Germany, and welcome.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure had a Problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">You have to explain to the refugees that it takes a long time and you can bypass the time-useful, for example, with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Who will develop at some point the feeling that he could help in Urbach anyone, could not work and was useless, the will to integrate never.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority was motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">Problem cases there are but also says a customer, to be honest, "people, where anything goes". The work of Deuschle and the customer is therefore always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">All of this was a "mammoth task".</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: Have the two of them after the recent occurrences, and the fear of radicalisation, even in a small community such as Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"No," says Regine customer is clearly, "what may some call naive." A residual risk cannot and does not want to exclude.</seg>
<seg id="50">Be aware of the helpers.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents were also the subject of the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">The had the fear that the assassin will bring you completely into disrepute.</seg>
<seg id="53">"You want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So and Volunteers are on - site and in the Region need to keep activities looking.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the Background that soon a new shock could come on refugees and migrants, according to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need an upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly, is not afraid of the policy.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it is unfair, you helpers on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="60">"In Urbach, we are not yet arrived where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer is also clear that the Urbacher are also utilized to integrate the human reasonable.</seg>
<seg id="63">The are currently around 100 people, mostly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But if people are in Need, you have to help you, both women agree.</seg>
