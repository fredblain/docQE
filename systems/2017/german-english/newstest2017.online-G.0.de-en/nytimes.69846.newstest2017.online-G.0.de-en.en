"A Generation of protest" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators calling for political changes in Ethiopia, met with a violent resistance to the government.
Witnesses say that tens of Protesters were killed in the move during clashes with the police when shot.
Is Ethiopia a break just to match?
In the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West, with a fast-growing economy.
But in the last few months-torn protests against the government of the country, and expanded in more and more areas.
Last week, stormed thousands of people to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.
The response of the government was, according to human rights organizations relentlessly.
Witnesses reported that police officers shot at dozens of unarmed protesters shot and killed.
In the circulation of Videos of the protests are believed to be from the last or beginning of this year, show how security guards beat young people with sticks while they were compelled to do a Handstand against a wall.
The head of the UN's Commission on human rights now requires a thorough investigation.
"It has always been difficult for this country to keep together and in the future it will be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project Manager of the Horn of Africa, International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia to Nigeria, the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated from the West.
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians in order to combat terrorist threats beyond the Region, particularly in Somalia. Only a few countries in Africa, if at all, get as much help from the West.
Ethiopia's economy expanded at a remarkable pace.
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital, Addis Ababa.
The roads are generally quiet, safe and clean.
Even if Ethiopia was not a model for democracy - human rights organizations have continuously led the repression by the government - the Opposition in the country was restricted, where dissidents have been effectively Silenced.
Many were sent into exile or to prison, killed, or in the vast Expanses of the desert driven.
But that could change.
"If you oppress people and they have no other options to protest unless it breaks," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia.
All of the youth protested.
A Generation of protest.
There are numerous complaints, covering everything from land use to the stranglehold of Power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the Opposition and are now in control of 100 percent of the Parliament.
At the same time, tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea; the jagged, controversial line called for in June, hundreds of lives.
Analysts fear that the separatists, such as the Oromo liberation front or the National liberation front in the Ogaden, which were defeated in the last few years, more or less, take advantage of the turbulence and could arm.
Several factors explain why feelings of resentment after years of to explode in front of Hink√∂chelns under the surface now.
The first seems harmless enough: Smartphones.
Only in the last years, a great many of the Ethiopians were able to communicate by means of social media, cheaper smart phones were becoming more common and the Internet improved services.
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter what you are doing at regular intervals, especially during protests, will be able to communicate a lot of people still on the Internet Proxies, which hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said that they gathered to protest.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
Since Eons, prosper, the Amharas from Ethiopia containing predominantly Christian countries, in politics and the economy, while Stripping the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims, and in lowland areas of life.
But even that is changing.
"We are to co-ordinate under one umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The largest protests were held in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by way of members of the ethnic group, the Tigray, which account for approximately 6 percent of the population and are in the military, in the intelligence services, in the trade and of the policy dominant.
The third reason for the riots was the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr Meles, a former rebel leader, was until his death, at a non-public-made disease in the year 2012 for 17 years, Ethiopia's Prime Minister.
He was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.
Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in the early signs of discontent and to use a special representative, to edit, to opponents and to make them harmless.
"The current Regime there is a lack of this basic skill," said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, has been selected from a relatively obscure reasons, the position of Mr Meles.
Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray Region of Northern Ethiopia, Mr Hailemariam is from the South.
Analysts say that he enjoys the confidence of the Tigray-controlled security services.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last Time Ethiopia had experienced such turmoil in 2005, after thousands against election protested, the were bungled, according to information from analysts appears to be from the government, and then stolen.
During the subsequent raids, many of the protesters were killed at the end, even if it were less than in the last few months, and this time the riots went by relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for its measurable progress in the fight against poverty.
But obviously, this has not prevented the intensification of internal resentment of the Ethiopian government.
And she takes on a dangerous ethnic Form.
Last month, protesters attacked the end in Gondar, Amharic, city of Tigray-run business, and the hatred towards to the Tigray is usual in the social media.
Analysts say that the protests will bring the United States and other Western allies in a peculiar Position.
The American government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, even if they recently announced that it has closed on this Basis.
While the West wants to give clear support to the democracy, he does not want that his ally collapses in an already volatile area.
"This," said Mr Abdi, "is a very thin tightrope."
