Russia and Turkey: An "Alliance of outsiders"?
It was a gesture that ended in a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday, to give the hands and proclaim a formal end to the eight months lasting war of words and economic sanctions.
But as Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish opponents in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, in the reception, I can not honor me the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation to the most.
There was the handshake, Yes.
But Putin seemed to Smile, tight-lipped, and he radiated almost no heat, even for his laid-back circumstances.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke, however, repeated his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report five times.
I could not count it.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to your old level before the crisis, but even be improved.
The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have had to be in a daze, as if never happened something Bad.
To me, his enthusiasm seemed to be rather the opposite.
But a Putin-emitting, sustainable Coolness showed that the head of state of Russia had nothing to forget.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the First thing he mentioned in his introduction words: the shooting down of a Russian combat aircraft to the Syrian border by Turkey.
Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.
Putin informed and accused Ankara to be Russia in the back like that.
The Offense was even greater because it was perpetrated by a supposed friend.
The trust will establish difficult, if not impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media waged a fierce, full attack on Ankara.
At once it seemed as if the Turks would carry the blame for everything.
The most serious of the allegations by senior officials that Erdogan would have benefited his own family from the illegal Oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic state.
He has vehemently denied.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward.
Finally, this Meeting took place only because Putin received from President Erdogan the excuse he wanted to hear.
Russia has achieved a kind of victory.
For Ankara, the advantages of weapons are at a standstill.
Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was dismissed last month in a failed coup almost of his office.
Again terror took attacks on Turkey have shaken him also.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular, the prohibition of Charter flights that bring out every year, usually several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast.
The number has decreased by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and Charter companies will be facilitated if the flights will be resumed.
You can count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean sea.
This week, the state television predicted that cheaper fruit and vegetables, as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports to be allowed again.
A report in Vedemosti put it as follows: "tourists there are long, tomatoes here long."
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is on the West angry, since it is acquisition, whose response to the attempted power as a weak response.
The persistent resentment on the snail's pace of the EU accession negotiations, and Putin is eager to draw from the cool mood Use and to reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West.
The Russian head of state won in Ankara with a Bonus that he called after the attempted coup, support for the elected organs of the state.
This is for Moscow, mind you, as a matter of course, the self has to change a deep-seated fear of the Regime.
The summit of this glittering Palace on the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey, as described to me by an analyst, "Alliance of outsiders" to represent two countries which are in breach from the West and ill-treated feel, and now ally.
Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation between the two is still large differences.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role as a peacemaker, but where do Russia and Turkey have opposing sides to support.
It could be significant that after nearly three hours of initial talks, both presidents at the press conference stating that they would not have touched on the topic once.
The President of Turkey avoided it intentionally to a question about their differences to the answers, while Putin emphasize this decided to.
There is no clear consensus, where there is a common denominator to Syria can be found.
But after months of open hostilities - and, given the potential for a complete Disaster, as NATO-member Turkey shot down the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state at least talk to each other again.
