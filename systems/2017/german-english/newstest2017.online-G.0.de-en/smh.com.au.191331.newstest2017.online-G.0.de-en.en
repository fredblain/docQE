Donald Trump election campaign indicted after allegedly gun pulled
New York: Donald trump's campaign has been indicted for alleged inaction after she was informed that her campaign Manager for North Carolina, in February, I directed a gun on an employee while they were in February in a Jeep on the road.
The incident is described in an indictment that was filed on Wednesday in the district court of Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in this state.
Bordini was to have for months maintained that the matter would be dealt with before he realized that " this would not happen."
The campaign Manager, Earl Philip, " pulled out a gun, put his right index finger on the trigger, and rammed the barrel into Vincent's knee," said Bordini in his charge.
After he had complained to the local and regional campaign management, Bordini, that already at least four other people had the same experience with Phillip, he was in the indictment.
"Weapons need not be fired to cause harm," said Bordini.
The indictment comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused an uproar when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment folks" shot gun owners and Weapons enthusiasts - measures should take, if his rival Hillary Clinton to be elected, and the judge should appoint.
Trump's campaign clarified that the media had taken his words out of context and that he would not incite violence.
Bordinis complaint demanded damages from the campaign for the violation of the duty of care and of Philip, because of physical injury and lasting psychological damage.
Trump's spokeswoman Hope Hicks could not be reached for comment.
Attempts to contact Philip to fail as well.
WCCB, a local news channel in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer employee of the campaign.
On calls for his consulting business, Innovative Consulting Services, was not responding.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has so far led a controversial campaign.
The procedure is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President, Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
