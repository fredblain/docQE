How to protect yourself with Krav Maga weapon attacks
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this Video of Dailymail.com could it make for you a bit safer.
We spoke with Rhon Mizrachi, a Grand master of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Regardless of whether you will show approaches you from the front or from the rear watch this Video to see how you turn around for your robber, the tables.
If one approaches you from behind, then you should turn around First, so you can see their attacker and "out of the firing line," says Mizrachi.
You take the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder before you hit him with your free elbow into his face.
You beat him then with the knee in the bar, and twist, while the attacker bends in pain, the weapon from his hands. You beat him with the barrel face and you move backwards while pointing the gun at him.
In the case of attackers who approach from the front, is the technique similar to move your body out of the line of fire, grab the weapon and twist it so that the attacker can not shoot.
You shift at the same time the weight of the gun and hit the attacker in the chest, then twisting the gun from his grip, before moving backwards and the gun at him.
Sounds difficult?
Watch the Video to see exactly how it's Mizrachi's dominance.
But remember that when a robbery is safest to hand over your money - unless you are a Krav Maga are the Grand master.
