Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "go where it hurts"
Strange Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania: The Locals get nothing from the summer election campaign and the holiday makers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to select the diet.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern you have understood.
In 2021, the state election will not take place directly at the end of the summer vacation, has decided the Schwerin Parliament already in the beginning of the year.
As stupid as so far it's not: summer holidays, heat, and state election campaign - the bite.
The Locals to be convinced of the choice of fighters are on a holiday.
Most of the vacationers who are in the country, on the island of Usedom, Rügen and Hiddensee on-the-go, are not Natives, they are not allowed to select the diet.
These are practical problems: In the holiday volunteers, the posters are inflating, balloons, distributing flyers, and at the end of vote counting, just hard to find.
To 4. September 2016, the election and the last day, must of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania once again the election campaign, at the people passing endure.
The hot Phase, if one can even say, has just begun.
And it's also about something: the Prime Minister, Erwin Sellering, the leader of a SPD/CDU coalition, has to fear for his office.
The SPD since 1998, the strongest party, is now in the polls, well behind the CDU.
Exciting it is, how strong is a newcomer to the AfD is performing and what remains at the end of the coalition-grade left.
Selle ring, 66 years old, and since 2008 the head of government, makes an almost inconspicuous-looking election campaign, one of his large posters.
He travels the country, distributed roses and plauscht a little with the people, so as to be legendary taciturn predecessor, Harald Ringstorff, fact.
Otherwise soul ring got cold feet and Chancellor Angela Merkel to blame for the Bloom of the AfD.
Their refugee policy, you do have accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists, which will cost him now will probably be the nice the office.
The CDU, with its top candidate, the Minister of the interior Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it is like when you at the wrong time, right place campaign.
She has twice been invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large rallies; Merkel election to the Bundestag circle is located in the North-East.
But the target audience is wrong, it's more of North Rhine-were-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as the Mecklenburg and Western Pomerania.
"As the majority of other States was likely," said Vincent Kokert, Secretary-General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently in the NDR.
But it is a pity also to anyone from other parts of Germany, even Angela Merkel to listen to.
Otherwise, the northeast, the CDU largely dispenses with the usual election campaign stalls at market places and shopping malls with parasols, and air balloons.
So, Kokert assumes only play a "subordinate role".
The European Union has also noticed that her wegbröselt on the Land base that you have to work very hard, to find a wire to the people.
She's like the Left, the SPD, the Greens: in the far reaches of the country.
The Council of the CDU-choice of fighter Kokert to his comrades-in-arms, however, is also self-revealing: "you have to go where it hurts, namely, where the people are: village celebrations, Golden weddings, any birthday celebration needs to be used".
Because much is at stake, selle ring called on his SPD to a very dedicated campaign.
In polls, the social Democrats were last with 22 percent, behind Partner, the CDU (25) and only just ahead of the AfD (19).
In the 2011 election, the SPD had gained a clear yet with 35.6 percent of the CDU (22).
The Greens, a minor party, with seven per cent in the polls, is likely to make the leap in the Parliament.
You make the vacation-Not a modern virtue, and transfer its election campaign in large part to the Internet.
"Online campaign", announced the Chairman Claudia Müller.
Otherwise, green choice fighters go in search of tracks according to the local voting citizens and visitors.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, just curves with a house boat through the Mecklenburg lakes, and finds it beautiful.
Your impression: "election holiday in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania is not a punishment".
