The rights of the "Identitarian movement" has come to the attention of the Federal office for the protection of the Constitution.
After several land offices of the constitutional protection authorities have asked the Federal government, the group under observation.
"We see in the case of the 'Identitarian movement' evidence of efforts against the free democratic basic order", said the protection of the Constitution CEO Hans-Georg Maassen, the German press Agency in Berlin.
So immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East to be defamed in extremist way.
Therefore, we observe the movement now.
The "Identitarian movement" is a group with French roots, which is since 2012 also active in Germany.
It is directed against "Multicultural madness", "uncontrolled mass immigration" and the "loss of one's own identity through Domination".
The Constitution protectors in nine Federal States of Bremen, Bavaria, Hesse, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, North Rhine-Westphalia, lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - watch the "Identitarian" already.
Maassen said his Agency had coordinated with the decision closely with the country offices.
"Groups such as the 'Identitarian movement' to try, your audience is there to pick up where she stands," said the protection of the Constitution boss.
In General, extremists, and reach "youth-friendly" language, often with pop music.
Did Islamists as extremists.
This is not a betuliche advertising for the own business.
The Propaganda is designed to appeal to people emotionally.
Young people are in particular vulnerable.
This is dangerous.
Recently, there had been from several States, reports of contacts of the "Identitarian" AfD politicians.
Maaßen said that he had no knowledge.
For the protection of the Constitution possible contacts of this type are only from a certain point of relevance.
It depends on whether the party will change, in this case, the AfD by certain persons that are extremist, its purpose, and so extremist.
The decisive factor is therefore whether such individuals tax have influence on the party.
This was not apparent.
With a view to the significant increase in the number of right-motivated crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugees accommodations, Maaßen said that he would not speak in this connection of the new right, terrorism.
But we have found in the past few years that it can give to terrorist structures.
There was the group of 'Old-School Society', or the free fundamental group.
It may well be that other legal terrorist groups or micro-groups, the attacks against asylum seekers, against refugee homes or attacks from other right-wing extremist motives plan.
A Germany-wide or Europe-wide control of legal terrorism is not identifiable.
The previous groups were created at the regional level or in social networks.
Worried Maaßen said that many Assaults went on the account of people who were not previously entered into the right scene.
This gives us cause for Concern.
Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum accommodation had not previously been Criminals, and politically motivated offenders, or followers of the right scene.
"Many people have committed offences that had before, with right-wing extremists, nothing in the hat, the were, perhaps, politically indifferent or, for example, the CDU, the SPD or the Left have chosen, have radicalized, however, by right-wing extremist propaganda".
