London school girl who joined the IS, was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British school girls who left last year to London, to the IS to connect, died, according to Reports, in Syria.
The lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said that her family learned a few weeks ago of her death in Raqqa, Syria.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air strike in Raqqa, the stronghold of the group in the country, reported ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old, and died, according to her family shortly after she was planning to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
"One can only hope that the only Good is to go to as a reminder and a warning to others that these are the risks that are associated with it, in a war zone - to keep people from ever make this decision," said Akunjee.
In February 2015, the Sultana and two other school girls from East London were in a plane direction of Turkey and then a Bus to the Syrian border.
Sultanas family was informed that she has married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and within a few months the widow was.
