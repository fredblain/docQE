Clinton's and trump's economic policies compared: It's all about the money
In infrastructure investing, and the trade agreements TTP prevent the want to both Clinton as well as Trump.
Divided the two US presidential candidates are, however, tax policy and energy policy, as well as a question of principle.
The Differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, was a General, rather philosophical difference.
Of the, about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep the software small, and warns how the government can damage the economy with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wool tax the economy to death and regulate death, he says.
He would himself, however, is quite different, says Trump.
He will go back to the regulations, solid, and he makes for a far-reaching tax reform, with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies.
Clinton, however, says: The state has to fulfill certain tasks, he has to give Disadvantaged opportunities and needs for money.
Therefore, the taxes would be increased for the Rich, she says.
Interesting, both are very close to the subject of infrastructure.
In the needed to be invested in, say, Trump and Clinton the same, almost word.
The democratic candidate announces the biggest investment in new jobs since the Second world war.
State investment programs in infrastructure are the classic democratic politics, and to be rejected by the state critical tea party wing of the Republican strictly.
To Trump so the party could face internal discussions.
More marked are the differences in the energy and climate policy.
Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and coal production in the United States.
Oil production should also be in previously protected areas, the Paris climate protection agreement he wants to terminate.
Clinton wants to expand their investment program, specifically the Renewable energy and calls for: "A country will be the super power of the clean energy and millions of Jobs."
"It will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be there."
However, not only in the infrastructure, even in the case of international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other.
TPP, the TRANS-Pacific trade agreement, not want to both sign.
At the same time both don't want to isolate but the U.S. from the international trade - but just American Jobs.
Which should be paid better, asks about Clinton.
The current minimum wage of 7.25 dollars is a pittance.
It wants to increase to 15 dollars per hour.
What do Trump in this question is not very clear: Once he says: The minimum wage needs to go up, then he says that he ought not to be changed.
However, the big discussion in the coming months is likely to develop has more to do with the tax policies of the two camps.
On the one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the burden on the economy and the citizens, in order to stimulate growth.
His critics hold him, so that the budget deficit would only get bigger.
On the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least to demand of the Rich that they pay more tax, and whose critics say: More taxes are the solution.
