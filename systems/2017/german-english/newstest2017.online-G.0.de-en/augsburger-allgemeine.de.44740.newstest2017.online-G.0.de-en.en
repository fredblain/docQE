Escape: "Any refugee woman has experienced sexual violence"
Sexual violence is for women who flee alone, almost everyday.
When you arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house provides shelter.
In a large kitchen, four women sit.
Each of them has a Baby that is not more than a year old.
A laid her little son in the Arm.
He looks with big eyes curious in the room.
His mother is staring at the tabletop.
Until she realizes that she is observed.
She smiles briefly and kisses the Little one.
The scene is normal.
Until we speak with Katrin Bahr.
She is area Director of Condrobs, institution for social assistance in Bavaria, and deals with the topic of women on the run.
The four women in the kitchen are Refugees.
You live in the North of Munich in one of the few decentralized accommodation for all Inge escaped women and their children in Bavaria.
In January Condrobs has opened the facility together with Pro Familia, and the Munich-based woman help.
Recently it was officially opened.
60 people live there - approximately 40 women and 20 children.
Men, there is none - not even as a visitor.
The exception is a security guard in front of the door.
"It is no exaggeration to say that Every woman that comes here, has made it on their flight experiences with sexual violence," says Bahr.
"Men flee because of Wars, because they are politically persecuted, because of torture, or the death, or because their families send hope to Europe," she says.
In women, other reasons for the escape outweigh that: "Many steal secretly away, because they see no other way out".
In their homeland they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honour killings, slavery or forced made prostitution.
You continue driving.
On the run, the list goes on.
"That tractor demand, for example, for a bottle of water, a sexual act, is not uncommon," says Bahr.
And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Those who believe that the end, once you come and ask in Germany, is misleading, says Bahr.
Here, too, single women in refugee would accommodation, often considered inferior and, at worst, abused.
The result is that about 90 percent of women living in accommodation in the North of Munich, are traumatized, and appreciates you.
"Some of the kids are certainly not created voluntarily."
Many women are so used, that they say nothing.
"Or you do not dare to speak openly about the experience, because the shame is too great".
Since you don't know help often, need it more accommodations just for you, calls for Bahr.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments for the accommodation of refugees, in charge.
On the question of whether they knew of a similar project in Munich in the area of its competence, the answers some.
In the upper Palatinate and upper Franconia, about there is no such thing in accommodation of the governments.
Also in Swabia alone, refugee women are housed separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press Secretary of the government.
In upper Bavaria, and middle Franconia, there are some community accommodation floors or own-houses for single women and their children.
The exception is Bavaria, there are two Central properties exclusively for women.
Also, the Committee "women's rights and gender equality" in the European Parliament demands that women must be segregated from men, are housed.
In a study published for the Committee, said: "It's very important that men and women are separated houses."
"The lack of privacy, or men and women be housed together, it can - the continuous violence against women".
Especially, the washing should be separated, and for women, shall be easily accessible, in the study.
How the women feel this need to protect, you can read the crowd on the house in Munich.
"Since around spoke, that it gives us, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr.
You could easily open a second house.
