Despite the Olympic disappointment: Martin fighters remain
Despite his disappointing performance in the Olympic time trial wants to be a professional cyclist Tony Martin does not get to you.
"I keep the world Cup in view, stay confident and keep fighting," wrote the 31-Year-old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro in Facebook.
An explanation for his miserable twelfth place at the sugar loaf, he has not.
"I find it hard, to be honest, the time to comment on yesterday," said Martin.
He had to analyze in tranquility, what reasons had led to the debacle.
At the time trial world championship in October in Qatar, Martin wanted to fight actually for the title.
"I'm going to look at everything very carefully, what we have changed in the last time."
"My Position is one," wrote the three-time time trial world champion, who had lost on Wednesday to the 54.5 km, more than three minutes on the Olympic champion Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland).
