Military service information, guide distort ISIS secret Committee of Congress
Members of the military of the United States Central Command, altered intelligence information to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic state in Iraq and Syria as it would have allowed the actual conditions on site, pending an investigation Committee of the Congress in a report on Thursday.
The preliminary Report created by a Task Force of Republican members of the armed services Committee, intelligence Committee and the military budget kommites, reports of great discontent among Central Command intelligence analysts have reported on how managers changed their assessment of the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic state.
The Central Command, in short, Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Intelligence information, a senior Centcom commanders were typically rubber-stamped manner, signed regularly, a more positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism than it would have allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence services", - quoted a newspaper article on the report.
"What happened at Centcom, is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer, when bad analyses of our political leaders are presented," said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the house of representatives.
The Leadership failure in the Centcom reach up to the top of the organization.
The ten page report shows detailed persistent problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi armed forces.
Although there is no direct evidence to suggest that the government have given tips under Obama's instructions, to change the reports, it shows how analysts are going to put the pressure of their pre-exposed to saw, to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic state, also known as ISIS or ISIL,.
"During the first half of the year 2015, many of the Central Command press releases, goods, opinions, and statements before Congress, stated significantly more positive than it corresponds to the facts" of the report.
For example, a Centcom announced pair publicly that a military reconquest Mossuls could already begin in April or may 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic state.
"After months of investigation, this much is clear." said Mike Pompeo, a Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement.
By the middle of 2014 until the middle of the year 2015, the leaders of the Central Command changed the intelligence reports that the threat by ISIS to play in Iraq.
The Republicans called the Task Force, after you tool that analysts are Worried regarding the Manipulation of Reports to the Islamic state.
The on Thursday released the report by more detailed findings completed during the investigation will be continued.
In addition, further investigation of the Centcom reports by the inspector General of the defense Ministry are in progress.
Democratic members of the intelligence Committee, published on Thursday their own findings, which were consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"In the years 2014 and 2015, the Centcom created an unduly restricted process for the preparation of intelligence assessments of ISIL and the Iraqi security services", announced the highest-ranking Democrat in the Committee, a member of the house of representatives Adam B. Schiff, in a statement.
This process, Mr. Schiff, "delayed the publication of intelligence Reports," damaged the morale among analysts and "excessively little room for dissenting opinions."
But Mr. ship-and the Democrats claimed to have no information on Intervention of the White house in the Centcom analysts in terms of a "political opinion" found.
The preliminary results of the investigations of the Congress were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast".
Last August, the New York Times reported that investigations by the inspector General of the Pentagon taken after complaints from the Centcom analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a spokesman for the Pentagon, said in a statement that the Ministry of defence would comment on the reports of the Congress, during the investigation of the inspector General are still in progress.
But he also admitted that "experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions regarding the Interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of defence welcomed a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense."
The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim which is now made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of defence).
The accusations of the past year have, however, raised the question of whether President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of the military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
The criticism with regard to the intelligence information about the Islamic state are reminiscent of arguments from more than ten years ago, as a Centcom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, a piece of writing wrote about how the then government under George W. Bush, did, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, only a small occupation force in Iraq and little time transformations, to think about the consequences of the Invasion of 2003 thoughts.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current system of reporting on the Islamic state.
In the past year, the Team of Mr. Hooker, after giving the government notes that, contrary to the statements of the government air strikes against the Islamic state-held refineries would have no significant impact on the financial position of the terrorist group, as these makeshift refineries would be put into operation, in order to sell Oil on the black market.
This finding, however, was not released, reported the Times in September.
Centcoms former commander, gen Lloyd J. Austin III, has been criticised by members of the legislature because of his overly positive evaluation of the war situation, at a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin was in April, retired and was replaced at Central Command by gen Joseph L. Votel.
