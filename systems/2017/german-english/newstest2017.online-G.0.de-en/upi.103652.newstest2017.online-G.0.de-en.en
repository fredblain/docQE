Kepler rotation measures the rate of stars in the Star cluster of the Pleiades
The latest Mission-the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers the most complete catalog of rotation rates to collect under the stars in the star cluster of the Pleiades.
The new data will help astronomers to understand why stars rotate in the Star cluster at different Rates, as well as the context in which the rotation periods of planet formation.
"We hope that we will be told by Comparing our results with other star clusters, and more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of the solar system," Luisa Rebull, a research scientist at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The Star cluster of the Pleiades is located about 445 light years away from earth.
A lot of stars in this Star cluster, which originated approximately 125 million years ago, are now reaching adulthood.
Turning now to the fastest.
To launch top-of-the rotation rates of these Mature stars, large amounts of stellar winds.
As these winds by the magnetic fields of the star are traveling, you will have a brake effect on the stars.
When a star ages, it begins its rotation rate to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star, by detecting the time between the appearance of a recognizable star-spots -- sun spots--.
The latest catalog from rotation rates indicates that more massive stars rotate slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with larger stars rotate slower pirouettes than smaller ones.
"In the "Ballet" of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotors tend to be solid, whereas the faster the rotors will tend to be very bright stars," said Rebull.
Because the Star cluster of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities, such as rotation rates.
"The Star cluster of the Pleiades provides an anchor for the development of theoretical models of the stellar Rotation in both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.
There is much still lies ahead of us, about what we want to know how the slow rates of How, when, and Why stars in their Rotation, and a sort of "dance shoes" to hang up.
Rebull and her colleagues have in three Newspapers report in detail on their latest analysis of the rotation of the Pleiades rates reported, will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
