Carrier shall not be liable: fall on passenger boarding bridge
A carrier shall not be liable for the crash of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
Because a liability is only when the dangers are conceivable, which are typical for the air traffic, argued the higher regional court of DÃ¼sseldorf (Az.: 18 U 124/14).
The plaintiff had broken in the fall, a knee-cap.
The accident, however, can happen anywhere - it was a General life risk, the court said.
The airline had to pay the man damages.
