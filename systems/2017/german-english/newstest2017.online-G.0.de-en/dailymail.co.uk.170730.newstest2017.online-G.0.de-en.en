Buyer in Primark outraged about the woman who tried on the heart of the business shamelessly underwear
The buyer did not know where you should look, as a woman took off her clothes in the middle of a Primark, pants to try on.
To aggravate the Situation, looked at her, how she looked in it, took them off and put them back on the shelf.
They browsed and tried on four Pairs of pants in a store in Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone,.

A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was at the same time in the business, said that after the mysterious woman had tried on the underwear, "she pulled back, and the store left without buying anything."
She said: "people could not believe what they saw."
In the middle of the sales floor, standing, she took a Pair of panties from the Display, took off her own tights and pants and tried them on.
"She tried to find a slightly more discreet place to do it - you just stood there, bold as brass."
"Everyone stared as she took off the pants again, not like you obviously, since you put it back on the shelf."
Again the same repeated with a further three under pants before you decided that you liked nothing, re-dressed and went out.
"You didn't seem to bother it, that someone was watching - or thinking about the Person that would buy under the circumstances, the panties she had tried on."
Mrs Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said think:"How disgusting that someone would take the pants home, which she wore to another Person and not washed."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Mrs Davidson added:"As I've noticed, have tried the staff to pull the garments from the sale, after you went to - what is just as good."
"I would hate to go with a new Pair of pants to go home and find out that another woman was wearing them and again took off and you were not washed."
A spokesman for Primark said:"Primark of the incident, on Tuesday, may 9. August in our branch in Folkestone occurred."
All of the products in question were withdrawn from sale.
