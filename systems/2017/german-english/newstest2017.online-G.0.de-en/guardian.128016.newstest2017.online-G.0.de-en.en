The Prefecture of Calais argued that these places should be demolished, because they would constitute a parallel economy, the taxes paid would be and the mountains will be a fire and health risk.
Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and Restaurants were important because of the free meals offered by the state-supported Association and other groups, would not provide enough food for the growing Numbers in the warehouse.
They claimed, moreover, that the temporary shops and Restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in Need.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of people, the operate of the 72 temporary stores, but acknowledged that the concerns of the Prefecture of Calais were "absolutely understandable."
The judge Jean-Francois Molla said that the grocery shops, Cafés and Restaurants, would play a much greater role, as to feed only the people "in an extremely precarious conditions of life."
He said that the areas in a quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that was threatened by the low tear, the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the warehouse, which is gemeinnnützig operated and 200 meals a day, English - and French classes, as well as advice on asylum matters for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied Minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the Petition to preserve the Kids' Café.
In a letter to the Guardian, it was said that the closure "would be for these children in a disaster, of which the youngest eight years old."
The two aid organisations Help Refugees and L'auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of in the jungle camp Living had increased to over 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in the number of new arrivals over the summer.
