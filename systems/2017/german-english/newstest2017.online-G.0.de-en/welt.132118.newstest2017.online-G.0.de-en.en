Data theft: So perfidious hackers to extort their ransom
Programmer of blackmail Malware attack is currently targeted company and are successful in doing so.
According to a recent survey by the anti-Malware specialist Malwarebytes under 540 companies in North America, the UK and Germany, 40 percent of companies surveyed in the past twelve months have been at least once, some several times the victim of an attack with malicious Software.
In Germany, nearly 20 percent of the companies were already the target of a Ransomware extortion.
40 percent of victims paid willingly by the perpetrators demanded ransoms to the compromised systems and data re-use.
The perpetrators specialize your blackmailer Software according to the observations of Malwarebytes increasingly to attacks in corporate networks.
You are successful, the potential to gouge the end of ransom is significantly higher than for private users.
"Today we are seeing a terrifyingly rapid Evolution of malicious software," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski in an interview with the "world".
In 2008, most of the malware programs were designed, to send advertising.
Then the perpetrators of the blackmail Software discovered for.
First-time users were private the goal, but the change to the company's attacks took place in the past few months, shockingly fast.
Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: on the Computer of a victim actively seeks you are specifically looking for recently modified files, such as Word, Excel, or database files as well as archives of images and Videos.
These files are encrypted the Ransomware and delete the originals in a sustainable way.
Then the Software presents the demands of the blackmailer.
In order to get the Endschl√ºsselungs-Code the files, you must transfer the victim's money - usually in the Form of the crypto currency Bitcoin.
But where in the case of private users, the personal photo-database on the game.is company sensitive customer data, or project databases, without which the production is at a standstill
Accordingly, the higher the damage is, if a Ransomware hits.
22 percent of German companies reported sales losses caused by Ransomware, 13 percent had to the business activity complete interrupt, in one case, people in life danger.
In Germany, houses were already multiple sick victims of the attacks, the patients can be threatened by the loss of medical records in acute.
"We say to the Victims is always: don't Pay, you are promoting the Problem," says Kleczynski.
However, 80 to 90 percent of the firms pay to get your data back.
For managers, it is difficult, in the face of deadlock in the operation, the requirement of the offender to reject.
The hackers know this and try everything to have a good Reputation.
In a recent study, security researchers from F-Secure have studied the User interfaces and the contact with the Extortionists, and come to the conclusion that The perpetrators actually try, a kind of customer service to build, to make more money.
You explain to your Victims via Chat, as you by Bitcoin, can pay, free-to-access Support Websites, or to decrypt free sample files.
And private redeemed people after the payments of a few Hundred Euro, companies need to negotiate, in part hard and five-digit numbers sums to your unencrypted data back.
Due to the potentially high and relatively risk-free profits from the Ransomware extortion, the Hacker will always be professional and share the work, says security expert Chester Wisniewski, from anti-virus vendor Sophos: "A single Person can write a Ransomware approximately within a week."
More likely, however, is that there are three or four people.
The programmers sell their malicious software in the Form of a Software module to the actual blackmailer.
The existing Malware Kits created by the Malware itself, advising, and additional Tools were purchased for a one-off, fixed price between 1000 and $ 10,000.
"In the scope of supply, an adjustment tool is included, so that smaller configurations, appearance and Branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.
The blackmailer then look for more hackers to the fresh purchased spread Software among the Victims.
We live in a service economy.
You logged out in one of the forums in the underground, buy the Set of a Criminal, and instructs another in order to install the Software on as many PCs.
The payment is made per infected computer.
"Usually, the Criminals then instruct spammers with the spread," explains Wisniewski.
The risk of Ransomware is now used at many companies are known, which can secure your data better.
About 50 percent of corporate IT managers in the Malwarebytes-survey trust, a Ransomware with file-Back-ups and scanner software to fend off.
Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.
"If the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful Erpessung more, threaten the perpetrators instead, with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski.
Thus, the damage potential is depending on the type of data to be many times higher than it was before.
Also, the offender could take in the future, entirely new targets on the Internet of things.
At the hacker conference Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they were able to get an Internet-connected Thermostat under your control.
In the middle of the Winter could be the activation of such blocked heating some of the victims quite a ransom value.
If the perpetrators of the block then instead of the heater, in the future, a whole production line in a factory, could Ransomware are also in the industry 4.0 a topic.
