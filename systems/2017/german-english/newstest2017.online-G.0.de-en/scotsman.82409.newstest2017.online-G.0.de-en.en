Scot Callum Skinner rushes home, Brite Gold for Cycling wins
Scotland's Callum Skinner raced last night in the men's team Sprint at the velodrome in Rio to fame, as the British Team defended the title of London 2012.
The 23-Year-old from Glasgow took up the anchor role, which had made his country man Sir Chris Hoy. The youngster made the legend proud as he stormed home for a victory of the favourites new Zealand in the us.
England claimed four years ago, a shocking victory, while the Hoy took the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
They repeated the Trick, after you picked up in March at the world track Championships in London despite the resignation of Hoys only a modest sixth place.
The Problem is between Beijing and London, the replacement of the Anfahrers Jamie Staff was.
They did this in a timely manner as Hindes appeared.
Hoys retirement created a gap, Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton were trying to close.
Skinner was the man, they remained, as they saw potential in the Scotsman, which has now developed.
Hindes, Kenny - the won four years ago, with Hoy and Skinner sat in the qualifying rounds, an Olympic record, but in the standard rounds were won by the new Zealanders in the first round.
And the British Trio won the duel with Gold.
Hindes fell after his round, tight, but Kenny brought the Team to the front, and Skinner thought it was.
A change of strategy was a big part of the Transformation, in the Hindes in a higher gear drove to slow it down and allow it Kenny, and especially Skinner to keep the pace.
Hoy looked out of his Position as a BBC expert, and it occurred to Skinner, Kenny and Hindes, as these rose to the podium.
The 23-year-old Skinner, from Glasgow, said: "It is a flattering is the comparison."
I'm just here to do my Best and to make a name for myself.
We have placed in the final round, an Olympic record and the world champion defeated.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win this.
After the Triumph of 2012 on the side of Kenny's and Hoys Hindes admitted that he fell after a weak Start on purpose on the train.
He withdrew this statement later, and there is no right of appeal of England's rivals came.
In a stunning victory this Time there was no such Problem.
Hindes said: "It feels with all the GB flags on the grandstand as London."
We came together in the last three months as a Team.
We have titles with so many of the World's so bad, that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.
This is an event, a gold medal for the Nation which won seven of 10 titles in both Beijing and in London.
If this is a Barometer of our progress in the last five months that await us successful five days in the velodrome.
With the Form of Kenny's, it is Possible that he medals Hoys win three Olympic gold in a competition repeatedly.
This would be for Kenny - exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, also on 23. March, was born (apparently a sacred date for the British sports; on the day, Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger were born Bannister) - a yield of six gold medals and one silver medal mean.
It would be the same of Hoy.
Kenny takes the next Sprint, which starts today, and in three days will go.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I'm enjoying this just for the Moment."
The Team event is always best.
You can win it with his colleagues.
It feels a bit lonely, to win alone.
Hindes said: "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be knighted."
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there was more good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-man, Four-kilometre race.
They arrived in 3:51,942 on the target.
The world record, won the 2012 Gold in London was at 3:51,659.
The first and final round (22.42) take place today on the second day of the Wettbewers, in the case of the Wiggins with a focus on safety and security.
He had a fight yesterday with the representatives of the qualification, as officials called for, to measure his body size.
In the corresponding Women's event, which continues tomorrow and finishes, advanced Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world-record time in 4:13,260.
The GB Team relies on its strong track Cycling team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic games and to pick up a bevy of medals.
After a truly exceptional display of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio have been shut down.
It is drama being played in the Background, the resignation of the technical Director Shane Sutton in April, in the midst of sexism and bullying allegations, as well as the retirement of greats such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
If you look at the first night of competition at the velodrome, it looks as if the now legendary reputation of GBs, the has reached the perfect Moment of his climax could be repeated again.
