Salzburg's "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare year, the Salzburg festival presents games, the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as the tragic lovers, similar to Romeo and Juliet.
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A Musical conquered Salzburg: the "West Side Story", Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.
The artistic Director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the Musical to the temple of the classical period and fulfilled the role of Maria is a dream of youth.
In the orchestra, the Simón Bolívar orchestra under the direction of the venezonalischen conductor Gustavo Dudamel dig: "This music is full of rhythm," he enthuses.
We always say that it is very marked in Latin America.
There are a lot of Latin American ingredients in your Tempo and melody.
It is a wonderful blend, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say that we have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this production, Bartoli plays an older and more battle Maria.
She remembers with nostalgia of her romance with Tony, while the younger, Maria, plays, and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
Firstly, because it is musically exceptional!
And then Mary would be there personality.
She says it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright".
She is so smart, of course, also naive, and very passionate.
"She resembles me very much, my Italian character, I as a Roman woman," laughed Bartoli.
Dudamel is full of praise for the Opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It is such an honor for us to work with her.
She is a tremendously generous person.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "he is an exceptional artist and very passionate!"
Conducting for him is a necessity.
You can see it in every one of his movements, in his eyes, it is his life!
There is a huge Chance this musical experience with him to share.
We both have a rather southern Temperament, a fire, a passion and a joyful approach to life is very important!
For the American Director Philip Wm. McKinley, the "West Side Story" is highly topical: "In this piece it is to prejudice and fanaticism."
Today we have the refugees, at that time, the Puerto Ricans went to New York, and the New York residents they didn't want to.
There are the same topics, and they are today as meaningful as it was then.
59 years later the piece is still relevant.
