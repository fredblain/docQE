Once the price out of the market, come back cafe in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby Café in Williamsburg, where you could only pay in cash, had no Wi-Fi, but for 15 years, good coffee is served.
Of course, it was supplanted by the prices from the Bedford Avenue store front.
The business of Soap Cherie, the replaced in the summer of 2014, sold soap in the Form of Cupcakes.
Locals mourned it as the last loss in a gentrifizi city.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change, but I still can't believe, that CBGB except for dead, the Chelsea Hotel, and the Verb has now a soap business."
But if New York is change, then it is also a reinvention.
A reanimated Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile North of its original location.
The new Verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similar simple atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old Cafés, owner and managing Director of the new cafes.
He began in 2001 to work at Verb, and remained there until the end.
When a customer offered money for a new outdoor site to provide, he was excited to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things.
Verb used the same Distributor for the Bagels the same espresso machine model bought.
It even used the same lamps from the old Verb.
But Rodriguez said that he also wanted to experiment with.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the menu are Sandwiches with bacon and cheese and onion are toppings such as capers and sauteed.
It's brown rice bowls.
The Café serves beer, there are fresh juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez said that he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.
"A lot of old customers were replaced by prices from Williamsburg," he said.
Recently, on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and visited the Verb is regular.
Even after they had moved to Greenpoint, would you take the path up.
After the Verb had closed, gave you a while drinking coffee, she said.
"I realized that it was the coffee and culture in the Verb, which appealed to me," she said.
Now she's drinking coffee again, even if you ordered that day instead of your usual Iced Coffees a Blended Chai Tea, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal is since the beginning of the Verb, in 2003, another long-standing and loyal customer.
He went there before work and ordered inevitably always the Same.
"I came at a quarter past seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and prepare my Everything Bagel with Butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to include experimentation and new ingredients into the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his Everything Bagel with bacon, Egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said that he harbored no resentment about it, that the soap business has taken the old business room.
In fact, the owner of the Soap Cherie offered a special soap for a Verb with the cold-brewed coffee in the cafes as an ingredient.
"I think we will take her up on her offer," said Rodriguez.
And the traditional Polish inhabitants "green points" have accepted the Café.
A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said that he intends to issue soon, so that his new neighbors feel welcome.
The location also has other advantages.
A local juice locally to fill the cold brewed coffee into bottles and sell it.
There is a Chance that the cafe is expanding to an adjacent building.
For many customers, a new Verb is enough to get your old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said that he was devastated when the cafe lock.
As the new Café opened, said Whitt, the Entering of the premises, and the Order felt like a new coffee as of a homecoming.
"I had to smell it," he said.
