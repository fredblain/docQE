Rain instead of shooting stars: the hope of the weather improving
The weather has made the shooting stars-Watchers in the southwest of Germany in the night of Friday, a line through the invoice - however, there is still hope.
The night had been suitable because of clouds and rain bad to watch the sky spectacle, said the Chairman of the Observatory Welzheim, and Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.
Our hope is on the night to Saturday.
The weather is supposed to be good, then we can see many shooting stars in the sky.
In the case of the star scales are the Perseids, which belong with 216000 miles per hour of the fastest shooting stars.
Their name because they appear to come from the constellation Perseus, in the North-East rises.
