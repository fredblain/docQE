Cats are more sensitive than males to the cries of the young animals
Biologists have studied in Hannover, the effect of the cat's babies on adult animals.
Not to let her Surprise, the Meowing, the male cold - however, they behaved, in contrast to the females, always the same.
Female cats can detect the degree of agitation of the baby cats at the Meow of the Little ones.
They respond to ten percent faster on Sounds of kittens, who believe themselves in great Distress, as scientists from the University of Veterinary medicine and the Hannover Medical school (MHH) have found out.
Cat to respond to the Call of the kitten, however, is always the same.
"Apparently, the acoustic differences between the Meowing from less, and greatly excited the young animals for the males either not noticeable or not of importance", said the biologist, Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
She is first author of the study, which was published this Friday in the journal "BMC Evolutionary Biology".
In a previous study, the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the kitten screams with the urgency of their need for assistance.
Were observed a total of nine adult cat and eight females from the animal husbandry of the MHH.
You were playing a Call of Small, which were taken for three minutes from the Wurfbox and of the mother and the siblings separated.
On the other, they were faced with a shout of more excited kitten, which, in addition, were lifted high.
The researchers believe their findings despite the small sample for meaningful.
"All females, even those who had no own offspring, reacted differently to the cries of," said Konerding.
They turned faster to the speaker, if this Call was the very erregteren kitten.
This ability may be innate or develop itself to Mature with the sex.
"A Surprise was that the males have ever responds," said the biologist.
In the past, scientists have studied already several times in humans, the reactions of women and men to baby noises.
Also some studies showed that women reacted more sensitive on babies, regardless of whether they were mothers or not, reported the biologist Marina Scheumann.
