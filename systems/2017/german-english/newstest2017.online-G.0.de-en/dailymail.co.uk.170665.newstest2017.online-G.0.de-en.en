The £2-per-day drug, which can lower heart attack risk
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £2-per-day medication, after by the authorities, it was recommended this to more people for a longer period of time to administer.
The antiplatelet drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is already administered for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack is reduced.
The regulatory authority NICE, the NHS has recommended a four-year-long taking to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.

Around 140,000 people suffer each year from a heart attack and a quarter of them will suffer another heart attack or a stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes fat seizures by collections containing material in the arteries causes the walls, of the pads.
If the plaque breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot that plugs the blood flow to the heart and thus a heart attack caused.
If the blood clot breaks off, it can flow through the blood stream and the blood flow to the brain become clogged, which caused a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack, are subject to a higher risk of another one.
Ticagrelor, which is manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca under the trade name Brilique is distributed, reduced this risk by making blood clots less likely.
The manual design from NICE, published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of Aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, Director of NICE's health technology evaluation centre, said: "Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack will have another heart attack or a stroke - often with disastrous consequences."
The fear of a recurrence of a heart attack can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of a Person.
The experience shows that Ticagrelor in combination with Aspirin is effective in the reduction of further heart attacks and strokes in people who already had a heart attack.
By a provisional recommendation of Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to the thousands of people who can benefit from it.
The Information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding is limited to a period of up to three years. The draft does not recommend a treatment that goes beyond this period.
