NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
Venus was according to the projections of a new NASA climate model likely once habitable.
Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus, on the basis of Tools and Algorithms that are similar to those of Climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus could have shown with your hot, waterless surface, and CO2-dense atmosphere of a once earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that the slow Rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest Simulation suggests that Venus might have had a thin atmosphere similar to earth's, and still slowly turned.
The model also highlighted the topography of the early history of Venus.
The Planet was probably more dry areas than de earth, but once had enough water, and geographic variability, to accommodate life and faster evaporation protected.
The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.
"In the GISS model simulation Expo the slow Rotation of Venus returned to your day side of the sun for almost two months," said GISS scientists Anthony Del Genio, in a press release.
This heats the surface and produces the rain which creates a thick layer of clouds that acts as a rain screen, the surface shield of a majority of the sun's heat.
The result of average temperatures a few degrees cooler than that of earth today.
The model produced a history of the Venus, which is similar to the Evolution, which was previously suspected by planetary researchers.
Although it was probably habitable, was exposed to the Venus -- in the course of several billion years --too much heat and ultra-violet light.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapor was burned away from the ultra-violet light.
As their Hydrogen escaped, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide was a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus, the know how, we are today.
The researchers, the results of your new Venus climate model, announced in Geophysical Research Letters.
