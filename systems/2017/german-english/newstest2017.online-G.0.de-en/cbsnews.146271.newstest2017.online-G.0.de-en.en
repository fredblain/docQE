The mother of a 6-Year-old with Microcephaly: "It gets better"
Like most 6-Year-old Edmund Picciuto loves to Sing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But as the least of his contemporaries Edmund Microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder, which his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto know during your pregnancy nothing.
When he first came home, was my first thought, I can do this.
I can't do it.
I've gotten myself into.
What is not true at all -- of course you admitted it," she said.
Her husband Vincent, and she was informed that Edmund can, you may never recognize and that he may not survive.
Some Doctors even went so far that they proposed to institutionalize him.
"My initial response was, 'I knew that the people make are still,'" explained Picciuto.
Edmund can run with the help of a Walker.
Edmund was able to sit up to the age of three, or crawl and he still can not speak.
But he is making slow progress.
He can walk with support and to ride a Bicycle.
He also loves to play with his two brothers and to sing.
Elizabeth shows the sign language devised by Edmund for "Please sing to me"."
"We teach him sign language," told Picciuto CBS News.
But it is not a typical sign language -- is she says. Edmund has invented some of the characters alone.
Microcephaly has numerous causes: genetic, such as in the case of Edmund, as well as infections with viruses such as measles or the Zikavirus during pregnancy.
The symptoms and prognosis can vary greatly.
It is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the Zikavirus Infected.
Picciuto remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I constantly asked, what will happen?
What is going to happen?
And you know, it is still not really.
I haven't been asked for a long time, according to the forecast, because I expect that you can tell someone really.
But Picciuto has a hopeful piece of advice for mothers of infants with birth defects that were caused by the Zikavirus.
It will be better.
You know that it will be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love.
