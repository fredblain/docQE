The soprano Anna Netrebko openly with the autism of her son, Tiago, and is addressed to other parents: "you need to have the courage to talk about it."
"The medicine has made great progress," said the 44-Year-old to the Italian newspaper "Corriere della Sera".
As the disease had been detected in her son, she believed she had to die.
The now eight-year-old Tiago was well forward and have the opportunity to meet privately in New York, where there is the best therapist.
"To give an example: If I have to, he reminded him a little question, what is two years, when I sang at La Scala in Milan, to nothing," said Netrebko.
But he is the happiest man on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebkos connection with the bass-baritone Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to the Tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
