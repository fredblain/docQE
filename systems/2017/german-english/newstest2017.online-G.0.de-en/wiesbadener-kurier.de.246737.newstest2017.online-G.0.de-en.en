For all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
In the small HR-V Honda wants to grab everything: a little SUV, a little bit of a Coup√© and the versatility of a minivan.
Sounds pretty cluttered, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new Jazz proves to be in everyday life, in fact, as extremely flexible.
Although the only 1,60 m high HR-V appears to be rather small, the passengers in the first row as well as in the rear lot of space, it acts at any point closely.
The materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant, only the Cockpit, the upper side of the falls.
More versatile than comparable vehicles the HR-V at the storage space.
It's just a trunk of 453 l in Superscript and 1026 l when folded backrest is not available, but there is the "Magic Seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: The seat surfaces of the rear Bank as cinema seats fold up to provide storage space, from floor to Ceiling of 1.24 m high.
The trunk is well loaded, but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1.6-liter Diesel with 88 kW/120 HP accelerates the HR-V, thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in the wide engine speed ranges is very powerful.
He is expected to do his work, however, is a little quieter.
Encouraging the daily consumption of 4.7 l/100 km.
There is a further motorization: a 1.5-l gasoline engine with 96 kW/130 HP.
A four-wheel drive is not offered.
The driving is a good compromise between dynamics and comfort behavior is balanced.
The steering should be more direct.
The equipment leaves in the tested Top-of-the variant "Executive" nothing to be desired.
Among the security systems of the City-emergency brake assist (works up to a speed of 32), the collision warning system and lane keep assist.
The Collision warning system irritated sometimes because he has a rating in Maneuvering a lot of obstacles as "approaching objects".
Very reliable, light assistant works with the remote.
And the intelligent tempo controller reacts to the road-sign recognition, and throttles the speed.
The full connectivity is there but only for the Top-features: 7-inch touch screen, Navi, App Integration, and more.
Two USB and an HDMI Jack are located under the armrest, and are therefore somewhat cumbersome.
The around 29000 euros for well-equipped Top-of Diesel are in order.
Who does not want to invest so much, receives the gasoline from 20000 euros, the Diesel from 23000 euros.
The engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard.
