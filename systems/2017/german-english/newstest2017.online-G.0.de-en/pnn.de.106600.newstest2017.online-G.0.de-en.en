Grönlandhai: The oldest Vertebrate is almost 400 years old
Rare Sight.
Grönlandhaie come mostly in Winter to the surface.
This shark was allowed to return after an investigation aboard the research vessel Sanna into the sea.
He was born in 1624, and swim with a 1 km/h through the North Atlantic - until today.
Grönlandhaie get only 150 years young.
Leisurely the Grönlandhai floats at the bottom of the North Atlantic, along, in an hour, he comes in an average of 1,220 meters.
Only if it comes down to it, it accelerates the five-Meter-long animal to a whopping 2.6 km/h and this maximum speed is half as fast as a seal.
This slowness embossed living style seems to be a recipe for a ripe old age.
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" in any case, from a Grönlandhai that could be 392 years old.
"Madness," says Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max-Planck-Institute for demographic research in Rostock, this life-span, the means for Vertebrates a world record.
Although the evolution is suspected, a biologist for a long time that Grönlandhaie be as old as the hills.
Only the evidence was lacking.
Grönlandhaie are difficult to observe, finally, they live mainly in the Arctic ocean in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen.
Because water temperatures prefer to six degrees Celsius, at the surface usually only in the Winter.
About the life style of the Grönlandhaie researchers know correspondingly little.
Their slow pace, they measured, as they provided prior to Spitsbergen six animals with a transmitter equipment.
Prey of these sharks still In the stomach of an animal, researchers found the Remains of a seal, another had taken the jawbone of a young polar bear.
You may hunt sleeping animals or patrolling at the bottom of the Arctic ocean and search for carcasses, the stagger from the higher water layers to the bottom.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues studied 28 Grönlandhaie, the Fischer between 2010 and 2013, in front of Greenland, or Spitsbergen as a by-catch from the depths of the North Atlantic, it was picked up.
The smallest shark was just 81 inches long, while the largest 502 centimeters in dimension.
In order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the carbon-14 method the lens nucleus of the sharks.
This is the center of the lens of the eye develops before birth, the sharks, the proteins are not renewed.
The two smallest sharks were striking a lot of carbon-14 in the lens core.
Your birth should be, therefore, to the early 1960s, when nuclear tests threw large quantities of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere.
In the 220 centimetres, the length of the third smallest Tier of the lens nucleus contained a small Excess of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons tests, it is expected at the time of his examination in 2012, his 50. Celebrated the birthday.
All of the major Grönlandhaie had in your lens core, by contrast, the normal carbon-14-quantities produced by cosmic rays in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon-14 clock showed a 493 centimetre long Grönlandhai an age of 335 years, during the record-breaking shark is likely to be 502 centimeters even be 392 years old.
That Grönlandhai-females can have offspring, if they are longer than four metres, was known.
Now, researchers at the length were able to assign an age.
As one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably on the threshold of sexual maturity, and his age was determined to be 156 years, Grönlandhaie with the propagation seem to be at least one and a half centuries of time.
Also for vertebrates is currently the world record.
Such Methusaleme life, especially in icy waters, is no coincidence.
The previous record holder, a 211 year-old bowhead whale, in the Speck on the neck of a 120-year-old harpoon tip was in, was caught off the coast of Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there on the back burner to be running frequently.
They Mature later and age slower.
In order to keep in the cold water is warm, the animals are also often very large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, by which the animal heat is losing.
The heat loss from one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than a gram of elephant.
Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.
"A smaller animal is so hazardous, and should focus on, to have as early as possible as many as possible offspring," explains evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.
A very large animal should invest its resources more in a long life.
