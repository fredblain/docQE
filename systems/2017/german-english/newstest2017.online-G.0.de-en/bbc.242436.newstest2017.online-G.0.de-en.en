Russia's Putin fires chief of staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly fired its chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was for many years part of the closest circle of trust circle of Putin.
The 63-Year-old was as special representative for environment and transport matters is appointed.
In opinion of the Kremlin is that Putin had arranged, without giving reasons, "the dismissal of Ivanov of his duties as Chairman of the Russian presidential administration".
Anton Vaino, since 2012, Ivanov's Deputy, was appointed his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former Diplomat.
In 1972, in the Estonian capital, Tallinn, was born, he made his degree at the prestigious Moscow State Institute for International relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo.
On the Website of the Kremlin it says (in Russian) that he was later head of Protocol and chief of the government staff.
On his appointment he said to Putin:"Thank you for your trust."
I think that it is the most important task of the government is, your activity as the head of state concerning draft legislation and to support controls for the implementation of its instructions.
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his Post and Vaino as his successor I recommended.
The smile convincing faces?
This step has made Moscow shrouded in mystery.
Sergei Ivanov was for a long time one of the closest to Vladimir Putin's and working for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.
As chief of staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a Meeting with President Putin that was broadcast on television, claimed both men, that the chief of staff, at his own request.
But despite the smiles for the cameras, here are just a few convinced - especially now, shortly before the parliamentary elections.
The result is a kind of here is so the fight makes?
No one knows currently.
But the official statement - that a man who was once touted as a potential President, would like to redirect to once the Russian environmental policy - met with great skepticism.
In his remarks to Putin, cited on the Kremlin Website, said Ivanov, "it is true that I asked you at the beginning of 2012, in a conversation, to me this is very complicated Post - one might almost say arduous Post for four years.
As it turns out, I am for four years and eight months, Chairman of the Russian presidential administration.
Ivanov took up the Post in December 2011.
Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of defense.
He is a member of the Russian security Council, and like Putin a former member of the state security service KGB.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was Chairman of the Federal security service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov appointed his Deputy.
As Putin came to Power, was he named Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once believed that Ivanov could be Putin's second term in office, President of Russia, since a third term in office, Putin would violate the Constitution.
But this Post was taken from another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin, the Prime Minister was before he was three and a half years later, President.
