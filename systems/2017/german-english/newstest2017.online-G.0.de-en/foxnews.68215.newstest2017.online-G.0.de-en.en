Treats want a naked calendar for "women and men"
The Treats magazine works together with the photographer David bell-m√®re, a 1970s Pirelli-inspired Calendar for 2017.
But, instead of famous naked people you want to find for your NU Muses Calendar for 2017, the next Generation of supermodels.
The editor-in-chief of Treats Steve Shaw told us in the beginning of this year, be naked in a magazine of old-school Playboys vagina as "Playboy for men".
I'm doing this for women.
Apparently, he is of the view that it is not doing the Calendar.
"We need to return to the representation of timeless and classic of Consent, in the case of both women and men feel comfortable and from these images of the female body, to feel inspired," said Shaw in a press release on the publication of the Calendar.
Women will want to participate in this project, because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit your pictures online, or in person at open Casting call in Los Angeles and New York.
