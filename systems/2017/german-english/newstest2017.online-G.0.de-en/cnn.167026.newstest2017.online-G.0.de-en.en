Which is why we need Simone, Gabby, and Laurie
This is what I me women Olympic team in gymnastics to introduce, and for more than one reason.
First of all, I'm in it since 1984, each summer Olympics and the United States were never so dominant.
And secondly: This team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who worked for many young girls of color inspiring.
The structure of this team, Aly Raisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, rounding, makes everyone proud.
This team reflects, finally, the United States.
It is black and Hispanic has solidified ash female presence at the top of this sport.
In the last four years, the number one was under the female gymnasts an African-American.
Last year Simone and Gabby #1 and #2.
The shows strength.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was cheered a surprising Olympic medallist and America.
Now, the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three-time world champion, Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as you unexpected, however, masterful gymastik routines provided.
On Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American, who won an individual more fight event for women Gold.
Team member Aly Raisman won the silver.
We experience the top of these sports, but gymnastics does not see classes in the whole country.
Simone, Gabby, and Laurie were all in the same way as Aly and Madison, to make it to the Olympic Team.
They are the "Final Five", because the next Olympic team will only have four gymnasts in the team. In addition, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive Sport, and Turner, primarily in private gymnastics clubs that are obtained from parents for the training, equipment, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the Trainer and the gymnasts and families). The list can go on and on.
The majority of these gym clubs are located in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.
In these Clubs, the gymnasts received their entire Training, and this is for the families of an expensive and long-term commitment.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, both have trained their athletes since she started with gymnastics.
We need to allow the municipalities to do so on countless young girls, inspired by Simone, Gabby, and Laurie, a leistbareres and easier to understand turn training.
I founded my turn Foundation of 20 years.
At my events, we have trained free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youth (especially black and Hispanic) and national and international winners.
In September, we will be expanding to Detroit (my home town), to offer youth high-quality gymnastics, deserve the opportunity to learn from this great Olympic sports, and to benefit.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility, and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline, and determination for the spirit.
This combination offers life long health benefits, as well as for academic and professional success.
It is the Inspiration of this team, which will bring thousands of young girls are interested in gymnastics, and that's great.
It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby, and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by bringing the Olympic Mannschaftsgolds and thank you, barrel, you motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds, to start your path to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
