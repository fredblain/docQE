Pokémon Go, a hunting after health and happiness, is worth it
It is fascinating to watch how the world is changing.
That a Teenager and child to Play and not go outside, but rather, prefer to spend their free time on screens to stare at, it was complained in the last decade by many.
In Pokemon Go to get people off the Sofa and active.
The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then video games, and most recently on Smartphones.
Therefore, it is not great to see that technology and activities to exclude Outdoor each other.
I refer of course to the Pokémon Go-delusion, an App based on the characters that were initially created for the video games in the 1990s (and later a cartoon series, game cards, and other Spin-Offs).
How many phenomena of popular culture decreased, the interest prior to the release of the game in the United States, Australia and new Zealand at the beginning of July something.
The market introduction in other countries has been postponed due to the massive demand that overloaded the Server.
Within a few days pokemon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short the player is told to go with their Smartphones out and are looking for Pokémons that will be followed with a GPS tracked and, once they have been found, "photographed" (can be taken via a Screenshot on the phone) or "caught".
A Generation that played the game, when she was younger, joined the craze and jumped for the search of your Sofa.
In the USA the game has led to a considerable increase in steps the "average" Person puts in every day.
Cardiogram, an App for Apple Watch, which follows 35.000 users post, told the Washington Post recently that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of post people who train every day for 30 minutes, followed by 45 percent to 53 percent started.
The company does not know who plays of Pokémon Go - it only provides the raw data to increase performance.
Many public awareness campaigns for health, the people want to take "30 minutes," "come from the Sofa" and "to be active every day" fell on deaf ears, because many of the public messages on health are boring, and people come, the misery of appearance.
Nevertheless, the importance of sports cannot be overstated.
Those who exercised regularly, reduced their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, Diabetes and a long list of benefits is too long to cite here.
But the wonder is full to Pokémon Go, that it brings the people to do something Outdoors that is fun.
Thus, the three pillars of health are exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.
Some people close to hunting and even new friendships.
As always, there are also grumpy party-pooper, who must always complain about something.
And Yes, someone could run against a door.
What's the point?
It has been a breakthrough.
Even if Smartphone Apps such as Fitbit already track our activity, they gave us no reason to go in for sports, as it does in this game.
The New one will lose its appeal and the use will abate with time.
Because of Pokemons success, but there will be more games, Apps and virtual reality with the active associations in the real world, and many people on the hunt will help you to be more active, fitter and healthier.
