Helen Glover and Heather Stanning by the battle with the cancer of a Coach to the rowing victory inspired
There will be no emotinaleres Gold at these Games, and that's saying something.
From the first stroke to the last, 220 hard Hieve that go down in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning, an additional importance in your Golden Moment is found at the Estacio da Lagoa.
Even if it's just the Two of them were, the at the helm were sitting, there were three voices in the boat. The Echo of the Trainer, Robin Williams, was allanwesend as they rowed for the second Olympic gold in the Two without tax woman in a row, the first women in the history of British sport, which laid such a scale.
Their dominance was absolute, after all, your 39.ter undefeated use, which is also unprecedented.
What we have are two brilliant athletes, on the surface with the elegance of swans gliding, which does not reflect the kind of triumph to the full.see
Behind every Gold in rowing a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental progress that make the difference and there was no one assistant as the coach who didn't know 30 months ago, if he would survive this day at all, as in the case of cancer was diagnosed.
As he said, risky.
I had cancer of the bladder, which is easily operable, and they did.
If you don't do that, it spreads everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad Situation.
It changed a little bit the view.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The Trio was lucky that he had treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, was about to begin, what is the interruption kept to a Minimum, if at all, under such circumstances, even the right term.
I needed money, so it had to go me better soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and ran to the Station, around 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time, as you said that few steps are sufficient.
So it begins.
The rowing itself is a challenge, but that makes it even greater.
The immediacy of victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, the grueling a nervous Morning for something to spent more than to talk otherwise, and thus tried to handle his own Fears.
Stanning, who was a captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment on a mission in Afghanistan, said, "I was this week an emotional wreck. Perhaps that's a little extreme, but it means so much."
It's only repeating of how much this means to me, how much I and Helen and Robin have worked.
There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin we would be nobody, so a massive Thank you to him. He is the best coach in the world.
I couldn't imagine a better Person to Train or a better Trainer of your choice.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have lost in the last five years, not a race.
The Couple had a hard rhythm, with which their opponents could not keep up.
Even in the last 500 meters, as the Teams from new Zealand and Denmark started to catch up, had to Stanning and Glover too much in Reserve.
We were very caught up in the Moment.
Helen cried, "stay in the process, stay in the process".
It is really important not to get carried away.
We had a good Start, and at the same time, we were not there to make something Great.
We wanted to today, no fireworks, we just wanted to get a good result, to go out and win the race, which we did.
The Couple will take a one-year break, before it will make decisions about his future.
Glover needs to appear next week at a wedding of their own with the TV adventurer Steve back hall.
Now you want to just enjoy the Moment.
I didn't want to say that this was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London, it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion.
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed.
Here, it took about four minutes.
It feels so much better," she said.
