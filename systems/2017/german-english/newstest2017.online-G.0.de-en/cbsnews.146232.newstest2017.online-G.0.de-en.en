Simone Biles creates Gold in women's gymnastics
You forget the pressure.
You forget the Hype.
Simone Biles is on all the immune.
Dynamically on the go horse.
Effortlessly on the beam.
Stunning on the floor.
All along the line brilliant.
And now finally, an Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast climbed on Thursday to the more combat title, and enlarged the gap between itself and the Rest of the world before the eyes of all under the spotlight of the Olympic games.
Your overall result of 62,198 was clearly in front of silver medal winner and the "Final Five"-along with teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medallist Aliya all around title.
The Americans Simone Biles turns on the balance beam during the single multi-fight finals of the women's artistic gymnastics at the Olympic summer games in Rio de Janeiro in 2016, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American to win a multi-fight title and a total of the fifth, while consolidating its reputation, to the Best of their Generation, or even at all.
She burst into tears, as your end result, it was shown, and their long journey took place in this Moment.
This success puts them in the same League as unique athletes such as Michael Phelps, have brought their sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated the last three years of your sports, 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - amazing Exercises won, which include a mixture of ambition and precision, that the Olympic champion of 1984, Mary Lou Retton from her said that she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."
It was expected to be a final test in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and the Rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.
Not with a handful of Gold to return back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be viewed as a disappointment.

Biles is the first medal on Tuesday, while she served on the farewell party of retirement doers team coordinator Martha Karolyi as a exclamation mark.
Although Biles insisted to have during their long way to the top, never the future, this is not really true.
A part of your floor exercises - which contain the typical Tumbling Pass is aligned with Latin American music, the home would fit on the street outside of the Olympic arena in Rio.
This is not a coincidence.
This is a girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child, and coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip in the gymnasium was discovered in the Boorman trained, was to the force.
She has lost since the summer of 2013, no more fight, more competition, a winning streak that will continue as long as it wishes Biles.
Even if all around title, led by two spins easily, tr√ºgte the image.
Balance beam and Floor exercise - in which Biles holds the title of world champion - lurked.
She repeated with 15,433 on the balance beam again, and continued with a 15,933 on the floor.
Raisman hugged her gently as they awaited their end result - a pure formality - and tears streamed on Biles shiny red, white and blue Eyeliner, as the Vision that you once described in your collection, became reality.
The performance Raismans was a revenge for the last Time four years ago, as they fought for third place but the bronze medal went to a Tiebrake in all around title.
This Time the 22-year-old team captain, called by the Americans "grandma" had a head start.
After her floor exercise, she threw the audience a kiss, hands, overwhelmed by a Comeback that seemed sometimes doubtful.
What concerns Biles, the fast-spreading Tweet of the 19-Year-old from the beginning of this week has a whole new meaning:
