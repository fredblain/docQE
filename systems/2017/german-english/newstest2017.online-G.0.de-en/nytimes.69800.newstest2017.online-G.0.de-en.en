In the midst of the Rage of the Olympic games, the Zen of the trampoline
Wherever you are, how late it is, it is the Olympic games.
The events in Rio de Janeiro to feel resistant, and inevitably, a frantic relay race between competition and striving.
It is, as the Olympic torch itself would be a burning rod, which is passed from the archers to the float to Turner for triathletes.
You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper, or at the call of your neighbors in the queue in the coffee shop listening without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there are Logan Dooley.
Dooley, for the first Time at the Olympics and a heartthrob with the dimples, would definitely build among these well-known names to be sent to the Prime Time, through sponsors and feel-good TV ads, if he was a swimmer, gymnast or even fencers.
But Dooley, 28, of Lake Forest, California, is fighting in the Olympic trampoline gymnastics Gold.
The Olympic flame lights every event.
Further from the centre, partly in the shadow of the sports that are not generally recognised: air gun shooting, archery, Badminton, Taekwondo.
We will always have the Breaststroke, and may it reign be long.
But if I could humbly make arguments for my particular favorite, then let me attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline to steer.
Although the trampoline since 2000, an Olympic event, as it had in Sydney, made his debut, there has not been perceived in the past 16 years, so sparse, that a lot of the, I had interviewed knew that it is an Olympic sport.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the United States has sent athletes to the Competition, it has never won a medal in jump on the trampoline and up to 2012, athletes had made it to the finals.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to be the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians share the for the women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend this year, her gold medal from London.
The trampoline has jump a certain outsider charm, partly because it sounds for the uninformed ear, more suitable for a clown school than for the Olympic games.
At this point I should admit that I'm no expert, but just an earthbound Enthusiast.
It is humorist has potential - the cartoon-like Shaking of his never-ending thunderous impact, but also the grace of the gymnastics and diving, the two sports that unites it.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El Trampolin, which means "diving Board."
Emerging the winner, jump on a giant trampoline, shooting almost up to 30 feet in the air and a number of the movements (Turn, dive, and somersaults) must, before you land on your feet.
You will be assessed according to the official Olympic program after the execution, difficulty, and "flight time".
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio against each other.
The most common Olympic vector is a straight line.
Medal hopeful must go in their quest for Gold further, faster, up and over, sometimes up to the target, sometimes there and back, up and down on the Playground.
You are not just chasing the finish line or the starting wall, but in the TV broadcast also another scornful aim: to make the world or Olympic record.
The goal-oriented striving is noble, admirable, even fanatical, and it is enough to stir even an audience to tears.
But it is also what I feel when watching these games as a little tiring.
The trampoline offers a pause for breath.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is at the top.
A forward movement is not the goal.
He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless as an Astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back to the top.
Here, too, there is competition, of course, not without difficulty, but during the Exercise there is no frantic attack on the target, not a Dome in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.
It is so Zen like, the competition at the Olympic Games is only can be.
The qualification and finals of the women will be held on Friday afternoon, in the Streaming at 13: 00 Eastern Time and the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.
NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days, starting at 14.00.
In the midst of Olympic-mania, the promise of a quiet, nice Moment, one that is overlooked in the General hubbub probably.
If the Awareness-raising can only be through the Gapes and the object classification of male athletes - as it is the male American gymnasts, according to The Wall Street Journal recently suggested - then Mr Dooley expects his air ring to the end of that new fan base.
