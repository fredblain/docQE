The car maker is not the customers after the conversion, a "guarantee" certificate, but speaking of a "warranty" as it was called on Friday in business circles.
Basic legal intricacies.
The "Focus" had reported, Volkswagen will grant its German customers now, but a warranty for reconditioned diesel models.
This was confirmed last Monday, VW's representative in the Federal Ministry of transport.
From the Ministry of transport, it was confirmed that there was this Meeting.
"VW has to meet the requirements of my inquiry Commission of the KBA in full."
"The deviations are not acceptable," said German transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), according to the Ministry.
VW has taken the guarantee that in the case of fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance after the conversion, no deteriorations are taking place all type approval relevant vehicle values unchanged.
Volkswagen itself does not use the term "warranty" but, as it was called in business circles.
In the case of the broad term "warranty" looks to be a Volkswagen, the possibility that customers may come, for example, half a year after the conversion, for example, with a damage to the engine in a workshop - and this could lead back to the new Software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
Also in the customers interest, it is important to avoid that it comes in the case of any other damages that have nothing to do with the exhaust of the scandal, to uncertainty regarding the possible warranty provisions, as it was called.
That's why VW don't use the term "warranty".
