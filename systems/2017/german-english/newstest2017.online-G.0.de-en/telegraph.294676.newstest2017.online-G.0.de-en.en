England must draw the Olympic spirit and Heathrow expand
Heathrow is not only in our local communities and in the whole of London, but in the entire country, renewal and prosperity.
For me, that was the biggest attraction of Heathrow, just as they did in 2012 in London, when we operated a great deal of effort to ensure that all of our Nations and regions from the Games benefited.
The Olympics brought great benefits for Stratford and the East End.
And again, by creating for Locals and businesses in the vicinity of Heathrow to new possibilities.
For our local communities, we are alone, 10,000 new teachers, 40,000 new jobs and the youth prepare for unemployment in the airport environment.
As they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who think that the challenge of the expansion of Heathrow is too big.
I was told that England will never be the same for the games and that we will embarrass ourselves on the world stage.
The doubters had 2012 wrong, and you will also be at Heathrow is wrong.
There are always obstacles to Overcome, but Heathrow answered every question.
As the Olympic games, Heathrow is for many and not for a single infrastructure project.
Extension is a possibility to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion of economic growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment in both the airport as well as in the whole of GB.
We have a great Team at Heathrow has implemented a £11 billion in expensive infrastructure investment program in time and Budget, the T5 - five years in a row for the world's best airport terminal has been selected, up to the T2, which was built in the middle of the two busiest runways in the world.
Now you are ready to deliver a third runway, which is supported by £16 billion of private investment.
The London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be a.
It is time that we steer this Olympic spirit and Heathrow to expand, as well as our future trade secure and a legacy of skills and employment created on the England can be proud of.
