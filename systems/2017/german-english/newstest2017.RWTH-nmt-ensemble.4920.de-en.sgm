<seg id="1">28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco mall</seg>
<seg id="2">A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local shopping centre.</seg>
<seg id="3">The victim's brother said he can't imagine anyone who would want to hurt him, "at last, he went uphill again."</seg>
<seg id="4">The lightsaber found on Wednesday morning in the Westfield Mall was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, the court medical department in San Francisco said.</seg>
<seg id="5">The San Francisco Police Department said the death was classified as murder and the investigation is in the running.</seg>
<seg id="6">The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABS broadcaster KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who used to work as a chef in Boston, had taken his dream job six months ago as a chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="7">A spokesman for the Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and destroyed at the ground" over his death.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss him painfully," the spokesman continued.</seg>
<seg id="9">Our thoughts and condolences are at this difficult time at Frank's family and friends.</seg>
<seg id="10">Louis Galicia admitted that Frank first lived in hostels, but that "things went uphill for him at last."</seg>
<seg id="11">"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend," said Louis Garcia KGO.</seg>
<seg id="12">Louis Galicia said that he could not imagine anyone wanting to harm his younger brother.</seg>
<seg id="13">He was a friendly person with a big heart.</seg>
<seg id="14">His way of connecting with his family was to always cook us to prepare dinner, "said Louis Galicia.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never wanted to take part in any kind of confrontation.</seg>
<seg id="16">He was the brother who swam with the electricity.</seg>
<seg id="17">"In everything that is going wrong in the world, he was this unsliced diamond that lit brightly every day," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone who has information on the case is asked to call the SFPD's hint phone at number 415 - 575 - 4444.</seg>

<seg id="2">Jennifer Aniston doesn't always have to be perfect or successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">That's what the Hollywood star has now made unequivocally clear in an interview.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I always get stuck in drawers or get glued from the outside label, which has little to do with me and the reality."</seg>
<seg id="5">"I myself do not want to be perfect and successful."</seg>
<seg id="6">"Frankly, these things are more snug to me."</seg>
<seg id="7">Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh at the fact that she is considered a "Miss Perfect" as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan."</seg>
<seg id="8">After all, the actress spends her time at home, premiering TV with loose Dutt and Mexican food, the magazine says.</seg>
<seg id="9">To the white glut, they raise the question of children's desire: "we women do not have to be married or have children to be perfect," according to the Hollywood Star.</seg>
<seg id="10">In her new movie "Mother's Day - Love is not a Children's Game" Aniston is seen as a single mother of two sons.</seg>

<seg id="1">Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid</seg>
<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer, with some colleagues, sought a bit of change with an exit on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58 -year-old, it was a premiership.</seg>
<seg id="5">Chio: "golden sports pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">After a few minutes, the horses remembered their holidays, they jailed in the fast gallop home to the feedingstuffs.</seg>
<seg id="7">One kilometre at that pace, I've been scared.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It was not a good experience," says Langer.</seg>
<seg id="9">And then the riding career ended again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament wins - was back near horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He left with his family over the plant of the ALRV, on a horse he didn't even swap for photo purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and therefore also at the CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports aid handed over the Golden Sports pyramid to the man from Anhausen as part of a small gala.</seg>
<seg id="15">At awards, the sympathetic athlete is not lacking.</seg>
<seg id="16">Federal Cross of Merit, Silver's Lorbeerblatt, Champions Tour Player of the year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen has already adored him.</seg>
<seg id="18">Long is the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Aachen, he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="20">"This award means a great deal to me," says Langer, "because it will be awarded not only for sporting success, but also for social engagement."</seg>
<seg id="21">For decades, Langer has been promoting the offspring.</seg>
<seg id="22">And so he also gave the prize money of €25,000 straight away.</seg>
<seg id="23">With 15 other outstanding athletes, the dual U.S. Masters winner was admitted to the "hall of Fame of German Sports" on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="24">The exhibits include the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the Father Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob-driver Meinhard Ner, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumping rider Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumously the handballer Erhard Wunderlich.</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sports legends had come to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="26">After the official part, the illustrious society migrated to the Springstadion, where the Lavazza prize ran.</seg>
<seg id="27">Bernhard Langer kept distance to the big animals.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton's and Trump's economic policies in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade deal - that's what both Clinton and Trump want.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two U.S. presidential candidates are divided on fiscal and energy policy, as well as on a fundamental issue.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical, difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">The, about the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small, and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate to death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself, on the other hand, would be very different, Trump claims.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will cut back on regulations massively, and he is strongly committed to wide-ranging tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for businesses.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton, on the other hand, says that the state has certain tasks to perform, it has disadvantaged opportunities to open up and needs money for it.</seg>
<seg id="11">That's why taxes would be increased for the rich, she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the need to be invested, Trump and Clinton say almost worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate is even announcing the biggest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">Government investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic politics, and are, for example, strictly rejected by the Republican state's state-run Teaparty wing.</seg>
<seg id="16">So, on Trump, bipartisan discussions could still be held.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are clearer.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and drive up coal production in the U.S. again.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil extraction should also be possible in previously protected areas, and the Paris climate change agreement is intended to terminate it.</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton, on the other hand, explicitly wants to expand renewable energies with her investment program, calling for "a country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"It will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the Trans-Pacific Trade Agreement, both do not want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, however, both do not want to isolate the U.S. from international trade - but simply to better protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should then be paid better, for example, for Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to raise it to $15 a hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do on this issue is not entirely clear: once he says: the minimum wage has to go up, then he says he should not be altered.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more about the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On one side is Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics believe that this would only increase the budget deficit.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who, at least, wants to ask the rich to pay more taxes, and whose critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.</seg>

<seg id="1">Escape: "every whipped woman has experience of sexual violence"</seg>
<seg id="2">Sexual violence is part of everyday life for women who are fleeing alone.</seg>
<seg id="3">When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatised.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen, four women sit.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each has a baby that is at most a year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son in the arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He guys with great eyes curious into the room.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother stares at the table plate.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until she notices she is being watched.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles short and kisses the little one.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene works normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">She is the managing director of Condrobs, a carrier for social assistance in Bavaria, and deals with, among other things, the issue of women on the run.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are poultry.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the Munich north in one of the few decentralised shelters for all-embracing women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January, Condrobs made up the establishment along with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid.</seg>
<seg id="18">It has recently been officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">Men don't exist - even as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard in front of the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"It is not exaggerated to say: every woman arriving here has had experience of sexual violence on her flight," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Men are fleeing for wars because they are being pursued politically because they are threatening torture or death or because their families are sending them to Europe as a hopper," she says.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the case of women, there are other reasons for the escape: "many are stealing secretly because they do not see any other way out."</seg>
<seg id="25">In their homeland, they have made experience of sexual violence, forced marriages, honour killings, slavery or forced prostitution.</seg>
<seg id="26">That is what is driving them.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run, that goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"For example, that smugglers are demanding a sexual activity for a bottle of water is not a rare occurrence," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="29">And women are alone, they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">Anyone who thinks that the end, as soon as they arrive in Germany, is mistaken, tells Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here, too, single women in refugee shelters would often be regarded as inferior and at worst abused.</seg>
<seg id="32">That leads to about 90 percent of women living in the shelter in Munich's north, she estimates.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Some of the children have certainly not been voluntarily created."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so accustomed to saying nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Or they don't trust to speak openly about the experience, because the shame is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">As they often don't know to help, it needs more shelter only for them, calling for Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bavaria, the seven county governments are responsible for accommodating refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the question of whether they knew of a similar project as in Munich in their area of competence, some responded with no.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the Oberpfalz and Oberfranken, for example, there is no such thing in government shelters.</seg>
<seg id="40">Even in swabs, only fled women are not submerged separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, the government's press secretary.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Oberbayern, Unter- und Mittelfranken, there are floors or own houses in some Community accommodation only for single women and their children.</seg>
<seg id="42">The exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central shelters exclusively for women.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommodated separately from men.</seg>
<seg id="44">In a study published for the committee, it says: "it is very important for men and women to be accommodated separately."</seg>
<seg id="45">"Lack of privacy, or men and women are housed together, can come to - perpetual - violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">In particular, the washrooms should be separated and easily accessible to women, is in the study.</seg>
<seg id="47">How much the women feel this need for protection can be seen at the Andrank, which there is on the house in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Since it has been around, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="49">You could easily make up a second house.</seg>

<seg id="1">Assistant doctors strike: calls for new workplace action</seg>
<seg id="2">Deputies of the assistant doctors have called on their union to approve new workplace measures in their disputes regarding a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called for its entire council to approve more work measures from the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC said that ministers had failed to respond to the concerns about the Treaty.</seg>
<seg id="5">Assistant doctors and medical students voted on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA in July.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a letter to members released on Twitter on Thursday evening, the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said the government had remained "persistently quiet" to problems, resulting in the contract being rejected.</seg>
<seg id="8">She said: "in view of this, the JDC Board of Directors has voted to reject the proposed new treaty completely and to call for official renegotiations on all of them."</seg>
<seg id="9">In response to the government's silence, the JDC Board today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing program of escalating workplace measures that begins at the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="10">The disputes led to assistant doctors striking six times this year, the first overall outages in the history of the NHS.</seg>
<seg id="11">The head of BMA assistant doctors Dr Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed terms of the contract, which had been recommended by the BMA.</seg>
<seg id="12">He informed BMA members during the meetings, which took place before the vote by 54,000 assistant doctors and medical students, that the contract was beneficial and should be adopted.</seg>
<seg id="13">After the vote, the Health Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said the contract would be forcibly introduced for doctors in England.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: a "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gold-plated hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile worked narrowly and he barely radiated warmth, even for his restrained conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke repeatedly of his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report whole five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old pre-crisis level, but will even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have behaved as if there had never been anything bad.</seg>
<seg id="11">It seemed to me that his enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But a Sustainable Killed, sparked by Putin, showed that Russia's head of state had forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory remarks: the shutdown of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border by Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's response at the time was wrapped up.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara of falling into the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offence was even greater as it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Rebuilding the vetting will be difficult, if not impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the government-controlled media carried out a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At once, it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">The most serious were the accusations by senior officials that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has vehemently denied this.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan, who he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia was able to make a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are clear.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan needs in the first place all the friends he can get after he was unveiled last month at a failed coup d "état almost his office.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - particularly the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be facilitated when flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, state television predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">A report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows: "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an added political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry at the West as it considers its response to the attempted seizure of power as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">On top of that, the persistent resentment is about the snail's pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is keen to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey's relationship with the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian head of state certainly won a bonus in Ankara for calling for support for the elected state bodies after the attempted coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glorious palace at the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portray one, as one analyst once described to me, "alliance of outsiders": two countries that feel the West and feel badly treated and now allied.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still major differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave itself the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be telling that after nearly three hours of initial talks both presidents said at the press conference that they wouldn't even have stripped the issue.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize it.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator on Syria can be found.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey shot down the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state at least talk to each other again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland no longer available</seg>
<seg id="2">The RBS brand is expected to be reduced to a back-office role, according to the bank's chief executive.</seg>
<seg id="3">Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bank has since distanced itself when it had to be almost collapsed and rescued eight years ago.</seg>
<seg id="6">During this time, brand strategists have used "RBS" to protect other end consumer finance brands.</seg>
<seg id="7">She supported international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship, from Six Nations rugby to the Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.</seg>
<seg id="8">But now it has decided to put more national brands in focus.</seg>
<seg id="9">Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.</seg>
<seg id="10">In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralised headquarters and the stock market listing will switch to NatWest.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are other smaller brands for retail banking, which will be more important - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.</seg>
<seg id="13">McEwan was interviewed during a sighting tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire.</seg>
<seg id="14">He told BBC Scotland: "the RSB brand will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed, as we now become more of a bank of brands."</seg>
<seg id="15">When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.</seg>
<seg id="16">I say now that we are not pursuing global goals, but local goals.</seg>
<seg id="17">Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers under these brands.</seg>
<seg id="18">RBS has already said it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the perceptibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship.</seg>
<seg id="19">"It's time for us to develop to the bank of brands, because how do we focus inside (we asked) to make this a better bank for customers?" Said the CEO.</seg>
<seg id="20">It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands.</seg>
<seg id="21">But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think you will see a lot of changes.</seg>
<seg id="22">We can launch these brands again, so I think the time has come.</seg>

<seg id="2">Dettori sprays champagne after a Double at Newmarket that brings him 3,000th win</seg>
<seg id="3">The jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th UK win at Newmarket on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="4">He put on Predilection, which is trained by John Gosden, on his local racetrack with his second win of the night a milestone.</seg>
<seg id="5">The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in the flat race.</seg>
<seg id="6">He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.</seg>
<seg id="7">The three -time winner Dettori, who won on Ghayyar before that, said: "it's something special."</seg>
<seg id="8">I'm very emotional because my family is here as well</seg>
<seg id="9">I'm very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday evening with 20,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I am relieved and very modest.</seg>
<seg id="12">Dettori takes the cheer as he picks up victory on Predilection</seg>
<seg id="13">Two jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20 -time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who reached more than 4,300 wins in a record-breaking career.</seg>
<seg id="14">Lester Piggott, the nine -time Derby winner had 4,493 career wins</seg>
<seg id="15">Frankie is one of the best jockey of modernity and it's no surprise that he has reached that milestone, which few have reached in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="16">He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.</seg>
<seg id="17">He is a fantastic ambassador for race, his enthusiasm and charisma enthusiasts fans for years for this sport.</seg>
<seg id="18">I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he would have already picked up 6,000 profits if he wasn't just a weekend and major tournament jockey!</seg>
<seg id="19">Frankie has already had nearly 30 years of winners in GB, which is great.</seg>
<seg id="20">He has a living personality, which is good for a British race, but beyond that, he's an incredible jockey.</seg>
<seg id="21">Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount</seg>
<seg id="22">From Flying Finals to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the flagship of British flat racing for two decades.</seg>
<seg id="23">It was nerve-wracking.</seg>
<seg id="24">A whole series of major tournament wins, including his famous "glorious Sieben" 1996 in Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban.</seg>
<seg id="25">Three years ago, he initially had difficulties when he returned from his six-month lock, but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to defy his doubters and return to his best form.</seg>
<seg id="26">And he is far from at the end - Dettori once said that he wants to continue in competitions until his at least 50th year of life.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia's Putin fired chief of staff Sergei Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly sacked his chief of staff, Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ivanov was part of Putin's closest confidence circle for many years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old has been appointed a special envoy for environmental and transport matters.</seg>
<seg id="5">In an opinion from the Kremlin, it is that, without giving reasons, Putin "ordered the dismissal of Ivanov from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration."</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who has been Ivanov's deputy since 2012, has been appointed to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the embassy in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin's website, it says (in Russian) that he was later protocol chief and chief executive of the government staff.</seg>
<seg id="10">On his appointment, he said to Putin: "thank you for your confidence."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think that it is the government's most important task to support your work as head of state on draft legislation and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV broadcaster on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This move has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidants and works like he did for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As a chief of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, broadcast on television, both men claimed that the chief of staff resigned at his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, here are few convinced - especially now, just before the general election.</seg>
<seg id="19">So, is this the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows that at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official claim - that a man who was once praised as a potential president at once would want to guide Russian environmental policy - came to great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said "it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 to give me this very complicated post - one could almost say - to entrust burdensome posts for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was deputy prime minister and defence minister.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, former member of the state security service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990 s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov one of five people he trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was once believed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term, as Putin's third term would have violated the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, nearby ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became prime minister before becoming president again three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">Gibson was involved in a physical confrontation at the set of the series in Los Angeles last month.</seg>
<seg id="3">ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced in a joint opinion his termination.</seg>
<seg id="4">Gibson, who played the Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, publicly apologized on Thursday before announcing his termination.</seg>
<seg id="5">On the set, there were artistic differences and a difference of opinion.</seg>
<seg id="6">I regret the incident, "he said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="7">Details of how the character Gibsons is written out of the series, which follows a team of FBI agents, are expected to be published at a later date, according to the opinion of ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.</seg>
<seg id="8">The 54 -year-old, who previously played in the sitcom Dharma & Greg, had been with it since the first season of the series in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I love Criminal Minds and have put my whole heartbreak down the last twelve years," Gibson said in a statement released on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="10">I had hoped to be there until the end, but that will no longer be possible now.</seg>
<seg id="11">I would just like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you can only wish for a series.</seg>
<seg id="12">The planned broadcasting of the twelfth season is scheduled for 28 September.</seg>

<seg id="1">Queensferry Crossing: bridge now linked to Fife</seg>
<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have linked the North deck of the Queensferry crossings with the viaduct - meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is the first of four closures of the "cover blowers" that are approaching the completion around each of the bridge's three towers.</seg>
<seg id="5">Fife's bridge section is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 swirling ropes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Business Minister Keith Brown visited the building site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said: "this is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry crossings.</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses to an engineering art of a truly epic extent in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the bridge between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for the pitch.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total, nearly 79% of the total bridge decks are in their place and the last section of the deck is getting a bedtime for the deck in Rosyth today, meaning the entire deck is ready to be raised on the bridge to its place.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">In this fantastic project, the closure represents forward-looking high and low construction.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the northern tower deck in the expansion, we then had to close the remaining gap on the north or land side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by dragging the northern train bridge 700 millimetres south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and, at the same time, very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive, as the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighed about 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled up at an increase of about 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Delicate, as the tolerances the team is working towards were tiny - on each side they were just a few millimetres.</seg>
<seg id="20">Thankfully, everything went very well.</seg>

<seg id="2">Three men have "luck still to be alive" after being thrown from their fishing boat before Anglesey.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Moelfre RNLI rescue station struck at 13:20 BST alarm on Friday after a crew watched the event in Moelfre Bay.</seg>
<seg id="4">The three men had difficulty swimming in safety while their boat was moving on their own.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We saw how the boat turned around and presented us with the worst," said the head of the rescue station of Moelfre Vince Jones.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Thankfully, the strong winds have already won the boat apart from their reach until we left to water," he added.</seg>
<seg id="7">Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man at the age of 60 was exhausted and hanged on a boje hanging without a lifeguard.</seg>
<seg id="8">They all arrived aboard the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Jones said: "the three men thrown into the water are lucky and still alive.</seg>
<seg id="10">Although the bootengine had an emergency stopplein, it loosened the boat from the person who steered the boat.</seg>
<seg id="11">Someone has woken up about these men today.</seg>

<seg id="2">A man has attacked and seriously injured his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife.</seg>
<seg id="3">As police said yesterday, the 50-year-old had got the key to the apartment to pick up his personal things.</seg>
<seg id="4">Instead, the alcoholic offender cut the clothing of his ex-girlfriend.</seg>
<seg id="5">When this one came into the apartment, he stole on her twice.</seg>
<seg id="6">The 44-year-old was injured at hand and on the body.</seg>
<seg id="7">Police were able to arrest the offender.</seg>
<seg id="8">While the 50-year-old destroyed his ex-girlfriend's clothing, he called his mother.</seg>
<seg id="9">This then alerted his sister.</seg>
<seg id="10">Together with her life companion, the 45-year-old wanted to reassure her brother.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, she could not persuade him to leave the apartment.</seg>
<seg id="12">That's why she walked out of the house with her life companion.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the road, they met the man's ex-life companion.</seg>
<seg id="14">When the two women re-entered the apartment, the 50-year-old shuffled his sister to the side and attacked his ex-girlfriend.</seg>

<seg id="1">Who is building Braunschweig's cheap homes?</seg>
<seg id="2">The SPD and the Greens mean that investors should be given much more responsibility in the future.</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you respond to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap homes in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">The SPD proposes a "concept of action" for the next Council meeting.</seg>
<seg id="5">But contention is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First of all, the question is: who is supposed to build the cheap homes?</seg>
<seg id="7">There is no provision so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">SPD group chairman Christoph Bratmann says: "we are in agreement with the Greens: those who want to build on urban areas will have to expel 20% of all homes as social housing in the future."</seg>
<seg id="9">However, the cheap apartments can also be found in the stock.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, the big point of contention at the town hall is, according to Bratmann: "how do you deal with investors who want to build on private land?"</seg>
<seg id="11">"We want investors to build at least 10 percent on such land, but as much as 20 percent of homes as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">A new urban housing support programme, which will cost millions and still needs to be funded, is intended to provide incentives.</seg>
<seg id="13">The problem, Mr Bratmann said, is "there is no agreement at the moment between the political groups."</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make as few rules as possible to investors.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even tougher conditions for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Notwithstanding this, Mr Bratmann said, the situation in the housing market is tightening.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the concept of action is implemented, this will provide additional tasks in the building administration.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff are needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the programme is not yet complete: the roughly 1260 new homes, which should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">How, though, is the loss of more than 1300 cheap homes, whose support will be phased out over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2020 alone, it will be 500 homes.</seg>
<seg id="23">To prevent that, according to Planning Policy spokeswoman Nicole Palm, expiring ties should now be purchased from the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, consideration should be given to getting homes back into price fixing.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">In one blow, the problem could be solved.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in the western city, deadlines run out at the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">About 1800 homes could be retrieved there into price fixing for cheap homes.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: that is what the owners, the housing companies, do not want.</seg>
<seg id="30">If the number of social housing in the western city is dramatically increased, it will be removed from the objective of so-called meddling.</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no more concentration of social weaknesses in just a few parts of the city.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">Group chairman Holger Herlitschke says: "for a broad majority, the CDU must be on board."</seg>
<seg id="34">This has focused on more building sites for single-family homes.</seg>
<seg id="35">What does not mean, however, is that a compromise cannot be found.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that's worth it</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenagers and child no longer go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time staring at screens, has been lamented by many in the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and making it more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially on the TV, then limited to video games and most recently on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">So it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">I am referring, of course, to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters first created for the video games in the 1990 s (later created a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many phenomena of pop culture, the interest sank ahead of the release of the game in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that the servers overloaded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, the players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokémons, which are traced with a GPS and, once they have been found, can be "photographed" (via a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was even younger, joined the whip and jumped for the search from the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US, the game led to a significant increase in steps that the "average" person puts back every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, told the Washington Post recently that within two days of the game's launch, the number of tracked people who train 30 minutes each day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public health campaigns to get people to "take themselves 30 minutes" to "come from the sofa" and "be active every day" encountered deaf ears because many public messages to health are boring and come from people who look elusive.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overvalued.</seg>
<seg id="19">Anyone who regularly drives sports reduces his chances of suffering from cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the miraculous thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close new friendships on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there are also mysterious gamblers who always have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What is to be done?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier in the day, they gave us no reason to drive sport as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its charm and the use will decrease over time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to Pokemon's success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="1">Simone Biles creates gold in the doorway</seg>
<seg id="2">Forget the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="3">Forget the hype.</seg>
<seg id="4">Simone Biles is immune to all this.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dynamic on the jump horse.</seg>
<seg id="6">Effortlessly on the bar.</seg>
<seg id="7">Breathtaking on the floor.</seg>
<seg id="8">On whole line brilliant.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now, finally, Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American Turnerin erupted to the multi-campaign title on Thursday, widening the gap between himself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the headlight of the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="11">Their overall result of 62.198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and "final Five" team cameradin Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American Simone Biles is touring on the weaving beam during the women's single multicampaign in the art turf at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American to win a multi-campaign title and overall the fifth, while solidifying her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has dominated her sport the last three years, winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the 1984 Mary Lou's Olympic champion said of her that she is "the best turner I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">It was expecting a last test in Brazil, a contest that did not go so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between it and a load of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas would be seen as a disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The American Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace themselves after they each won gold and silver in the women's singles multi-campaign inch in the art turf at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles picked up the first medal on Tuesday while she served as an exclamation mark on the farewell celebration of team coordinator Martha Karolyi.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although Biles insisted that during her long journey to the top, never planned the future, that's not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of their ground exercises - which contain their typical tumbling passport - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the gym where Boorman trained, became a force.</seg>
<seg id="25">She hasn't lost a multi-campaign contest since the summer of 2013, a victory series that will last for as long as it wants Biles.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even though Mustafina led easily by two rotations, the image declined.</seg>
<seg id="27">Weaving beams and ground turkeys - in which Biles holds the world championship title - lurked.</seg>
<seg id="28">She picked up again with 15.433 on the wearing beam - and set one on it with a 15.933 on the floor.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman gently embraced her as they were expecting her final glue - a pure formality - and tears streamed on Biles gleefully red, white and blue Eyeliner when the vision she once described in her collection book became a reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">Raismans "performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she struggled around third place, but the bronze medal in a tiebrake went to Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="31">This time, the 22-year-old team captain, called "grandma" by the Americans, had a lead.</seg>
<seg id="32">After her ground exercise, she accused the audience of cushions, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes appeared doubtful.</seg>
<seg id="33">As for Biles, the 19 -year-old's rapidly spreading tweet has a whole new meaning from earlier this week:</seg>

<seg id="2">According to police reports released Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot dead in one of the deadliest attacks for a decade in Phoenix's first serial murder case while they were entertaining in the car and listening to music.</seg>
<seg id="3">Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot dead on June 12 while the car was parked in an entry, authorities said.</seg>
<seg id="4">The offender fired eight shots from a handgun while he was on the car's front-passenger side and then fled with another vehicle, is read in the report.</seg>
<seg id="5">Police announced that the triple murder did not appear to have been the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 that were owned by one of the adult victims.</seg>
<seg id="6">Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard's police spokesman said the shooting was giving investigators a closer look at whether it is linked to four previous attacks.</seg>
<seg id="7">In total, seven people were killed and two others wounded in Hispanic residential areas within four months in nine attacks.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It happens in a residential area in front of a house," Howard told KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, earlier this month.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is believed the suspect used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990 s, a black BMW from the late 1990 s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.</seg>
<seg id="10">Investigators refused to disclose the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same murderer.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to her injuries and later died.</seg>
<seg id="12">Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah still died on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="13">A witness told police that it was not unusual for her to sit in a parked car and listen to music.</seg>
<seg id="14">Authorities also released a police report on the shooting, aimed at an empty pickup truck half a hour before the triple murder and is believed to have been the work of the serial murderer.</seg>
<seg id="15">Investigators found patron hulls and secured a bullet from the seat as well as bullet fragments from the engine room.</seg>

<seg id="1">Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It's getting better '</seg>
<seg id="2">Like most 6 -year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.</seg>
<seg id="3">But like the least of his contemporaries, Edmund has microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder about which his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing during her pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="4">When he came home for the first time, my first thought was, I'm not creating that.</seg>
<seg id="5">I'm not creating that.</seg>
<seg id="6">I did not admit that.</seg>
<seg id="7">What is not true at all -- of course, it has been adhered to, "she said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Her husband Vincent and her has been told that Edmund may never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some doctors even went so far as to suggest that they institutionalize it.</seg>
<seg id="10">"My first answer to that was" I didn't know that people still do, "" explained Picciuto.</seg>
<seg id="11">Edmund can run with the help of a remedy.</seg>
<seg id="12">Edmund could not sit or crash until his third year of life and he still can't speak.</seg>
<seg id="13">But he is making slow progress.</seg>
<seg id="14">He can run with support and bike ride.</seg>
<seg id="15">He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.</seg>
<seg id="16">Elizabeth shows the character language that Edmund thought for "please sing me something before."</seg>
<seg id="17">"We bring it to him," Picciuto told CBS News.</seg>
<seg id="18">But it's not a typical character language -- she says, Edmund has invented some characters alone.</seg>
<seg id="19">Microcephaly has a variety of causes: genetic as well as Edmund, as well as infections with viruses such as measles or the Zikavirus during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="20">The symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is too early to say how it will affect the lives of those infected with the Zikavirus.</seg>
<seg id="22">Picciuto remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future.</seg>
<seg id="23">I constantly asked what will happen?</seg>
<seg id="24">What will happen?</seg>
<seg id="25">And she still doesn't really know.</seg>
<seg id="26">I haven't asked for the prediction for a long time, because I don't expect them to be able to tell me anybody really.</seg>
<seg id="27">But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth damage caused by the Zikavirus.</seg>

<seg id="1">Fierce rains, flooding gives cause for rescue in Louisiana, Mississippi</seg>
<seg id="2">Heavy rainfall and large-scale flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to call out the state of emergency on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Numerous rivers in south-east Louisiana and the south of the Mississippi flooded their shores and threatened with large-scale flooding after extreme rainfall, the National Weather Service reported.</seg>
<seg id="4">The governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards announced that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and that assistance to the affected communities is already on the way.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mike Steele, a spokesman for the governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, announced that requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags were increasing.</seg>
<seg id="6">Steele said that the municipality of Tangipahoa alone would have requested ten thousand sandbags.</seg>
<seg id="7">A flood warning system is being deployed across much of the south of Louisiana until Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="8">The weather service indicated that an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area.</seg>
<seg id="9">In southern Alabama, a flood-early warning system was deployed on Friday, while it continued to rain in the Mobile area.</seg>
<seg id="10">The River Comite near Baton Rouges and the River Amite near Denham Springs, both of which are located in Louisiana, are likely to reach record levels over the weekend.</seg>
<seg id="11">The metereologist Alek Krautmann says both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.</seg>
<seg id="12">He also said that a strom-downward flood in Ascension Parish poses a danger, as these will only flow slowly in the Lake Maurepas across the rivers.</seg>
<seg id="13">The River Tickfaw, south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, already reached 09,00 the highest level ever recorded on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rescue teams still poured people out of the floodwater in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="15">Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued near Gloster on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house, rose sharply overnight.</seg>
<seg id="17">He said that another stepson who lives nearby would have warned him.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We woke up and the water flowed and flowed," Hansford said.</seg>
<seg id="19">It reached my waist.</seg>
<seg id="20">His wife told Hansford that in the 48 years she lived there, she would never have seen such a high of the river.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hansford said that he and his family members had all the disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim.</seg>
<seg id="22">Hansford said that Nothelfer had saved all three in a major military truck and had brought them to the next fire guard in Gloster, where they were housed until Friday.</seg>
<seg id="23">Krautmann said the flood had "spread rapidly" as there continued to be heavy rainfall and that authorities were considering evacuation instructions.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Krautmann, an observer near Livingstone reported from midnight to Friday morning of 13.75 inches of rain.</seg>
<seg id="25">Krautmann said the ground had been significantly softened by the rains since Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="26">Authorities said heavy rainfall and road flooding caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and teaching failure in five school districts.</seg>
<seg id="27">The CBS subsidiary, WWL, reported that an associate in Tangipahoa gave 200 flooded houses.</seg>
<seg id="28">Residents were evacuated in two churches, which have now both been flooded.</seg>
<seg id="29">The premiere of the community of Robby Miller said authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets, which were battered by the flooding.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the cities of Amite and Hammond, temporary shelters were set up to house the evacuees.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Once the water begins to go back, they will be able to go back to their homes," he said.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the town of Hammond of the municipality of Tangipahoa, nearly two dozen roads were closed due to flooding and sandbags provided for residents to take part, hoping to keep the water from their homes and shops.</seg>
<seg id="33">"The last major flood we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum of the city administration.</seg>
<seg id="34">This seems to be a similar incident.</seg>
<seg id="35">In Mississipp, the emergency manager Rupert Lacy of the Harrison County said it continued to rage on the Gulf Coast.</seg>
<seg id="36">According to his data, a handful of houses were reported to have been reported as flooding on Thursday, but none were reported on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="37">Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.</seg>
<seg id="38">"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," said Townson, "and it's still coming."</seg>

<seg id="1">Mahaj Brown, 6, "extinguished by bullets," survives shooting in Philadelphia</seg>
<seg id="2">Police agree that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, this week already the second time a 6-year-old child is shot.</seg>
<seg id="3">The boy's grandparents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.</seg>
<seg id="4">The grandparents indicated that Brown suffered multiple shot injuries, including in the Lend, leg, arm and belly, but that he was at the hospital when he was transported to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="5">"He went through a lot, his little body was sparked by bullets," his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the broadcaster.</seg>
<seg id="6">I just can't believe that.</seg>
<seg id="7">The boy's condition was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations.</seg>
<seg id="8">The boy's family informed the broadcaster that he is expected to recover.</seg>
<seg id="9">He should have started the first class in a local primary school.</seg>
<seg id="10">Brown was one of four people who were shot in Germantown.</seg>
<seg id="11">Three men were also shot: two at the age of 29 and a 32 -year-old.</seg>
<seg id="12">One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.</seg>
<seg id="13">The boy was found hooked up on the front seat of a car along with the 29 -year-old, who is in a critical condition, reports the broadcaster.</seg>
<seg id="14">The other two victims were not in the car and police are just investigating whether or not to be among one of the injured men of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="15">Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it appeared to have come to a crossfire between several shooters.</seg>
<seg id="16">Patron hulls for storm rifles traced to various storm guns overturned the scene.</seg>
<seg id="17">It seems that this was clearly an ongoing fight.</seg>
<seg id="18">On the road, on both sides of the road, there were sleeves.</seg>
<seg id="19">There seem to have been several armed fighters involved here, who were very actively involved, "police chief Anthony Ginaldi told police in Philadelphia to the broadcaster.</seg>
<seg id="20">Several houses and vehicles have also been hit in the area.</seg>
<seg id="21">There were no arrests and police are currently reviewing reports of the surveillance video.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That's what I imagine under the women's Olympic team in the turf, and that's for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First of all, I have been at every summer Olympics since 1984 and the U.S. has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And second: this team has three turners-up, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who were inspiring for many young girls of other skin colour.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, who is Jüdin and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team is finally reflecting the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one among the female turner has been an Afro-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year were Simone and Gabby\ HASH 1 and\ HASH 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">That shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America cheered.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world has been able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez as they delivered unexpected but masterful gymastic routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American to win gold at an individual multi-campaign event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We are seeing the top of this sport, but that's not how turf classes across the country look like.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie all beat the same way as Aly and Madison to create it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "last Five," because the next Olympics will only have four female players in the team, and this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that turkeys are an expensive sport and Turner is primarily in private turf clubs that are maintained by parents who pay for the training, set-up, travel, competition and hotel costs (for the coaches and their turners and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these turf clubs lie in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, the Turners receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started playing with the turkey.</seg>
<seg id="22">We need to give the communities countless, young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie a more affordable and more accessible turf training.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my turnstile of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events, we have offered free and affordable turkeys in Harlem for over 15,000 urban young people (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high quality turkeys that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turnen develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the spirit.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health, as well as for school and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It's the inspiration of this team that causes thousands of young girls to be interested in the turf and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It's so important to participate in sport, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real portrayal of "Girl Power" by the Holen of the Olympic team and thank you so many young girls with different background motivated to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="1">Assistant doctors want to organise further strikes after they rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal</seg>
<seg id="2">Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the British Medical Association's officials, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistant doctors who voted in an election rejected him.</seg>
<seg id="3">In July, Hunt had unveiled plans to forcibly introduce the contract, saying that the NHS would be in a "no-man's land" and that any further delay would be harmful to staff and patients.</seg>
<seg id="4">The first assistant doctors are to receive a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend work to improve care at inhospitable times.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dr Ellen McCourt, the chairman of the BMA Committees for Assistant Doctors, announced last night in a communication: "assistant doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and admit it will treat all doctors fairly."</seg>
<seg id="6">At just eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress has to be made and time is running out.</seg>
<seg id="7">Efforts by the BMA to resolve the disputes by conversations joined the government on reluctance to participate, and sometimes on deafening silence.</seg>
<seg id="8">That happened to a promise made by Jeremy Hunt just last month that his door would always be open.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Jeremy Hunt must act now, lift the stir and address the concerns of assistant doctors."</seg>
<seg id="10">Should he not do so, the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further work measures.</seg>
<seg id="11">The last strike at the end of April saw a postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and specialist doctors were involved to grant cover to doctors on the strike pocket chain.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting the reformed contract with the British Medical Association's officials.</seg>
<seg id="13">The BMA wants a better weekly pay for the 54,000 assistant doctors who will be subject to the contract.</seg>
<seg id="14">Daniel Mortimer, director general of the NHS staff, urged assistant doctors to end the strike.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mortimer said: "work measures do not achieve anything of the very little, but already overburdened teams and service providers, and only cause concern, distress and disruption to patients, carers and their families."</seg>
<seg id="16">Over the past two months, we have spoken to the Committees of Assistant doctors and have responded positively to concerns about the guardianship and whistleblowing with the Department of Health as well as other ministries.</seg>
<seg id="17">Employers hoped that continued positive engagement on other important issues - such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a professional outbreak, training kits, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was for employers, the Health Education England and the Department of Health to comply with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.</seg>

<seg id="1">The £2 -per day drug that can lower heart attack risk</seg>
<seg id="2">Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £2 per day drug after being recommended by the authorities to administer this more people for a longer period of time.</seg>
<seg id="3">The germinating drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with a heart disease.</seg>
<seg id="4">The drug is already administered for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="5">The NHS's regulator NICE has recommended a four -year long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.</seg>
<seg id="6">The NHS's regulator NICE has recommended a four -year long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.</seg>
<seg id="7">Around 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the artery walls that make up coverings.</seg>
<seg id="9">When the Belag breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot that closes blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="10">If the blood clot solves, it can flow through the bloodstream and clog the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="11">People who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, which is produced by the British company AstraZeneca and is distributed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more unlikely.</seg>
<seg id="13">NICE's draft bill, published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90 mg of Ticagrelor, followed by 60 mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre said: "despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all those who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or a stroke - often with disastrous consequences."</seg>
<seg id="15">The fear of a renewed heart attack can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.</seg>
<seg id="16">Experience shows that in combination with aspirin, Ticagrelor is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who already had a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">Through a provisional recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="18">The information on the effectiveness and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years.</seg>

<seg id="1">Culture of Political Correctness leaves electoral fraud flourishing in Muslim areas</seg>
<seg id="2">The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year at the instigation of a government report</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of political correctness has meant that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is knowingly ignored as a devastating government report disclosed today.</seg>
<seg id="4">Former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles is verbally attacking the police, election observers and town halls for having ignored evidence of electoral abuse due to "oversensitivities concerning ethics and religion."</seg>
<seg id="5">The former Minister for Integration and Local Government, who is now an anti-corruption royal, said that intimidating voters from religious motives would be so bad that police should be allowed to set up lockout bands outside electoral cabins to protect intimidated voters.</seg>
<seg id="6">He recommends that voters should have an identity card to prove their identity in elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the moment, a voter only has to name his name and address.</seg>
<seg id="8">The report proposes to put non-removable ink on a person's finger when they cast their voting votes to prevent someone from choosing twice.</seg>
<seg id="9">Whistleblowers should receive more protection, says Sir Eric.</seg>
<seg id="10">It calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions from non-official committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"This is not only against electoral fraud, but is also intended to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that goes with it," he said.</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlets election scandal in east London.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last year, a special election court ruled that the acting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be dismissed after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his office.</seg>
<seg id="14">The court found that Rahman would have "perverted" the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical way" and that he would have silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobia accusations.</seg>
<seg id="15">Rahman is said to have "led his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 votes were either dubious or the consequence of an imitation where one person chooses as someone else.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">He was particularly alarming about the fraudulent letter election - where older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including driving out expulsions to prove the identity</seg>
<seg id="20">In his report, it says: "As proof has been given that pressure has been put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, to vote in accordance with the will of the elderly, especially communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds.</seg>
<seg id="21">"There were concerns that... State institutions had knowingly ignored such behavior because of" politically correct "oversensitivities concerning ethics and religion."</seg>
<seg id="22">Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including banning political activists from editing letters to stop "electoral harvesting."</seg>
<seg id="23">The report, considered by Theresa May, also requires tougher registration reviews to prevent the electoral directory from being used for immigration and social fraud purposes.</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider options to ask voters before choosing your card.</seg>
<seg id="25">Non-removable ink on a person's finger as soon as she has cast her vote to prevent someone from choosing twice.</seg>
<seg id="26">Carry out systematic reviews on a person's nationality to ensure they are eligible to vote.</seg>
<seg id="27">A three -year limit on applications for an automatic letter choice.</seg>
<seg id="28">Ban that political activists edit full letter elections and envelopes of letter elections.</seg>
<seg id="29">Giving the police the power to set up lockouts around election stations.</seg>
<seg id="30">A change in the law that facilitates an indictment of intimidation in accordance with the Representation of the People Act 1983.</seg>
<seg id="31">Photography ban in polling stations.</seg>
<seg id="32">Requirement that only English be used in the polling stations (except for Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">Intensifying the training to ensure that staff enforce the rule that voters go to the electoral cabin alone.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "astonishing" that after the Tower Hamlets case, no criminal charges were made.</seg>
<seg id="35">"The electoral court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy to be inappropriate for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.</seg>
<seg id="36">He was found guilty of a number of reasons, according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="37">He also criticizes the ineffective "hawkish controls" of town halls "electoral registration departments.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Eric said: "the court ruling in Tower Hamlets of last year was a warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="39">Our country has a proud heritage as the mother of the parliaments, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation.</seg>

<seg id="2">Fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio have come out this week over the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, out of edge and band, who has proved to be an impressive doppelgänger of the Duchess of Cambridge.</seg>
<seg id="3">But the 24-year-old Olympicist is far from the only one to have gold struggling athlete who has his own famous doppelgänger - at least not if you are allowed to believe in social media.</seg>
<seg id="4">In honour of the Rio Olympics and all the famous faces currently flimming on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympics that have more than just a certain resemblance to Hollywood fame.</seg>
<seg id="5">The hunter and wolf: team member of the U.S. team in arch shooting Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since his childhood</seg>
<seg id="6">Apart from Kate's doppelgänger on the cycling track, many people on the internet pointed out how a certain arch protector could be the twin of A-Promi Leonardo DiCaprio.</seg>
<seg id="7">The team member of the U.S. team in arch shooting Brady Ellison has caused a rush on Twitter after images on which he sees the Wolf of Wall Street star intriguingly similar.</seg>
<seg id="8">In fact, the arch protector got the madness on social media and admitted that he has been hearing since his childhood that he looks like Leo.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I do not see a great similarity, except for facial hair," Brady told the Huffington Post.</seg>
<seg id="10">"He is a good-looking guy, so I am a compliment."</seg>
<seg id="11">One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will no doubt be even more focused this year: the upsetting similarity between British wife Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.</seg>
<seg id="12">Russian turner Aliya Mustafina, with her large, expressive eyes, is expected to be able to go through as a doppelgänger for the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.</seg>
<seg id="13">And in the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years.</seg>
<seg id="14">A gear higher: this user believes that Nathan is the "athletic version" of the Inception actor</seg>
<seg id="15">Another persistent comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similarly heavy eyebrows and lips.</seg>
<seg id="16">Russian silver medal swimmer Yulia Efimova dismisses more than just the sun-drenched skin and blonde hair like the actress Annalynne McCord, while American Nathan Adrian was attested by fans to equal a "athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt."</seg>
<seg id="17">Strong women: football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar face shape and eyes</seg>
<seg id="18">Not the only one: one Twitter user was very happy that others have also noticed the similarities</seg>
<seg id="19">Theory put in space: according to this user, there may be a reason for the pair's resemblance</seg>
<seg id="20">A Twitter user explained her satisfaction that "the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical."</seg>
<seg id="21">Indeed, the U.S. soccer star Hope Solo and the Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes.</seg>
<seg id="22">Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as the gold medal winner in the turkey Gabby Douglas, which features her own beautiful, wide smile that resembles that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.</seg>

<seg id="2">Byron MacDonald's analysis on the fourth place of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at dr 4 x200m freelance swimmers outraged viewers of the CBC's Livetransfer of the Olmypical Games on Wednesday</seg>
<seg id="3">Canadian broadcaster CBC had to apologise after one of his commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "went off like Mief" and during the race like "a pig died."</seg>
<seg id="4">The commentator Byron MacDonalds thought his microphone was switched off when he handed out his own opinions at the end of the 4 x200m freelance swimming pool.</seg>
<seg id="5">Macdonald, who had been picked into the CBS's commentator team to lend more "colour," could be heard saying: "this little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby."</seg>
<seg id="6">Too excited, went off like Mief, died like a pig.</seg>
<seg id="7">Thank you for that.</seg>
<seg id="8">Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second stage of swimming staffing 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to close the gap to China.</seg>
<seg id="9">Viewers across Canada quickly reacted online after they were shocked by the tone and language</seg>

<seg id="2">The buyers didn't know where they should look when a woman pulled out her clothing amid a primark to try underpants.</seg>
<seg id="3">To make the situation worse, she mustered how she looked in it, pulled her out and put her back to the shelf.</seg>
<seg id="4">She continued to stoke and tried four pairs of underhoses in a shop at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone, Feb.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Primark business at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone, where the woman tried the underhoods before putting her back in the shelf</seg>
<seg id="6">A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the business at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear, "she attracted herself again and left the business without buying anything."</seg>
<seg id="7">She said: "people couldn't believe what they saw."</seg>
<seg id="8">Standing in the middle of the sales area, she took a pair of underpants from the outlay, pulled out her own tights and pants and tried her.</seg>
<seg id="9">"She didn't even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, freaking out like Oskar."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Everyone starred when they pulled out the underhoods, who obviously didn't like it, as they put them back into the shelf."</seg>
<seg id="11">She repeated the same with three other underhoods before finally deciding that you liked nothing, got back and ran out.</seg>
<seg id="12">"She didn't seem to disrupt it that she was watching someone - or thinking about the person who might buy the underhoods she had tried."</seg>
<seg id="13">Ms Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: "how disgusting to think that someone would take underhoods with home that had a different person and who were not washed."</seg>
<seg id="14">The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="15">Ms Davidson added: "As I got along, the staff tried to pull the garments out of the sale after it went - which is just as good. '</seg>
<seg id="16">"I'd hate to go home with a new pair of underhoods and find out that another woman had her and pulled out again and they weren't washed up."</seg>
<seg id="17">A spokesman for Primark said: "Primark is aware of the incident that occurred in our branch in Folkstone on Tuesday 9 August."</seg>
<seg id="18">All the products in question were pulled out of the sale.</seg>

<seg id="1">How to protect yourself with Krav Maga from gun attacks</seg>
<seg id="2">The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make him a little safer for you.</seg>
<seg id="3">We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a grandmaster of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you are approaching you from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the spy around for your robber.</seg>
<seg id="5">If you are approaching you from behind, you should first turn around so that you can see your attacker and "get out of the firing line," says Mizrachi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Then take the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before you beat him with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Then beat him with the knee in the bar and turn, while the attacker crumbles from pain, the weapon from his hands, beat him with the run in the face and move backwards while turning the weapon on him.</seg>
<seg id="8">In attackers approaching from scratch, the technique is similar - move your body out of the firing line, take the weapon and turn it down so the attacker can't shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">Shift the weight to the weapon at the same time and beat the attacker to the chest, then turn the weapon out of his grip before moving backwards and targeting the weapon on him.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds difficult?</seg>
<seg id="11">Watch the video to see exactly how it prefers Mizrachi.</seg>
<seg id="12">But remember that in a robbery, it is safest to pass your money - unless you are a Krav Maga grandmaster.</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveller Ian Wright is chasing his tongue at the dirtiest places in Europe for a travel guide</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller underwent his immune system and dignitaries of a serious test - by ditching some of Europe's dirtiest and most eclectic places.</seg>
<seg id="3">The presenter and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shabbed his course on an euro note, a balloon at the Piccadilly Circus, a dishwasher of a train toilet as well as a public phone in Russia to demonstrate the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before dragging each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he is going to get into.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, filmed under the title "the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results to light.</seg>
<seg id="6">The idea of leaking the dishwasher of a train toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchenette.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about promoting intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thankfully, nothing he left behind left more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Wright became known for testing the resilience of his intestines by traveling through the world and enjoying peculiar and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public money to train stations to washing buttons of toilets, the task definitely put his immune system under a probe</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he told: "already as a child, I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film, he was in any case fair to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he opposed was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His trial discovery showed a luminometer number of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">In comparison, the luminometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet he refused to lick after her luminometer number was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the bacteria number in different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">In the film, he says: "this comes close to the worst I've got in a toilet."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing dirtier than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I'm not going to lure anything here because it's indoors here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company is equipping Mr Wright with Valio freezing, which includes both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valio's Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we really wanted to offer something new to consumers.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We carried out crazy brainstormings that ended that we said "let us call Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a wider context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we have been able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who led the film's directions, added: "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had put some of the things that I instructed him to lick, just like the eclectic Russian toilet shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course, there were things where it was easier to get Ian to lick them and others where this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad we've included some of these dirty leaks on film. "</seg>
<seg id="33">In a 2015 survey carried out by Valio, 84 percent of all respondents associated lactic acid bacteria in particular with the wellbeing of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said they at least occasionally use products containing attached lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="1">Asocial family destroys social housing in Saltash, Cornwall</seg>
<seg id="2">An asocial family left their social housing after a deluge with a £50,000 damage because it had terrorised their neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown from their property in Saltash, Cornwall, according to a long list of complaints.</seg>
<seg id="4">After being violently removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls pointed out glowing holes, wooden dieles were ripped up, rubbish was scattered on the floor and graffiti was smeared to the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family have been resettled and it is believed she now lives in a private shelter</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for house administration at Cornwall Housing, said she fears the apartment was no longer to be repaired.</seg>
<seg id="8">She said: "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I think people don't have to live in this way.</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to take into account, as this property will probably be seen as not such a beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and their reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">The pair had three sons who lived in the flat in the meantime and police said that the terror that had inflicted on the family included street fighting with baseball blasts, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive cries, strikes and flight.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, got an arrangement for anti-social behaviour in June.</seg>
<seg id="13">In some rooms of the house, which will be demolished in circumstances, old rubbish was found</seg>
<seg id="14">It has been ripped up in the property where drugs have been traded in the past</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours said they saw them fighting on the street and had to be regularly called to the police</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing deleted her and her partner this week violently from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily pull out.</seg>
<seg id="17">The deluge was cheered by facilitated neighbors who said their lives were being made to hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">One said: "they did not care about anyone."</seg>
<seg id="19">We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad.</seg>
<seg id="20">The countless times we tell the police here are unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="21">"This morning we could not sleep."</seg>
<seg id="22">We stood up because it was so quiet here - we're not accustomed to that!</seg>
<seg id="23">Now that they are finally away, it will be nice.</seg>
<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it would have failed the family to cooperate with local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house, to which police were called at regular intervals, for 20 years</seg>
<seg id="26">On the overgrown side of the community house, rubbish and old toys were thrown down</seg>
<seg id="27">He added: "it is a disgrace that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and that of their family, as a deluge is always the last step to consider Cornwall Housing.</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case, as the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be terrible for their neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work done by my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the community who have been courageous on us and have provided us with the information.</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will give consolation to some neighbours and convey the message that anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">Fitzpatrick said all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress that is left in one of the house's bedrooms after being deleted on the floor</seg>
<seg id="33">Workers of house administration will now have to remove rubbish mountains that surround the house</seg>
<seg id="34">In 2014, police carried out a raid in the house and found over 70 g of cannabis, as well as scales, paraphernals and cash of £1,700.</seg>
<seg id="35">Skeldon was given a fine after she pleaded guilty to the possession of a drug B drug in trade view.</seg>
<seg id="36">She claimed that the money was for a tombstone of her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car crash in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="37">After they were without a shelter, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner now live in a private accommodation in Plymouth.</seg>
<seg id="38">Many room walls of the house were decorated with graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">Police say it will delight tenants who don't stick to the house order</seg>
<seg id="40">Angela Crow from Devon and Cornwall Police announced that the deluge was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not abide by the house order.</seg>
<seg id="41">"This goes to those who think they can behave without self-accusations and to those who have been damaged by such behaviour," she said.</seg>
<seg id="42">Devon and Cornwall Police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.</seg>

<seg id="2">Sun worshippers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives</seg>
<seg id="3">A Portugal's P- 3 C Orion plane of air forces put an incredible fall flight</seg>
<seg id="4">Airstrikes said it was on a training flight but insisted that no security risk was ahead</seg>
<seg id="5">This was the moment when scared tourists began to panic after a tipping jet crashed over a full beach.</seg>
<seg id="6">Dramatic video recordings showed how the military plane flew almost within tangible proximity above the sunshine on the beach section in Aveiro in northern Portugal.</seg>
<seg id="7">The holidaymakers sprang up when they understandably began to worry about the noise of the diet engines without first seeing what came through the clouds on them.</seg>
<seg id="8">The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.</seg>
<seg id="9">Daniel Fernandes, one of the many holidaymakers who posted videos about the dramatic fly-by on social media, said: "it flew twice really very deep and there was a moment when it looked like it was going to crash."</seg>
<seg id="10">Nuno Arroja added: "I was just on the surf and it felt like the plane was falling down on me. '</seg>
<seg id="11">Tourists on Aveiro beach were in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and was incredibly deep</seg>
<seg id="12">The Portuguese air forces today indicated that the pilot of the P- 3 C Orion plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast, flying so deep that this was the only way to detect them.</seg>
<seg id="13">The spokesman said the jet flew slightly deeper than usual due to poor visibility conditions by nearby area fires, but the air forces insisted that safety was at no time at risk.</seg>
<seg id="14">Land fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer, where four people were killed on the island of Madeira.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Portuguese air forces today indicated that the pilot had to fly so deep due to the conditions - strong fog and fire smoke - which restricted his view</seg>
<seg id="16">The plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise</seg>

<seg id="2">Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis champion.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 27-year-old defeated his countryman and "title defender" Zhang Jike 4:0 (12.5,4.4) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro in an one-sided final.</seg>
<seg id="4">As a result, the world class first picked up the "golden Grand Slam" with successes at World Cup, World Cup, World Tour Final Tournament and Olympia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.</seg>
<seg id="6">The two Chinese, as expected, got into the final game and made the title of each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">So it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would pick up the single title in the sign of the Five Rings.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last non-Chinese on the top Olympic stairwell was former SVS NÖ-legionnaire Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.</seg>
<seg id="9">Ma and Zhang were left on the plate alone, between the sentences and at time-outs they had no coaches at themselves.</seg>
<seg id="10">They had withdrawn to the grandstand and left their shooters alone in the fair competition.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The matches to here I played for my country."</seg>

<seg id="14">The match itself was unexpectedly one-sided.</seg>
<seg id="15">Ma had only really struggled with his 28-year-old opponent in the first set.</seg>
<seg id="16">After that, he determined the pace at the plate, leaving Zhang with only a total of 13 points.</seg>
<seg id="17">The superiority of Ma did not develop the expected matching match.</seg>
<seg id="18">But, nevertheless, there were plenty of breathtaking ball changes to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="19">Mizutani won the game around bronze against the 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4:1.</seg>

<seg id="2">The leadership of the U.S. Republicans is plagued by massive worries about losing their majority in traditionally conservative states.</seg>
<seg id="3">Presidential candidate Donald Trump now admitted weaknesses of his election campaign in the previous Republican high of Utah.</seg>
<seg id="4">A rare moment in which the normally large-scale and self-assured multimillionaire expressed something like concerns, as correspondents reported.</seg>
<seg id="5">Having thrown 16 rivals within his own Republican camp out of the race, the doubts are now growing about his success in the battle for the White House.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We have huge problems in Utah," Trump said before evangelical Christians he asked for support in key states such as Ohio, Florida or Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="7">Guilt were false reports of his candidacy, he resumed his well-known media outlets.</seg>
<seg id="8">Republican high bursts waking up</seg>
<seg id="9">Utah is normally a safe bank for the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to a survey by SurveyUSA from June, Trump and his competitors were equal to the Democrats, Hillary Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="11">Other institutions see Trump ahead, but not with the distance that is common to Republican candidates in the state.</seg>
<seg id="12">Arizona and Georgia are also at risk.</seg>
<seg id="13">In an interview by the broadcaster CNBC, Trump responded to the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton's advance again: "just as I have done so far."</seg>
<seg id="14">And afterwards: this will be "either successful, or I will make a very nice, long holiday."</seg>
<seg id="15">He is not doing anything other than "telling the truth."</seg>
<seg id="16">If it's not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness, that's fine, Trump continued.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then I return to a very good way of life.</seg>

<seg id="2">The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary commission on the case.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kenya's athletes are dropping Ungemach after the second doping affair at the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a fraud attempt at a doping control in the Olympic village, Kenya sent a coach home.</seg>
<seg id="5">The International Olympic Committee announced that it would immediately set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case.</seg>
<seg id="6">A Kenyan official had announced that the former sprinter and present-day coach, John Anzrah, had handed out an urine probe in the Olympic village under the name of the 800 -metre runner Ferguson Rotich.</seg>
<seg id="7">This was reported to Kenya's team management by the doping inspectors.</seg>
<seg id="8">The IAAF World Federation has asked the IOC for information on the case to make its own inquiries, an IAAF spokesman said.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent actions of the IOC, the IAAF will carry out an assessment," an IAAF statement said.</seg>
<seg id="10">"He (Anzrah) has gone to the doping control station and has spent himself as Ferguson Rotich, the probe handed out and signed," declared Kenya's chief of mission Stephan Arap Soi.</seg>
<seg id="11">He was in possession of the athlete's accreditation, which was on the list for the World Anti-Doping Agency's training checks.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ferguson Rotich had become more than 800 metres in Beijing in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="13">Four days earlier, Kenyan athletics leader Michael Rotich had been deducted from the Rio Games.</seg>
<seg id="14">He is said to have informed sportsmen of his country about upcoming doping tests.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to media reports, he should have been arrested on his return at Nairobi airport.</seg>
<seg id="16">Kenya has been under special observation for a long time at the IOC after numerous doping offences.</seg>
<seg id="17">In announcing the IOC's more than 2000 doping target controls before the Rio Games, it was unusually pointed out previously that athletes from Kenya and Russia are being targeted.</seg>
<seg id="18">The World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.</seg>
<seg id="19">The law was passed a few weeks before Olympic start.</seg>
<seg id="20">As a result, the WADA Kenya took from the list of countries whose doping is compliant with the rules of WADA.</seg>
<seg id="21">Kenya is considered a major runner nation.</seg>
<seg id="22">The country's athletes won the most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="23">In a series of television reports from the ARD, accusations have repeatedly been made that in Kenya doping funds are easily accessible and there is to be a significant mentality of sports fraud.</seg>
<seg id="24">IOC member Richard Pound last called for a similar investigation in Kenya, as he had done in Russian athletics.</seg>
<seg id="25">It has been proven that this sport has been covered in a comprehensive and systematic way.</seg>
<seg id="26">Russia's athletes were then excluded from the summer games.</seg>

<seg id="1">Salzburger "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli</seg>
<seg id="2">In the Shakespeare year, the Salzburg Festival presents the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic love pair, similar to Romeo and Julia.</seg>
<seg id="3">With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.</seg>
<seg id="4">A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story," Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.</seg>
<seg id="5">The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical to the temple of the classics and met with the role of Maria a youth space.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the orchestral ditch the Simón Bolívar Orchestra led by the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "this music is full of rhythm," he warmed.</seg>
<seg id="7">We always say that it is very Latin American.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and melody.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's a wonderful mixture, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="10">I would say that we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!</seg>
<seg id="11">In this staging, Bartoli plays an older sought-after Maria.</seg>
<seg id="12">She remembers waking up to her love with Tony, while the younger Maria plays and dances.</seg>
<seg id="13">The role of Maria has always fascinated me.</seg>
<seg id="14">First, because it is musically extraordinary!</seg>
<seg id="15">And then there would be Maria's personality.</seg>

<seg id="2">Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, died in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="3">The lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said her family learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was believed she was killed by a Russian air raid in Raqqa, the group's bulwark in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="5">Sultana was 17 years old and died, according to her family, shortly after she pretended to leave the war-torn country and return to England.</seg>
<seg id="6">"One can only hope that the only good thing is - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war zone - discouraging people from ever making that decision," Akunjee said.</seg>
<seg id="7">In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London rose into a plane towards Turkey and then entered a bus to the Syrian border.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sultana's family have been told she has married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months.</seg>

<seg id="1">Turkey: Kurdish community expects mass flight</seg>
<seg id="2">"Anyone who does not suit and praises Erdogan sits on packed caffeine," says the chairman of the Gülen Foundation Dialogue and World, Ercan Karakoyun.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Kurdish municipality of Germany expects in the short term tens of thousands of protective seekers fleeing Turkey to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the medium term, it could even become "a few hundred thousand," the association's chairman, Ali Toprak, believes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Because of the hard push by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish municipality of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="6">"In the short term, I reckon with tens of thousands, in the medium term, with a few hundred thousand protective seekers from Turkey in Germany, if the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," says the Association chairman, Ali Toprak of the "world" of Friday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Because the government had already overrun Kurdish strongholds with punitive actions months ago, 500,000 Kurds within Turkey were on the run.</seg>
<seg id="8">After the thwarted coup, secular and opposition ethnic Turks would be added.</seg>
<seg id="9">Many will want to restart in Europe if they are further oppressed in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="10">"It is not acceptable for a state that itself is taking up refugees to produce refugees in their own country," said Toprak.</seg>
<seg id="11">The chief of staff complained of the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish but also in alevitic cities.</seg>
<seg id="12">In this way, Erdogan wants to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kurds.</seg>
<seg id="13">"They are the last large minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have been eradicated or displaced over the last hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member.</seg>
<seg id="14">The chief executive called for the federal government to "position itself as sharply as Austria against Erdogan and its supporters."</seg>
<seg id="15">A "witch-hunt" against Erdogan critics is also taking place in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="16">I don't feel safe in Germany for the first time in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="17">The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad.</seg>
<seg id="18">More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and opposition activists.</seg>
<seg id="19">The fire mark as a Gülen supporter destroys teachers and other academics the professional existence.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Anyone who does not adapt and praise Erdogan sits on packed caffeine, by the way, the Kemalists and seculars," said Ercan Karakoyun, Chairman of the Gülen Foundation Dialogue and Education, the "world."</seg>
<seg id="21">As the newspaper reports on figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Turks presented the largest group of asylum-seekers recognised for political persecution in Germany before the coup.</seg>
<seg id="22">On the date of 30 June, this was 11,386 people and, therefore, almost 29% of all recognised as asylum seekers (39,625).</seg>
<seg id="23">This survey does not cover war, poverty or the lack of prospects.</seg>
<seg id="24">Asylum rights under the Basic Law are exclusively political, that is to say, from the state side, individually persecuted.</seg>

<seg id="1">Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "go where it hurts"</seg>
<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals don't get anything from the summer election campaign - and holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country day.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2021, the country's election will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays, the heavy parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">After all, this is not the case: summer holidays, heat and council campaign - that is what is happening.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who are to be persuaded by the campaigners, are on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="7">The vast majority of holidaymakers who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so they are not allowed to choose the country day.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition, there are practical problems: in the holidays, helpers who hang up posters, blow up air balloons, distribute flyers, and end up counting voices, are only laborious.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 2016, 4, the election and last day of the holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has yet to pass election campaigns just over the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, has to fear for his post.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls.</seg>
<seg id="13">Thrilling will be how strongly Neuling AfD cut off and what's left coalition dust at the end of the day.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, is making an almost inconspicuous campaign, you see from his large posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels through the land, distributes roses and ploughs a little with the people, just as his legendary predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise, Seelering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame at the bloom of the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her refugee policy, her "we create this" has accelerated the rise of right-wing populists, which is now likely to cost him the beautiful office.</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its top candidate, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already seen how it is when you are campaigning in the right place at the wrong time.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to major rallies; Merkel Bundestag is located in the northeast.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not vote, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony than Mecklenburger and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"There was probably the majority from other federal states," said Vincent Kokert, Secretary-General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR.</seg>
<seg id="22">But it is also a pity to no one from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise, the north-east CDU largely waives the usual campaign levels on marketplaces and in front of shopping centres with umbrellas and air balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">This, Kokert says, only plays a "subordinate role."</seg>
<seg id="25">The Union, too, has noticed that it is breaking the ground in the countryside, that it must make a great effort to find a wire to the people again.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is like the Left, the SPD, the Greens: there is little in the way of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the council of CDU campaigner Kokert to his co-workers is also self-evident: "you have to go where it hurts, namely where the people are: village, golden weddings, every birthday party must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called for his SPD to be a particularly committed election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In polls, the Social Democrats last stood at 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just just before the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">In the 2011 election, the SPD had still clearly won at 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Greens, small party with seven percent in the polls, are likely to create the leap into the land day.</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue from the holiday distress, and largely move their campaign to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Online campaigning," it calls the national chairman Claudia Müller.</seg>
<seg id="34">Otherwise, green campaigners will go on trace search for local voters among holidaymakers.</seg>
<seg id="35">Silke Gajek, the top candidate, is curvy with a pet boat through the mecklenburgic lakes and still finds it beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="36">Your impression: "election holiday in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment."</seg>

<seg id="1">B27 refurbishment: restaurants suffer from blocking</seg>
<seg id="2">There is nothing to mock at the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="3">For those responsible for the construction work, which starts at 5,30 o "clock in the morning and only end at 20 p.m., there is all the praise.</seg>
<seg id="4">"They have done everything quite zealously," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet petrol station.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a superteam.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no delay either.</seg>
<seg id="7">The construction site could be moved to the south at half-time at the halfway point, until the end of October everything is expected to be ready.</seg>
<seg id="8">Praise will also be given to those responsible for the construction work, for example, when it comes to the setting up of containers.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site has moved south on Monday and the blocking of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen has also been lifted and the connection to Rottenburg has also been restored, the traffic situation within the village has been relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now return from Ofterdingen to the B 27.</seg>
<seg id="11">The traffic through the place seems to be going back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"There were some significant complaints," says the Deputy Chief Executive Officer, Florian King, responsible for the transport management of the refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had struggled with more traffic noise because many cheques were searching and were more likely to trust their Navi than the signage.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to some trucks being franked in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">As the speed limits were not met, the municipality increased the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.</seg>
<seg id="16">"There have been significant excesses," says King, who made himself aware of the situation on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three per minute have already been bleached.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fastest was travelling at 77 kilometres in the Tempo- 30 zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">Since the construction site has moved on, however, it has become calmer.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the businessmen at the B 27, it is only a small consolation that, for customers from Rottenburg, the road is now open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the cards, businessmen do not like to look.</seg>
<seg id="22">But that the B 27 refurbishment at them has led to turnover breaks, leaving everyone to look through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more and less affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">Who has less to do with the "end customer," that is to say for other companies, for which the refurbishment has little impact.</seg>
<seg id="25">At the Maier car dealership, Thomas Sulz also speaks of a "at most slight decline," but also admits that, of course, "the running customer is missing."</seg>
<seg id="26">The most battered are the locals along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly crown, finds clear words.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already threatening.</seg>
<seg id="29">Not only him, but all the restaurants have "hit hard."</seg>
<seg id="30">The customers were missing from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil.</seg>
<seg id="31">We have to be happy about every euro turnover.</seg>
<seg id="32">Sales losses are estimated at "well over 50 percent."</seg>
<seg id="33">Road rehabilitation has "rebuffed" its operation "by two years."</seg>
<seg id="34">He has had to sack half of his staff.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been made redundant, the policy would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a question from Göhner as to whether there could be financial compensation, with the hint that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation at the B 27.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows of other counties where such a thing has been handled more generously.</seg>
<seg id="38">In all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family business has been here since 1715, it refers to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">He can understand the fact that other regular guests are now less frequent because of the complicated traffic management.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't drive, it's beautiful elsewhere too.</seg>
<seg id="42">Göhner has no doubt that his tribal clientele will come back after the end of the rehabilitation work.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises with BSE and avian influenza, Göhner keeps the impact of the B 27 construction work on its clientele for the biggest crisis its restaurant has experienced in its long-standing history.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six months of construction work is already brutal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Legislation is constantly being screened in the name of the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="2">Following the recent attacks, Interior Minister de Maizière is now presenting a thick security package.</seg>
<seg id="3">But what has a tolerance status to do with terror?</seg>
<seg id="4">And what does the coalition partner say about all this?</seg>
<seg id="5">Thomas de Maizière gives the concierge.</seg>
<seg id="6">All his proposals are "politically reasonable" for the coalition partner, says the Federal Minister of the Interior at the presentation of his new security package.</seg>
<seg id="7">They don't overcharge anyone.</seg>
<seg id="8">Other, more far-reaching points would first be discussed within the parties.</seg>
<seg id="9">I am also involved in this.</seg>
<seg id="10">As Minister of the Interior, however, he is in a position to achieve results and to achieve a "achievable consensus" within the coalition.</seg>
<seg id="11">De Maizière has missed a little time after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach before presenting his conclusions for security in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, these are now all the more extensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">Some things are already known, proclaimed, pronounced: that a new security authority should take care of the cracking of encrypted communication is not new.</seg>
<seg id="14">Nor is the fact that Germany has to implement several EU requirements on passenger data and gun law.</seg>
<seg id="15">The call for more video surveillance and staff for the security authorities is equally unsurprising.</seg>
<seg id="16">In part, de Maizière is launching a second start for proposals that have not been made with the SPD so far: he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under punishment, and to crack down on jihadists with dual citizenship the German passport.</seg>
<seg id="17">"This will be difficult points for the SPD," the CDU man admits.</seg>
<seg id="18">He still thinks this is reasonable and does not call for any chances in the coalition partner anyway.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few new ideas presents de Maizière as well.</seg>
<seg id="20">They have it in part: it plans fast-track procedures for deportation and more opportunities to detain people before deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees who are targeted in the country are expected to chase their smartphones before and disclose social media accounts for a security review.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the case of tolerances for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to put some even worse than hitherto - for example, those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to disguise their identity.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of this is politically and legally sensitive.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some of them are still unbalanced and leave questions open.</seg>
<seg id="25">And, on a number of points - with regard to the inequality of patience, for example, - the question arises: what does this really have to do with security and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, de Maizière says it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be denied that the offenders of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">Moreover, many people worried about security, given the high numbers of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="29">And things that people were deeply concerned about could not be excluded even in campaign times.</seg>
<seg id="30">Internal security has been tremendously focused.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only the attacks in the neighbourhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The uncertainty is great.</seg>
<seg id="34">And yes, there are election campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly in position on the issue of internal security.</seg>
<seg id="36">Over the past few days, it has been high between the two parties.</seg>
<seg id="37">First a garnish dispute over the equipment of the federal police, then about a security policy gathering of some Union interior ministers, in which the Ressortchefs also call for a Burka ban and a departure from dual citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="38">De Maizière is also looking for conciliatory sounds.</seg>
<seg id="39">He does not think of a departure from the double pass.</seg>
<seg id="40">We have befriended the discussion in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">It does not make sense to reopen it.</seg>
<seg id="42">And in a Burka ban, he has constitutional concerns.</seg>
<seg id="43">Whether his own package is constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually "reasonable" for the coalition partner, it has yet to be shown.</seg>
<seg id="44">There is something in it that could cause dispute.</seg>
<seg id="45">But the SPD is also trying to prop up the issue of internal security.</seg>
<seg id="46">Party leader Sigmar Gabriel first signals caution and says: "the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security."</seg>

<seg id="1">Volkswagen is still glimpsed.</seg>
<seg id="2">Despite diesel scandals, extradition figures worldwide are rising.</seg>
<seg id="3">But not all markets are running around.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the case of recall, there is a term for a term.</seg>
<seg id="5">Volkswagen is staring at the deliveries more forcefully into the second half of the year.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the past year, despite the diesel affair, Europe's largest automobile can continue to show a plus, thanks to its many brands and some well-running markets.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in July, the core brand, VW, weakened mainly in Western Europe, and thus again burdened the total sales, as the company listed in the Dax said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Worldwide, the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles in July than in the previous month.</seg>
<seg id="9">In Western Europe alone, after China the second most important market, sales were up 14 percent below the previous month.</seg>
<seg id="10">In Germany's home market, deliveries sacked by almost a sixth.</seg>
<seg id="11">Brand sales chief Jürgen Stackmann attributed the weaker figures from July, mainly to two sales days less in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="12">Moreover, in some core markets, there has been a retention of purchase by "changing economic conditions."</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey, the UK vote to leave the EU also strained, a spokeswoman explained.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US, where the exhaust affair first escalated, there is also a minus to beech.</seg>
<seg id="15">Big support for VW is the Chinese market.</seg>
<seg id="16">In total, the mainly affected house brand of Lower Saxony is still glimpsed by the diesel scandal: after the first seven months, only an extradition minus of 0.9% to 3.37 million vehicles is to be found.</seg>
<seg id="17">Group sales chief Fred Kappler was able to continue to show a sales luck from January to July.</seg>
<seg id="18">1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen at this time, worldwide 5.904 million.</seg>
<seg id="19">Volkswagen had manipulated exhaust tests with a software.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany alone, VW calls about 2.5 million cars to convert to the workshops.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the course of the conversion, VW reiterated that the conversion of the cars has no negative impact.</seg>
<seg id="22">After the conversion of the vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power.</seg>
<seg id="23">After retrofitting, the automobile exhibits a "guarantee" certificate, but it does not talk about a "guarantee," as it said on Friday in business circles.</seg>
<seg id="24">The reason is legal.</seg>
<seg id="25">The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen now guarantees its German customers a guarantee of converted diesel models.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would have confirmed VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday.</seg>
<seg id="27">From the Department of Transportation, it was confirmed that there was this meeting.</seg>
<seg id="28">"VW has to comply fully with the requirements of my commission of inquiry and the KBA."</seg>
<seg id="29">"Deviations from this are not accepted," said Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), according to the ministry.</seg>
<seg id="30">VW has taken on the guarantee that, in the case of fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power, no deterioration will occur after the conversion, and that all typical vehicle values will remain unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="31">Volkswagen itself uses the term "guarantee" but not as it was called in corporate circles.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the broad term "guarantee," Volkswagen sees the possibility for customers, for example, to get into a workshop half a year after retrofitting, for example, and to return this to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.</seg>
<seg id="33">Even in the interests of the customer, it is important to avoid the fact that, in the event of any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust scandal, it will be insecure in terms of possible warranty arrangements, as it was called.</seg>
<seg id="34">That is why VW does not use the term "guarantee."</seg>

<seg id="1">The Raiffeisenbank Gmund at the Tegernsee is demanding punitive interest rates from rich savers in the future - as a second institute in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="2">Bank chief Josef Paul said on Thursday: "it's only about 139 customers who park 40 million€ on giro- or daily money accounts."</seg>
<seg id="3">The Federal Association of German Banks speaks of an isolated incident and sees no sign that ordinary savers would "not be afraid to pay for their savings banks."</seg>
<seg id="4">Camps banks money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they must pay their 0.4 percent penalty rate.</seg>

<seg id="6">"The first €100,000 is free."</seg>
<seg id="7">"The next 100,000 will cost €400 a year," said Paul.</seg>
<seg id="8">He has been wary of €40 million for some time, which could be lifted from one day to the next and which he cannot use.</seg>
<seg id="9">"These are with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent costs," the bank chief said.</seg>

<seg id="11">According to the polluter pays principle, the costs will now continue.</seg>
<seg id="12">It would be far too dangerous to leave the cash in the Raiffeisenbank's safes: "I have already seen four falls, I do not want the fifth!" Said the bank board.</seg>
<seg id="13">Most customers would have understood and changed to other forms of investment.</seg>
<seg id="14">Few migrated to other banks.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Cooperative Society of Bavaria said: "the ECB's extreme monetary policy is causing significant costs for all banks."</seg>
<seg id="16">To carry them on their own is "not economically viable."</seg>
<seg id="17">Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or remittances.</seg>
<seg id="18">With penalty rates for deposits from three million€, the Thuringian People's and Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land had made headlines with their Skatbank branch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="19">Michael Kemmer, chief executive of the Banking Association, said: "we do not expect private customers to have to pay for deposits for deposits, and competition in Germany among banks and savings banks is far too strong."</seg>
<seg id="20">A banker said that at the Tegernsee there is "a clientele that is a little more fitted by the fortunes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"This can become a problem for a small bank" if it hurts money for free.</seg>
<seg id="22">Founded in 1911, Gmund has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the region, well-known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs live.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Cooperative Association of Bavaria "is not currently aware of any other banks that calculate an outlay for deposits of private customers," spokesman Ernst said.</seg>
<seg id="25">The president of the Federal Association of German People's Banks and Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), Uwe Fröhlich, declared at the end of June: "the threshold to go to the negative towards the private client is very, very high."</seg>
<seg id="26">The competition is tough, and it threatens the brain drain to compete.</seg>
<seg id="27">Customers in Germany will not let this happen in width.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Platten: who actually buys records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely middle-aged men love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before rushing to the commentary in order to overthrow it under the pseudonym non-AlleEinsamenmen Mittlerenage with rough insults, this statement derives from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the much-discussed resurgence of records is not on a boom in Millennials that want to welcome the novelty of physical items, but due to midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a plate are likely to be aged between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the 18 - 24 age group is the most unlikely buyer group.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a horden by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers retain their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do YouGov's results vote?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog were a news report on television, the camera would follow me while running in the midst of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest grey suit and stealing wildly before standing, holding my hands and saying something like: "so, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Sohos is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were based - there are still a handful of fantastic record specialty shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and vegetation through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I have from Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (data number: eight middle-aged men, a woman, probably around the 20) is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I already appreciate," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snap by email, I didn't follow him home), dress up the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason he owns such a significant number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy plates he couldn't afford when they appeared and again buy items he sold when he was young and bankrupt.</seg>
<seg id="19">"A lot of things I buy are from the late 60 s, early 70 s, who appeared when I was 11 or 12, things where I was probably a little too young to buy them," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy plates are more introverted and happy to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.</seg>
<seg id="21">That's my laster.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets apply to the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he has also noticed a new wave of people being influenced by the media hub, people who have heard about the comeback and are looking to buy their old plates again.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of the conversations I have had, people have usually devoured so at 1998 or 1999 of their collection.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their plates to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their plates again, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">That would explain the boom to supporters of the record revision of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional significance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes just a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realise that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to Wez, some of the older customers took impetus to the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar soundproofing hulls, from items that wake up happy youth movements.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or the possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation," says Wez.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector and I think that is the case with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It's an easy way to look at it mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"We are like their social workers!" An employee is flying from a record stack.</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey by the ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who bought a plate last month have not yet listened to them.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% possess a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a plate do not own a record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried while bleeding through a stack to Bossa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data number: three middle-aged men), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"Someone came here only recently and said:" I don't have a record player, but I would like to buy a Radiohead record so I can put them on the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More product-like, less musical.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones, who are slowly coming in.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has devoted almost an entire floor to the records, has a blower audience when I'm talking.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenage young and middle-aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops - Wild Beasts' latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz drenched from the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks particularly lonely, but nagging mental trauma is hard to detect if you are standing next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around in the shop for a few minutes and considers the varietal of the plates for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It makes a storytelling rather than a big purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">She doesn't deserve much, so collecting plates is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to hear music from a computer or in other ways, but the beauty of plates is... "she drives off with a loved sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I look to muster the jeans hotpants, I watch a group of young teenage girls grooming for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter consider buying a Crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">To the left is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one looks at them - perhaps because they are only purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It's no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends most on luxury items such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my investigation revealed that the results of YouGov are voting, they leave, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors who exist in reality, record shops and in online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They are certainly not spending their Thursday morning with the bump through record shops of Berwick Street and the blazing through plates while avoiding the starring look of an intriguing, 30-year-old false presenter who raises over the shoulders of nothing of middle-aged men.</seg>

<seg id="1">French court rejects offer over demolition of shops in Jungle refugee camp</seg>
<seg id="2">A French court has rejected an offer by authorities in Calais to tear down dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the Calais Jungle where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">At a court hearing this week, authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorized to tear down 72 provisional deals where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hairdressing services, or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few€ in provisional restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Calais prefecture argued that these places should be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would pose a risk of fire and sanity.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups informed the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the government-backed association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also carried out that the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of people running the 72 provisional deals, but acknowledged that the concerns of the Calais prefecture were "absolutely understandable."</seg>
<seg id="8">The judge, Jean-François Molla, said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than simply feeding people who "live in extremely precarious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said the areas provide quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places threatened by the defeat was the Jungle Book Kids "Café of the camp, which is operated nonprofit and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as a consultancy on asylum matters for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to uphold the kids "cafe.</seg>
<seg id="12">In a letter to the Guardian, it said that the closure would be "a disaster for these children, the youngest of whom are eight years old."</seg>
<seg id="13">The two aid agencies Help Refugees and L "Auberge des Miert estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the Jungle camp had risen to more than 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in newcomers over the summer.</seg>

<seg id="2">Germany's Raser has to adapt to the next generation of speed knives: in various federal states, including Hessen and Brandenburg, new flash devices are being tested that are supposed to be particularly effective in transmitting tempos.</seg>
<seg id="3">The futuristic Enforcement Trailer of the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden, for example, can be used for accident areas where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.</seg>
<seg id="4">For example, at highway construction sites or bridges with temporary templates, there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide a stationary lightning for compliance with the speed limit.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or elaborate.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Enforcement Trailer is autark: its battery holds five days at uninterrupted measurement, the case data is encrypted via a modem.</seg>
<seg id="7">With laser measuring technology, all vehicles can also be captured across multiple tracks simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="8">Variable speed limits as well as transit bans after time, driving strips and vehicle class can also be monitored.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the high-powered state, you can move the trailer with every car with a trailer clutch, according to the manufacturer.</seg>
<seg id="10">In order for him not to be simply cloned, he is lowered in the measuring operation, so the wheels in the armored and, incidentally, also shouted outside shell disappear.</seg>
<seg id="11">In addition, a built-in alarm system is designed to protect the lightning from vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since 2015, the trailer has been tested and used in various federal states, according to Vitronic.</seg>
<seg id="13">Foreign authorities are also flashing with the new technique: recently, France has reordered 100 pieces, after an order of 150 pieces last year.</seg>

<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance at the 7 -er rugby came in the final on Thursday night to an abrupt hold at the last hurdle in the form of the Fijis when they were beaten with a 43 - 7 result at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji issued a masterclass in the handling, side-stepping, retrofitting, line run and raw force to win gold - their first Olympics medal of any colour.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was sweetened by the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth that day - and they were able to be very proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7 - 5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall back on them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless, Fiji would have beaten a 15 -man team in best form at that form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for GB - but it probably won't - that at least one Briton will hang a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's chief trainer Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens under Ryan.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This sap will hurt, but progress is astonishing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began miraculously, leaving the attacking GBs out of fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. as if you were running into driving buses, and the World Series winners went up 5 - 0 when Osea Kolinisau was in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With still four minutes of game time, Jerry Tuwai added yet another attack from the right corner he converted.</seg>
<seg id="15">12 - 0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A hevorraging Tackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa reaching a third gate, but it only held up Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua lured a touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0 - 17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the rematch and there was still over a minute of game time... In the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou pressured through further weak Tacklings of the GB team and stumbled down to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29 - 0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is as if Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB is still learning.</seg>
<seg id="22">That is the way it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB carried out fundamental changes at half-time and closed the fijian gap... For whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half until Josua Tuisova ran through after a brilliant intermediate play by Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton launched a try for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36 - 7, but the game has long been in favor of the South Seasons, whose fans sang, flags swapped and danced in the grandstand.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not hard to admire Fijis "playful approach.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame set the i-Tüpfelchen with another try in the final seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Pfiff tweeted, the Fijis hugged himself and GB kicked devastated in the lawns.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day, Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi-finals with 20 - 5 and Britain urged South Africa in a tight semi-final match from the race - Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Boks forward in the first half but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate among the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late Tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15 -Aside team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by battle with the coach's cancer to rowing victory</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no more emotinous gold than in those games and that's what what is going to mean.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first rowing strike to the last, 220 hard Hieve, who go down in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an extra meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though it was only the ones who sat at the helm, there were three votes in the boat, the echo of the coach Robin Williams, who was alluding to the second Olympiagold in two without a tax woman in a row, the first women in the history of British sport who put such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolutely, after all, their 39th unbeaten use, which is also unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athletes gliding across the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the nature of the triumph.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in rowing is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental advances that make up the difference and it was no one more helpful than the coach who did not know 30 months ago whether he would survive that day at all, when cancer was diagnosed with him.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said, he's risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer that is operable and that they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you don't, he's spreading everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio were lucky that he was able to start treatment in early 2014, outside the season, which kept the interruption to a minimum if that is the right term in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so it had to go better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in hospital and ran around at the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice.</seg>
<seg id="18">That's how it starts.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing in itself is already a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the immediacy of victory, her first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve-wracking morning talking a little more than usual, trying to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Stanning, who was the main man in the Royal Artillery Regiment in a bet in Afghanistan, said "I was an emotional wreck this week, which is perhaps something extreme, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It only repeats how much this means to me, how much I and Helen and also Robin have worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin we would be no one, so a massive thank you to him, he is the best coach in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I wouldn't have wanted a better person for training or a better coach.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the past five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The pair had a tough rhythm with which their opponents couldn't keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 metres, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to open up, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very caught at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "stay in the process, stay in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important not to get involved.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we weren't looking to make some tolls.</seg>
<seg id="33">We didn't want a fireworks today, we just wanted to achieve a good result, go out and win the race, which we did as well.</seg>
<seg id="34">The pair will take a break for a year before making decisions about his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover must appear on a wedding next week, her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that was my last race.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have meant too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">In London, it took about six months to realise that I am an Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="40">It was all so new to me and I was so stressed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Here it took about four minutes.</seg>
<seg id="42">That feels so much better, "she said.</seg>

<seg id="2">The managing director of the "Veitenstein Group," Ruppert Göller, is retiring.</seg>
<seg id="3">The association is considered to be "bay-wide exemplary."</seg>
<seg id="4">A small flimsy drinking water association as a model for the large water producers.</seg>
<seg id="5">For example, some time ago in the original, it was in a contribution from the Bayerische Rundfunk.</seg>
<seg id="6">Little later, the water forum of the government of Unterfranken paid tribute to the purpose association.</seg>
<seg id="7">The work of the Veitenstein group is "bayernwide as exemplary."</seg>
<seg id="8">Behind all this is Rupert Göller, who was 31 years in the purpose association, of which 28 years as CEO.</seg>
<seg id="9">Now, at the age of 65, he was retired.</seg>
<seg id="10">The drinking water association of the Veitenstein group, based in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, promotes about 150,000 cubic metres of water every year and provides 32 places and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">The municipalities are the municipalities of Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current chairman, Breitbrunn's Mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was recruited as a watershed in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Its tasks have been very diverse and they stretched from water management and maintenance work to office and organisational activities, budgeting, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations at weekends," the chairperson said.</seg>
<seg id="15">As outstanding events, she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells (1994), land purchases in the area of the new wells (1998) and compensation for farmers, the refurbishment of the high containers (1999), the re-creation of a central computer control (2004) and the partial renewal of water pipelines.</seg>
<seg id="16">There has been no stalemate and there have been repeated innovations, because water means life and drinking water is the most important food.</seg>
<seg id="17">In her Laudatio, she praised Göller's loyal, reliable and correct service over 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">He has worked with a lot of heartthrob for his Water Confederation and he has lived up to the Water Confederation as if it were his own company.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was able to present the concept of success of the Veitenstein group to the nitrate cut in front of the Water Forum of the District of Unterfranken.</seg>
<seg id="20">He has received a great deal of recognition and praise for this.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rupert Göller, for his part, praised water wart Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.</seg>
<seg id="22">He is the best watershed and he was a loyal crunch.</seg>
<seg id="23">Together we were an unbeatable team.</seg>
<seg id="24">As highlights from his point of view, he described the Brunnenbau and the reorganisation of the purpose association.</seg>
<seg id="25">The biggest challenge and the most difficult bet, however, were the pipe breaking at the high container at Kirchlauter on a 3 January.</seg>
<seg id="26">Here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night, so that the localities could be supplied with water.</seg>
<seg id="27">It was also possible to maintain the supply of Neubrunn only because the high container of Pettstadt was filled with hoses.</seg>
<seg id="28">The management of the drinking water association has been handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who follows the succession of Rupert Göller.</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - Light for German steel industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-hit and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared from additional costs in millions of€.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that threatened the industry from eco-electricity support are off the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the case of the liberation of the renewable-energy levy in the stock systems for the so-called equity production in the German steel industry, German Minister of Economics Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "West German General Newspaper" (WAZ, Friday edition) said.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I am really pleased that we have finally managed to achieve this after two years of tough negotiations."</seg>
<seg id="6">As a result, the European Commission had initially planned to ask the steel producers who use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption.</seg>
<seg id="7">The steel industry threatened additional costs of between 120 and 240 million€ per year, according to the German industry association.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel told the WAZ that there is now a basic agreement with the EU Commission following talks with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is only when the generators are replaced in the steel plants that an EEG levy of 20 percent is applied.</seg>
<seg id="10">This, too, is not being raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">The IG Metal welcomed Germany's agreement with the EU Commission on the production of equity.</seg>
<seg id="12">As a result, the status quo of the previous scheme is largely enshrined.</seg>
<seg id="13">The successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry are particularly important.</seg>
<seg id="14">"With regard to our" steel "campaign, this is a first step."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Others must follow."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Climate and employment targets are also to be weighed in the reform of emissions trading," said IG Metal Chief Executive Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.</seg>
<seg id="17">The steel industry in Europe has been suffering from overcapacity and significant price pressures since the 2008 financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year, the situation further intensified when the world's largest producer of producers threw mass steel into the world market, given the weakening domestic demand.</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel corporations of price dumping.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the course of this spring, the situation has been somewhat relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand, import tariffs on import steel have been effective and, on the other hand, the economic outlook in China has arisen.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry primus Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Most recently, prices would have been more stagnant.</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">ThyssenKrupp also did not want to exclude closures of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">Around 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="28">In July, German steel manufacturers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.</seg>
<seg id="29">They produced a good six percent less crude steel with 3.4 million tonnes than in the previous month, as the Stahl Economic Association announced on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="30">After a short increase in May, the crowd now declined the second month in succession.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since the beginning of the year, production has been up by two percent below the previous year's level.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the coming months, the association expects an increase in the volume of orders.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, spirit, health: singing does seniors well</seg>
<seg id="2">The singing has already accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in the Lehram studies she belted the compartment music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior chorus.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a probe, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall more alive, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good about her health and her mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because singing is equal from several perspectives a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler of the German senior league.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describing Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular interaction, seniors can establish and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures are settled in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "to speak out and to organize, to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of association."</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in the positive sense, Hackler says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Because in doing so, seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly call for their lungs do not get out of the puste as quickly as they are in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even when it comes to getting the sound of voice in age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">On older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the federal Labor community of senior organisations.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, common singing had a much higher priority, it belonged to everyday life, both at school and in leisure, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people awakens many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth time.</seg>
<seg id="18">By means of lyrics and especially melodies, even dementia sufferers are devoid of long-standing events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the case of singing, a special performance is also required for the head, Lenz explains.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, focusing on your own voice and on a predetermined rhythm, adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just elderly people who live alone do not just focus on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition given by singing in the chorus, Hackler says.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Self-esteem is also growing by singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show yourself: if I long for something, I will be better and wake up beyond me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">So there's good reason to start singing, so there's enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Anyone who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks they have little talent, Lenz advises.</seg>
<seg id="28">You are not singing alone - with 50 singing people, who is listening when a tone goes on?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the suitable offer, seniors have different options, Hackler says.</seg>
<seg id="30">Sings someone from the familiar circle in a senior chorus, you can easily join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">If you want to sing in a church choir, you can turn directly to the municipality or the church.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Anyone who does not have access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbours for help with the Internet search.</seg>
<seg id="35">Anyone who wants to sing should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that applies to any age.</seg>

<seg id="1">Cats react more sensitively than hangovers to cries of young animals</seg>
<seg id="2">Biologists have examined in Hannover what effect the call of cat babies has on adult animals.</seg>
<seg id="3">To her surprise, the males also didn't leave the males cold - however, unlike the females, they always behaved the same way.</seg>
<seg id="4">Female cats can detect the excitement of cat babies at the minds of the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="5">They respond by ten percent more quickly to sounds of kittens, which are in great distress, as scientists have found out from the veterinarian high school and the Medical University of Hannover (MHH).</seg>
<seg id="6">Hangovers are also responding to the calls of kittens - but always the same.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Apparently, the acoustic differences between the middling of less and heavily excited young animals for the males are either unperceptible or not important," said the biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.</seg>
<seg id="8">She is a director of the study published this Friday in the journal "BMC Evolutionary Biology."</seg>
<seg id="9">In a previous investigation, the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the kittens cries differ with the urgency of their need for help.</seg>
<seg id="10">A total of nine adult hangovers and eight kittens were observed from the animal husbandry of the MHH.</seg>
<seg id="11">They were pre-played on the one hand by little ones who were taken from the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings.</seg>
<seg id="12">On the other hand, they were confronted with cries of more excited kittens, which were additionally elevated.</seg>
<seg id="13">The researchers consider their results to be meaningful despite the low sample.</seg>
<seg id="14">"All females, even those who have not had their own offspring, reacted differently to the cries," said Konerding.</seg>
<seg id="15">They turned more quickly to the loudspeaker when this call of the very more erroneous kittens played off.</seg>
<seg id="16">This ability may be inherent or evolving with gender maturity.</seg>
<seg id="17">"A surprise was that the males reacted at all," the biologist said.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the past, scientists have already examined the reactions of women and men to baby noises on several occasions.</seg>
<seg id="19">Also, some studies showed that women were more sensitive to infants, whether they were mothers or not, the biologist Marina Scheumann reported.</seg>

<seg id="1">Podolski attacks with "Gala" after Supercup</seg>
<seg id="2">Hakan Sükr is a football legend in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Turkey, an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hakan Sükr.</seg>
<seg id="4">He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.</seg>
<seg id="5">For the first time after the coup attempt, an important football match is taking place in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="6">Before the duel of the arch-rivals between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul around the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: "business as usual."</seg>
<seg id="7">Even when the state of emergency was imposed after the accident in July, the government begged that the everyday life of ordinary citizens should not be affected.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, which is blamed for the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="9">It does not stop at football.</seg>
<seg id="10">Against the former Starkicker Hakan South, the prosecutor issued an arrest warrant.</seg>
<seg id="11">As a result, South America, now living in America, is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.</seg>
<seg id="12">Sükr is said to be supporters of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is blamed by the state president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, for the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the state of emergency, which was initially imposed for 90 days, still applies until October, in fact, this has almost no impact on the lives of most Turks.</seg>
<seg id="14">The night "democracy guards" in public places across the country declared Erdogan to be finished on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="15">The sport - like the whole country - is divided into followers and opponents of Erdogan.</seg>
<seg id="16">Especially fans of the Besiktas working-class club are traditionally not among the president's friends.</seg>
<seg id="17">What unites the bulk of the Turks, however, in the face of dramatic experiences in history, is the strict rejection of military coups.</seg>
<seg id="18">Even the fans themselves agree - no matter whether their heart beats for Galatasaray or Besiktas.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the case of gala winner "Gala" there will be a special return to Lukas Podolski.</seg>
<seg id="20">His sporting value showed the Cologne in the past season: with 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions, the 31-year-old finished his first game time as his club's top scorer.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the final game against Fenerbahce, he scored the 1:0 victory.</seg>
<seg id="22">The newspaper "Fanatik" joked him: "he was the best in the place."</seg>
<seg id="23">He has completed the season in an excellent way and secured his team the trophy.</seg>
<seg id="24">Thanks to "Poldi," the disappointing season for the record champion found a conciliatory conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="25">After the pre-run-k.o in the Champions League, the "lions" also differ in the Europa League early.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the South Lig, it only ranged to rank six.</seg>
<seg id="27">The season was not good.</seg>
<seg id="28">The trophy was the only way to win something.</seg>
<seg id="29">"We did this and that is the most important thing," said Podolski.</seg>
<seg id="30">For Master Besiktas, the game year ran better.</seg>
<seg id="31">Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who, with 26 seasons, laid the base for the 14th title as a South League goalkeeper.</seg>
<seg id="32">That's also the reason fans continue to hope for the 31 -year-old's return.</seg>
<seg id="33">At the same time, the Gomez, who was under the auspices of the AC Florence, and which was only borrowed at Besiktas, had announced that he would not return because of the political situation in the country after his EM holiday.</seg>
<seg id="34">"If Mario wants to come to us, he only has to say it," said the magazine "Kicker" club chief Fikret Orman.</seg>
<seg id="35">In order to do this, however, the storm would have to be prepared to renounce around a third of its annual salary estimated at €7.5 million, and Orman made it clear: "we cannot pay his salary at Florence."</seg>

<seg id="10">Here's an overview:</seg>
<seg id="11">Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4 x100-m-Staffel / USA): the 34-year-old is among the most controversial figures in athletics.</seg>
<seg id="12">He was already locked twice because of doping (2001 and 2006 to 2010).</seg>

<seg id="2">The Austrian embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, the State Department spokesman, Thomas Schnöll, said Friday morning.</seg>
<seg id="3">She had suffered cut wounds and had been treated in hospital but has already been able to leave this one again.</seg>
<seg id="4">Her home trip was scheduled for early September.</seg>
<seg id="5">Whether from the further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket, as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon, also Austrian citizens are still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities in this regard, according to Schnöll.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the roughly 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok, Hua Hin was first seen exploding two bombs on Thursday night in a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to police, a Thai change was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrians, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.</seg>
<seg id="9">Friday morning, two explosives went up again, and another man was killed, according to the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="10">A bomb explosion was also reported by Phuket in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="11">A taxi driver was injured in the detonation near the beach resort of Patong, which was popular with holidaymakers.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Surat Thani on the country's south-east coast, another bomb then exploded that killed an urban employee.</seg>
<seg id="13">The explosive rate has gone into the air, according to authorities in a flower beet in front of the coastal police force.</seg>
<seg id="14">Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwest coast, as well as in Chumphon on the south-east coast, called for several injured.</seg>
<seg id="15">One goes from a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it said.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The bomb attacks carry the same handwriting," said Armeegeneral Danai Kritmethavee Friday morning before journalists.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We assume that this is a coordinated attack."</seg>
<seg id="18">It is too early to comment on possible motives, but it is probably the actions of Muslim rebels.</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country in the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, said that the attacks were not related to the Islamist insurgency or to international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"This is only local sabotage, which is limited to limited areas and provinces," a spokesman in Bangkok said.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rather, it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the past few days, the authorities have received intelligence indications of impending attacks in the south of the country - but they have not been informed about the exact date and the places.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">Police dismissed their officials across the country to step up security around important government buildings, as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and amusement districts.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Thailand, there are always smaller bombings, but they are mostly not directed against tourists.</seg>

<seg id="1">The right-wing "identitarian movement" has been targeted by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection.</seg>
<seg id="2">According to several national offices, the constitutional protectors in the federal government have also put the group under observation.</seg>
<seg id="3">"We see in the" Identitarian Movement "evidence of aspirations against the liberal democratic basic order," said constitutional chief Hans-Georg Maaßen of the German Press Agency in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="4">In this way, immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are being defamed in an extremist manner.</seg>
<seg id="5">That is why we are now watching the movement.</seg>
<seg id="6">The "identitarian movement" is a grouping with French roots, which has been active in Germany since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is opposed to "multicultural madness," "uncontrolled mass immigration" and the "loss of its own identity by foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="8">Constitutional protesters in nine federal states - Bremen, Bayern, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - are already watching the "identitaries."</seg>
<seg id="9">Maaßen said his authority had voted closely with the national offices in the decision.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Groups like the" Identity Movement "are trying to pick up their target group where it stands," said the constitutional chief.</seg>
<seg id="11">In general, extremists try to address them with youthful language, often with poppy music.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Islamists as well as right-wing extremists.</seg>
<seg id="13">This is not a beguiling advertisement for one's own cause.</seg>
<seg id="14">Propaganda is supposed to address people emotionally.</seg>
<seg id="15">Young people are particularly vulnerable.</seg>
<seg id="16">That is dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="17">Most recently, there had been reports from several federal states about contacts of the "identitarian" to AfD politicians.</seg>
<seg id="18">Maaßen said he did not have any findings to do so.</seg>
<seg id="19">For constitutional protection, possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point of view.</seg>
<seg id="20">What matters is whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - will change its direction and become so extremist by certain people who are extremist.</seg>
<seg id="21">What is crucial, then, is whether such individuals have a steady influence on the party.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is unrecognisable.</seg>
<seg id="23">Looking at the significant increase in right-wing offences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelters, Maaßen said he would not yet speak of new right-wing terrorism in this context.</seg>
<seg id="24">But we have noticed in recent years that there can be right-wing structures.</seg>
<seg id="25">There was the group "Old School Society" or the Freital Group.</seg>
<seg id="26">It may well be that other right-wing groups or micro-groups are forming that plan attacks against asylum-seekers, refugee homes or attacks from other far-right motives.</seg>
<seg id="27">However, a German-wide or Europe-wide control of legal terrorism is not recognisable.</seg>
<seg id="28">The previous groups were created at the regional level or in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="29">Worried about the fact that many assaults went to the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right scene.</seg>
<seg id="30">That is the cause of concern.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum shelters had not previously been known as criminals, politically motivated criminals or supporters of the right scene.</seg>
<seg id="32">"So many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists, who may have been politically indifferent, or who, for example, chose CDU, SPD or Left, but who then radicalised themselves by right-wing extremist mood."</seg>

<seg id="1">Rio 2016: ROBEL Kiros Habte becomes an internethit</seg>
<seg id="2">Not always the Olympics or world records determine the headlines at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows the brave appearance of Robel Kiros Habte at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">At the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that at times he was no longer seen in the TV images.</seg>
<seg id="5">He simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut was selected.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the social networks, he subsequently became the viral internethit.</seg>
<seg id="7">In fact, the 24-year-old finished his forehand with a backlog of 48 seconds and ranked 59th place of 59 starters.</seg>
<seg id="8">It was, however, his not exactly sporting figure that attracted the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why the 24-year-old nevertheless takes part in the Olympics?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian got a special start from the international swimming association.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming in under-represented countries more familiar.</seg>
<seg id="12">As most athletes run in Ethopia, they just wanted to do something different.</seg>
<seg id="13">Preparation is all: ROBEL Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.</seg>
<seg id="14">Quickly, the first nicknames made the round.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some media described him as "ROBEL of the Wal."</seg>
<seg id="16">The English tabloid "the Sun" with "dad Bod" made it funny.</seg>
<seg id="17">His time, he only struck with a minute and nearly five seconds over the 100 metre freestyle, played no role there.</seg>
<seg id="18">Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">At the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, the run of Eric Moussambani provided media attention.</seg>
<seg id="20">Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea when he had to go on his own in a forehand over 100 metres of free style.</seg>
<seg id="21">Frenetically, Moussambani was fired at the time.</seg>
<seg id="22">The then 22-year-old only learned to swim eight months before Olympia and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.</seg>

<seg id="2">The consumer research company GfK exchanged its boss Matthias Hartmann.</seg>
<seg id="3">The resignations suddenly came - but not entirely surprising.</seg>
<seg id="4">The difficult situation of the market research firm GfK was that the chair of chief executive Matthias Hartmann becomes all the more uncertain the longer the successes he promised.</seg>
<seg id="5">Turbulence at the top of the Nuremberg market research company GfK: after again disappointing business figures and the resignation of corporate governance, the global number five of the industry is facing a new beginning.</seg>
<seg id="6">GfK board boss wants to leave the company at the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board, Arno Mahlert, is already leaving the supervisory board with effect from 12 September.</seg>
<seg id="8">The leadership on the board is already taking over the previous board member Gerhard Hausruckinger as of September 1, the company announced.</seg>
<seg id="9">He is expected to officially take over the function of a "board spokesman" until a successor to Hartmann is found.</seg>
<seg id="10">As a reason for the resignations, the company called "different views" on the long-term business orientation.</seg>
<seg id="11">Details did not want to name a company spokesman on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="12">Anyone who will be the market research company in the future is still unclear at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="13">In investor circles, it was said on Friday that the shareholder was most recently disappointed with the continued successes of the restructuring that took place years ago.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr Hartmann has been at the GfK top since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="15">"The fruits of the restructuring have not yet been seen after 5 years," it said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Given the last bad GfK business figures, any shareholder will eventually become troubled.</seg>
<seg id="17">"If this were the case with BMW, that would also make the quandaries so," it said.</seg>
<seg id="18">The company had not been able to stop its loss journey in the second quarter of 2016 after setbacks in the prior quarter.</seg>
<seg id="19">With 361.2 million€, sales were up 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable prior-year quarter.</seg>
<seg id="20">Related to the first half of the year, sales shrank by 3.4 percent at 721.2 million€.</seg>
<seg id="21">The profit in the second quarter, in particular, has burdened the company's sunken value in the face of its difficult economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company's depreciation of €139 million, which was necessary in the Consumer Experience Division, gave the Group a loss of €148.2 million.</seg>

<seg id="1">The charges per cubic metre of waste water are from 1 October 2016 for the area of the waste water plant Neudorf / Reuth / Welschenkahl 3.44 instead of €2.10; for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp €3.36 (so far €2.26) and for Azendorf €3.64 (so far €2.18).</seg>
<seg id="2">At the plant in Azendorf, the wastewater fee will be increased again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are required.</seg>
<seg id="3">After an excess calculation, the sewage price in Azendorf will be €4.37 per cubic meter.</seg>
<seg id="4">As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, during the approval of the budget by the Countess of Kulmbach, it was found that undercover for these sewage plants was underway.</seg>
<seg id="5">As a result of legal bases, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the facilities in a cost-effective manner.</seg>
<seg id="6">From 1 October 2016, the citizens, as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg, will have to go deeper into the purse.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Managing Director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the body, a new calculation of the fees for the sewage systems of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, it is also possible to compensate for over- or undercover discoveries from the previous calculation period.</seg>
<seg id="10">The serious increase in fees justified Schmidt with the fact that all three wastewater facilities are relatively small, with a very low sewage, which is between 6800 and 12,000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, due to the low distribution base, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand€ would have a serious impact.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the volume of wastewater in all three plants is slightly decreasing.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, in the last calculation period, all three plants have been significantly reduced, not least because of their ageing and repair costs.</seg>
<seg id="14">The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the facilities for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt pointed out that in the Azendorf wastewater plant the mechanical ventilation plant had to be exchanged due to a damage.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the Pumpwerk Welschenkahl, the nearly 20-year-old conveyor plants had to be overhauled from scratch and at the Lopp pond plant, after nearly 20 years of operation, the first sewage pond had to be excavated, sewage sludge had to be disposed of and an additional ventilation facility had to be installed in order to continue to comply with the water requirements.</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: "to these extraordinary expenses came the continuing care and maintenance costs to be taken into account in the new calculation period."</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which were still well below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011/2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made it clear that, in the small waste water in the three plants, the expenses for the operation and maintenance are "full."</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, Schmidt added, the market community has been spared major entertainment costs in sewage plants over the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="21">The situation for the aforementioned plants will, in the view of stone houses, continue to remain precarious in the long term, especially as the supply area of the Friesenbachtal wastewater will not be extended to include these facilities, because these are deficient facilities.</seg>

<seg id="1">Snapchat "Anime" effect criticised as Asian cartoon</seg>
<seg id="2">Snapchat says this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to breeds.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filter tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that already borders on the absurd.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are blunt, stand-alone tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All mistakes are made to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have attracted criticism in the past, in which they were accused that the app would propel blackface or white skin as a beauty deal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When, this week, some users suggested a filter that gave them slashes, false teeth and woven cheeks, some critics called a racist caricature of Asians - "yellow face."</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered whether these repeated controversies pointed to a bigger problem that the company has with diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and outrage were widely shared on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced it would have deactivated the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was thought to be a tribute to anime characters rather than as a caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced racism reminded the filter of offending clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others strongly rejected the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about the photos became widespread, wrote that the filter was "offensive and, to say the least, uncomfortable."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the counter-rendition of a very disgusting Asian caricature and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellow, but that the yellow face has been dragged into the devalued extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stumbling wire.</seg>
<seg id="18">American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchat's big audience of young people - who are in terms of race different than their older counterparts - might be more likely to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">If one of Snapchat's filters creates an image that is offensive to an user, "so it's much harder that such things remain unnoticed than it used to be," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for Medium, decided to extinguish her Snapchat account urged others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an upset for medium and in a phone interview, she said that she believes racial controversies reflect a lack of diversity in recruitment practices at Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticized the largely white, only male leadership and finished her upset with a hashtag:\ HASH DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Either they have no representation of people with other skin colours in their workforce, so they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colours who work there but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say what."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely left unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its staff, but according to a spokesman, the company recently recruited a staff member focused on under-represented populations and on internal integration efforts.</seg>
<seg id="28">For her part, Zhu said that she will leave her Snapchat account closed and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to be able to say that this is not O.K."</seg>

<seg id="1">Military leadership distorts ISIS intelligence information, notes congressional committee</seg>
<seg id="2">Military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than it would have allowed actual conditions on the ground, a congressional committee of inquiry reported in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The provisional report, created by a Task Force of Republican members of the Armed Forces Committee, Secret Service Commitees and the WehrBudget Command, reports of major discontent among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how prescriptions changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Intelligence information, typically sent off by high-level Centcom commanders, regularly featured a more positive image of American efforts against terrorism than it would have allowed the actual conditions on the ground, and were consistently more positive than analysis of other intelligence services," a newspaper article quoted the report as saying.</seg>
<seg id="6">"What happened at the Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives.</seg>
<seg id="7">The leadership flaws in the Centcom range to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten -page report shows detailed problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although it does not provide direct indications that government spikes under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts faced pressure from their pre-laws to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, opinions and statements in front of Congress were much more positive than the facts," the report noted.</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a Centcom associate publicly announced that a military recapture of Mossuls could start as early as April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mossul, Iraq's second largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"After months of investigation, it is so much clear," said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, Central Command's peaks changed intelligence reports to downplay the danger posed by ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">Republicans called the task force into life after they were told that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report, published on Thursday, will still be completed by more detailed findings while the investigation continues.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigation by the Centcom reports is under way by the Department of Defense's inspector general.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the intelligence committee released their own findings on Thursday, coinciding with some of the Republican task force's conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="19">"In 2014 and 2015, the Centcom created an overly limited process for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," the highest-ranking Democrat in the Committees, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, announced in an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="20">This process, according to Mr. Schiff, "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," damaged the morality among analysts and "gave excessively little room for divergent opinions."</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said not to have found any evidence of a White House intervention at the Centcom analysts about a "certain political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the congressional investigation were published on Tuesday by "the Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon's inspector general, which were recorded following complaints from Centcom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon press secretary, admitted in an opinion that the Department of Defense would not comment on any reports from Congress, while the inspector general's investigation was still under way.</seg>
<seg id="25">But he also admitted that "experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions about the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense."</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigation has repercussions beyond the issue of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim that is now being made by a growing number of defense ministry members).</seg>
<seg id="27">Last year's accusations, however, raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">Criticizing the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of constraints from more than ten years ago, when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, drafted a document on how the then government under George W. Bush, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, foresaw only a small occupying force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current coverage of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team around Mr. Hooker, according to government offices, notes that, contrary to the government's statements, airstrikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would not have a significant impact on the terrorist group's financial position, as these provisional refineries would have been commissioned to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, this finding was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcoms then commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="1">The U.S. wins fourth match in women's field hockey, a showdown with Britain faces</seg>
<seg id="2">A day after she shot three goals during a 6 - 1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the women's American field hockey team in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 - 0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five goals in two games should actually be a memorable achievement, but Bam (27) said she could not remember having ever done that.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea," she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I'm not one of those people who keep their gates in mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, she knows this: the Americans are in the Olympic competition at 4 - 0 and are in their group with the British in the first place, who remain unbeaten after their 2 - 0 victory against Japan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet in the last game of the first round on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which of the two within their group from six teams will each gain first and second place.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first-place finish will be a little longer out of the way that the other group cites.</seg>
<seg id="10">Whatever the game may be on Saturday, Americans have sparked a surprising hurricane through their success story, four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 places.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of that team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey sleeper in hands (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), with 16 years she became a national player of the United States, the youngest in the team's history.</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympics in 2008 as she couldn't qualify for the cadre.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012, in which everything went wrong for her and her team.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, became a coach of the national team, and so things began to turn to better.</seg>
<seg id="16">"A change of culture, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.</seg>
<seg id="17">We didn't have the workload in London that we have now.</seg>
<seg id="18">We've been able to rip the helm completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday night, Bam opened the goalkeeper in the first half of the game with a retreat from the close range.</seg>
<seg id="20">India had gone into the game without a victory in the tournament, but the team were surprisingly tough and held the game stand from 1 - 0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and lugged the ball into the gate to give American women a 2 - 0 lead.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the United States goalkeeper, Jackie Briggs, who so far had to have a gate in each of the previous games.</seg>
<seg id="24">She has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"We're in a good position" said Parnham, but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amid the Rage of the Olympics, the Zen of the Trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, however late it is, it is the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel steady and inescapable, a rushing squeeze between competition and quest.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning stove, which is passed from the bracelet to the swimmer to the turner to the triathlete.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour's conversation in the queue at the Coffeshop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there's Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is here for the first time at the Olympics and a women's swarm with greens, could well have been among those familiar names sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising if he were a swimmer, turner or even a fan.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting gold in the Olympic trampoline turf.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event the same.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, partly in the shadows are the sports that are not universally recognised: air gun shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast swim and may it prevail for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I should modestly make arguments for my particular favourite, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline rush has already been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it was perceived so sparingly the last 16 years that many the, I had interviewed, did not know it was an Olympic sport at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the U.S. sent athletes to compete, it has never won a medal in the trampoline rush and has had an athlete by 2012 who has managed it to the end.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians who share for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline rush has a certain outsider charm, in part because it sounds more fitting for the unenlightened ear for a clownish school than that for the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert but just an earnest enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartoonish trembling of its never-ending impact - but also the grace of the turf and diving, the two sports that essentially unite it.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El Trampolin, which means as much as "springboard."</seg>
<seg id="22">Rising sieges jump on a gigantic trampoline, shooting almost up to 30 feet into the air and having to take a series of falling movements (turning, hitting and saltos) before landing on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">They are assessed according to the official Olympic program after execution, difficulty level and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Twenty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medal hopefuls must go further, faster, up and down in their quest for gold, sometimes up to the goal, sometimes back and forth, up and down in the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">Not only are they hunting the finishing line or the starting wall, but also in television broadcasting another heightened goal: that of the world or of the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="28">The purposeful pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical - and it's enough to even stir a spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I feel as something tiring even when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">Of this, the trampoline offers a breathing space.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline controller is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she collides, seemingly heavy-handed like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">Here, too, there is competition, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It's as Zen as the competition at the Olympics can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The women's qualifying and final will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming around 13,00 Eastern Time; that of men on Saturday, also at 13,00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will broadcast the final hours as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14,00.</seg>
<seg id="38">Amid the Olympic mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in the general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in awareness can only be achieved by the anxiety and objectification of male athletes - as the male U.S. Turner suggested recently, according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr Dooley expects his new fan community to be rushed to air.</seg>

<seg id="1">"A generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the US</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Protesters demanding political change in Ethiopia encountered violent resistance from the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that tens of protesters were killed during clashes with police during shot changes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just collapsing?</seg>
<seg id="6">Over the past decade, it has been one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months, protests against the government rocked the country and expanded into more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week, thousands of people rushed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government's response was relentless, according to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses said that police officers shot and killed on tens of unarmed protesters.</seg>
<seg id="11">Videos in circulation about the protests that are probably from the last or the beginning of this year show how security people beat young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the U.N. Human Rights Authority is now demanding an in-depth investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"It has always been difficult to hold this country together and it will become even more difficult in the future," said Rashid Abdi, the Project Leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence agencies are working closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats beyond the region, especially in Somalia, and only a few countries in Africa, if any, receive so much Western aid.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even though Ethiopia was far from a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually cited oppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, with dissidents effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or in prison, killed or driven into the wits of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"If you suppress people and they have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protest.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints covering everything from land use to stranglehold in terms of power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a largely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions along the border with Eritrea are rising; a battle for this zealous, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts worry that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden's National Liberation Front, which have been more or less beaten in recent years, could exploit the turmoil and arm themselves again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness are now exploding after years of precipitation under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years have a very large number of Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones became increasingly common and Internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, which it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies that hide where they are staying.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians said they gathered to protest.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethopia's predominantly Christian highlands, prospered in politics and economics, while exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and living in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But that, too, is changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"We are in the process of coordinating under an umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, which accounts for around 6 percent of the population, and who are dominant in the military, in the intelligence services, in trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years until his death in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think of corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly keen to perceive early signs of discontent and use special envoys to edit opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"The current regime lacks this fundamental skill," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst.</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected for relatively opaque reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say he doesn't enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many worry that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time Ethiopia experienced such an uproar was in 2005, after thousands protested against elections, which, according to analytics, were seemingly catered for by the government and subsequently stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the subsequent raids, many protesters were killed, even if it was less than in recent months and this period of unrest went over relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in the fight against poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the Ethiopian government's internal misgivings.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, protesters in Gondar, an amharic city, attacked by Tigray and the hatred towards the Tigray is becoming increasingly common on social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say the protests put the U.S. and other Western allies in a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as a base for droning flights over neighboring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it has closed that base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile area.</seg>
<seg id="59">"This," Mr Abdi said, "is a very thin grate."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his claim Obama had established ISIS had been "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy on Friday that surrounds his campaign by indicating that his repeatedly repeated claim that President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the "founder" of the Islamic State terror group had not been serious.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate's communication skills, whether he was able to communicate clearly and comprehensively with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings his co-workers, who are trying to protect him during an eventful period, into the peculiar position of having to explain statements that he might not have meant at all.</seg>
<seg id="5">After making the suggestion at a campaign event on Wednesday night, Mr. Trump resigned in relation to the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that the president and Mrs. Clinton would have created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was the opposite to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews he meant the accusation was completely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When conservative radio presenter Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump mitigate the statement somewhat by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know anything about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism prone to Mr. Trump while trying to steer the focus of his campaign on the economic situation because of falling polls.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to the issue again.</seg>
<seg id="12">Speaking on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he had found her speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already put forward sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July, he drew strong criticism when he said that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but he later declared "of course I meant the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to shift the linguistic boundaries in politics and then rub back as needed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive, and then, if necessary," clarify "depending on how the reaction is out." Said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who watches the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">I also believe, however, that he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more predictable tone, as his poll values have continued to decline.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new poll by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, released on Friday, showed a lead with big lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is generally trying not to apologise for his provocative remarks, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he is stepping up the focus of attention in the final months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's jokes have put his loyal co-workers in the uncomfortable situation of having to stand up to him, regardless of how provocative his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent advocates, gave himself great trouble to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments" said Mr. Giuliani he was questioned about the accuracy of Mr. Trump's statements, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backbenchers, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he pulled off the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread by refraining from aggressively bringing the situation in the Middle East under control.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of getting around on each of his words and being biased against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">He mocked the "poor, jolly" television experts who try to understand him and said, "you can't!."</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the Democrats spotted Mr. Trump's apology as just another proof that he was unfit for the presidency.</seg>

<seg id="1">Once squeezed over the price from the market, café comes back in Greenpoint</seg>
<seg id="2">Verb Cafe was a shameful café in Williamsburg, where you could only pay cash, which had no Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="3">Of course, prices were squeezed out of his Bedford Avenue shop front.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Soap Cherie business, which replaced verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Locals charged it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.</seg>
<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea hotel gutted and verb is now a soap business."</seg>
<seg id="7">But if New York is change, it is also reinvention.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revived verb cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the old cafe, who is the owner and managing director of the new cafe.</seg>
<seg id="12">He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a customer offered him to provide funds for a new outpost, he was excited to do it, he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rodriguez, 36, maintained a lot of things.</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment as well.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garments like capers and sucked onions.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are natural treasures.</seg>
<seg id="21">The café no longer serves beer, there are fresh juices for it.</seg>
<seg id="22">After nine months, Rodriguez said he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Many old customers were also displaced by prices from Williamsburg," he said.</seg>
<seg id="24">Recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.</seg>
<seg id="25">Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after she had moved to Greenpoint, she would take the path on her own.</seg>
<seg id="27">After the verb had closed, she gave up the coffee drinking for a while, she said.</seg>
<seg id="28">"It became clear to me that it was the coffee and the culture in the verb that liked me," she said.</seg>
<seg id="29">Now she is drinking coffee again, even if she ordered a blended Chai Tea on that day instead of her usual Iced Coffee, which is another new addition.</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Rosenthal has been another long-time and loyal customer since the start of the verb in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="31">He went there before work and invariably always ordered Dassel.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I came after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket clock and they prepare my Everything-Bagel with butter," he said.</seg>
<seg id="33">Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and include new ingredients in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="34">Today, Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his Everything-Bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.</seg>
<seg id="35">Rodriguez said that he hadn't been hungry about the soap business taking the old business space.</seg>
<seg id="36">In fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered to produce a special soap for verb with the cafe's cold-blown coffee as an ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="37">"I think we're still going to go on their offer," Rodriguez said.</seg>
<seg id="38">And the traditional Polish inhabitants of Greenpoints have also accepted the café.</seg>
<seg id="39">A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said he prefers to exhibit them soon, so his new neighbours feel welcome.</seg>
<seg id="40">The location also has other benefits.</seg>
<seg id="41">A local juice locale would like to fill and sell the cold-blowed coffee into the bottle.</seg>
<seg id="42">There is a chance that the café will expand to a neighbouring building.</seg>
<seg id="43">For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favourites.</seg>
<seg id="44">Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said that he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed.</seg>
<seg id="45">When the new cafe opened, Whitt said that entering the venue and ordering a new coffee felt like a home return.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I had to smell that," he said.</seg>

<seg id="3">As a gourmet, President Roosevelt had a Faible for refined delicacies of Fifth Avenue such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup.</seg>
<seg id="4">His menu that day was slightly more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, potato purple and as dessert a plum pudding.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.</seg>
<seg id="6">Her husband Andrew Coe added, "it was also a message to Americans how they should eat."</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">Coes' last book, "Chop Suey," handled from Chinese cuisine in the US, while Ziegelman was told in her book "97 Orchard" about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side from the food perspective.</seg>
<seg id="9">Her latest collaboration, "a decent meal," which will appear at Harper Verlag on Tuesday, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="10">They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at the Eisenberg's Sandwich shop for dinner, a small, snarling snack in the Flatiron District, which has already been in store since the 1929 stock market crash.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive groves, while Coe, 57, had Truthahn with potato purple and vegetable mixture.</seg>
<seg id="12">When the reporter ordered hackbrats, this found the pair fit for a discussion about eating in the era of the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Rich foods were very popular," said Ziegelman.</seg>
<seg id="14">There was earth bread, liver cheese and bean bread.</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and something billionaire that stretches the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine eating so many Earth nuts that they serve them as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">Coe grinned.</seg>
<seg id="18">"It must have been in the stomach like lead," he said.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the years before the Great Depression, the table was an all-you-can-eat buffet in an American household, especially in rural areas.</seg>
<seg id="20">Teams of women cooked for male field workers and it was served freshly baked pasta for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</seg>
<seg id="21">It was the Americans who, during the first world war, sent food to starving Europeans. "A Square Meal" sets out the ways in which the country could no longer be the country of origin.</seg>
<seg id="22">"It was a time when food was a central, tense issue for Americans," Coe said, why he and his wife wanted to write about it.</seg>
<seg id="23">Just as tense was the new budget diet: mysterious dishes such as bread and casserole became basic foods, the casserole as a "wonderful way of restoring eating remains," noted bricks, as chefs were able to hide unappetising ingredients under a creamy sauce.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meat, which was the centrepiece of American cuisine for years, became a rarely served luxury.</seg>
<seg id="26">Peculiar mixtures were tried, as a calorific and nutritious satisfaction took precedence over taste or even healthy kitchen mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">During their search for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from this epoch, baked onions with earth nut butter.</seg>
<seg id="28">"It was not a popular addition at lunch," says Coe.</seg>
<seg id="29">Brick man continues: "it was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Nut butter and baked onions do not match each other.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the house economic recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">As never before, or ever since, household economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 - 1943 - have been doing the country's eating habits.</seg>
<seg id="33">By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "household politicians" and meet the challenge of turning pamps like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.</seg>
<seg id="34">"A Square Meal" is a celebration of historical delicacies.</seg>
<seg id="35">In particular, the reports of the government's response to the starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoovers' Lass-Mich-Kuchen-Essen-attire, are very palatable.</seg>
<seg id="36">While publicly praising the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen, he feeds like the millionaire man of world to which he has become.</seg>
<seg id="37">"He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," said Coe.</seg>
<seg id="38">He was in an almost gold-plated dining room and was wearing a smoke.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was gloriously alien to reality.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not asked him to set an example with his stomach.</seg>
<seg id="41">As described in the book, the arrival of a householder with no interest in flavours by Mrs Roosevelt meant that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most dismal. "</seg>
<seg id="42">Many of the species from the era of the Great Depression to deal with food was discarded once the country came back on its feet.</seg>
<seg id="43">The legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food, Ziegelman said, as well as how science was applied to food.</seg>
<seg id="44">The pair gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother-in-law when writing the book - for example, how she couldn't throw food away.</seg>
<seg id="45">"She had a real fear of wasting food," said Coe.</seg>
<seg id="46">Ziegelman remembered: "she actually made people sick."</seg>
<seg id="47">There was the windbag incident.</seg>
<seg id="48">After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, they and Coe drew a dessert that they had prepared at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt had at lunchtime.</seg>
<seg id="49">"It is called Prune Whip," said Ziegelman, adding that it was a common trick to miss modest recipes a chic name.</seg>
<seg id="50">There was no bearded cream, just plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.</seg>
<seg id="51">Each one appeared somewhat reluctant a spoon in the tough, brown Glibber.</seg>
<seg id="52">Amazingly, it didn't taste bad.</seg>
<seg id="53">Coe picked up a surcharge three times.</seg>
<seg id="54">Like a Can-Do budgeter, he said to his wife, "a few hacked walnuts would help."</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland hai: the oldest vertebrae is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland sharks mostly come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation aboard the Sanna research vessel.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swims with well a 1 km/h through the North Atlantic - to this day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland sharks only get offspring at 150 years old.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Greenland halfway through the North Atlantic Ocean, in a hour's time, is an average of just 1,220 metres.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it arrives, the five -metre long animal accelerates to sat 2.6 km/h - and is half as fast as a seal with this maximum speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">This slow lifestyle, however, seems to be a patent recipe for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "science" at any rate from a Greenland hai that could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Madness," commented Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this lifespan, which means a world record for vertebrae.</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolutionary biologist has long suspected that Greenland sharks are being stoned.</seg>
<seg id="13">Just lacked the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland sharks are hard to watch, after all, they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their tempo of time, when they took out six animals with a broadcaster in front of Spitsbergen.</seg>
<seg id="18">Prey still make this sharks: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">They may be hunting sleeping animals or patrolling at the bottom of the ice sea and looking for cadavers that torch down from higher water layers.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now investigated 28 Greenland sharks, which picked up fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Spitsbergen as a by-catch from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long, while the largest 502 centimetres measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens of the sharks with the carbon 14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens is created even before the birth of the sharks, and the proteins contained therein will no longer be renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had striking a lot of carbon 14 in the lens.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960 "s, when nuclear weapons experimented with larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">On the other hand, in the 220 -centimetre length of the third smallest animal, the lens contained a small surplus of carbon 14 from the nuclear weapons tests, so it was likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in its 2012 investigation.</seg>
<seg id="27">All larger Greenland sharks, however, had normal carbon 14 quantities in their lens, resulting in cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">Indeed, the carbon 14 -clock for a 493 centimetre long Greenland hai showed an age of 335, while the record shark with 502 centimetres is expected to be even 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland hai females only get offspring when they are longer than four metres was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers of the length have been able to assign an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres was probably on the threshold of sexual maturity and his age was 156 years old, Greenland sharks, with the proliferation, can obviously be used for at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">This, too, is likely to be world record for vertebrae.</seg>
<seg id="33">The fact that such methane alems live mainly in icy waters is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">Even the previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale in whose bacon at the neck was stuck a 120-year-old harbor tip, was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on savings flame.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and ageing slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In addition, in order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are often particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume is growing much faster than its surface, by which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much larger than a gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: they have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"A smaller animal thus lives more dangerously and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as early as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.</seg>
<seg id="42">A very large animal, on the other hand, should invest its resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="1">Frankfurt benefits from Brexit</seg>
<seg id="2">The city on the Main, therefore, has the best chance of attracting jobs and companies relocated from London in the competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg.</seg>
<seg id="3">"It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit vote," says Michael Voigtländer, head of the IW's financial markets and real estate markets.</seg>
<seg id="4">After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether money houses may continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU.</seg>
<seg id="5">As far as the so-called EU passport is concerned, they have so far been admitted to the UK.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is just using big U.S. banks.</seg>
<seg id="7">Several banks have already announced that they will relocate jobs.</seg>
<seg id="8">The "Frankfurt Main Finance" lobby group expects 10,000 new jobs to be created within five years.</seg>
<seg id="9">For Frankfurt, the IW says, the headquarters of the European Central Bank (ECB), which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the eurozone's largest banks, as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Supervisory Authority, EIOPA and the ESRB risk council.</seg>
<seg id="10">In Paris, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has its headquarters, but it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Proximity to the central bank is important for banks, as they can communicate so directly with the oversight," says IMF Professor Voigtländer.</seg>
<seg id="12">Although Luxembourg has a large fund industry, it is doing worse than Dublin in terms of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport.</seg>
<seg id="14">The city also has easy access to commercial real estate.</seg>
<seg id="15">"In Paris it is not so easy to find free high-quality offices," says Voigtländer.</seg>
<seg id="16">At the Seine, rents for first-class commercial real estate are also 50% higher than on the Main.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure, as well as less crime.</seg>
<seg id="18">In a ranking of the company's consultancy Mercer, the city is ranked 19 th, Luxembourg ranked 33 th, Dublin in 37th place and Paris in th place.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if quality of life is a matter of preference: "with its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market, Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors," the IW concluded.</seg>
<seg id="20">London, however, will remain the most important financial center in Europe despite Brexit vote, the economic researchers say.</seg>
<seg id="21">For this, the balance of power also speaks: in London, according to figures from Landesbank Helaba, around 144,000 people worked in the banking sector at the end of 2015, in Frankfurt it was 62500.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes</seg>
<seg id="2">On Friday, Hillary Clinton released her tax return for 2015, which revealed for the Democrats "presidential candidate and her husband an income of USD 10.75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.</seg>
<seg id="3">In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million for charitable purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton generated nearly $5.3 million in speech honors; the former Secretary of State gave an income of $3 million from the publisher Simon & Schuster for her book about her tenure in the foreign ministry.</seg>
<seg id="4">Clinton's candidate for the vice presidency, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, along with his wife Anne Holton, is publishing his tax returns over the past decade.</seg>
<seg id="5">They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency," Clinton's campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri announced in an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a stark contrast, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and retreats in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is common for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, although they are not obliged to do so by law.</seg>
<seg id="9">Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have indicated a tax audit by tax authorities as a reason for his refusal.</seg>
<seg id="10">"They are on the train," Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams wrote on Twitter, referring to the release of the Democrats "presidential candidate.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's special adviser, said to CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish anything before the tax exams are not completed.</seg>
<seg id="12">Trump's critics, including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, have already made it clear that his refusal raises questions about wealth, his donations for charitable organizations, his business conduct, and various other connections, particularly with Russia.</seg>
<seg id="13">Clinton has already rushed to the issue and released a video on the internet on Friday in which high-ranking Republican Trump is calling for his tax return to be published.</seg>
<seg id="14">On Thursday, she also addressed the issue during a speech on the economy in Michigan.</seg>
<seg id="15">"He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax returns." She said to the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="16">Politico has reported that Trump paid no or very little tax during the 1990 s for two years, and a New York Times economic journalist quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advisers on Friday saying that that could still be the case.</seg>
<seg id="17">Federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="18">Clinton supports a scheme named after the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, who would make sure people pay the more than USD 1 million a tax rate of at least 30%.</seg>
<seg id="19">President Obama also supports the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="20">During a campaign event for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate here has his seat, called for Trump to a meeting to exchange their tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="21">Buffett said he had also undergone a tax review of the IRS and Trump had "fear" in front of voters and not in front of the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="22">Clinton's campaign has released tax returns back to 2007.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Clintons, now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid an effective federal tax rate of about 32% between the years 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Clintons "tax return of 2015 showed that these only amounted to USD 100 of their income as a wage, unlike most of the Americans.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their main asset was a low-cost index fund, from which Clinton's dividends and earnings of USD 109,000 were taxed.</seg>

<seg id="2">Naturalists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to stop elephants from going in man-made settlements - they throw condoms on them filled with chilipuders.</seg>
<seg id="3">The method has proved effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which already had the idea to do so years ago, has stepped up its promotion, along with U.S. nature conservation, by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four -step method to protect their homes and harvests without hurting animals.</seg>

<seg id="6">"Since we developed this... Toolkit, we have been able to observe a change in their attitudes within these communities, and they are much more confident that they can hold the elephants off their fields without hurting the elephant," the CEO of Honeyguide Damian Bell said in a communication.</seg>
<seg id="7">The first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a torch and the blaze into a horn.</seg>
<seg id="8">If he is not deterred, a so-called "chili cloud" is thrown.</seg>
<seg id="9">Chilipuder mixed with earth is packed together with a fireworks body into a condom, the end of which is turned up to the ignition.</seg>
<seg id="10">When it is ignited, the condom bursts with a bang and sprays fine dust to chilipuder into the air.</seg>
<seg id="11">A hint quite usually already already out to jail the elephant.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media uproar after he had betrayed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli preselection as it had "requested" Arab guests, according to an employee.</seg>
<seg id="3">Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah" left his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.</seg>
<seg id="4">During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel's list of countries.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, the country was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.</seg>
<seg id="6">How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and deleted?</seg>
<seg id="7">Wrote Lanzmann.</seg>
<seg id="8">Instead, the Kempinksi Bristol offers a way to select Israel via its own call center.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to a statement, the director turned to the hotel reception.</seg>
<seg id="10">The answer he received there, "shocked him," as Lanzmann wrote.</seg>
<seg id="11">The hotel employee said that the measure was a "deliberate decision of the management of Kempinski hotels."</seg>
<seg id="12">The reason behind it was even more rage in the director.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the preselection be deleted," the Lanzmann employee was quoted as saying.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Israeli Ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great shame," the Süddeutsche Zeitung reports.</seg>
<seg id="15">We were appalled and dismayed by this event.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is really very shameful.</seg>
<seg id="17">The fact that this has taken place in Germany in this very hotel chain is even more disgraceful.</seg>
<seg id="18">This does not require any explanation.</seg>
<seg id="19">We expect the hotel to "draw the right conclusions," the official said.</seg>
<seg id="20">The incident triggered a pretty big resonance on the internet where people called the whole thing a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="21">Some subjected the Kempinski Hotel to the alleged demands of Arab guests.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Shame you," said another post stating that the hotel, located on the noble Kurfürstendamm, is close to a synagogue.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hotel quickly dismissed all the accusations of itself and called the incident a "provided" and "apologised" at Lanzmann, reports The Mirror.</seg>
<seg id="24">"There was never a direct instruction" not to include Israel in the fast-track list, "the Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman for the Kempinski Hotel.</seg>

<seg id="1">Trade between Russia & Iran suddenly rises to 71% - RT Business</seg>
<seg id="2">With the lifting of sanctions, according to the Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 percent year-on-year.</seg>
<seg id="3">Since international sanctions on Iran were lifted, interest on the part of Russian companies in shops in the country grew sharply, the ambassador said.</seg>
<seg id="4">Russian companies are taking up existing links with Iran, while new firms are willing to gain access to the market.</seg>
<seg id="5">Of course, further trade expansion is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran, "said Dzhagaryan.</seg>
<seg id="6">He noted that trading turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9% in the first five months of 2016 compared with the same period in 2015, and was $856 million.</seg>
<seg id="7">In particular, Russian imports into Iran rose by 91.5%, and $697 million.</seg>
<seg id="8">Russian imports from Iran increased by 16% to $158 million.</seg>
<seg id="9">The trade recovery has been achieved by supplies of machines, land vehicles and weapons, "the ambassador said.</seg>
<seg id="10">Dzhagaryan goes from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia for this year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Last year, Russian foreign representation issued about 35,000 visas, primarily rice evisas, to Iranian citizens.</seg>
<seg id="12">Moreover, Iran reached the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="13">You could say that record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia are being broken last year, "he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the same time, only relatively few Russians visit Iran, something the ambassador hopes will change.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, who have received monuments of ancient Persian civilisation in a good state," he said.</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministrants from the Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were travelling on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Together, four stages have been managed.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the time until the next romance of all the ministries in two years "time, the St. Anna Supreme Council has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various pilgrimage destinations were examined and the Bishop city of Freiburg was finally decided, where this year, during the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage destination was offered with the gate of mercy at the Freiburg Munster.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 minis from Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Heiligenzimmern were on the way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening before, pastor Storost sent the pilgrims out in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrimage crosses and issued the pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb, it was taken by train to the starting point of Villingen, where a Munster of Our Lady is also a woman and so the pilgrimage was joined by the Munster.</seg>
<seg id="9">The individual day tours have been surrounded by a short impulse in the morning and in the evening, with different prayers, songs and texts.</seg>
<seg id="10">But even on the way, the minis at field crosses, chapels or churches repeatedly made roast to sing together a song from specially assembled pilgrimage lyrics.</seg>
<seg id="11">For the overnight stays, the parish homes of the local parishes were available.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the stages, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty as well as strong dinner and breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the second day, we went through Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">Day after day, the stage to St. Peter, which was the most strenuous route, had to climb around 500 meters of altitude in the wake of a sluggish heat.</seg>
<seg id="15">The earned reward was a common barbecue at the Badweiher in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning impulse on the fourth pilgrimage day in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, it went to the final stage to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="17">Visibly relieved and happy, the Minis met at the Freiburg Münster later in the afternoon and passed through the gate of mercy.</seg>
<seg id="18">With a little impulse, God was thanked here.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the evening fair in the Münster, the minis arrived at the Pilgrim target were greeted by collaborator Markus Obert.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the service, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.</seg>
<seg id="21">The next day was still time for the Breisgaumetropole.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the afternoon it went back to Horb by train.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the end, all participants agreed that the days were marked by spirituality and a strong community experience.</seg>

<seg id="1">Scots Callum Skinner storms home when Briton erects gold for cycling</seg>
<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner raced last night in the men's team-sprint in the Velodrom in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role that his fellow countryman, Sir Chris Hoy, had embraced, making the legend proud when he stumbled home to win a victory from New Zealand's favourites.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy picked up the fifth of six Olympics medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they picked up only a modest sixth place in March at the rail world championships in London despite the resignation of Hoys.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver, Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did so in time as Hindes appeared.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoy's retirement produced a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man they stayed at when they saw potential in the Scot, which has now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - who sided with Hoy four years ago - and skinners set an Olympics record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds, the New Zealanders won in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hindes was barely back after his round, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made up a large part of the transformation, at which Hindes drove in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked from his position as a BBC expert and dropped skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they rose to the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">The 23-year-old skinner from Glasgow said: "it's a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make me a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up an Olympic record in the end and defeated the world champions.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the 2012 triumph at the Kenny and Hoys side, Hindes admitted that he deliberately fell on the railways after a weak start.</seg>
<seg id="21">He later withdrew that statement and there was no objection from England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such a surprising victory, this time there was no such problem.</seg>
<seg id="23">Hindes said: "it feels with all the GB flags in the gallery like London."</seg>
<seg id="24">We've come together as a team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We got away so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which has won seven of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress over the last five months, that expects us to be successful five days in the Velodrom.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form Kenny, it is in the area of the possible that he repeats Hoy's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a contest.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on 23 March (an apparently sacred date for British sport; on the day also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same as that of Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part next in the sprint, which starts today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I'm just enjoying this for the moment."</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels somewhat lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">Hindes said: "if he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knighthood."</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the day's only medal contest, but there was further good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four -four -kilometre race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at the goal in 3:51.942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was at 3:51.659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22,42) will take place today on the second day of the contest, where Wiggins will certainly be in focus.</seg>
<seg id="42">He had stepped in yesterday with Officers before qualifying when officials called for him to measure his body size.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the appropriate women's competition, which will continue and end tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4:13.260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team is relying on its strong rail team to dominate the middle period of the Olympics and pick up a shar of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly extraordinary portrayal of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio were downgraded.</seg>
<seg id="46">It played off dramas in the background, according to the resignation of technical head Shane Sutton in April amid sexism and mobbing allegations as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks as if the now legendary reputation of GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Future of Portland's meltdown due to lifting of energy</seg>
<seg id="2">The future of Portland's aluminium meltdown in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workers "jobs - are at stake, as the plant operator will terminate the energy supply contract, thereby lifting all supply contracts, as the delivering energy company announced.</seg>
<seg id="3">This move followed the government's decision in Victoria earlier this year not to award any further subsidies to operate the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy set for 20 years expires in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs at Alcoa's plant in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">No less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to domino effects, as the meltdown consumes about 10 percent of the total electricity generation Victorias consumed.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry Schmelzerei, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">Alcoa's meltdown in Portland is losing money and risking a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This move follows years of speculation about the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and, most recently, due to the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the large aluminum meltdown with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that it expects three other owners to cancel their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The plant is in the majority possession of a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity through the meltdown," the company said.</seg>
<seg id="14">AGL also said the contracts were so-called "back-up deals" that should have come into effect from November 2016.</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12-month notice period so they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Therefore AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenue in the 17 financial year," the electricity supplier said.</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impacts on revenue on AGL from GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL announced that it had already written off the value of the contracts in its $187 million annual report in "expectation of a termination."</seg>
<seg id="19">Alcoa said that the decision to book the contracts, the "ability of Alcoas... To operate the meltdown or to ensure the power supply to the meltdown" does not impair.</seg>
<seg id="20">The U.S. company said it had completed a 20 -year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which should have come into effect from November this year, even if it is still guilty of a statement as to why it resigned from the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn of the industry's poor economic conditions ahead of the possible closure of the Portland meltdown in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">In reference to the analysts "statements earlier this week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumed around 600 megawatts and Tomago about 900 megawatts of electricity each year.</seg>
<seg id="23">Should both plants disappear from the market, that would mean a significant reduction in demand in the [electricity market].</seg>
<seg id="24">And for us as electricity producers, that would not be good, "he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September edition of Vogue</seg>
<seg id="2">Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September edition of U.S. Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kendall, who is a brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran to Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">"In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to the wine," Kendall wrote.</seg>
<seg id="5">The cover's revelation followed a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians similar?), scripted reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (except the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn, as well as in the presence of the most popular showbiz uncle and producer of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as they forget the cover of their sister and that ends with a classic turn: they have all planned a surprise party.</seg>
<seg id="6">This represents the cliched action of almost every birthday episode of a child's broadcast (Seacrest brought the phrase, "you thought that we would have forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon canine on a transmitter at 8 in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity somehow.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September edition of Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians has certainly begun.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendall's big sister Kim may have beaten her as far as the Vogue-cover is concerned (she and her husband Kanye West were seen on it in April 2014), but the cover of the September edition of the magazine is a league for itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September edition is the most sold edition of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">With an amount that resembles an image band rather than a fashion magazine, the output attracts a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista was of the 832 pages of the roller 615 pages advertising).</seg>
<seg id="11">The revelation of his cover star is so eagerly awaited that in the past two years images of the magazine have been sickened even before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">In recent years, there have clearly been more "celebrities who are modeling" than "models, the celebrities are" on the cover.</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar winner and dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honor.</seg>
<seg id="15">But even with the low chance that Mrs Jenner - described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the previous category, she is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or youngsters of today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even if it's all on Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who are distinguished in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course, Jenner's success doesn't like everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With her reality TV story, Jenner's position in the fashion world was always somewhat tense.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June, the former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized them and called them "the mistes of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">Those feelings boiled again high when the news came out with the appearance of Jenner on the Vogue cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But the point seems to be on the point of displeasure.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">She is in the truest sense of the word a supermodel.</seg>
<seg id="26">She runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">It makes advertisements for your grunting of Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">She and all her sisters sell you pictures of yourself on their respective paywall-apps.</seg>
<seg id="29">She sells from her made pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to the journal LOVE.</seg>
<seg id="30">And in her spare time she is seen in Reality TV, probably only to see her sister Kourtney and her children.</seg>

<seg id="2">More than 160,000 of the country's aid figures are dismissed annually by the municipal centres, while the industry is looking at the impact of further cuts on already overburdened transactions.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly elderly people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who have no funds for unjust delusions and similar - are dismissed in their request for free legal advice and legal assistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Legal services of the community, which are already overly exploited, are ready for further cuts.</seg>
<seg id="5">From June next year, it is envisaged that these legal centres will lose another 30% of their federal funds.</seg>
<seg id="6">The director of community law centres of Queesland James Farrell said the last survey of the National Association of Community Law Centres revealed that thousands of people are already being dismissed every year.</seg>
<seg id="7">Farrell said the situation would only get worse without a repeal of the federal government's decision.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Queensland's municipal centres are chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people are dismissed from important services you need," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">People who leave violent relationships, people with unmanageable and crushing debt, families who go through separations, workers who have been unfairly sacked - all these people have problems of a legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need.</seg>
<seg id="10">The federal government will cut funds by 30 percent from June 2017, meaning thousands of more vulnerable people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help.</seg>
<seg id="11">We call on the General Public Prosecutor and Federal Justice Minister and Senators of Queensland George Brandis to lift these cuts immediately so that people can get the help they need in legal problems.</seg>
<seg id="12">Last year, the state government fulfilled its pledge to raise funds for legal aid to the national average.</seg>

<seg id="2">New York: Donald Trump's campaign has been charged with alleged inaction after it was announced that her campaign manager for North Carolina had directed a firearm on an employee in February while travelling in a jeep in February.</seg>
<seg id="3">The incident is described in an indictment filed on Wednesday in Charlotte's National Court by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in this state.</seg>
<seg id="4">Bordini admitted to having waited for months that the matter would be settled internally before he realised that "this would not happen."</seg>
<seg id="5">The campaign manager, Earl Philip, "drew a gun, put his right pointer on the deduction, and rammed the run in Vincents Kneekehle," Bordini admitted in his charge.</seg>
<seg id="6">After complaining at the local and regional campaign management, Bordini noted that at least four other people had already made the same experience with Phillip, he admitted in the indictment.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Weapons do not need to be fired to cause damage," Bordini said.</seg>
<seg id="8">The indictment comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate sparked an uproar when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the "second Amendment people" - firearms owners and gun enthusiasts - should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton is elected and appointed judges.</seg>
<seg id="9">Trump's campaign made it clear that the media had ripped his words out of context and that he would not incite violence.</seg>
<seg id="10">Bordinis' complaint requires damages from the campaign for the breach of due diligence and from Philip for injury and lasting mental damage.</seg>
<seg id="11">Trump's press secretary, Hope Hicks, was not to be reached for an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="12">Attempts to contact Philip also failed.</seg>
<seg id="13">WCCB, a local news channel in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer a member of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="14">On calls at his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, was not reacted.</seg>
<seg id="15">Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has run a controversial campaign so far.</seg>

<seg id="4">While the red-black government coalition in the north could barely continue to govern, this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="5">In both federal states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would have a good chance of continuing to put the head of government.</seg>
<seg id="6">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD plunged from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.</seg>
<seg id="7">The party, according to the survey, would only be just ahead of the CDU, which could come back to 23 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">The third place is controversial between the left and the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="9">The left would be 19 percent (previously 18.4 per cent), the AfD would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the country's day.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Greens are reluctant to return to the heavyweight Landtag, despite slight losses at 6 percent (previously 8.7 per cent).</seg>
<seg id="11">NPD and FDP would not be represented in the Landtag with 3 percent each.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the Berlin Chamber of Deputies, the SPD would only be 23% (election 2011:28.3%).</seg>
<seg id="13">The CDU only reached 18 percent after 23.4 percent.</seg>
<seg id="14">It would still be behind the Greens at 19 percent (2011:17.6 per cent), but before the left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 per cent).</seg>
<seg id="15">The AfD would be represented at 14% for the first time in the House of Deputies.</seg>
<seg id="16">With 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, but the pirates would miss the entry, as opposed to 2011.</seg>

<seg id="2">Email and Internet in slow motion: 20 years ago the Nokia Communicator came to the market.</seg>
<seg id="3">The successors today dominate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The device weighed nearly half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was thicker and bigger, so it was not good either.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was pretty kloy.</seg>
<seg id="7">The built-in memory initially averaged eight megabytes, which would today be enough for roughly two selfies with high resolution.</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" came to the shops exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996 - and it was the first smartphone.</seg>
<seg id="10">For a few€, lovers can still buy the devices on the internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age.</seg>
<seg id="11">20 years ago, however, the Communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair Cebit in Hanover as a "office in the West End format."</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the new mobile phone could be a lot for then: SMS and emails could be sent and received, even by fax was the Communicator to reach.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even access to websites was possible via HTML browser, albeit slowly slowly.</seg>
<seg id="15">A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be folded up similar to a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then found a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">Quite proud was the price: 2700 D-mark, that is, about €1400.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was €392 in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">No one was able to guess in August 1996 that the Communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since then, everything has been different.</seg>
<seg id="22">The smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Finns "mobile phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster, was eventually sold to Microsoft and wrapped up.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, the market dominates the market, all of which came much later than Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="25">Always and everywhere online, this is today for a lot of people everyday.</seg>
<seg id="26">In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="27">Some 1.4 billion devices have been sold, and Samsung and Apple alone account for 555 million pieces.</seg>
<seg id="28">Global sales with the equipment are around €400 billion.</seg>
<seg id="29">On top of that, the well running business of the countless app providers and the telecoms corporations.</seg>
<seg id="30">Around the smartphone, a whole industry has now emerged.</seg>
<seg id="31">The crucial breakthrough to the mass market came only in early 2007, at the time Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced on the Mac-World the introduction of the iPhones.</seg>
<seg id="32">He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an internet communicator, easy to use all by touch screen.</seg>
<seg id="33">Apple's victory move began, still today the iPhone is the corporation's most important product.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who dominated the market, had the aftermath.</seg>
<seg id="35">They eventually disappeared, Blackberry has struggled.</seg>
<seg id="36">The saga now has Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung.</seg>
<seg id="37">The smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention.</seg>
<seg id="38">On average, every German now looks at his mobile phone 88 times a day.</seg>
<seg id="39">"We must all learn to put the smartphone away," said Janina Kugel, in the Siemens Board of Human Resources.</seg>
<seg id="40">Permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time.</seg>

<seg id="1">England must steer the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow</seg>
<seg id="2">Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and across London, but across the country.</seg>
<seg id="3">For me, this represented the biggest attraction of Heathrows, just as then in 2012 in London, when we operated a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and firms near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">For our local communities, we alone will create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.</seg>
<seg id="7">Just as they were ahead of us in London in 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of expanding Heathrows is too big.</seg>
<seg id="8">I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be blaming on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The doubters had 2012 wrongs and they will also be wrong at Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are always obstacles to overcoming, but Heathrow answers every question put to him.</seg>
<seg id="11">Like the Olympics, Heathrow is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project.</seg>
<seg id="12">Enlargement is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in wide-ranging growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and in the whole of GB.</seg>
<seg id="13">We have a great team at Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from the T5 - which was chosen five years in a row to the world's best airport terminal, up to the T2, which was built amid the world's two most frequented runways.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now they are ready to deliver a third runway, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment.</seg>
<seg id="15">The London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that Heathrow's expansion will also be one.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is time we steered this Olympic spirit and expanded Heathrow, securing our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.</seg>

<seg id="1">Adblock Plus, Facebook in "cat and Mouse Game" on ad blocking</seg>
<seg id="2">For companies that earn money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers, attempts are made to bypass ad blocking, a "cat and mouse game."</seg>
<seg id="3">On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block display blockages on its desktop side, Adblock Plus released a blog post saying that users could update their filters in the program to again block advertising on the social network.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop side would change the encoding with regard to its advertisements to make it more difficult to detect the detection of which part of the page advertising is.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">In a blogpost, Adblock Ben Williams' spokesman wrote that "this kind of Hin-and-Her-fight between the ad blocking open source community and the bypasses has already been under way since the invention of display blockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fact that the world's largest company has entered the fight for social media is a strong indication of how worrying ad blockers have become for the industry.</seg>
<seg id="8">Around the world, according to a study published last year by Pagefair and Adobe, about 200 million people use display blockers; nearly four times as much in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="9">With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile advertising makes up 84 percent of advertising revenue Facebooks.</seg>
<seg id="10">The company has it on display blockers on desktop PCs, as mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a spokesman said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Advertising on Desktop PCs accounts for a sufficiently large proportion of revenue, so that Facebook appears to be rewarding the investment of such a step.</seg>
<seg id="12">On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update its "ad preference" tool to have people more control over advertising aimed at them.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Facebook claimed that adblock new filters would be worrying because they would also block content on the page that is not advertising.</seg>
<seg id="14">"This is not a positive experience for users, so we plan to address the problem," a spokesman for Facebook said in an email message.</seg>
<seg id="15">Ad blockers are a stump means, which is why we have instead focused on developer tools like Ad Preferences to put more control in people's hands.</seg>

<seg id="1">Woman in suspected suicide on Swiss highway</seg>
<seg id="2">The victim was in the middle of the night on the highway.</seg>
<seg id="3">Police are calling on witnesses after a woman was overturned in the early hours of Thursday in a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a highway.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the Canton of Vaud just after midnight.</seg>
<seg id="5">A woman put herself in the dark "in an act of despair" and was hit by several cars, police said in Vaud.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is obvious that a Swiss at the age of 49, who was overrun by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill himself.</seg>
<seg id="7">She still died on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="8">Several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, the police said, urging these as well as any witnesses to the incident to sign up.</seg>
<seg id="9">An investigation has been opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter told the Le Tribune de Geneve.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="11">Was a collision avoidable?</seg>
<seg id="12">This is something the prosecutor has to decide, "said Hofstetter.</seg>
<seg id="13">Two similar cases over the past five years show that drivers are not being held accountable.</seg>
<seg id="14">In each of the two cases - where a person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that motorists would not have to assume that a pedestrian was running on the highway in the middle of the night, as was said in the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="15">Last year a policeman was acquitted of negligent killing after she had overrun and killed a man who was on the A1 near Payerne in August 2014.</seg>
<seg id="16">The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and has become unconscious on the street, the court heard.</seg>
<seg id="17">The court found that the policeman -- who had replied to an emergency call -- drove in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a "completely extraordinary and unpredictable situation," the judge said.</seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone who has more information on Thursday's incident near Morges should contact police at number 021.644 83 46 or 021.644 44 44.</seg>

<seg id="1">NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable</seg>
<seg id="2">According to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably once habitable.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and CO2 dense atmosphere, could once have shown erratic conditions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously hinted that the slow revolt of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation suggests that Venus may have had a thin, erratic atmosphere and yet slowly turned on.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also lit up the topography of early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably dismissed more dry areas than de Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to house life and protected from rapid evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.</seg>
<seg id="10">"In the GISS model simulation, the slow revolt of Venus exposed its daily side of the sun for almost two months," said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the sun's heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures, which are some degrees cooler than that of Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought forth a history of Venus similar to the evolution that was previously believed by planetary researchers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was once presumably habitable, the Venus -- over the course of several billion years -- was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans darkened and their water vapour was burned away from the ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As their hydrogen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a lethal greenhouse effect -- the Venus, which as we know it today.</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.</seg>

<seg id="2">Patrick Roy resigned as coach and vice president Of Hockey Operations of the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, leading to too little co-determination in the team's decision-making process.</seg>
<seg id="3">Alternative President / General Manager of Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the club will immediately search for a new coach.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Over the last three years, I have fulfilled my duties as chief trainer and Vice President Of Hockey Operations of the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," said the 50-year-old Roy in an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="5">I've been thinking long and much over the summer about how I could improve this team to give it more depth, this needed it and bring it to a higher level.</seg>
<seg id="6">To achieve this, the vision of the coach and Vice President Of Hockey Operations must be perfectly matched to that of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="7">He must also have a right of co-determination in decisions that affect the team's performance.</seg>
<seg id="8">These conditions are not being met at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="9">Sakic, who had recruited Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Patrick informed me of this decision today," said Sakic.</seg>
<seg id="11">We all appreciate what he has done for our organisation and wish him only the best for the future.</seg>
<seg id="12">Roy was honored during his debut season at the Avalanches 2013 - 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards as the league's best coach.</seg>
<seg id="13">He led the club to 112 points and in first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was beaten in the first round of Minnesota's playoffs and missed the postseason in each of the last two years.</seg>

<seg id="2">Labor struggles with regard to pay for North Sea oil workers will be suspended, while all the parties to the dispute will get to the table for a new round of talks, negotiators said.</seg>
<seg id="3">Strikes against the oilfield service provider Wood Group have been carried out sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Wood Group as well as the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the settlement process of the current dispute," says a joint statement.</seg>
<seg id="5">We will hold some all-day meetings in the next few weeks, which will begin early next year to readdress the problems.</seg>
<seg id="6">Unions said their last strike, which is the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible pay cuts of up to 30 percent.</seg>
<seg id="7">Wood Group this year cut rates to its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressures.</seg>
<seg id="8">The company's council cut follows a 10 percent drop for onshore contractors in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="9">The company said additional cuts give the company the space needed to get through the market downturn.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission with the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates under the stars of the Plejades star.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data helps astronomers to understand why stars in star clusters are rotating at different rates and in what context the rotation periods are with the planetary formation.</seg>
<seg id="4">"We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his age and even the history of his solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The star cluster of the Plejades is 445 light years away from Earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this star cluster, which emerged around 125 million years ago, are now reaching adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now turning the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">At peak rates, these maturing stars encounter large quantities of star winds.</seg>
<seg id="9">As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">When a star is ageing, its rotation rate begins to slow.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler misses the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a discernible star fleck -- such as sunshine.</seg>
<seg id="12">The latest catalogue of rotation rates points out that more massive stars are turning more slowly than fewer massive stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with larger stars turning slower pirouettes than smaller ones.</seg>
<seg id="14">"In the" ballet "of the Plejades, we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said.</seg>
<seg id="15">As the star cluster of the Plejades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic lab to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The star cluster of the Plejades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.</seg>
<seg id="17">There is still much ahead of us what we would like to know more about how the How, When and Why stars slow their rotation rates and hang up their "dance shoes."</seg>
<seg id="18">Rebull and her colleagues have reported extensively in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Plejades, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.</seg>

<seg id="2">The tears ran at Alex Rodriguez faster than the U.S. baseball star in best days from Base to Base.</seg>
<seg id="3">After his emotional resignation announcement, the 41-year-old professional will wear the jersey of his New York Yankees on August 12 against the Tampa Bay Rays.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I love this game and this team."</seg>
<seg id="5">"I say" Goodbye "to both," said the 14 -time All-Star Game participant of the Major League Baseball (MLB).</seg>
<seg id="6">Three times Rodriguez was voted the most valuable player in the league, and in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees.</seg>
<seg id="7">His signature under a ten -year contract has given him $27 million annually since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="8">By the end of the contract on December 31, 2017, he will act as a consultant and youth coach - at full salary.</seg>
<seg id="9">As a player, it paid Rodriguez back for a long time with performance.</seg>
<seg id="10">With 696 homeruns, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and since 2005 the Yankees created some milestones.</seg>
<seg id="11">With the Hall-of-Fame-members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two other baseball players in key statistics show similar values.</seg>
<seg id="12">But in the baseball's glory hall, the 41-year-old is still unlikely to be included.</seg>
<seg id="13">Because so successfully Rodriguez - nicknamed "A-Rod" - was on the field, so controversial is his appearance outside the square.</seg>
<seg id="14">As early as 2009, the superstar at "ESPN" admitted to having taken banned steroids between 2001 and 2003.</seg>
<seg id="15">In August 2013, he was locked up for 211 lots by the end of 2014 due to a settlement in the so-called biogenesis scandal.</seg>
<seg id="16">Rodriguez is considered the main suspect to have received performance-enhancing funds for years via an anti-aging clinic in South Florida.</seg>
<seg id="17">After a legal battle, the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The league could even have done me a favor for the year 2014, because I played 20 years without a break," Rodriguez said at the time.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even his farewell days are not running smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="20">While many baseball legends have been given the big stage again in their last games, Rodriguez has often had to sit on the bench.</seg>
<seg id="21">"My job does not include a farewell tour."</seg>
<seg id="22">"My job includes trying to win every game," said Yankees-Coach Joe Girardi.</seg>
<seg id="23">After all, Rodriguez, who was married to actress Cameron Diaz and to the relationship with pop star Madonna and the actress Kate Hudson, received sympathy from fans from the Yankee-arch-rival Boston Red Sox.</seg>
<seg id="24">"We want A-Rod," sang the supporters at the 4:9 defeat against the Rodriguez team.</seg>

<seg id="20">"I do not understand why the athletes do not draw the right conclusions," he said, "we Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, all weight theorists from the chronically doping nation may not participate in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">On Friday, the case of "Adrian Zielinski" was also known, the London-based Olympic champion in class up to 85 kg was tested positive to the anabole steroid Nandrolon three days earlier.</seg>
<seg id="23">Both deny the intake, but both are not allowed to start in class up to 94 kg.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before the launch of the athletes, especially the case of Danekowa is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The International Federation of IAAF had banned the complete Russian team, except for an exception due to systematic doping, and Kenya also produced a lot of bad news in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="26">In swimming sport, the previous offences in China had also ensured fierce clashes between the athletes.</seg>
<seg id="27">So the Frenchman, Camille Lacourt, attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang harshly.</seg>
<seg id="28">"Sun Yang pinches purple."</seg>
<seg id="29">"When I see the podium over 200 m free style, I want to surrender," Lacourt said on French radio.</seg>
<seg id="30">Sun was also at the heart of a dispute with Australian Mack Horton.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I have no time and no respect for doping fraudsters," said this.</seg>
<seg id="32">Sun had been tested positive for the stimulus trimetazidin in 2014 at the Chinese championships, but had to sit down only a three-month lock.</seg>

<seg id="1">Data cloud: so perfide blackmailed hackers their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful in doing so.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey by malware defense specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Britain and Germany, 40 percent of firms surveyed in the past twelve months have been at least once, sometimes several times victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of firms were already the target of a ransomware blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40% of the victims willingly paid the ransom required by the perpetrators to reuse the systems and data that were attacked.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their blackmail software, according to the observations of Malwarebytes, on attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potentially blackmailed ransom is significantly higher than for private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We are currently watching a frighteningly rapid evolution of the malware," explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world."</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">First, private users were the target, but the switch to corporate attacks has been terribly fast in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once active on a victim's computer, she is looking for recently changed files such as Word, Excel or database files, as well as archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and extinguish the originals.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the demands of the blackmailers.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the end key code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of the Cryptocurrency Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, where the personal photo database is at stake for private users, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production is closed.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage occurs when a ransomware beats.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the German companies affected reported revenue losses by Ransomware, and 13 percent had to completely interrupt business, and in one case, people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of sickness.</seg>
<seg id="20">"We always say to the victims: do not pay, it only promotes the problem," explains Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of firms that pay will get their data again.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers, it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in the face of standstill in the operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers, in turn, know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, F-Secure's security researchers examined user surfaces and contact with the blackmailers and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain to their victims by chat how they can pay by bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites, or decrypt example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private individuals are redeemed after payments of a few hundred€, companies will have to negotiate hard and pay five -digit sums to get their data back unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potentially high and relatively risky profits from ransomware blackmail, the hackers are becoming increasingly professional and sharing the work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski of the anti-virus provider Sophos: "a single person can write a ransomware circa within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">It is more likely, however, that these are three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their software in the form of a software construction box to the actual blackmailers.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous malware kits created by buying the malware itself, counselling and additional tools for an one-off, fixed price between $1000 and $10,000.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Included is an adjustment tool, so that smaller configurations, looks and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmailers then seek further hackers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service economy.</seg>
<seg id="34">So you log in to one of the forums in the bottom, buys the set of a criminal and instructs another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per infected computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"Usually, the criminals then charge spammers with spreading," explains Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of ransomware is now known to many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of corporate IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey trust to be able to resist ransomware using file back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"If the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful expediency, the perpetrators instead threaten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="41">As a result, the potential for damage, depending on the type of data, is still many times higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the future, the perpetrators could also take completely new targets on the Internet of Things.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Defcon hacker conference, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter, the activation of such a blocked heating could well be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then block a whole production road in a factory instead of the heating in the future, Ransomware could also become an issue in the industry in 4,0.</seg>

<seg id="1">One for all cases</seg>
<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and everyday</seg>
<seg id="3">In the small HR-V, Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds quite overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, is actually proving to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V is rather small, passengers have plenty of space both in the first row and in the fond, it doesn't work tight at any point.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the interior are well processed and pleasant, only the cockpit upper side comes down.</seg>
<seg id="7">The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="8">There is not only a boot of 453 l at the top and 1026 l at refolded back, but there are the "magic Seats."</seg>
<seg id="9">This is less magical than it sounds: the seating areas of the backbench can be folded up like cinema chairs and thus offer closet space, which is 1.24 m high from the ground up to the ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="10">The boot can be loaded well, but the loading height with 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6 -l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed areas.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, he is likely to do his job a little more quietly.</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another motorisation: a 1.5 l gasoline with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">An all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">Driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamism and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="17">The steering, however, is likely to be a little more direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">The equipment in the tested top variant "Executive" leaves nothing to be desired.</seg>
<seg id="19">The security systems include the City-emergency brake assistant (works up to Tempo 32), the collision warning system and the track record assistant.</seg>
<seg id="20">The collision warner sometimes irritates because he rated many obstacles as "approaching objects."</seg>
<seg id="21">The remote light assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent Temporegler responds to the traffic mark recognition and drops the speed if needed.</seg>
<seg id="23">The full connectivity, however, exists only for the top equipment: 7 -inch touchscreen, Navi, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and HDMI bookings are under the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome to reach.</seg>
<seg id="25">The around €29,000 for the well-equipped top diesel are in order.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who do not want to invest so much will receive the gasoline from €20,000, the diesel from €23,000.</seg>
<seg id="27">The engines meet the Euro 6 exhaust standard.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.</seg>

<seg id="2">After their journey, diseased holidaymakers will only get money back if the cause of the disease can be found without doubt at the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, this is only the case if more than ten percent of guests prove the same symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the negotiated case, a family was severely ill on diarrhoea and eruption on the second day of their Turkish holiday.</seg>
<seg id="5">She spent almost the entire holiday in the room.</seg>
<seg id="6">Their illness led the holidaymakers back to a defective sewage treatment plant that had allegedly polluted the seawater.</seg>
<seg id="7">The family felt that the journey had been flawed - and complained against the organiser.</seg>
<seg id="8">In court, the plaintiffs had no success.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although the treatment plant was in fact defective.</seg>
<seg id="10">But the organiser only learned about it shortly before departure of the plaintiffs.</seg>
<seg id="11">He had to assume by then that the sea water was in order.</seg>
<seg id="12">So he did not violate his information obligations, according to the ruling.</seg>

<seg id="1">De Maizière said that after the violence perpetrated by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people would have worried about further attacks.</seg>

<seg id="3">What is certain is that our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and split.</seg>
<seg id="4">We will not treat this triumph to the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="5">If criminals would have to leave the country more quickly, it would increase the security and strength of the population's support for refugee policy.</seg>
<seg id="6">De Maizière wants to achieve the implementation of the proposals until the 2017 federal election.</seg>
<seg id="7">He also announced a further staffing of the security forces, "on a medium four -digit scale over several years."</seg>
<seg id="8">Sympathy for terrorism must be punished again.</seg>
<seg id="9">Video surveillance is to be improved, the gun law is so novel that, above all, the purchase of weapons on the Internet is made more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="10">The most recently discussed confidentiality for doctors is to be preserved according to de Maizière's words.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, in dialogue with the medical profession, he wants to seek solutions to how to reduce the vulnerability of citizens, he said, with a view to mental health.</seg>
<seg id="12">In order to counter the radicalisation of refugees, the Minister considers that better social care is needed.</seg>
<seg id="13">Teachers would have to be better prepared for dealing with traumatised people.</seg>

<seg id="16">It is important that the Minister for the Interior has made a clear opposition to action.</seg>
<seg id="17">"This was an earnest for the sharemarkets in the CDU / CSU," Gabriel told the newspapers of the Funke Media Group (Friday).</seg>
<seg id="18">De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the Union for a Burka ban and the abolition of dual nationality.</seg>
<seg id="19">He considers a general ban on full concealment to be constitutionally problematic.</seg>

<seg id="1">Better traffic flow on the motorway carrier</seg>
<seg id="2">It regularly stops on the bypass - here's a picture of November.</seg>
<seg id="3">But this is to change: the legal blaze is to be extended.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is good news for all car drivers who are in congestion on the ambient road every night when they drive through the highway (A 43).</seg>
<seg id="5">The provincial road construction extends next Tuesday and Wednesday (16th / 17th August) in the area between the Hammer Straße and the exit Weseler Straße 700 meters.</seg>
<seg id="6">Motorists can then turn right from the Hammer Strasse to the right.</seg>
<seg id="7">The big advantage: the traffic divides more early, improving the overall flow on the much-vaunted section of the Bundesstraße 51.</seg>
<seg id="8">The idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district of Münster-West.</seg>
<seg id="9">The carriageway on the carrier nerves the motorists mainly between 17 a.m. and 19 pm.</seg>
<seg id="10">Working days stretch back to the bridge over the Albersloher route and sometimes beyond.</seg>
<seg id="11">The reason is the Nadelöhr on the B 51 just before the exit Weseler Straße.</seg>
<seg id="12">From here, traffic is only steadily channelled through the highway bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">The second track had to be rebuilt just over a quarter of a century ago.</seg>
<seg id="14">The reason: static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer possesses the necessary power to include, above all, heavy goods traffic.</seg>
<seg id="15">For how long this bottleneck and the associated work-day congestion will continue, the competent national operation cannot say.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, there are years to come: the bridge has an official residual duration up to the year 2034.</seg>
<seg id="17">For the extension of the legal abbey, the national operation has deliberately chosen the weaker time in the school holidays because it is expected to be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="18">Traffic will be spurred on the construction site on Tuesday and on Wednesday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing night: tips against sleep disturbances</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening you can walk around forever, at night you will be awake for hours, and in the morning you can no longer think of sleep well before the wake-up.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is far from recovering.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, such problems are in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep is often or permanently unrecoverable.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disturbances speak?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorder, and it can be based on a variety of causes, emphasizing Hans-Günter Week, the board member of the German Society for sleep research and sleep medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What one understands, however, is the Insomnie, that is, a disorder and a sleeping disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">In particular, many people feel unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the Board of Directors of the German Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disturbances?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disturbances are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind it can be organic, mental or behavioral factors, but also medicines.</seg>
<seg id="12">Often the sleep disorder is an expression of another illness.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Very early waking up is often the case with depression," says Week.</seg>
<seg id="14">And it may be that different factors are mutually dependent.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, anyone who has a disc incident may be bad, wakes up every two to three hours and may start to greet about everyday problems and worries, Week gives an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I have sleep disturbances to the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone who doesn't sleep well over a period of a month in at least three nights a week and is impaired on the day should go to the doctor, Week advises.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look very different: one is beaten, tired, undisclosed, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily riddled, has mood fluctuations or physical ailments such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">To alleviate sleep disorder, it is important to find out the causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As treatment options come, among other things, behavioral changes, cognitive behavioral therapy, or even medication - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="22">Established sleeping medical practitioners rarely exist in Germany, insists Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medical centre of Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, if you have sleep problems, you should first contact the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be used to investigate whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to the sleeping lab, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For the study in the sleeping laboratory, for example, medical practitioners advise on snoring with breathing suspenders, in sick day fatigue, in sleeping converters or if you don't find the cause of a sleeping disorder, Fietze explains.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is not really necessary to prepare for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Just don't make a lunchtime sleep," says Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="30">After the cabling, you go to bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes on the body, one wears a nasal glasses, a chest belt and a feather at the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera on the ceiling features the sleeper.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can people get to grips with the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of pitch screws that can be used for better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Week counts on: regular sleeping and upcoming times, not too long in bed, not sleeping on the day, not watching TV to sleep, avoiding alcohol and not looking at the clock at night - then you start to expect immediately, and that is not conducive at all.</seg>

<seg id="4">Now the former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has been protective of his ex-team-mates in the critique.</seg>
<seg id="5">"In a country where an Olympic champion gets £20,000 premium and a jungle 150,000 Euroshould no one wonder about missing medals," the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="6">The support system in the swimming pool is bad, but the doping controls are very good.</seg>

<seg id="8">"I am not saying that the controls should be stopped here," he continued.</seg>
<seg id="9">If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler would already have to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA).</seg>
<seg id="10">That is exactly how we should keep it with countries.</seg>

<seg id="4">Compared to a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, it is already being built: a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments is to be created by 2017.</seg>
<seg id="5">Articles about this "trendy district," as the relevant real estate company Friedrichshain calls it, are, however, preferred in recent weeks with burning cars.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have lease contracts, but on the ground floor are still occupied rooms and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">In particular, since the beginning of the year, the Berlin interior senator, Henkel, has argued several times for a tough action by the police against the project, calling the area a "no-go zone" for police officers and the 94 as the starting point for autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After on June 22 the rooms on the ground floor, the cadtersmiths, had been cleared with 300 police officers, police patrolled official statements for three weeks with 30 to 40 officers and three team cars on the ground, locked up parts of the road and kept visitors from entering the house with number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile refurbished construction workers on behalf of the unknown homeowners the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On July 13, a Berlin administrative court ruled that clearance had been illegal, and a day later, police and construction workers moved under the cheer of sympathisers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon, the road works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the pavement in front of the houses in the sun, others entertain themselves in front of Späti.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects lie a primary school and nursery school.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in the Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who has three children here, are mainly generous from the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the residents of the house projects, they share the concern about rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It doesn't sound like a Kiez, who wanted a majority of police protection against vandal left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch that the Berlin interior senator and police make up between house occupiers and their neighbors does not appear to exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district, which today has a low average income and high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="18">Home occupations and the housing projects that have been born have also long been part of the Kiez: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainz street near the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer had been cleared under great police force in a real street battle, many of the projects in the Rigaer were legalised and are still inhabited by the people they had occupied 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, in recent years, the district has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and election berliners from around the world: with them, residents from DDR times and former house occupiers are now sharing their jaws.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also noticeable in the rents, which have risen by nearly 60 percent in new rents since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: one recognizes them on inserted slices or freshly removed facades, which have been thrown with colour bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road has been mentioned so often this year along with the words "left-autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason that not all neighbors view this as a problem may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as bodily injury are almost exclusively directed against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the offences make up property damage, which tends to hit the new buildings and freshly refurbished houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a rental house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As far as acts of violence are concerned, it is appealing: the people in the 94 are their neighbors, who have certainly not been.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars no longer exist in the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "here one helps each other, lives together on the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately pulled into Rigaer Street - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">That is why it was so important to her that the residents get their road back: from the police, the politics and the media, who all suddenly claimed the authority over the district in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away from them: through faceless new buildings in former building gaps that crowd out the old residents.</seg>
<seg id="33">"These are, after all, property flats that are not interesting for many here - here are more people who are not so well beguiled," she says.</seg>
<seg id="34">"I absolutely cannot endorse violence and destruction."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should you do if you never listen to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">For Zugezogens, who are annoyed by colour bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Anyone who draws on should be aware of this - just like someone who moves into a pub district, can complain badly about noise there.</seg>
<seg id="39">All the people only presented with first names have asked not to be named with their right name</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee officer</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person in terms of integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July, Annika Deuschle has been the refugee officer for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Social Pedagogist supports the management team around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">It sees itself as a contact person for all actors: refugees, working groups, administration, authorities and anyone else.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer from the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the ice-legged wool mill, which, above all, has a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">For example, some - less intense than the multitude of requests for tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the post.</seg>
<seg id="9">An administrative power has been sought with a talent for languages and people, coupled with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, an ice-legged wool mill.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organisation, work with the people on the ground and also behind the scenes as well as network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent limit on three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"It was high time," says Regine customer, that Annika Deuschle supports honorary and full-time actors.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and small problems, organisational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers stand in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem has been for some time to find homes for the connecting refugees who have been recognised.</seg>
<seg id="18">Local authorities are responsible for the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of the construction, rent or renovation of these shelters must be borne by the local authorities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Countess to the Commune and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the administration does not find private homes.</seg>
<seg id="25">It has not worked so far, so it is necessary to rely on private housing, according to Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">That is why it is necessary to make public housing esteemed, as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be set up in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with homes is it not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the key word, are Regine Customer and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a firm bust, it is internships, training places, school places, one-euro jobs and aid activities for refugees and migrants who need to be funded or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"More places would be good," reports Regine Customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help house master, do non-profit work - and that motivates and very properly, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">It hopes that work for the community will lead to a positive outlook.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">However, activity does not just mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a firm structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So it needs offers such as sports, contacts with locals and, above all, language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rar.</seg>
<seg id="40">So, here too, administration and volunteers are jumping.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees feel they are wanted and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedures is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They must explain to the refugees that it is just that it takes and that they can bridge the time, for example, with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Anyone who eventually develops the feeling that he can't help anybody in Urbach should not work and be useless, who will never integrate.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">However, there is also a problem, says the customer, "people who do nothing at all." The work of Deuschle and the customer is therefore always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: have the two been afraid of radicalisation after recent events, including in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"No," says Regine customer very clearly, "what some may call naive." A residual risk cannot and does not want to exclude them.</seg>
<seg id="50">However, the helpers are already aware of this.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">Those would have the fear that the offenders will bring them completely into disrepute.</seg>
<seg id="53">"They want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So the main and honorary people on the ground and in the region must look for activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">In doing so, they always have in the background that a new thrust of refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a ceiling?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly, politics is shy.</seg>
<seg id="59">In fact, it is unfair to put them on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="60">"In Urbach we have not yet arrived where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbachers are already in the process of being able to integrate the previous people sensibly.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mostly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they have to help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no easy answers.</seg>
