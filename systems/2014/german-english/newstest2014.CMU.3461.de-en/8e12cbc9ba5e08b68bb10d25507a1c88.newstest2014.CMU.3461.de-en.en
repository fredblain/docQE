Tourism: descend to the Romans
Cologne is around 120 metres below a water from the Roman times.
Visiting Cologne, the cathedral.
Approximately 157 metres from the two towers in the sky, making it the second-highest church building of Europe.
But only a few visitors, the two filigranen Kircht체rme bestaunen anticipated that there is a lot to discover in the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in Cologne Pit.
Meeting place for tourism directly on its tours is the centre of Cologne Cathedral.
The tour starts very unspectacular beginnings: "we are in the garage," says Schulze.
In the 1970s, the city fathers wanted a fair city, and therefore only what remained of the remains of the old city wall was not too great.
Most of the users of the Park House, therefore, today the Roman over and only your car.
But if you look more closely, discovered in the parking D 2 an archaeological site separated by metal bars.
There are about five meters high ruins of handteller large stones.
"There are remains of the Roman city wall, built in the second half of the first century after Christ," says Schulze.
Before it goes back to light, Schulze participants on the upper park level leaves a look in a dark, 15-meter shaft.
This is the fountain of the old cathedral, which, unfortunately, unnoticed.
The next step of the Pr채torium, and there the participants back down into the depths.
We see the office of the most powerful man north of the Alps, the Pr채tors of the CCAA.
What CCAA means, a visitor would like to know.
"It stands for" Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium ," which in Roman law as much as" town and city of Agrippinenser, founded by Emperor Claudius on the place of the altar for the Kaiser cult "means."
And the Pr채torium is the former Statthalter Palace, the power center of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the lobby of the exhibition introduces a tunnel access to the Roman sewer of around 120 metres.
"You can go one step along the so-called Cloaca Maxima along, if you want," Schulze the guests.
A surprise Schulze has.
He has brought to the Cashier key, he leads the group to a 16-meter begehbaren shaft.
"We are now in the mikvah, a Jewish ritual bath," he says.
The Jewish community built their bath deep in the soil to the groundwater, which was essential for ritual ablution.
To date, in the bottom of the mikvah, whose origins go back to the eighth century, different water levels by changing the level of the Rhine brushstrokes.
The mikvah is part of an archaeological zone on the town hall square, for the work should begin shortly.
Until the completion but a few years.
