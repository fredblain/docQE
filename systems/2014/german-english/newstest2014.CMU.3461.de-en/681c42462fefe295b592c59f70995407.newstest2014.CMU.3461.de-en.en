FIFA MANAGER-bashing for Schiris: Mane no Schwalbe King
Ralf Rangnick so happy with the current Hochform of league-table leaders Red Bull Salzburg, so disappointed was the sports director of the "bulls" of the arbiters.
"There is currently a dangerous tendency that Mane and Alan into the category Schwalbe kings," he took the two Offensiv Wirbler protection on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg.
The most recent cause of Rangnicks criticism was yellow for Mane in the 3-0 against Grödig last Sunday, the Senegalese alleged Schauspielerei was doomed but was not, as the TV pictures showed.
"An egregious mistake," said Rangnick, the referee Harkam as "completely overwhelmed."
Harkam will also have "its part" to Eskalation between Salzburg coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig trainer Adi Hütter after the game.
He defended his German country, as Roger Schmidt ":" I have the same in every situation.
Schmidt wants the skirmishes with Hütter have had no contact with his colleagues.
I do not know why.
"Because I am the one who was offended," said the 46-year-old.
In view of the success of Rangnick voted but a Lobeshymne.
"There are only two words: good," he stated.
There is not much.
In particular, the way in which the team is impressive.
This is to continue.
Kader changes in the winter transfer will be little.
There is no great reasons to make a difference.
"But a player with the desire, it is clear that he wants to leave the club," said Rangnick.
