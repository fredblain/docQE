FAA: passengers can now use electronic devices on planes (but no phone conversations)
From takeoff to landing, passengers can now use their electronic devices to read, work, play, listen to music and the image of films, but not with mobile phones, the new guidelines, issued on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States.
But the passengers should not expect that these changes be implemented immediately.
How quickly they were implemented, would depend on the respective airline, FAA employee Michael Huerta said at a press conference.
The FAA, the airlines must prove that they comply with the new directives and that the training manuals of the flight crew and planes have updated the rules for the Verstauen equipment under the new rules.
The FAA said it received a number of airlines plans to expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes.
Under these airlines, Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the expanded use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA announced in a statement.
Passengers currently have smartphones, tablets and other devices off, when the plane doors are closed.
They must restart only when the aircraft has reached a height of three kilometres and the captain gives the green light.
Passengers must enter the approach you again and they must not restart before the plane landed.
Under the new guidelines could allow airlines whose aircraft against electronic disturbances are secured their passengers to use the devices in starting and landing on the tarmac, the FAA said.
Most new transport aircraft and other planes, which were umger체stet, should meet the criteria for the use of Wi-Fi in greater heights.
Laura Glading, president of the association of professional cabin crew, welcomed the changes.
"If the new regulation is implemented safely, and we are working closely with the airline on this, both sides will benefit," said Glading.
We are frankly tired, to feel as Aufpasser on this issue.
However, Internet surfing, exchange of emails, text messages or downloading of data, banned under three kilometres to the authority.
Passengers are invited to smartphones, tablets and other devices in the air mode.
So there is still no"words With Friends, the Scrabble 채hnelnde online game, played the actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011, when he had to leave a jet of high profile American Airlines because he refused to shut down the device, while the aircraft was parked Flugsteig.
Heavier devices like laptops should continue to be stored, because there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile phone calls during the flight also remain banned.
The regulatory competence for telephone conversations lies with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not the FAA.
FAA highlights may ban on certain electronic devices for starting and landing
Last month, said Mark Rosenker of Transport Safety Authority National Transportation Safety Board, an expert on national security issues at CBS News, mobile phones are still considered a risk.
"Mobile phones are a problem, not only because it could potentially cause interference with navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that the transfer from the air Sendemasten can interfere," said Rosenker.
An advisory committee of the industry, which was launched by the FAA to investigate this issue, recommended last month that the government permit a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years has increased the pressure on the FAA to loosen restrictions on the use.
Critics such as the democratic Senator Claire Mccaskill from Missouri take the view that there is no valid reasons for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of devices has become ubiquitous.
There is talk in some studies, up to a third of the passengers the closure of the device forgotten or ignored.
The FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic devices by passengers, after reports of disturbances of navigation and communication devices by passengers mitgef체hrte FM radios became known, then the trend represents the latest technology.
New planes are more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA to electronic interference.
Airlines offer passengers Wi-Fi some years ago, when the flight height is reached.
The Wi-Fi systems adapted pilots are also less susceptible to interference.
The vast majority of passenger planes should be appropriate for the greater use of electronic devices to the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices in general much less radio radiation than previous generations.
E-Reader, for example, only minimal radiation, if you umbl채ttert.
But when downloading or sending of data transfer values are more.
One of the advocates of easing the restrictions on the use of equipment by passengers Amazon.com.
In 2011 companies invited staff of Kindle E-Reader and a passenger plane made a Testflug, in order to identify problems, but could not see.
Members of the FAA advisory committee expressed mixed feelings with regard to the risk of the use of equipment.
Douglas Kidd from the National Association of Airline Passengers, said he was of the opinion that the passengers disrupted by the equipment is genuine, even if the risk is minimal.
Other committee members said, there are only isolated reports of pilots for a disturbance of aircraft systems through the equipment, and most of them are very old.
However, the committee recommended the FAA to allow pilots instruments landing in low visibility the closure of the devices by the passengers.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes, describing them as a reasonable accommodation for travellers, today extensively equipped with technology.
"We are pleased that the FAA acknowledges that a passenger experience is not contrary to the security," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
