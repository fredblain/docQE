He gave in a previous survey the cocaine possession.
The prosecutor was transferred after the police in their investigations of Scarborough herausfand that this had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspects and saw how he went to Dittas house and the drugs with a purity of 60% in a black golf glove under the MÃ¼lltonne Anwalts.

Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal defender, because he has to deal with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not simply a drug dealer, but a drug dealer, his lawyer with drugs.
One part of his communications was undoubtedly legitimate, because he was the lawyer for these individuals.
But that went far beyond the bounds of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He was the police investigations as far as possible, so that they could continue their criminal activities.
Mr Ditta said that his profession into disrepute.
He stood too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed that his independence is compromised.
Ditta rejected any wrongdoing and said: "if I were a corrupt prosecutor, I am not, and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, then I would not wait 15 hours, but do it immediately."
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire police said: "Mr Ditta has taken the step of a criminal defender to a criminal at the moment when he started to buy drugs from organised criminals."
