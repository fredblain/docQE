Anger verdict on Bali bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who were killed in the bombing in Bali in 2002, were angry about the verdict for the last was the instigator of the trial, because Umar Patek thinks it should be legally shot.
Patek, Southeast Asia almost ten years as one of the most wanted people on the flight, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in the construction of Sprengkörpern for the bomb attack.
With criminal suspension he could be released after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for the attack on two nightclubs in the tourist district of Kuta killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injured many more.
A guilty verdict was also in a number of terrorist charges, including a wave of bomb attacks on churches in Indonesia were on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The Public Prosecutor requested a life sentence for the man, because of its reputation as the bomb Bauer, even if they also known as "Demolition Man," could seek the death penalty.
The decision has awakened painful memories in June Corteen, a mother from Perth, the 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny lost in the devastation caused by Patek and his conspirators almost ten years ago.
She said with tears kämpfend, Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I mean, it should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
"We should put him in front of a firing squad," Corteen told AAP.
I have to live with it every day that I will not get further grandchildren and my daughters will never see.
The Sari Club was razed on October 12, 2002, shortly after 11:00 p.m., a powerful bomb exploded in a small truck was parked outside the nightclub.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar, where only 20 seconds before a suicide bomber with explosives-filled backpack was exploding.
He fell into a coma for a month after the attack and "died" three times, while he was on a life-support system.
Hughes said that Patek deserves the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell of Jemaah Islamiah, Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra, were responsible for the massacre and executed four years ago.
Really, this guy should above all have the death penalty.
Him alive -- no, there is no reason to leave him alive.
To get 20 years after he has killed 202 people and injured hundreds, is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers, the court.
He turned away from almost a decade of detention, but was finally caught in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US forces killed four months later the former Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.
During the negotiations, an FBI agent said that the note had provided intelligence that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with a view to rebuild the link between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
"He has not," said Corteen.
Until recently, he has shown no remorse for how much pain he has caused to other people.
The judgment before the 10-year anniversary of the attack this year, with commemorations in Bali and Australia.
"There will be lots of tears this year," said Corteen.
Patek can appeal against his sentence.
