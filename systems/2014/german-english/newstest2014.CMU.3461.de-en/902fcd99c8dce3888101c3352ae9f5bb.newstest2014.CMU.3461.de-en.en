The interiors are racing seats and six-point belts and a Freisprechanlage.
The options range from enhanced brakes, a service package of care of Bowler Works mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, CEO of Bowler Motorsport, said: "the Rally to Bowler, customers who have changed."
They are not all experienced cyclists, but people who are looking for excitement and adventure and a achievable path to world-class events.
We are pleased to be able to open this road in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens up new opportunities, the various Rally disciplines in Britain and abroad and newcomers to prepare for the Strapazen and the reality of Rally Raid.
We had a really fun to develop the Defender Challenge cars -- this will be an entertaining championship.
In addition, there is a training and Testtag in Defender Challenge in February and the option to participate in desert race in North Africa and the Middle East.
