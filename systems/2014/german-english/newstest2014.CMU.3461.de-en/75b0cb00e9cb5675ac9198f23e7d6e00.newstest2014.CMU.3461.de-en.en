The Council adopted track facilities targeted
"The Hirschen" consuming the railway crossing should be converted to improve road safety?
Yes, the local authorities have decided.
Schiltach needs to 220,000 euros in the hands.
The Deutsche Bahn wants to improve the Kinzigtal line in the coming year.
It is particularly to increase the safety of crossings are regularly to collisions of trains with other vehicles in Germany.
The restructuring measures to the communities, they must agree with a third of the cost involved, the rest are rail and federal.
Schiltachs city architect Roland Griesshaber explained to the council the nature of the Bah Übergangs "the Hirschen."
There is the Mundes west of the city, to the tune of the tunnel, to build a bulge.
There could also greater transport vehicles, for example, those long wood, in turn, without having to block the tracks.
Griesshaber therefore proposed to construct a necessary Stützmauer so that the city could expand the road when the time comes, to ensure a smooth traffic flow.
This has been controversial and discussed in the council, as some councils the need for road proliferation in doubt: Thomas Kipp brought to the mood of critics took to the point: "we have so much money in the hands of so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas said: the railway crossing "Hirschen" will regularly used for the transport of long timber.
Even "Kuhbach"will be transported by this route, in part, because the wood from the area up to 20 metres long vehicles could use the route to the Häberles bridge, not because they could not turn in the road.
In addition, serve the route as Umleitungfür those vehicles, not allowed to use the tunnel, Haas argued that if the main road is blocked.
Since abzusehen that Kirchberg and Schloss Berg tunnel could be rebuilt and refurbished, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the railway crossing an important transport," the "Hirschen" for a longer period.
The council agreed to investigate the costs which would cause angedachte broaden the road.
Nevertheless, the reconstruction of the railway Übergangs was agreed with the proviso that the required majority Stützmauer is built in such a way that the city may encounter for transport to the road "Bahnhofstrasse" around 5.5 metres.
The renovation of the transition to the Gerberei Trautwein could lead to a different problem that affects the ansteigenden "geroltz houses in the road."
The administration was the Umbaupläne train from Engineering Breinlinger examined, since it had doubts as to whether the planned then the Geroltz houses is still perfectly possible.
The investigation concluded that it cannot be excluded that the gradient of the road that could lead to longer vehicles aufsitzen.
The responsibility for wear in the city as road Baulast winner.
The restructuring could therefore entail liability disputes.
As both the wood Abfuhr and the Abbiegen worked in the current state of development, argued that we should not approve the reconstruction of the rail Übergangs Haas.
It is also the risk of a collision with a train car at the transition significantly lower than the other crossings, because the stopping point directly to the middle, there is a good line of sight.
Even if abgebremst trains from the main train station at this point would be that no risk of collision.
The majority of this rail refuses to give its assent to the transition as the city Schiltach had the problem with sitting vehicles "ausbaden, Räte," as the railways could withdraw after the conclusion of the work of the responsibility.
The Board considered problems the Umbauten the crossings "before Heubach" and "Kuhbach," for already crossing agreements with the rail.
