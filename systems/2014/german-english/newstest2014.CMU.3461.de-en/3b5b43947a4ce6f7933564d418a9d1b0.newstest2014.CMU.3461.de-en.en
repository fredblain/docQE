When the horse show experts in Cardiff einfanden to k端ren the horse of the year, they were aware that a competition was imminent.
But none was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirk country.
The kid, which has not even made his first steps in the nursery, and only a few months ago, and his Shetland pony toffee trabten loosely through three rounds, retrieving the prize, while leaving behind 30 adult opponents.
The inseparable couple, both have been praised for their appearance, behaviour and style in all annual competition, hosted by the Sunny Bank Equestrian Centre in Rudry, near Cardiff.
When he appeared to compete against men and women with elegant Melonen drafted he had his plate cap in a frechen angle and led the two-year-old Toffee by the ring.
Fenton was hailed by the judges for his natural abilities in dealing with the pony which are far beyond his age.
And Toffee received top marks for his demeanor and his personality.
Fenton had days to get his third birthday gift last March and since then every day with the Shetland pony.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: "Fenton and toffee are a great team."
They had to compete against the entire field of participants and with Gold Cup and Rosette Square.
It was only the second time that he had attended a competition with toffee, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Completely Tourism in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The small boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, the horses vorf端hrt for over ten years.
Howells said: "the entire audience was electrifying, and all have angefeuert and geklatscht."
He ran the entire length of the Arena on sand and although he looked so tiny, he has done a fantastic job.
Fenton is crazy about animals, he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens, which he cares.
As it is, it will not be long before he started on the "horse of the year" show -- and I am sure that he will do well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show, said: "Fenton is only three, but he knows he must deal with his pony."
Together, they are a great team.
The judges bewerteten Fenton and days later, how well they were beaten, and in the Vorf端hr ring.
They to ensure good cooperation between pony and leader -- and Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I am sure that Fentons s端sse clothing has contributed, which was really perfect for the occasion.
