Hearing before the Royal Commission: two YMCA staff accusations against Jonathan Lord accused of sex
Two YMCA staff from New South Wales (NSW) have been accused of sex offences relating to children, charges against the childcare Jonathan Lord from Caringbah before 2011, as the Royal Commission for sexual abuse of children.
But the opening statement to the Commission the YMCA had said it had "never had to deal with an incident of child sexual abuse in the organisation."
CEO Phillip Hare has been consulted on a case in which a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences, and another at the YMCA Caringbah Hall 1991 a sports teacher was convicted of the abuse of children entrusted to him.
Hare said Gail Furness, one of the Commission assistierenden lawyer, knew that he had known from the first case, but not the second.
He admitted that the opening statement of the YMCA to the Commission was also vague in the statement, "we have external reviews of the YMCA, in which the YMCA was recognised as at the forefront of child safety."
Evidence before the Commission show that the YMCA was informed that he is the second-lowest of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities (Ministry of Education) in August of this year.
Hare, with 21 the YMCA started, admitted the management had failed "from me on downwards" in the recruitment of Lord and not ensured that staff were aware of their obligations to report violations of the directives on child safety.
Lord was convicted of sex crimes against 12 boys during his two years for the YMCA at the beginning of the year.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
Hare argued, however, that the YMCA had a cultural problem, the employees have held Lords violations in relation to the safety of children.
The employees said they had observed violations, among other things, that Lord was alone with children, for private as a babysitter, they have a said that he would like to sit on his lap, and let children play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose leader Lord was and had asked for a training on child protection, because she was concerned about his behaviour, said that the children of the supervisors in YMCA Caringbah, Jacqui Barnat, the Lords was "very intimidating and most of the time was very remote."
The CEO said he would not accept statements by employees that they have not had the courage to report back to their superiors.
Instead, he said, but their friendship with Lord have impaired their judgment why they had not reported him.
Hare said that he was the chairman of the YMCA NSW, the organisation shared his view that the lesson to be drawn from the Jonathan Lord incident,"" not the Melden"by staff betreffe, and the Board voted in favour.
Hare said that the decision to push the staff to sign confidentiality obligations shortly after the accusations had been made by the director of children's services, Liam Whitley, YMCA.
He said that it should prevent contamination of the evidence, but had been "overzealous" and poorly implemented.
The YMCA NSW is in the period between 2009 and 2011, when Jonathan Lord was employed, not for children safe organisation, said Professor Stephen Small Bone of Griffith University, an expert on child sex abuse of the Commission.
He explained that there are "serious problems" in the recruitment, screening, training, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing was postponed until December 20.
