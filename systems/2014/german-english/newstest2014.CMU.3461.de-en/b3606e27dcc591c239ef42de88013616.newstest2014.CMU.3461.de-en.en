John Kerry stated in an unprecedented admission, the US spying was "inappropriate" went too far
John Kerry indicated with an unexpected admission is the defensive argument in terms of their monitoring programmes by the United States would be inappropriate in certain cases, "he said, the spying gone too far."
The Foreign Minister also admitted that he tr√ºge along with Barack Obama the responsibility that you have placed on "autopilot," when the explosive revelations of the NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden on espionage activities were publicly.
The leaked information is the US government in a diplomatic storm of indignation from its allies.
In a speech transmitted by video link on the Open Government conference in London, Kerry said: "there is no question the president and I and others in the government have learned of some things that have taken place almost by autopilot, simply because the ability was even more difficult years of the Second World War and the Cold War and, of course, goes back to the events of September 11."
He then became the first senior member of the US Government that the US spy have crossed a line, but stressed that no rights have been abused.
He said: "in some cases, inappropriate has gone too far."
The President is determined to create clarity, and makes a thorough investigation, so that no one must feel that this is abuse.
I can assure you that does not affect the rights of innocent people in this process.
Kerry, however, insisted that the NSA is a force for good and many lives were saved by its monitoring operations.
He added: "we have to do it with a new world in which people are prepared to blow themselves in the air."
There is a radical extremism in the world, the intent to kill people to blow up in the air and governments to attack.
What, if you would be able to intercept and stop, before it happens?
Indeed, we have plane crashes, prevent attacks on buildings and the murder of people, because we have seen in the run-up to such plans.
Meanwhile, US lawmakers will travel to Europe, to allay the concerns about the alleged US spying and to convince Europeans of the need to continue to cooperate with the United States, with the anti-terrorist efforts, as the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, said he had spoken with representatives of the European Parliament and others this week and is concerned about their threats, because of frustration over the National Security Agency surveillance not to participate in anti-terrorist organisations.
"It is very important for the national security interests of the United States, that the Europeans remain on board in terms of our common struggle against terrorism," said Murphy, is the first Democrat in the Senate and as chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs, in an interview in Washington.
Moreover, I am going to Europe, to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their anger about the NSA programs.
Media reports that the NSA has collected millions of phone data in Europe, which have strained relations with some US allies, although the head of the secret service said this week that the reports are incorrect and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata, which had been collected by NATO allies and shared with the United States.
Other revelations from Snowden passed documents cited that the NSA monitored the phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other world leaders.
The director of national intelligence, James Clapper, defended the spying on allies as necessary and said that it is common on both sides.
In all the commotion, Murphy said that his agency is preparing the journey of the Congress, to be held this year, and hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating Members to be published in the next few days.
He said that the exact route will be drawn up.
Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip is to improve the relations, he also said that there would be some "serious words."
He said that the European governments should be honest with their populations about the kinds of spy programmes, which they themselves for years.
"We can change our surveillance programs and better protect the rights of Europeans, but this must also come to terms with the fact that we are not the only ones, the spy," says Murphy.
Meanwhile, John Kerry stands for a trip to the Middle East and Poland this weekend, with the anger about the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as the US surveillance activities.
