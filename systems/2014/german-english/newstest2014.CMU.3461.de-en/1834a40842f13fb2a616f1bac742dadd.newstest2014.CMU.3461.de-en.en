Pope Francis appoints first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will for the first time on February 22 new cardinals of the Catholic Church, the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest-ranking clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope, and they are, so to choose a Pope Francis to appoint the first group of men who will be involved in the choice of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal, has reached the age of 80 years, can no longer take part in the Pope election -- this is a group of 120 "Wahlberechtigten Kardinälen."
In a statement, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said the news was announced, there will be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony will be held on the appointment of the new cardinals, known as a consistory.
"Pope Francis has decided to announce its decision to convene the Konsistoriums in February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of Kardinälen from all over the world, can be planned," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero, from Catholic Voices, said that the number of eligible cardinals to February will probably be dropped.
He said that a Pope ernenne normally so many cardinals as necessary to keep the number of eligible cardinals 120 betrage, and so many cardinals over 80, as it wishes.
The consistory next year is important, because it is the first since the election of Francis in March of this year, Valero.
At the moment, there is a certain Überhang aufseiten of Europe and particularly in Italy.
"It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will be appointing cardinals from the rest of the world, to restore the balance," he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of Kardinälen.
The cardinals will also be the first to be appointed to the Council established since the formation of the Francis cardinals, a group of eight Cardinals from around the world, have the task of finding ways to reform the church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.
"Now Francis has selected eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said that it was "quite possible" that Francis, the cardinals ask for advice.
But so far, we have not been in this situation -- this is all very new.
Valero said that typically the bishops appointed to Kardinälen from large places, but stecke Francis "full of surprises, so we do not know whom he appoints."
