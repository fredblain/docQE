Schools are encouraged to greater focus on math, spelling and grammar
In courses of English literature pupils will have at least one play by Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry and contemporary British novels from 1914 onwards.
Included in the audit also "ungesehene texts" to encourage breiterem reading.
For the combined English literature and language will be abolished.
From 2015, pupils must take a GCSE exam for language, there is a strong incentive to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will publish the new curriculum for English and math -- the first subjects which have been radically transformed.
Other core subjects are changed next year.
In a separate initiative will give Ofqual, the regulator for a reorganisation of the GCSE structures, including a new rating system and less course work.
In a speech in the summer Michael Gove, the education minister, said that there is a broad consensus that we need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence," he stressed, the GCSEs would be "more challenging, more ambitious and more stringent."
Studies show that less time spent on math -- 116 hours per year, or three hours a week in English schools per year -- than in most other countries.
On the other hand, Australian schools received an average of 143 hours a year and students in Singapore 138 hours.
Although there is no formal requirement, more time in the curriculum for mathematics, but from coalition circles that the comprehensive math testing, combined with a greater weighting of the compartment in rankings, schools will probably encourage more hours.
The curriculum is more emphasis on "problems of the real life," including financial mathematics.
