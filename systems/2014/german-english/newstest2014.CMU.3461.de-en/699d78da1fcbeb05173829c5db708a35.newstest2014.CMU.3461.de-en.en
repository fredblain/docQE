The British government has announced a study designed to increase the benefits of the HS 2 rail project for Scotland.
It is proposed in the work of HS2 Ltd, with the beginning of phase 1 in 2026, high-speed links between Scotland and the north of England.
Transport minister Baroness Kramer said the project "will bring Britain closer together."
The Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was very pleased to work with the British Government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands.
At the end of phase 2 there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June the government revised the estimated costs for the construction of the high-speed line between London and the north of England of GBP 32.7 billion to GBP 42.6 billion.
The British government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, HS 2 Ltd mandated to seek further route capacity and journey time improvements to northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a travel time of three hours or less of Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: "our goal for HS 2 is a truly national network, the United Kingdom and its cities closer together."
We are proceeding with HS 2, because it brings enormous benefits.
Without it, we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it is also about the link between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, thanks to HS2.
The Scottish Secretary Alistair Car Michael commented: "today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown Car called Michael to "unequivocally" for the Scottish involvement in the HS2 network.
Brown said: "the high-speed rail has the potential enormous economic benefits for Scotland, at the same time, the economic strength of Scotland also provides an argument for high-speed rail links across Britain."
We are therefore pleased to work as a partner of the British government and to examine the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland, which creates benefits for all and complements the link between Glasgow and Edinburgh, the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to the report together with the British ministers in the next year to examine and decide on the next steps.
