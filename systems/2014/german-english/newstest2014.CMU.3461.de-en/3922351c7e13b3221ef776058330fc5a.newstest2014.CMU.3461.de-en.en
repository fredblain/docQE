Halloween 2013: in numbers
When I was small, Halloween something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, late aufbleiben and disguise for the neighbourhood.
Today, I am more to Halloween Muffel.
In the last two years, I have not agreed to distribute sweets from my apartment, and it will not do so this year.
But according to the statistics, I am a black sheep, on Halloween.
The majority of Americans -- 158 million, to be precise -- this year celebrating Halloween and a total of $6.9 billion for candy, costumes and decorations from the American Federation of retailers (NRF).
One thing to which I am then again every Halloween, the trend values.
The costumes are approximately 1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, aufreizende inanimate objects of the rage.
Women must no longer hüllen in sexy clothes, they can now also verführerisches food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
With regard to men, I expect a lot of zombies, thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daft Punk space men are in the Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most sought costumes, Batman, pirates, zombies and witches.
I suspect that there is nothing wrong about tradition.
We have our dogs last year and to my surprise they were not alone.
Indeed, Americans $330 million for costumes of their pets this year, according to the NRF.
There are a lot of "Hot Dogs."
As regards Süssigkeiten, we are not zimperlich.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, The Nielsen Company.
That is about 270 million kilograms of chocolate bars, lollipops, candy and gum.
So the good news for the 41 million people, according to the US Department of Commerce with the slogan "trick or Treat" by the district.
Indeed, we are more than 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween buy and eat -- let us not deceive ourselves.
The only thing that we do not want to consume, is the sweet candy corn, sold 15 million kilograms of Halloween, according to the National Association of confectionery manufacturers.
That is about nine billion maize grains.
It is a mystery that I could not resolve.
Nothing is more to Halloween than houses, where it spukt.
They have great names like "Terror Behind the Walls" (which is in a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "the House of Shock."
There are 1,200 officially recognized Spuk houses in the United States, in fact, the $500 million Erlös, America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photos, in which it in the trousers pinkelt and friends on Facebook, where it is not loswird again, and then type, on the one, leave a comment like "nice facial expression."
But we finally come to the Kürbissen.
Charlie Brown made us familiar with the pumpkin, when we were children, and the carving a small pumpkin lantern is decorating the Christmas tree -- something that we have to.
Fortunately, the "Baby in the pumpkin" trend began only last year thanks to Pinterest, so that most of us have grown up the pumpkin zuschnitzen, not to sit.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million for pumpkins, the US Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lantern, the slow Vorgarten verrottet, probably comes from Illinois, where this year 245 million kg were harvested pumpkins.
If you want to score, then you call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and schnitzen slightly Hübsches of their 921-pound pumpkin.
