Europe's elite is ready to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the aim of the economy to bring and to define what those who wish to change our relationship with the EU in Britain for prosperity and work.
To this end, we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders and asked them what they think about Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov interviewed over 1,000 executives from the economy, the British company sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of businesses now exported outside Europe and focused on countries to modernise and grow, while the states in the EU will stagnate.
They want that the government side new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil favorisiert, instead of concentrating on the long and arduous process to reform the obskuren EU institutions.
Asked for their opinion on certain regulatory issues ranging from antitrust to product legislation -- the majority of business leaders is of the opinion that the control of these key competences should be brought back to Westminster.
There was general discontent on the internal market, since the costs of Brussels regulations now outweigh the benefits, according to the company, voted to be part of Europe's trade zone -- even 40% of large companies which are traditionally the most Europhile.
Finally, and this is probably the most, our survey of business leaders found that a clear majority of Britain wants a direction change in the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not on politics.
This is in leading corporations and companies of all sizes shows that the economy is pushing for a "meaningful change," the issue of action back to Britain.
It is much better conditions for Britain -- an amendment of the agreement and 16 percent would lead to a change of opinion in favour of the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the British economy behind his plan for the re-negotiation of the British conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that the companies expect a renegotiation of a significant shift in the balance of power back to Britain.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary, after the eurozone moved towards closer economic and Fiskalunion now.
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain, as the result of our survey shows, which for businesses means a greater emphasis on trade and a fundamental change in the approach to Brussels regulations.
