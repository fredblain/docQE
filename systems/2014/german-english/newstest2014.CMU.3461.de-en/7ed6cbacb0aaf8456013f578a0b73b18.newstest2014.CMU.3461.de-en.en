The Bauzaun Bechtle-Plot bemalt
A group of the citizens' initiative "Swiss meadow" has the Bauzaun Bechtle plot on the spa promenade in Bad Herrenalb verschönert.
They also clean and verbreiterte the foot, it says in a press release.
The planned cover of the crumbling house in the rear of the land was not permitted for security reasons, because the terrain threatens to slide.
Alfred Abel, the plot, the currently Verschönerung action with his colleague Reinhard Domke of the BI.
Before the action of the BI was a banner with the message "we are appropriate."
But the 20 members of the citizens' initiative, however, little in its action.
Her motto on the large poster said "we are against Bauruinen."
They wanted to draw attention to the danger of even greater ruins on the Swiss meadow one day the giant project should fail.
In talks with many passers-by before the "site," it was clear that some citizens do not believe that it will be better off with the implementation of the project of many of the city, although a few have presented the same questions to the dimension of the project as the BI.
But they are beginning to resign because the city these responses further zögert, from the BI.
As we heard, and the public statements of the mayor.
May said at the council meeting that he feared the death of the spa, the population in the citizens should vote against the plans for a vote and spa complex on the Swiss meadow.
Some seem so downright scared, others see it as a "crude blackmail" to the population, it says in the press release of the BI.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all volunteers.
