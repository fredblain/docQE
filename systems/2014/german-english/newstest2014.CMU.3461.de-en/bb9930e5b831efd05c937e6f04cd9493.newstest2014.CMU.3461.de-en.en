ESA determines large space missions: missions for billions
Distant planets, gravitational waves or black holes experts of the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that they want to start in the next few years.
30 proposals were to selection, five are still in the race.
Distant worlds.
More than 1,000 planets of other stars, astronomers have already found.
If there is at least some of them life, nobody knows.
The choice is difficult: we should search for gravitational waves?
Or explore the origins of the cosmos?
Or after discovering erd채hnlichen planets fahnden and perhaps alien life?
These questions are the responsibility of the European space agency Esa.
For its program "Cosmic Vision" looking for ideas for two major space projects, which promote the research.
The budget for such "l mission" is approximately EUR 1 billion.
The launch is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, the European space research, the elite met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas were debated, five of them are now in the shortlist.
A number of bodies on the proposals, hooks the researchers.
In the next few days, a final decision by the scientific programme committee.
Four major issues, the Esa has selected the mission of the 2007 initiierten programme "Cosmic Vision" answers.
What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life?
The exact processes for the formation of stars from large gas clouds and the formation of planets that orbit stars-are still in the proverbial dark.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can live there?
To pursue this issue, "his" space telescope to 2017, with 500 already known planetary systems in our surroundings be investigated.
But the possibilities are limited, his is a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million.
With larger instruments could Astronomen erd채hnliche planets and even the composition of atmospheres and search for "Biomarkern" as an indicator for biological activity: gases.
How does the solar system?
This question is ultimately about what are the conditions for the emergence of life.
An important role in the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field and the particle radiation posed by him with the planetary system.
In our solar system, these transactions exemplary.
The Solar Orbiter"the Esa has already sent a mission of the M-class (there, the budget is around half a billion euros) for this issue.
The probe will start 2017 and surface and activity of the sun closely.
Of great interest to the researchers are Jupiter and its moons.
They want to find out what role of the giant planet in the development of the solar system.
This is the, the first of the three L-mission of the "Cosmic Vision" programme.
The "juice" (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) begins its journey expected to 2022.
Eight years later, she reached Jupiter and the atmosphere of the planet and the icy moons Europa, Ganymede and KALLISTO.
What are the fundamental physical laws of the universe?
The space offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and to investigate whether the laws of nature we know there are still valid.
Perhaps there are derogations, the physicists could point the way to a new theory, under whose roof all known laws of nature.
What is the universe, and what is it?
Our universe in the Big Bang 13.7 billion years ago.
In addition to the us gel채ufigen from the stars, planets and life as we know, there are dark matter, whose gravity holds galaxies and clusters of galaxies together, and dark energy, by actions to accelerate the expansion of space.
So far, the researchers do not know what physical laws valid in the first a split second of Urknalls were what dark matter and dark energy.
"Euclid," the Esa has already approved a M mission, whose launch is scheduled for 2020.
With a special telescope to examine the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the whole sky and thus allow conclusions on the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could make the race
Of the 30 proposals are only two left at the end of the selection process.
Many experts believe the best chances of approval as L-mission "e-lisa," an ambitious approach for the detection of gravitational waves.
Physicists are changes in the structure of space-time, the Albert Einstein had predicted almost 100 years ago.
They have not yet been proven.
Elisa could create, the scientists behind the project hope.
The mission provides a detector, stationed in the space of two or three probes.
It could also prove gravitational waves, unlike plants on the earth, the Big Bang, and new knowledge about the formation of the universe.
Four other competing proposals to the second L mission: a large X-ray telescope, called "Athena," which, among other things, to explore black holes, "icy planets," another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism," a mission to survey the cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder" to identify and investigate erd채hnliche planets.
Ausgeschieden already include proposals on samples returning from the Moon, Venus and Mars, to explore asteroids and the solar physics.
