New anti-nicotine vaccine could kill the pleasure smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine, which could spoil the fun smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice for a lifetime smoking.
Further tests are needed before testing on humans, which may take a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal from Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, said the first results are good.
"We are very hopeful that this kind of vaccine strategy can help millions of smokers who tried to stop and tried all the methods available on the market, but had discovered that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches," says Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus, has been changed so that it contains the genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selective the liver cells, which produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibody hunt and neutralize the nicotine molecules in the blood, before they reach the brain, which a smoker no nicotine high.
In experiments behielten vaccinated mice, which have been fed Nikotin, their normal level of activity.
Mice without vaccination, by contrast, had a "break," the researchers said, a sign that the nicotine reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Former tobacco vaccines failed because they contain antibodies.
The vaccination had to maintain the anti-body so often that they were expensive and impractical.
But the costs of the new vaccine are likely to significantly lower, because it transforms liver cells in anti-body factories.
As Professor Crystal said, could be a future vaccine for people, if he certainly children, before they were tempted to try a cigarette, and thus prevent nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely that smokers would use it to stop.
"They know they feel: when they start to smoke again, no pleasure because of the nicotine vaccine, and this helps them to the habit," he explained.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but at the same time, it warned that further research is needed.
