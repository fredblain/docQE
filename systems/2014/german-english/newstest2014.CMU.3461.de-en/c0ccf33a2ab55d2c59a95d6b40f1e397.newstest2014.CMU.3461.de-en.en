Fancy Eiscreme, shining in the dark?
A British company has developed the first in the dark shiny ice -- with jellyfish.
Charlie Francis, the fluorescent properties of marine animals and created a bright Leckerei.
The idea came to him after he had read a research on jellyfish and Chinese scientists could convince the bright protein artificially.
The ice cream consumption with the tongue, causing the increased pH in the protein and the lights.
Chris said, the Speiseeis response to the heat in the mouth and luminaire -- the more you leckt, the brighter it is.
Charlie, founder of "Lick Me I'm Delicious ice cream company," says: "the product is unbelievable, but still at a very early stage of production, and so you get two grams of this for GBP 200."
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue with a neutral pH.
If the mouth of the protein erw√§rmt, increasing the pH and the ice.
We have tested in the last few months and it seemed ideal to bring it to Halloween on the market, because it has this wonderful Leucht effect.
It is probably the most expensive ice cream I have ever produced, because the jellyfish Leuchtstoff is four times more expensive than gold.
Each bullet costs me about GBP 140.
But it tastes delicious.
Charlie's experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavours, including beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his latest creation will be even more ambitious.
He says: "I would like to develop an invisible Eiscreme."
It is to be impossible because of the refraction caused by ice crystals, ice cream, but I suspect that we will find a way to create it.
The Eiscreme uses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish, the Chinese scientists artificially.
