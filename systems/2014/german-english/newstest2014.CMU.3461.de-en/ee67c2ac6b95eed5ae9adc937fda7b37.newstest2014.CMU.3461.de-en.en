Even if the SG Achim/Baden for four days without a victory, the handball Oberligisten is still good mood.
Coach Tomasz Malmon is no doubt about that.
All remain fully motivated in the matter.
Nevertheless, I hope that we can finally win again.
"Because I no longer know, as a victory tastes," a success experience of managing his team awaits Malmon Fredenbeck II.
Even if the Drittliga reserve from Fredenbeck currently has no trees uprooted, Malmon beforehand warnend the forefinger.
Many players I myself still in the A-youth.
That is why they will certainly be very motivated against their ex-coach.
"It is also to be seen whether another increase from the first is" verdeutlicht the SG-Coach.
To return to the track, the Malmon team compared to previous appearances, in any case.
Above all, in the coverage and the game haperte it least.
The chance of recovery must definitely be better.
I therefore hope that my players have finally the head during the short break free.
