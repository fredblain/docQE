These are the first such directives issued by the US Government, as the number of school children with food allergies.
One in 20 children in the United States has a food allergy.
According to the CDC, the spread of food allergies among children has increased by 18% between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines contain information for schools, the faculty and staff to raise awareness about food allergies and how to deal with children who show an allergic reaction.
It is also recommended that schools have stock Epinephrin -- the car injection of the Epipen brand is most commonly used, in order to meet a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
The legislators in the states have recently changed the rules so that schools can hold Epinephrin easier.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms, the children, have an allergic reaction.
Children may say: "it feels as if something on my tongue," is my tongue feels as if a hair is"or "my tongue kribbelt."
