Germany's biggest country church has an offensive Gestartet, to promote the work of the pastor.
Background is a possible shortage of priests: the Evangelical Lutheran Church Hannover currently expects that the number of around 1,800 Pastor and pastors to jetziger situation will halve by 2030.
Today is the very attractive profession for young people and offer good prospects, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in consultation with the Evangelical press service.
It is attractive to the work and to manage their daily.
With Burfien, the Church pastor for the first time on a full place to inspire young people for the study of theology.
Currently, fewer and fewer young people choose after graduating from high school to study theology.
Burfien leads to the process of secularisation: "God's voice is soft, the world is loud."
This is the work of great freedom and diversity.
I am Mr my schedule and my priorities, where it is important to me.
Pastors as pastors could be very close to the people.
They deserved as much as teachers and could live it.
Certainly will have paid more, but in the free economy, a secure employer.
This brings me to the young people of today, which is not only about career, but a job.
According to the Church, which includes three-quarters of Lower Saxony, currently around 60 pastors per year in the retirement.
At the same time, approximately 40 graduates start their Vikariat of theology studies.
In sparsely populated and peripheral regions such as the resin, the Emsland or the Wendland can be difficult to occupy it in the future.
Burfien will, among other things, hold study days for young people and also to invite celebrities who have studied theology.
The theology studies offer a broad education.
It can even be Federal President.
