George Kerevan: European unbundling gives Scots the choice
A new day, a new horror story for independence.
This time, we warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the cue for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a gesicherte with barbed wire border of Hadrian's Wall.
In fact, in the Strathclyde document on the possible economic benefits that would bring more freedom of movement in the rest of Europe, but this is -- predictably -- played no role in the news.
Nobody has also mentioned that the EU Member States often bent their strict rules when it is convenient for them.
However, Scotland is not part of the Schengen area, the continued failure to Brussels would be only a small concession in exchange for what it really wants from the Scots.
So, no story.
And one that has been so in the years that they have a fossil: the first time I heard the "independence means passport controls" duck at least 40 years ago.
This is an interesting point in the permanent Wiederholen of this ancient history.
Why should we expect an independent Scotland that after the European pipe dances?
Why the London eintauschen against the yoke of Brussels, especially now?
That is the real European news: the big, broader plan to reunify Europe after the war is stalled.
With the euro crisis is the European project is officially dead.
The anti-EU parties are gaining ground everywhere in the EU or the euro as single currency want to throw overboard.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party, only founded this year -- nearly five million votes in the general election in September for ergattern and effectively the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There have been local opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis is a turning point.
Because of the strict austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the straitjacket, the national economy by adhering to the single currency to Europe, many people are of the opinion that the project is too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with the fact that national governments create excessive budget deficits -- that was only the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has festgenagelt its members on exchange rates, which are beneficial for German exporters -- and German politicians would like.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the local currency found southern Europe with a built-in productivity disadvantage Germany.
The only possibility is to reduce wages and public spending -- spurred by Berlin.
Behind the current budget and monetary problems is a deeper European productivity problem.
As a result of the "green" energy directives imposed by Brussels -- a code for subsidising French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers, the European industry compared with the United States pays double for electricity and four for gas.
This is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we have seen in Grangemouth.
All wage fixing the world to protect the European petrochemical industry from cheap American shale gas in the corner.
As a result, a revolt, particularly in France, the former cheerleaders of the EU.
After the war, France's political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to Germany to keep in check and Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin and Paris no longer needed as a gateway to political legitimacy struggling aufgedrückt, the ailing French economy, Europe has its own economic policy.
The result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, anti-EU National Front has just won a decisive Nachwahl and that the ruling Socialists at three.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote -- a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume a split in the right-wing would mean benefits for the left.
What makes Le Pen with their newly gained popularity among white working-class people?
They would like to use the European elections next year, to forge an anti-EU, anti-Community monetary bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections -- and this is perfectly possible, then such a block dominated by the European Parliament for the first time.
This is the point that I want to emphasise that, in the not too distant future, the growing resentment of the EU and the single currency on the abolition of the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will be something like the "Europe of (sovereign) nations," the General de Gaulle favored.
Germany and some of its satellite economies, perhaps the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect that Britain distanced themselves from this project in the hope to curry favor with the US.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where is Scotland in all this?
We can decide to be a small region by (ultimately) England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests, including, Berlin and Brussels to say what they where stuck.
I suspect that Scotland could drive in a lockereren European network very well, if we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries is in a Europe of Nations not föderierten easier.
Otherwise, we should consider it join Norway and retain our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is -- remarkably -- the most successful political movement against austerity measures in Europe and a spectacular majority in 2011 as a result of the rejection of the proposed (and won) cuts, the Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer, Alistair Darling and the Tory-Lib Dem coalition had to answer.
It would be ridiculous to decide now for independence for Scotland, only to get a austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
