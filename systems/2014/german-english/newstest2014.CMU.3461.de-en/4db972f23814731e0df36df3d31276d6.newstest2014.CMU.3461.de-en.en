Red lights in the long term: attentive to wait
Sometimes a light simply not green.
The contact loop in the street does not react, or the light signal is defective.
What should we do in red?
A Betroffener waited at a red traffic light and the crossing is free, he can continue long enough to explain the Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorrad."
The wait must be "appropriate," which could be interpreted on a case-by-case basis.
Becker advises auszuharren, at least five minutes before a malfunction of the traffic is expected.
Those who drive despite Rotlichts continues, however, must be aware that he bears full guilt for a caused accident.
Anyone who tolerated, may not be less than five minutes long enough, warns Becker and refers to a decision of the Higher Regional Court Hamm.
In the case verhandelten, a driver after about three minutes and had responsibility for negligent Rotlicht infringement ignored red traffic lights in the long term.
The light was not damaged, but soon jumped to Green.
A driving ban the fine but not spared him because of the special situation.
