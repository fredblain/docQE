On 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his ill father always lost consciousness and went to hospitals, which do not have the resources to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon, in 1981.
First, he had a broken arm, but then formed a inflammation to his brain ausweitete and caused a Hämatom that should affect him for the rest of his life.
"There was no Neurochirurgen in Cameroon," says Georges Bwelle.
We have released him from Cameroon, if we had the money.
Instead, spend Bwelle years to accompany his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals, to get the treatment they had to offer.
"It is not easy," said Bwelle.
You can leave the house at five o'clock in the morning and run to hospital, to be the first, and it is not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people are dying because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwelles father died in 2002.
In Cameroon there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organisation.
On the other hand, the relationship in the United States is a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there were a doctor for them, could not afford the most Kameruner the visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and almost three-quarters of the country's health expenditures are private.
"The only problem they have is the poverty," Bwelle said.
And the poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
His father and so many of his countrymen suffer to see, in Bwelle the decision to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team have last year 700 free operations.
He was himself a doctor and works as a cardiovascular surgeon in the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a nonprofit organization called Ascovime, the weekends in rural areas and offers free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday zwängen he and up to 30 people in small buses and with the fixed medical equipment on the roof unbefestigtes Terrain in the villages that need help.
It is not always smooth.
Already they had to push vehicles through rivers and mud more than once.
But when they arrive, they are welcomed as heroes: a celebration meal, singing and dancing and the best accommodation, the place has to offer.
Free medical care is really a cause for celebration in these villages and Bwelle, with his broad smile and boundless energy, is to the joyful celebration.
The next morning the team then starts with the examination of hundreds of patients.
"We have 500 people," Bwelle per trip.
They come from a radius of 60 kilometres to the village -- and the walking.
Each of these Wochenend clinics providing medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, Unterernährung, diabetes, sexually transmitted diseases and parasites.
Others receive crutches, gespendete glasses or free birth certificates -- a document that is necessary for the school, but many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team simple operations with local anesthetic.
The operations generally take place in a school, town hall or an apartment; after surgery are the patients and move in the recreation area to make space for the others.
The lighting for the OP and the disinfection equipment powered by the generator of the group Bwelle and its volunteers to work in the early hours of the morning on Sunday.
It is a demanding Pensum, but the village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated.
"They drums all the night, so that we can stay awake and continue our work," Bwelle said.
On Sunday, the team then goes back in the city, tired, but proud of the work.
The group -- a mixture of kamerunischen doctors and foreign medical students -- last year 700 free operations and know that their work has made a huge difference for the people who it helps.
A man said that the free operation of bars of which he received, he is allowed to return to work.
"It changed the future of my family," the man said.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital Bwelle at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job finanziere 60% of its charitable activities, Bwelle; the rest come from private donations.
"I really do not know when he is sleeping," says Katie O'Malley, studied medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia in the second year and voluntarily in Bwelles group mitarbeitet.
He is either in hospital or trying to raise money for the organisation, so that it can go on these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students such as O'Malley, the support from the US and Europe and Bwelle, this is a chance to gain practical experience that they would never get at home.
"We can be in operations, where we help blood abzutupfen or the instruments for Dr. Bwelle," O'Malley says.
That would be never possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
The students pay for their own trip to Cameroon normally and bring often donated Sanität material.
Once they are in Yaoundé, Bwelle accepts the accommodation, transport and guidance.
"He is undoubtedly a hero," says O'Malley.
He dedicated his life to this organisation and its desire to help the people of Cameroon, knows no borders.
For Bwelle is the almost constant work is not a burden.
Other to achieve a better life and to fulfil a promise that his father gave him great pleasure.
"I'm so happy, if I make this work," Bwelle said.
And I am thinking of my father.
I hope he does, what I do.
I do it to make people laugh again and to relieve the pain.
