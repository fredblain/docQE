Parents of sexual children can choose "sex unbestimmt"
Germany is the first European nation in which a third sex is recognised for children who were born with ambiguous genitals.
Babies will no longer be rigid male or female zugewiesen.
Under the new law, parents must explain no sex for such children, but "vague" or "not fixed" on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to take the pressure of parents, so that they must make no hasty decisions on operations for a gender allocation in newborns, and to combat the discrimination of sexual people.
An inter-sexual person, according to the BBC years later said: "I am neither man nor woman."
I remain the Flickwerk, created by doctors, mutilated and full of scars.
It is estimated that one of 2,000 children each year either a boy or a girl to the world.
They belong to the Inter Sexuellen, a group covered by the diagnosis "sex differentiation disorder" (DSD), a generic term for people with atypical chromosomes, Keimdrüsen (Eierstöcken or testes), or unusually developed genitalia.
Wallis Simpson was perhaps inter-sexually.
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the United States suggest that we should use the best available information on sex allocation, if a determination is not possible, and not wait for the psychological and physical development of the child, before you decide -- if any -- for a operation.
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the issue of gender identification, said the new German law "blade for a good cause."
Inter sexual children constitute an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgery, but not for most of the children," he said.
You can make a sex allocation without operation and then wait to see how the identity entwickle.
The scientific data on, as a child his gender identity, are not very developed.
No one knows why it happens.
It is like the secret, why people are gay.
In a report to the European Commission in 2011, to distinguish Inter people are transgender or transgender people, because their status is not gender-related, but due to their biological condition, which is neither exclusively male nor female, but typically both or not clearly defined as one of them.
These properties were in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair and genitals, breasts and stature; primary sexual characteristics such as Fortpflanzung bodies or Chromosom structures and hormones.
The report also gives an overview of the discrimination, inter-sexual and transgender people face in professional life and on the extent of harassment, violence, prejudice and crime.
Not consistent with the gender image boys now have a special camp.
It is now possible in Australia and Nepal for adults, male, female or "third sex" on official documents.
In June Australier Norrie May-Welby (52), recognised as the world's first "sex lose" person after a court had granted the lifelong maintenance of "undefined" gender status.
German Ausweise in M and W will have a third allocation, X for inter-sexually, the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, a news story on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French Members of the strict Catholic country signed a petition that the "gender theory" should be removed from textbooks.
The US site Catholic Online has also opposed the German law, with the explanatory statement: "if the world dragged into a new state, where the gender, sexual activity but it is not a decision we verdrehen two other pillars of civilisation."
The mother of a newborn baby from Maryland told zone, it would be better if babies at the birth of a sex zugewiesen.
"The parents general is stressful enough without further restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of their child," she said of the parents website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children who were born with both male and female sex parts, called Hermaphroditen, after the Greek god of both sexes.
Ten years ago the medicine the sex as something that you can extinguish and then rebuild.
But in the meantime, the ethical foundations of an operation angezweifelt, now known as the gender identity is complex, and that doctors can be wrong, because they do not know how the child feels the Aufwachsen with the sex assigned to them.
"In the middle of the twentieth century called it a psychiatric emergency," Drescher said.
If a child was born, then it is not the psychiatrists, but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory on the treatment of children with ambiguous genitals goes back to Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, took the view that gender is malleable.
He coined the term "gender identity" and argued that social and environmental initiatives -- such as the parents of a child and a child -- acting with the genes and hormones, so consider whether a person is male or female.
But in a notorious under the title "John/Joan" case from 1966, his theories were controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis was separated in a botched circumcision, the child to kastrieren and to remove his testicles and raise it as a girl.
"Money presented the case as a successful example of a transformation, but it was not," says Drescher.
The boy was about 15, he moved back to the male and married a woman.
With 38 but he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who practise this model.
But in the 1990s, with the introduction of the Internet, survivors of these gender surgeries came to the public, are "not happy with the result."
For example, Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, was born with male XY chromosomes, but ambiguous genitals.
The doctors were not aware whether he had a great Klitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a satisfactory life "as a man."
So were its external body and testicles surgically removed in 1976 and shortly after the birth he was brought up as a girl.
At the age of 12 he received female hormones.
"I knew that I am not a girl," he said to ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really difficult to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he should receive a vaginoplasty.
But because he was depressed and knew that something was wrong, he demanded his medical records.
What he found was shocking.
I was sterilised in my birth -- and no one has ever said that to me.
Bruce was born with a DSD, his body could not produce enough testosterone to the development of the genitals.
After the truth, he moved back to the male identity, received testosterone injections and had his breasts removed.
The operation, it has become infertile.
Today he fights for others in an organisation called Interface Project that inter-sexual people are perceived as normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, managing director of the California -based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German legislation "to encourage Abstempeln and Stigmatisieren."
"Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and the child, not to define'," she said.
We are afraid that the interventions.
We think that it would be better to wait for the male or female zuzuweisen and then.
But we do not know how the law will affect, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization support the Australian law, because it allows adults recognition as a third sex."
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex," she said.
The German law relates to the allocation of childbirth.
This is not a fight to the small children should force at this time.
When they grow up, they can decide on their body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast Radiologin from Pittsburg, who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation and hundreds of others in a self-help support group, says that the German law "assigns" both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete Androgen resistance.
Because of the Rezeptor Defektes the target cells for testosterone Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Katie is now 29 and married; it works in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania as a collaborator.
She is infertile, but hopes to get through adoption or a surrogate child.
"The law gives parents, which they do not rush decisions," Baratz said.
It gives them the time to make various tests and to clarify things and gives them time before they write "male" or "female."
In this way, everything is in order -- you draw the child large and loves.
It has a wonderful baby and the parents happiness.
And we must not rush to an operation, which will no longer be reversed.
"This includes the children in the decision-making and remove the fear the parents umtreibt, because they are of the opinion that they are not doing the right thing," she explained.
Finally, the child decides the sex, the better with him, and that is wonderful.
This children are in a position to make the decision itself.
