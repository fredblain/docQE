Excellent the fight.
The role of Santiago in Hemingway's novel "the old man, the old man and the sea," Horst Janson cut on the body.
Janson is itself an old in his profession, the Performing Arts.
The old man in Santiago can delude fishing.
So complement the two simply splendid.
One almost believes that the wrinkles in the old man's neck, of which the fishermen boy Manolo speaks to see.
If Janson Santiago is tired of life gebeugt on the chair is real.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman a character through and through, Janson excellent meistert.
Hemingway told the story of a wrestler, a courageous man who does not abandon and ultimately by his knowledge and also his willpower to win the fight against the fish.
Janson is in many respects as Darsteller alone on the stage.
It is to focus the attention of the audience, so that his monologues are no boring.
His efforts to draw the fish up to the surface of the water, are so real that only the viewers forget that the sea of blue illuminated water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann makes the old man in the boat in the fishing village.
In the course of the performance, he continues the active scene: the hut of Santiago, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Gunst Scandinavie the life of Cuba, with their songs and beautiful voice.
The four musicians play Cuba's rhythm and are also guests of the bar.
