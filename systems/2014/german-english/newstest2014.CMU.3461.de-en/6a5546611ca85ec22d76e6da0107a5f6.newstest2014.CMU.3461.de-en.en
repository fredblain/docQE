Living with future
In fact, lives a Waltraud Ries.
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart, with a lot of green, old trees, nice neighbours and not too much traffic.
In the city are only a few minutes by public transport.
"I hope they have no fear of spiders?" asks Waltraud Ries and shows a fat spider on the door frame.
I have been looking for some time for a new home for my husband and me.
But you know how difficult that is in Stuttgart.
The reason is not a spider phobia, but the concern, at the age no longer able to tackle the many steps to the house and in the apartment, she explains.
In addition, since the Mittfünfzigerin has experienced a Meniskus operation, what it means to move with a handicap from floor to floor.
Recently it is a book published on happy living in the age- what home form is the best for me?'.
"Our apartment is the best example of what the age is not', it begins to tell.
When more than 20 years ago with her husband in the duplex apartment, it was simply a nice apartment in the middle of the Greens.
Today by mid-fifty Waltraud Ries thinks otherwise.
But they also know that it is one of the few people who could deal with the issue of living in the age'.
Most of the crowd, as long as it is.
Old are only the other,' she says schmunzelnd.
Only when the pressure is really suffering, do we have to consider.
"But it may also be too late, as Ries.
In her book, the interior designer 17 residential models for a self-determined housing in the age.
'What home form one chooses, is always an individual decision," she says.
D i e solution there is not for the age.
Even those who can afford the pensions seat in Tuscany or Brittany, should always consider that he could be sick.
And: "without a good knowledge of the language same in Dolce Vita," the Fachbuch author Aussiedlung willing to consider.
Its models include classical models, alternative housing or the oft-quoted pensioners -WG.
In the age, everyone he ticks and quirks
"For me it would be a residential community but nothing," she says with a wink.
Certainly not like a student-with a common bathroom and a kitchen.
' You just need also his retreat," says Ries.
However, a senior living community work, the author does not want to exclude.
But that must then differently than in the traditional Studenten -WG.
And sometimes if you simply want to even its calm', she believes.
With this opinion, it is in the country's capital, at least not alone.
"Most elderly people want to remain in their own homes as long as it is in Stuttgart', is the experience of Teresa Rütten, the head of the civil service in the age of the provincial capital.
Its service advises people around the issue 'Älter'.
Therefore, it would only accept older people often Unbequemlichkeiten and restrictions in order to be able to remain in their familiar surroundings, it is also the experience of the Stiftung Warentest.
There are many ways to make the house or the apartment barrier.
Ries recommends that all the dealing with the old fair remodeling their house or apartment, first to inform thoroughly and not only the best craftsmen.
Today, there is also for the old fair reconstruction specialists.
Even in the rental achieve one or the other, and if it can only be the toilet seat is increasing, the interior designer.
But not always, the existing housing so old and free umgestalten, even if it is so beautiful.
This experience had Waltraud Ries.
You may install a stairlift within the apartment, but the area also paved way to the front door, the far greater obstacle.
They will continue to search until she has found the ideal object for themselves and their man.
Before the move hate it more than the spider on their front door.
