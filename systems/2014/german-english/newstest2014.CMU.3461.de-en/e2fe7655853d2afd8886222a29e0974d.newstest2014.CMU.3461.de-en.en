Children should be taught as "models for the life" myths and legends, says a writer.
The story of Thor showed that "brutal force" has no chance against clever tricks, and Arthur legend demonstriere, how important it is to have a dream.
However, many of the myths were "far too wild, too dirty to anst√∂ssig and, in some cases, to be taught in schools," why Crossley-Holland for a "careful selection" age gerechter works.
"I think it is wonderful that myths and folklore are already part of education in America," he said.
I have already proposed a plan for 20 years.
He added, writers and teachers who were "overly didactic" children were "completely shut down" because in entertaining stories, the messages "unterschwellig."
Crossley-Holland, the Beowulf has translated from the Anglo-Saxon and the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, said: "you can hold certain intentions, but it should be possible in the background."
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writes for adults, and a writer for children, is the need to give hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or the happy ending, but there is an inherent sense of good and evil.
This must be presented unterschwellig explained by the history and not be disclosed.
This is the old story of the show rather than tell.
