A black box in the car?
American road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying highway system, and believe to have found the solution in a small black box, the dashboard each car place.
The devices record and the information to the authorities every kilometer, are at the heart of a controversial experiment of Washington and planning offices of the Federal States to revise the outdated system of financing American roads.
The usually dull field of road planning suddenly sparked a debate with colourful alliances.
Libert√§re have allied with environmental groups and the government argue that the small boxes used for recording the kilometer -- and, perhaps, where they were driven, and can use the information for the calculation of tax notice.
The Tea Party is appalled.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and a number of data protection concerns.
But while in Congress cannot agree on a procedure, several states are waiting no longer.
They are examining how they can change over the next ten years to a system in which drivers pay per driving mile.
Thousands of motorists have already tested the tachograph, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring.
This is really a must for our country.
"There is nothing that we only may use," said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Assn. of Governments, a record of planning gefahrenen miles on all California motorists in the state by 2025.
The way in which we pay these taxes, will change.
The technology is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, financed from the taxes that Americans pay at the pump, default.
But in America is no longer as much fuel as before.
Cars consume less petrol.
The state fuel tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 cents per litre), for 20 years has not increased.
Politicians dare not with high fuel prices, raising the tax by a penny.
"The gasoline tax is simply not sustainable," says Lee Munnich, an expert on transport legislation at the University of Minnesota.
His state has recently 500 cars equipped with a tachograph, which tested a miles-based payment system.
"This is the best alternative in the long term," he said.
Bureaucrats call it miles-based user fee.
Not surprisingly, the idea finds resonance in urban liberals, for example, the tax could be reduced to use to influence the driving behaviour so that congestion and carbon emissions.
The Californian designers rely on the system, enshrined in the preparation of strategies with which the ambitious objectives of the state of climate change.
But the Republican Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also stated that he is the best long-term alternative.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation, of the idea, drivers pay according to the distance travelled.
"This is not a tax, which disappears into a black hole," says Adrian Moore, vice president for directives at Reason.
The people pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former American transport ministers, in a report in 2011, had asked the Congress to move towards miles-based billing.
Last year, the US Senate approved a $90 million costly pilot project involving 10,000 cars.
But the majority in the House of Representatives blocked the Vorstoss and responding to the concerns of Members from rural areas, the everyday people who have many miles on the way to work or in the city.
Nevertheless, several states and large cities are moving on their own in this direction.
Oregon is currently involved 5,000 drivers for the biggest experiment of the country anwirbt.
These drivers will soon pay the mile fees instead of mineral oil tax to the federal government.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is also considering such.
Illinois testing it in limited with trucks.
And the I-95 Coalition, which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently investigating how to introduce the amendment.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where recently 50 volunteers with the equipment, drivers were sceptical about the idea that the government could pursue their every move.
"Concerns about Big Brother and such things were a big problem," said Alauddin Khan, director of strategy and product management in the Ministry of Transport of Nevada.
The people did not want it.
When the trial started, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: "it would be relatively easy to the tachograph into outright monitoring equipment."
There is no need to build a huge, bulky technological infrastructure, which would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of states who are now looking for affordable technology, the state can collect gefahrenen miles, but not exactly when and where.
So, Khan, would also reassure the public.
The pursuit of this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California.
The company is not originally assumed to help states in the taxation of drivers.
Its aim was to get a foothold in an emerging market for motor insurance, where drivers should pay on the basis of gefahrenen miles.
But the devices are also interesting for the road planners, because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information, are regularly uploaded via modem.
"People are more willing to participate if their speed and sites go unrecorded," said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
In some of these big mistakes were made public pilot programs.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this.
In Oregon, planners are experimenting to give drivers a series of choice.
You can choose for a device with or without GPS.
Or you choose no device and instead pay a flat fee based on the average of all inhabitants of the State of gefahrenen miles.
Other authorities hope to sell the concept of a suspicious public, by providing the equipment with more functions than with less.
In New York City, transport officials want a device to develop taxation, which also pay parking fees, insurance must be paid only for the kilometres and speed data collected by other vehicles in real time, thanks to which drivers can avoid congestion.
"Drivers are motivated by the added value of the benefits the system offers, for participation," it said in a planning document of the city.
However, some traffic planners wonder whether all the talk about the pay per mile is not only a huge distraction.
The Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area, officials said Congress could solve the problem of the bankrotten Highway Trust Fund simply by raising the fuel tax.
An additional one-time fee or an annual levy could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little petrol, so they pay a fair share.
"There is no reason for an operation, although an aspirin is sufficient," said Randy Rentschler, the head of the Commission's legislative and public affairs.
If we do, hundreds of millions of motorists concerned about their privacy and many other things.
