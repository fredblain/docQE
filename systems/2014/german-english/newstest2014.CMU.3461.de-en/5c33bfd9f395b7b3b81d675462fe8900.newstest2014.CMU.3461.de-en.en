Scientists were able to throw more light on the context in which the tail Wedeln of a dog with its mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dog with the tail wags more to the right (from the point of view of the dog), while the left side was nervous dogs.
But now, scientists say that other dogs and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, a neuroscience researcher at the University of Trento, said: "the people is well aware that the left and right brain react differently to stimuli, the positive or negative emotions."
Here, we have tried to look at this in other species.
He also said that dogs, like humans the right brain is responsible for the movement of the left and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings.
To learn more about how dogs react to the side tail Wedeln their own species, the researchers monitored the animals, while these films other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the Vierbeiner and analysierten behavior.
We will probably understand why the tail in one, sometimes in the other direction
Professor Vallortigara said: "we have shown the dogs films with dogs -- either a lifelike version or a silhouette to eliminate ablenkende other aspects, and we have been able to control the movement of the tail to the left or right."
If the animals saw an otherwise ausdruck dog has moved the cart to the right (from the perspective of the wedelnden dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But the tail was mainly left again (from the perspective of the dog wedelt), their heart rate rose and they saw unruhig.
In the opinion of Professor Vallortigara the dogs not deliberately communicate with each other by these movements.
He is convinced that the dogs had learned from experience, what movements they should worry and when not.
He said: "if you have several meetings with other dogs and the Wedeln with the cock in a direction more linked to friendly behaviour and the right side produced a less friendly behaviour, we responded on the basis of this experience."
The researchers say that the findings could provide a better understanding of the emotions of their animal dog owners, veterinarians and trainers.
Dog behaviour expert John Bradshaw and Visiting Fellow at the Faculty of veterinary medical science at the University of Bristol, said this was not the first study investigated whether the left and right is essential for dogs.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs, if they see an aggressive dog, turn the head left and right, if it is a happy dog.
In another research at the University of Victoria in Canada said: "dogs go on to be a robot dog, tail' wedelt left rather than right, rather than being unruhig -- exactly the opposite than in the Italian study."
According to his statement, hence the differences that the dogs could not interpreted as dogs in the various studies of animals in the movies or the robot dogs.
A study how dogs respond to real dogs, could help, he said.
"Although there is considerable evidence of many different mammals that the two halves of the brain used for various purposes, but many of the details still need to be determined, and dogs are no exception," says Bradshaw.
However, since their behaviour simply aufzeichnen, it will probably not take long until we understand why the tail moved sometimes in one direction, sometimes in the other.
