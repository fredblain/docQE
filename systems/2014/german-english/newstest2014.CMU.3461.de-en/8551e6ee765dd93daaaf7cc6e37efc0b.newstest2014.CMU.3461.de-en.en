Early puberty: faster erwachsen.
African American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty than their white age Genossinnen, as studies show.
Physical changes mean not the puberty
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic is a trigger for early puberty
The trend toward early puberty is less pronounced in boys
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specialises in child health and family issues.
A mother should be concerned if their daughter grow breasts and pubic hair at the age of seven or eight years?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida children Medical Association, said the paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, that these early physical change is relatively normal among American girls and represents a new standard.
"I spend a lot of time to reassure parents -- usually there is no sign that the puberty occurs quickly," explained Kaplowitz.
The ads of development, such as growing breasts, shame and Achselhaare and body odor, with girls in the past.
However, there was only a slight shift in the age of the Men Ark (the first menstrual period) in the last 40 years.
In the United States the average age of 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
"If the development of breasts begins, it takes at least two to three years to early puberty in girls," says Kaplowitz, author of "Men Ark often auftretenden: the essential guide to deal with this problem."
Time is the most accurate test, such as puberty progresses.
It is controversial, which is the beginning of puberty, but it is "early ripe," if the breast augmentation accompanied by a growth in an age of eight years.
In most cases, the process is slowed down or stalled -- something that a pediatrician can closely monitor.
Faster progress could be displayed by a Endikronologen tests so that serious problems like tumors or cysts can be excluded.
There are treatments to delay an early menstruation and the defence of another result: the premature aging of the bones, which may ultimately lead to growth inhibition and small body Wuchs in adults.
The recommendations for a pharmacological or hormonal therapy is based on the age of the child, the speed of development, growth and the emotional maturity.
Psycho social aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious when it comes to drugs, but he admits: "the suppression of puberty can mitigate behavioural problems and the feelings of girls, unlike their age Genossinnen."
The other big problem is understandable: parents simply do not want their very young daughters have the period.
"They are concerned about the risk of pregnancy or how they manage the hygienic side," Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter with ten their days.
Although there were signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
She was scared and excited home from school, because it was the first in their circle of friends.
There are many fully published theories about the causes of early puberty.
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media.
Young girls are similar earlier in the puberty.
Kaplowitz is of the opinion that the compelling premise is the epidemic of obesity.
In 2001, he supported the implementation of a study on girls aged six to nine years, the link between body fat and the entry into the puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors played a role.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty than their white age Genossinnen.
There are different explanations.
Global seems to be an early puberty influenced by all sorts of things, from economic conditions on the climate to the genes.
Another puzzle: although boys face and Schambehaarung already growing, the trend towards a full earlier puberty is not as high as for girls.
Other doctors on the AAP conference highlights the complexity of the issue.
The emergence of acne and pubic hair is even in infants and young children.
"We have to be careful how we identify the real beginning of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to consult their pediatrician, as they should talk with their child.
"This may mean that you must carry on a conversation earlier than expected," Kaplowitz advised.
If we remain quiet, the child normally reacts well.
Girls, early erbl√ºhen need the insurance, the process is a normal part of life, even if it happens earlier than expected.
