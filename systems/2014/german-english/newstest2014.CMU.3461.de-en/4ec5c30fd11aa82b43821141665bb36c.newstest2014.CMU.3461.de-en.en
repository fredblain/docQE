Profit losses for Bombardier to decline in delivery figures and contracts
The Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer Bombardier Inc on Thursday reported a 15% decline in net profit in the third quarter, after declining orders and deliveries of aircraft and contract problems in the rail sector was under pressure.
Montreal-based Bombardier also published a flight test data for his brand new plane the Cseries and gave no new information about whether the aircraft in accordance with the ambitious schedule next September could be in commercial use.
The maiden flight of the test aircraft followed one and a half months ago, so far only three other starts, which makes it doubtful whether the testing as planned.
The results were behind the forecasts, and led to a price fall of more than eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, analyst at National Bank Financial, on Thursday lowered its rating to "sector perform" from "Outperform" in view of the fact that the stock in the next one to two quarters a limited potential.
"Weaker delivery figures in the aircraft were largely expected, but the margin of development in the transport sector, we are clearly disappointed," Doerksen said in a customer letter.
We are of the opinion that Bombardier orders for the new Cseries, if the test programme for the aircraft progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect that the market skeptischer to the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the number of aircraft Cseries can catapult the company into the lower segment, which is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and flew after months of delays for the first time in September.
But so far, binding orders for the Cseries with 177 moderate, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of flight tests and want to see whether the company's claims about fuel efficiency and cost savings of the new jet transport aircraft is accurate.
There are currently a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
CEO Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will achieve its target of 300 binding orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the jets.
The company also assured on Thursday to analysts and media, the programme lies in the derivatives plan.
"The test aircraft is not remained on the ground longer than expected," Beaudoin said in a conference call, adding during the lifetime of the aircraft were scheduled soil tests and software updates.
Each manufacturer is different.
We have decided to take a first flight and then a review period, as we have done.
This is happening throughout the flight programme.
The second of five test planes will probably start in the next few weeks, the rest afterwards, it was on the part of companies.
Nevertheless, analysts remain skeptical that twelve months after the maiden flight of the first customer a plane Cseries in operation.
Bombardier said it überprüfe the planning for the commissioning (ice) and will update this in the next few months.
"The slow progress of the flight test -- even if they clearly meet Bombardier's internal planning -- reinforces our view that the commissioning to the first quarter of 2015," Doerksen said.
In the third quarter ended on September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share of $172 million, or 9 cents per share the year before.

The net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The backlog in the aerospace sector was $32.9 billion on September 30 and was unchanged compared with December 31.
"In the aerospace, the results were in line with our targets, but the low order intake and overall market conditions were disappointing," Beaudoin said.
Sales in the aerospace sector fell 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest rail manufacturer, announced that sales in this sector has increased by almost 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The backlog in the transport sector was $32.6 billion on September 30 and thus increased slightly in relation to the December 31.
The profit margin in the field of transport was affected by problems in some large contracts.
