Frontier Airlines collects charges for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge passengers up to $100 of verstauen on their flight hand luggage.
Frontier Airlines intends to charge $100 for a piece of hand luggage and $2 for coffee or lemonade, even if read in the announcement on Wednesday was that passengers should keep the whole box.
The new charge applies to hand luggage in the baggage compartment on the seat, small bags under the seat remain free.
Frontier berechne stated that, if the fee shall be paid in advance, $25 and $100 for travelers who paid only on Flugsteig.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the fee of $100, which aims to move travellers in the run-up to the payment.
"We do not want to calculate this amount," she said.
Airlines began to demand for the first and second checked bag fees in 2008.
Passengers who tried to bypass have therefore plugged into hand luggage as much as possible, which means that the baggage compartments above the seats are often crowded.
Fees are a way to persuade passengers, less on board.
O'Malley said the new fee is not really about money.
The most loyal customers of Frontier, have clearly expressed that it will be increasingly difficult to find space in the specialist on the seat.
Passengers who buy your tickets on the airline website, do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger on the flight climb of Frontier circumstances can take a bag for free, but the next person must pay $100 for a similar bag.
O'Malley said Frontier's website and check-in procedures would be changed so that the passengers are informed about the fee, before they come to Flugsteig.
The new Handgepäck fee of Frontier will only come into force in the summer, there is not a precise date.
Passengers often calling on baggage fees and other charges, but airlines resort to.
They argue that the cost of baggage money and passengers should pay this service, if they wanted it.
Many on Wall Street view the new luggage fees as a sign that the airlines enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
The most so far, however, the fingers of charges for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. three years ago first demanded and also followed Allegiant Air, a low-cost airlines for baggage charges.
The only other airline with such a fee was the Hungarian Wizz Air, the airline consultant Jay Sorensen, said the additional charges closely.
He estimated in a report in December 2011, that the Handgepäck fee Spirit einbringe USD 50 million a year.
Sorensen, who formerly held a leadership position in Midwest Airlines, has recently flown with Spirit and was curious what he would expect Flugsteig, when passengers were faced with the unusual Handgepäck fee of the company.
"The boarding process is one of the most smoothly, which I have seen in my career in the aviation," he said.
I expected to see gnashing and handgreifliche discussions on Flugsteig.
"The plane was full," he said, "and the boarding ran as lubricated."
Frontier is Spirit in the $2, the demand for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company said that passengers who bought lemonade or juice, kept the whole box and coffee gratis will recall.
Water is still free of charge.
Us Airways 2008 kurzzeitig attempted to demand money for soft drinks, but this was back seven months later, after passengers had complained and no major society nachgezogen.
Frontiers step to levy charges for hand luggage, if passengers do not buy directly from the airline, is the latest initiative, with the customers on the website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies like Orbitz 10 to $25 per ticket sold.
This provides an incentive for all societies, passengers to purchase directly from them, rather than through an online travel agency.
Frontier is in this area, however, has gone furthest.
In September, the company started booking through an online travel agency only half as many frequent flyer miles.
On Wednesday, the miles were again reduced to 25% of the flight.
A third flight booked with Frontier over 1,000 miles brings customers only 250 miles.
Passengers can also exclusively reserve the direct purchase on the website of Frontier jobs.
Frontier has a loyal customer base of his seat in Denver, but the business is shrinking and the company loses money.
The revenue declined 9 percent and the flight capacity fell nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, as we read in the financial report is published on Wednesday by the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc..
Republic has tried to get to grips with the finances of Frontier in the framework of the sale of the society.
