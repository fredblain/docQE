Ben Greenman: ten years New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
You could say that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: nearly one hundred years ago began the KÀ artist Frank Fay, who worked as a Conférencier at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, to the amount directly to tell jokes in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, Fays innovation, as most recently at the New York Comedy Festival.
Launched and managed by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the Stand-up institution, Caroline, the festival celebrates its 10th anniversary this year with more than 60 shows in small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of the headliner began in Caroline's and were always successful, until they were eventually too well known to act in a club," Hirsch said.
We have designed this festival, so that we can continue to work with them.
In this year's event, there are appearances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher as well as "stand Up for Heroes," an annual music and comedy fundraising event for military veterans in the Madison Square Garden, Roger Waters and Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Bill Cosby, among other things.
With the festival is also the world of comedy.
A number of comedians who participate in the festival this year, with more unconventional routes, such as programmes on smaller television channels like Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll was announced with a sitcom in cable television (the ironic schlüpfrige Fantasy Football Series "the League" to FXX), and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was both "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation"part of the occupation, although it is best known for its viral video "Marcel the shell with shoes on."
Both Kroll and Anthony Jeselnik, ironische, Slate and other young comedians with distinctive voices (the surreal pessimistische W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the dezentralisierten world of American comedy centered on racial issues.
One of the largest visitor magnets of the festival an interview: David Steinberg speaks with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but has become a respected television and film director and an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007 he hosted a television programme entitled "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" on TV Land.
The meeting will take place in the Town Hall in Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry's entire work," Steinberg said.
He told me that when he is here, then he can go through the alley between two buildings and thinks: Hey, if I lose all my money, then perhaps I live here.
