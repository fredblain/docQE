Security concerns grow in Mozambique in the face of clashes between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo's under the watchful eyes of a statue of Samora Machel, the founder and first president of Mozambique, in a rare public demonstration peace calls to thin air.
"We want peace, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, managing director of an investment company.
Fear for the future of the country they exchanged business attire for a T-shirt with the words "we call for security" in Portuguese and joined the crowd in Independence Square in the capital on Thursday.
For two weeks, there are almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, among the worst fighting since the peace agreement over 20 years ago.
RENAMO was once a notorious rebel movement, which was supported initially by white-ruled Rhodesia, and later by the apartheid government of South Africa in a bid to destabilise the country's independent government.
After the peace treaty of 1992, it has become an opposition party.
Analysts consider it unlikely that the country falls back into a full-scale conflict, but recent events have worried foreign investors and locals.
There is a great deal at stake for the fast-growing economy, since the discovery of huge gas deposits off the coast and coal camps in the north-west could investment of more than $50 billion in the coming years by companies like Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the US in the country.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo are blaming each other for the tension.
RENAMO claimed that the Government had provoked the recent clashes by its members on October 17, in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold Renamos, have attacked.
The attacks on the former Renamo rebels escalated, as government troops attacked Stützpunkte Renamos spokesman and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the group, said to the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accused the organisation to have attacked soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to downplay concerns about a instability.
On Wednesday, he told AFP, the French news agency, that Dhlakama as "losers," the "use all its remaining forces he wants to show that the government cannot impose its decisions."
Both Frelimo and Renamo to stress that they want to avoid a war.
But the concerns have increased since Mazanga, with the words quoted, RENAMO give the peace agreements of 1992.
He told the FT, he had meant that Frelimo no longer respecting the agreement.
"Our vision is to resume negotiations and seriously," Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have done little to resolve the tensions have been fueled by a series of clashes this year.
"We have two adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama), the heads collide," said Joseph Hanlon, lecturer at the Open University and expert on Mozambique.
None of them is good in bargaining and no one is prepared to make the necessary concessions.
RENAMO, which is pushing for electoral reform, has already said it will boycott the local elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt to kränkelnden movement, concessions and financial benefits from the government.
Renamos electoral successes schrumpfen since 1992, during a recent party, founded by a former Renamo member Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM), which are likely to improve the elections.
Mazanga said that Guebuza, whose resignation comes when his second term ends next year -- to destroy the country's democracy.
"He wants no multi-party democracy, it does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace, because he does not want to abandon the presidency," says Mazanga.
It is unclear what capacity Renamo, but it has taken on a major North-South connections disruptive attacks on police stations and vehicles.
Most of the fighting took place in the province of Sofala, a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo, Beira, is in the port, the export of coal mining companies like Rio Tinto and Vale.
In June, Rio disrupted the use of rail, a month after Renamo announced an attack on the track.
Mazanga responded cautiously to the question of whether Renamo will repeat this threat.
RENAMO wanted "the international community warn that the things in Mozambique are not good," Mazanga said.
The instability have increased frustration with the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Media Coop, an independent media company, because many people worried already because of the corruption, the slow progress in the development and a recent wave of kidnapping.
"People think that the government and the President are responsible for the future of the country, and it should be one of the solutions to the problems," he says.
Omar sultans, a demonstrator, said the people simply wanted stability.
"No interested Renamo and Frelimo, they just want to restore peace and usable roads," he said.
