Gutach: more safety for pedestrians
They are not 100 metres apart in Gutach: Tuesday is the new B 33 pedestrian traffic lights within the village car park has been in operation, in view of the older lights."
Two plants so close: intention or folly?
This issue has Gutachs mayor yesterday clearly answered.
"The hall light was installed, because this is the school," Eckert said yesterday.
The Kluser traffic safe both cyclists and bus passengers and the Bergle residents.
The official yesterday in genommene plant is important for the crossing area Sulzbachweg/Kirch road.
We have the museum, two churches, gardens, the bus, a doctor and a bank and the traffic flow from the residential area "Grub."
"The high volume of traffic and pedestrians to their safety in another light," says Eckert.
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold-Offenburg.
"According to current measurements about 12,000 vehicles on the B 33 daily through the municipality of Gutach, approximately 10% are heavy traffic," said Arnold.
It is therefore the construction of a more light than necessary: "security is easy," says Arnold.
All four transport Schauen have been carried out, including a roundabout was considered, but rejected because of the Sulzbachweg/Kirch road again in the crossing area.
It was all ausgetestet: "according to Arnold in the siting of traffic poles before using an extra trucks loaded with long wooden trunks for us, we have ausg from Sulzbachweg testing whether these vehicles on the B 33 ausfahren, without the light poles umzuknicken."
The approximately EUR 15,000 expensive traffic light itself is "modern, there is currently on the market," explained Arnold.
The machine is equipped with coloured LEDs, which glow so strongly that the lights of the drivers, for example, in deep of sun are good to see.
And it is also: the older lights consume about 100 watts, the new just eight watts.
Per direction, there are three lights.
Arnold said the new equipment: this is equipped with two radar sensors.
Expresses the pedestrian lights, testing the upper button radar sensor the transport situation.
The road is free, directly Green for the pedestrians, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor can be finished checking Grünphase for the pedestrians.
"If a group or disabled people on the streets, the Grünphase extended, it is everyone safe on the road," said Arnold.
Of course, should the driver here as your partner and monitor the road.
This was not the case yesterday, hardly showed the green light for pedestrians, rauschte a luxury vehicle with red piping.
