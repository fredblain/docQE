The new Opschlag shines with a new cafe.
One, the hotel and Wiederkommen.
One, the name of the programme.
According to the dictionary, Déjà Vu is defined as a psychological phenomenon that reflected in the feeling, to have seen before or a new situation.
In the case of the visit of the cafés on Opschlag in the district town of Kleve in sight distance to university Rhine-Waal is not in the pure sense of a déjà vu.
Finally, the cafe with the beautiful name exactly the aim: to make a real stay not only gedanklich, but hand always wiederkehrend experience.
Because it's fun and simply beautiful.
A look into the interior at the Opschlag 8 gives the viewer a good feeling.
The modern, but not cool cafe environment looks like a place to relax.
Here, the team with the Gründern Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top of the guest with different types of coffee or cocktail.
It's delicious cakes or individually-sourced fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, have already made a name before the opening of the schmucken cafés on Opschlag as art: in Kranenburg, the "Art Lounge."
The move to Kleve on Opschlag hope the Café lovers more sympathetic audience.
Last but not least, by the university.
"And we do not have a specific target," said Daniel Büttner.
We would like to raise the two young students here just as seniors and all ages in between.
Speaking of coffee-lovers.
The likeable owner couple stands behind the coffee enjoyment.
Enjoy the fragrant hot brew in the various forms.
Expressofan
Daniel Büttner is Expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the cappuccino Trinkerin.
"A baguette- that is my thing," she tells the NRZ.
Two events there's even in the bright cafe.
Better said one.
Because the harbour festival took place outside rather than the Déjà Vu Cafe not benefited.
But there was also the Ringelnatz evening.
"Beautiful, successful and funny," the two 33-year-olds.
But not Jedermanns.
Perhaps Daniel Büttner is therefore not a ausgesprochener fan of event evenings: "it's now not all right."
And I always speak with an event only, which is also interested in the special event.
That is why events are the exception rather be with us.
"We want to disturb the normal operation as little as possible."
Should read: Déjà Vu is also for reliability.
In terms of the quality of the products offered, as well as on the team and the beautiful surroundings at Opschlag in Kleve.
The road, which is more and more of a mile.
To the delight of Klever, guests from near and far, and the students, to discover the gastronomic mile and the café Déjà Vu.
