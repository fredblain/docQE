Rules for electronic devices on planes remain in Australia for the time being in force
Australian passengers must continue to tablets and smartphones when starting and landing off, despite efforts to relax regulations for such equipment in the United States.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US airlines to change their guidelines so that passengers could read e-books, watch videos or play on their flight instruments during critical phases, provided that these are in "flight mode."
While the bulk of the flight passengers is already permitted, but many people find it annoying that the launch and landing their e-books is not allowed to read it.
Australian companies are watching the decision to pursue the implementation of the US airlines have a lot of work, but no immediate plans to amend its rules.
The aviation security authority, also said it will look at the announcement, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical phases of flight in Australia still apply.
"The CASA currently has no specific rules on the use of electronic devices in aircraft," verlautbart.
The issue is subject to provisions requiring airlines and passengers must follow the safety instructions given by the cabin crew to maintain the security at any time.
Virgin has already held talks with the CASA on a use expand its in-flight Wi-Fi entertainment system and said it is open to changes, but this must be initiated by the legislator.
"We would welcome a review of the authorisation of electronic devices by the CASA, because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience, we now offer wireless entertainment) (during the flight," said a spokesman.
Qantas said that we are going to stick to the current rules.
"Our current directives stipulate that electronic equipment should not be used in the launch and landing, and we currently have no plans to change that," the company said.
The FAA rules apply to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations, which can benefit passengers, and we will certainly look carefully at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The decision is in US companies vary depending on the age of the fleet.
They need to demonstrate that their planes can tolerate radio interference from mobile devices and manuals, training materials, baggage programs and customer training.
"After the airline confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can be easier for passengers using portable electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any height," the FAA announced.
In rare cases, poor visibility during the landing, the crew will instruct the passengers to the equipment.
In addition, the group recommended schwerere devices when starting and landing safely under the seat or in the overhead.
