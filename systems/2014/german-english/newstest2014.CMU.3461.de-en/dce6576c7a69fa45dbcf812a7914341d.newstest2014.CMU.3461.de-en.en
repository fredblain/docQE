Mick Jagger said that he had never angemacht Katy Perry, when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week the pop star said she had worked as a singer of Jagger's song "Old Habits," from 2004.
Perry said that she had dinner with the Altrocker, and that "he has angebaggert me when I was 18."
She added: "this is a long time ago, and he was very nice to me."
A representative of Jaggers, 70, said in a statement on Thursday that he "categorically denies that he ever made overtures to Katy Perry."
The representative added: "perhaps she confused him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album "Prism" landed at number 1 this week.
