The throwaway society is not
The night was long, the music loud and the mood is good, but it is home.
However, in the bellies of the people on the front and rear seat is the hunger.
Of course, this may be responsible for a cocktail or champagne.
What is more, as gechillt go to the next Drive-In, to take a bite?
I admit that I am pleased, when it comes to fast-food Holen late at night or early morning.
A few chips, a Coke, a Burger and then nothing like home and to bed.
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco gamers.
What must a lack that steter Regelmässigkeit raises its fast-food bags from the car window?
In particular, the weekends weggeworfene paper bags on road edges and parking.
"Why?" question.
The people are too dim to take the bags home) until the next garbage?
It is not just that the paper Zeugs the landscape verschandelt.
Bags have also covered transport facilities as barriers and caused by accidents.
So what does this "throwaway society" but not, presumably, they do not even know what that word means.
If you travel often, especially with several people in the car, you know, like a Rückbank nights can be celebrated, clothes, bottles and other rubbish are.
A few bags would represent more or less but nix food scraps in contrast to the road, where no other rum trampeln.
I can already see the day when the areas to the cities and communities require for their bags Pfand blöd and the fast-food chains.
