Egypt first freely elected president sworn
Mohamed Morsi sets the Amtseid, but his day of triumph should not mean the end of the political disputes in Egypt.
The Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a "new Egypt" as he was sworn in as the country's first freely elected president and the succession of Hosni Mubarak, was driven from office 16 months ago.
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the Arab world's first freely elected Islamist president and Egypt's fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He took the oath before the 18 judges of the Court, which has its headquarters on the Nile and dressed in black robes is based on an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We seek a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," Morsi said at the ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.
"Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundation of a new life -- absolute freedom, a genuine democracy and stability," said the 60-year-old Morsi, a U.S.-trained engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group, since its inception 84 years ago a banned organisation had been severely targeted by the government.
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building as Morsi arrived shortly after 11 p.m. local time in a small car convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered before the court, to the new president zuzujubeln, and, unlike the presidential pomp of the Mubarak era, the traffic was only briefly stopped so that the car convoy was able to cross the usually busy road linking the city centre with the southern suburbs.
Derided as the Brotherhood's uncharismatic "spare tire," his personal prestige has grown since his victory and a Friday speech, when he presented itself not only as a candidate of the Islamists, but all those who wanted to bring to the efforts of the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubarak goal.
"Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," Morsi said in a blue suit with a red tie dress the judges in the panelled chamber in which he Amtseid ablegte.
Later, Morsi went to the University of Cairo, where his inaugural speech.
He was officially welcomed by an army band played the national anthem, which he zuhörte on eight possessions.
The military leader Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
On his arrival, he was of hundreds of people in the main auditorium of the University of Sprechchören of "the army and the people are one hand."
The University of Cairo, built in 1908 as a bastion secular education has become a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahir Square, the birthplace of the uprising that ended Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year, and vowed to reclaim presidential powers, the Militärrat gejagten from office by the head of state.
But, with the departure of the official oath before the court and not as usual, before Parliament, it is the will of the military, which indicates that the power struggle will continue.
Morsi's speech in Tahir Square was filled with dramatic populist gestures.
