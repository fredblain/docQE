<seg id="1">Schools are encouraged to greater focus on math, spelling and grammar</seg>
<seg id="2">In courses in English literature, pupils must at least a play by Shakespeare, a novel of the 19th century, romantic lyricism and contemporary British novels from 1914 to deal with in the future.</seg>
<seg id="3">The audit also "combat texts" are to encourage broader reading too.</seg>
<seg id="4">The combined rate of English literature and language will be abolished.</seg>
<seg id="5">From 2015, pupils need a separate GCSEs examination of language, with strong incentives for English literature as a separate qualification.</seg>

<seg id="9">In a speech in the summer of Education Minister Michael Gove, that there is a broad consensus that we will need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence, "he stressed, which would be" more challenging GCSEs, ambitious and strict, "said.</seg>
<seg id="10">Studies show that less time will be spent on mathematics in English schools - 116 hours per year, or three hours per week per school year - than in most other countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">In contrast, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours a year, and students in Singapore will receive 138 hours.</seg>
<seg id="12">While there will be no formal requirement to provide more time in the curriculum for maths, but from coalition circles, it means the extensive math test, combined with a greater weighting of the compartment in rankings - will probably encourage schools to have more hours.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the curriculum more emphasis on "problems in real life," including financial mathematics.</seg>

<seg id="1">Through the mud, rivers and jungle for free medical care</seg>
<seg id="2">Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care to remote villages in Cameroon</seg>
<seg id="3">Bwelle and his team spend to treat almost every weekend, hundreds of patients</seg>
<seg id="4">In the West African country, there are not many doctors, only one in 5,000 people</seg>
<seg id="5">Here you agree or with your mobile device</seg>
<seg id="6">Dr. Georges Bwelle Heroes of 2013 is among the top 10 of the "CNN."</seg>
<seg id="7">You can do for him or any of the other heroes in the top 10 vote to elect him to the "CNN Hero of the Year."</seg>
<seg id="8">The winner receives $250,000 to continue its extraordinary work.</seg>
<seg id="9">21 years, Georges Bwelle looked at how his sick father repeatedly lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals that did not have the resources to help him.</seg>
<seg id="10">In 1981 Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.</seg>
<seg id="11">First, he had a broken arm, but then an inflammation that extended to his brain and caused a haematoma that would affect him for the rest of his life.</seg>
<seg id="12">"There was no neuro-surgeon in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.</seg>
<seg id="13">We have released him from Cameroon, if we had the money.</seg>
<seg id="14">Instead, Bwelle years spent to accompany his father into overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment that they had to offer.</seg>
<seg id="15">"It is not easy," Bwelle comments.</seg>
<seg id="16">You can leave the house at five o'clock in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, and will not, however.</seg>
<seg id="17">There are very many patients.</seg>
<seg id="18">Indeed, some people die, because they have to wait.</seg>
<seg id="19">The situation has changed little since Bwelles father died in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.</seg>
<seg id="21">In contrast, the ratio is in the United States with a doctor for 413 people.</seg>
<seg id="22">But even if there was a doctor for them, most Cameroonians could not afford the visit.</seg>
<seg id="23">Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of health spending in the country are private.</seg>
<seg id="24">"The only problem we have is," poverty, Bwelle says.</seg>
<seg id="25">And the poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.</seg>
<seg id="26">His father, and so many of his compatriots are suffering caused to mature in Bwelle decided to do something about it.</seg>
<seg id="27">Dr. Georges Bwelle and his voluntary team held 700 free operations last year.</seg>
<seg id="28">He was even a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.</seg>
<seg id="29">He also founded a nonprofit organization called ASCO Vime, which travels at weekends in rural areas and free medical care.</seg>
<seg id="30">Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="31">He almost every Friday and up to 30 people force in minibuses and drive up to the medical equipment on the roof over unbefestigtes terrain in the villages, need the help.</seg>
<seg id="32">Not always everything runs smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="33">More than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.</seg>
<seg id="34">But when they arrive, they are greeted like heroes: A feast, singing and dancing, and the best accommodation, the place has to offer.</seg>
<seg id="35">In these villages, free medical care is really a cause for celebration and Bwelle - with his broad smile and his boundless energy - the joyful celebration.</seg>
<seg id="36">The next morning, the team begins with the investigation of hundreds of patients.</seg>
<seg id="37">"We treat 500 people per trip," Bwelle.</seg>
<seg id="38">You come from a radius of 60 kilometers around the village - and on foot.</seg>
<seg id="39">Each of these weekend clinics offer medical care in a number of areas.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many people are being treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.</seg>
<seg id="41">Others receive crutches, donated glasses or free birth certificates, a document that is required for the school, but many poor families simply cannot.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the evening, the team simple operations with local anesthetic performs.</seg>
<seg id="43">The operations typically take place in a school, the town hall or an apartment; after the procedure, the patient to stand and walk in the recreation area to make room for the next person.</seg>
<seg id="44">The lighting for the operation and disinfection equipment is powered by a generator of the group and so Bwelle and his volunteer work until the early hours on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="45">It is an arduous work, but the village musicians usually help, motivated to keep the team.</seg>
<seg id="46">"They drum all night, so we stay awake and able to continue our work," says Bwelle.</seg>
<seg id="47">On Sunday, the team moves back into the city, tired but proud of the work that has been done.</seg>
<seg id="48">The group - a mixture of Cameroon foreign doctors and medical students - 700 last year has carried out free operations and know that they are with their work makes an enormous difference to the people it helps.</seg>
<seg id="49">A man explained that the free operation of a work that he had received to work him now and again.</seg>
<seg id="50">"It changes the future of my family," the man said.</seg>
<seg id="51">In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon at the hospital Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.</seg>
<seg id="52">This second job, he is financed by 60% of its charitable activities, Bwelle; the rest come from private donations.</seg>
<seg id="53">"I really do not know when he sleeps," Katie O'Malley, who studied in the second year at Drexel University in Philadelphia medicine and voluntarily participate in Bwelles group says.</seg>
<seg id="54">He is always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization, so that he can go to these campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="55">For medical and nursing students such as O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe and support Bwelle, this is an opportunity to gather practical experience that they would never get at home.</seg>
<seg id="56">"We can be involved in operations, where we help blood abzutupfen or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwelle," says O'Malley.</seg>
<seg id="57">That would be in America as a medical student in the second year never possible.</seg>
<seg id="58">The students pay for their trip to Cameroon usually bring themselves and often donated medical equipment.</seg>
<seg id="59">But they are only once in Yaoundé, Bwelle accommodation, transport and guide.</seg>
<seg id="60">"He is very" undoubtedly a hero, O'Malley said.</seg>
<seg id="61">He has devoted his life to this organization and his desire to help the people of Cameroon knows no borders.</seg>
<seg id="62">Bwelle for the almost constant work is not a burden.</seg>
<seg id="63">To help others to a more fortunate life, and to fulfill a promise he made to his father, gives him great pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="64">"I am so happy when I make this work," says Bwelle.</seg>
<seg id="65">And I think of my father.</seg>
<seg id="66">I hope he sees what I do.</seg>
<seg id="67">I do it to bring people back to laugh and to alleviate the pain.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pope Francis appoints first cardinals in February</seg>
<seg id="2">Pope Francis new cardinals will call on 22 February, for the first time, the Catholic Church, the Vatican announced on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Cardinals senior clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope, and they are the ones who are choosing a pope, Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately be involved in the choice of his successor.</seg>
<seg id="4">Currently, there are 201 cardinals.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, a cardinal who has reached the age of 80 years, can no longer take part in the election - this is a group of 120 "electorate Cardinals."</seg>
<seg id="6">In a statement, in which the news was announced, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman said there will be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony for the appointment of the new cardinals will be held, which is also known as a consistory.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Pope Francis has decided to give his decision on the holding of by in February in advance so that other meetings that require the attendance of Cardinals from around the world can be planned," Lombardi said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Jack Valero of Catholic Voices, said that the number of voting cardinals will probably be dropped until February.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that a pope normally take so many cardinals as necessary, so that the number of eligible cardinals measured over 120, and so many cardinals over 80, as he would like.</seg>
<seg id="10">The consistory next year is so important because it is the first since the election of Francis in March of this year, Valero.</seg>
<seg id="11">Currently, there is a certain overhang on the part of Europe, and especially in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It will be interesting to see whether the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to redress the balance," he said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of Cardinals.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Cardinals will also be the first to be appointed since the formation of the Council of Cardinals founded by Francis to find a group of eight Cardinals from around the world who have a mandate to reform the church.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the past, the pope decided everything alone.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Now that Francis has selected eight cardinals that will help him," Valero said.</seg>
<seg id="17">He said that it was "quite possible" that Francis ask the Cardinals for advice.</seg>
<seg id="18">But we have not been in this situation - that is all very new.</seg>
<seg id="19">Valero said that the bishops would typically recruited from great places to Cardinals, but Francis "was full of surprises, we do not know whom he appoints."</seg>

<seg id="1">Europe's elite prepared to do business with Britain?</seg>
<seg id="2">Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to the table and to define what those who care in Britain for prosperity and work to change in our relations with the EU.</seg>
<seg id="3">To this end, we have been the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders and asked them what they think about Britain, the economy and the EU.</seg>
<seg id="4">YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business leaders, the roughly the British company sizes, sectors and regions.</seg>
<seg id="5">The results of the survey will surprise many.</seg>
<seg id="6">We have found that the vast majority of companies now exports outside Europe and focuses on countries which modernize and grow, while the states are languishing in the EU.</seg>
<seg id="7">You wish that the government of new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil are favoured, rather than the long and arduous process, the obscure to reform EU institutions.</seg>
<seg id="8">Asked about their views on specific legal issues, from antitrust law to the product legislation - the majority of business leaders, believes that the control of this key competences should be returned to Westminster.</seg>
<seg id="9">There was widespread dissatisfaction with the single market, as the cost of the Brussels rules, according to the companies would now outweigh the benefits to be part of Europe's trade zone - even 40 percent of large companies agreed to this, which are traditionally the most Europhile.</seg>
<seg id="10">Finally, and this is probably the most, our survey of business leaders showed that a clear majority of Britain wants a course in the direction of change of the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not on politics.</seg>
<seg id="11">This finding, which can be found in companies of all sizes and leading corporations, shows that the economy is pushing for a "meaningful change," which brings the tiller back to Britain.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is about much - a change of the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead at 16 percent to change its mind to stay in the EU in a referendum.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Prime Minister should have no doubts: This survey shows that the British economy behind his plan for the renegotiation of Britain's terms of EU membership.</seg>
<seg id="14">It also shows that the companies expect a renegotiation of a significant shift in the balance of power back to Britain.</seg>
<seg id="15">A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary after the eurozone is moving in the direction of a closer economic and fiscal union.</seg>
<seg id="16">The priority should be jobs and growth in Britain, as the results of our survey shows what companies will mean a greater emphasis on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulation.</seg>

<seg id="7">The debate proposal outlines 12 measures that were once considered by the former immigration minister Chris Bowen.</seg>
<seg id="8">Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was yesterday to talk about people smuggling in Sri Lanka, has converted five of the recommended changes, the others are still being considered.</seg>

<seg id="1">Halloween 2013: In</seg>
<seg id="2">When I was a child, Halloween was something magical.</seg>
<seg id="3">My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, grew late and clad in the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="4">Today, I am more for the Halloween rings.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the last two years, I have said I am not prepared to distribute sweets from my apartment, and it will probably not do this year.</seg>
<seg id="6">But, according to the statistics, I am a black sheep on Halloween.</seg>
<seg id="7">The majority of Americans - 158 million, to be exact - celebrate Halloween this year, giving it a total of 6.9 billion US dollars for candy, costumes and decorations, the American Association of retailers pulling.</seg>
<seg id="8">One thing that I am every Halloween then again, are the trend values.</seg>
<seg id="9">The costumes are approximately 1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, the principal.</seg>
<seg id="10">This year, provocative inanimate objects are the rage.</seg>
<seg id="11">Women must no longer remain in sexy clothes, they can now also tempting foods such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="12">When it comes to men, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet that speaking about Daft Punk-punk space men will this year in the Instagram feeds.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to Google zombies, Batman, pirates and witches are the most wanted costumes.</seg>
<seg id="14">I suspect that there is nothing wrong with tradition.</seg>
<seg id="15">We have our dogs dressed last year, and to my surprise, were not alone.</seg>
<seg id="16">In fact, Americans spend $330 million this year for costumes of their pets, the principal.</seg>
<seg id="17">That is a lot of "Hot Dogs."</seg>
<seg id="18">As for sweets, we are not squeamish.</seg>
<seg id="19">This year, Americans will spend $1.9 billion, as The Nielsen Company.</seg>
<seg id="20">That is about 270 million kilograms of chocolate bars, Lutschern, candies and Gummi.</seg>
<seg id="21">That is good news for the US Department of Commerce 41 million people with the slogan "or sour" through the quarters.</seg>
<seg id="22">In fact, we will buy about 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and - let us not delude ourselves - to eat.</seg>
<seg id="23">The only thing we don't want to consume is the sugar-sweet candy corn; however, 15 million kilograms of which will be sold for Halloween, the National Association of confectionery manufacturer.</seg>
<seg id="24">That is about nine billion corn grains.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is a mystery that I could not solve.</seg>
<seg id="26">Nothing is more on Halloween than houses where there are haunting.</seg>
<seg id="27">You have great names like "terror Behind the Walls" (which, incidentally, is in a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock."</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognised haunted houses in the United States, which will reach $500 million revenue, as America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photographs of National straight into the pants and friends on Facebook, where you get rid of them, and then the guy that you leave a comment like "nice facial expression."</seg>
<seg id="29">But we come to the tariff mouthful.</seg>
<seg id="30">Charlie Brown made us with the Great pumpkin, when we were children, and the carving a pumpkin lantern is like the jewellery of the Christmas tree - something that we have made.</seg>
<seg id="31">Fortunately, the "baby in the pumpkin" trend began only last year thanks to Pinte rest, so most of us have grown up with it, the pumpkin zurechtzuschnitzen and not to sit in it.</seg>
<seg id="32">This year, Americans will spend about $106 million for pumpkins, according to the US Census Bureau.</seg>
<seg id="33">The pumpkin lantern, which rots slowly in the front yard, probably comes from Illinois, where this year were harvested 245 million kilograms of pumpkins.</seg>

<seg id="6">In years of talks, which began in 2005, the government had pushed for public tenders for the leases.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tenants were against it, and also wanted longer maturities.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2009, the leases were extended for the companies at the Circular Quay, which provided the Obeids $2.5 million a year, without a public tender.</seg>

<seg id="1">NSA revelations reinforce corporate paranoia about government surveillance</seg>
<seg id="2">On a mild day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew low over the US consulate in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.</seg>
<seg id="3">On the instructions of the Federal Office of Constitutional Protection and terrorism (BAT), the German domestic intelligence service, he should be the roof of the U.S. outpost photograph, less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to German media, the BAT wanted to prove the existence of surveillance antenna and the action led to an exchange of words between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="5">James Clapper, U.S. Director of National Intelligence, was again in September, saying that the United States is no possibilities of foreign espionage, "the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies to steal their international competitiveness and could increase their profits."</seg>
<seg id="6">But since Edward Snowden, a former employee of the whistleblowers, with the publication of his filling Horn of U.S. surveillance secrets, are European governments and corporate executives no longer sure whether they can take the director at his word.</seg>
<seg id="7">Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency spied on Petrobras, the Brazilian oil company and American data cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo has acquired, the company's paranoia about government surveillance to a new high.</seg>
<seg id="8">The last straw was the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone was verwanzt, possibly for the last 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="9">If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, business lines are certainly potential targets.</seg>
<seg id="10">Snowden has the intensive cooperation between US intelligence services and companies more transparent.</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is conceivable that these data will be used for mutual benefit.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Germany needs to wake up," said Oliver Green, president of the BITMi, small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="13">German companies believe that the United States is now almost as great a risk as China when it was about industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by the consulting firm EY.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the documents leaked by Snowden, however, there was no evidence so far that the US has passed on the trade secrets of foreign companies to own companies.</seg>
<seg id="15">Politicians have expressed their concern that the EU certain IT and Internet facilities were missing and they reduce their dependence on the United States.</seg>
<seg id="16">The companies are sceptical.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Bundestag, it was suggested that we should build a German Google.</seg>
<seg id="18">I can close my eyes and open them slowly....</seg>
<seg id="19">"So it works, Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software maker SAP said.</seg>
<seg id="20">If you have a strong European IT industry would have wanted, then you would have them 20 years ago to extinction.</seg>
<seg id="21">Everything in Germany is subsidized by the coal on cars to agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="22">Everything except for the IT industry.</seg>
<seg id="23">Yet reach and technical sophistication of the Snowden leaks revealed US spy agencies shocked firms that previously the biggest espionage risk had seen in China.</seg>
<seg id="24">The cloud computing will be a big change, because European business leaders are now aware that stored data in the United States are subject to the jurisdiction and therefore are potentially at risk.</seg>
<seg id="25">According to one of the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade body, rejected poll after the revelations about the US data mining activities with Prism about ten percent of the non-members residing in the United States plans to use an American company.</seg>
<seg id="26">Jim Snabe, deputy chief executive of SAP, said: "We see a new issue of customers that there was not yet a year ago - it is: Where is my data will be stored and you can guarantee that they are physically in this area of law?"</seg>
<seg id="27">Many German business leaders argue that the recent reports confirm just what they already knew anyway, namely that powerful states must want to steal their most valuable secrets, and they are therefore guarded at any price.</seg>
<seg id="28">The fact that economic espionage, is no surprise.</seg>
<seg id="29">It has always been this way.</seg>
<seg id="30">"It was an issue for many years and has" by the current discussion not fundamentally changed, Kurt Bock, chairman of the chemical company BASF said.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Americans spy on commercial and industrial level, as we do this, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.</seg>
<seg id="32">The company does not normally on the action we have taken, which affords attackers benefits.</seg>
<seg id="33">Employees in large companies have long eingebläut that the export of a free USB sticks at a trade fair or the unguarded left a laptop in a hotel room is not advisable, to say the least.</seg>
<seg id="34">Ulrich Hackenberk, board member at automaker Audi, said that it was standard practice for years, before a board meeting to collect the phones, so that they cannot be used as a luxury.</seg>
<seg id="35">The German BAT advises executives, simple prepaid phones to use when they go on foreign trips, possibly because smartphones can be compromised.</seg>
<seg id="36">The prepaid phones will be thrown away.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, there is a concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.</seg>
<seg id="38">In Germany, many of these companies are global leaders in their respective niche.</seg>
<seg id="39">"Small and medium-sized companies often lack the experience, the staff and financial resources to protect company secrets effectively against unauthorized access," warns the BAT in a report.</seg>
<seg id="40">The US company warn against economic espionage by other countries.</seg>
<seg id="41">According to the Washington Post, the US National Intelligence Estimate in February, France, Russia and Israel behind China filed in two of the countries that used for the procurement of economic data of the Hackings.</seg>
<seg id="42">A member of a German blue-chip company agreed to when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst."</seg>
<seg id="43">Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French domestic intelligence service DCRL, was quoted in an interview this month with the following words: "The intelligence services know very well that all countries, even if they work together in the fight against terror, spy on their allies."</seg>

<seg id="1">Rescue package of 325 million Australian dollars for Tasman's health</seg>
<seg id="2">The Australian government insists on the harsh conditions of the rescue package of 325 million Australian dollars are linked to the Tasmanian health care to ensure that the state government should not waste the money.</seg>
<seg id="3">Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth would take "immediate measures" to avert a crisis that has been caused by an ageing population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic disease and system constraints.</seg>
<seg id="4">The funding for a period of four years, was decided after government consultations with Tasmanian Independent MP Andrew Wilkie.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The government has put together an emergency rescue package, which, in our view, the unique challenges faced by the state," Plibersek said today.</seg>
<seg id="6">The 325-million-dollar package includes $31 million in emergency aid for election results.</seg>
<seg id="7">By further 2,600 operations, including orthopedic surgery and treatments for eye cataracts, residues are to be eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition, there is money for daily clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better aftercare for inpatient stays, the specialist training, mental health services and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="9">"These investments are in line with the ideas that affected clinic employees have told me that they are the best way to improve the health care system," Tasmanian Tanya Plibersek said.</seg>
<seg id="10">The minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability of the Tasmanian government.</seg>
<seg id="11">The state needs to maintain the current level of funding to be able to receive money from the Commonwealth, and monthly report on where the extra money has been spent.</seg>
<seg id="12">A three-member commission will be set up and is designed to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.</seg>
<seg id="13">As Wilkie said today, 325 million dollars of little use if "they are not accompanied by real reforms that bring the public Tasmanian health system on a more sustainable course."</seg>
<seg id="14">Nevertheless, he praised the government that they have responded to his request for urgent aid, which he first expressed to the prime minister at the beginning of May.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I am confident that the federal aid will make a major contribution to the public health system of the state of the list of worries," Wilkie said.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to the state government this election services are largely offset the recent cuts.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the health spokesman for the opposition at the federal level, Peter Dutton, believes that the announcement today is only a "Band-Aid solution."</seg>
<seg id="18">"We are therefore in the current situation, because the lab-state government 430 million dollars, has withdrawn from the health system," he said on ABC TV.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is not acceptable that a state government is nearly half a billion dollars from the system and the Commonwealth sticks 300 million and then do so when it is good news.</seg>
<seg id="20">Dutton urged Plibersek to guarantee that a single dollar of the rescue package will not be spent on additional bureaucracy.</seg>

<seg id="7">The report said that the judge should be released from the case, as the code of conduct for American judges have violated, is determined that a judge the appearance of partiality to avoid; this was partly with a series of media interviews and public statements, in which they publicly responded to the criticism of the court.</seg>

<seg id="2">Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who had come in the 2002 bombing in Bali killed over the verdict reacted angrily to the last of the instigators, which has been brought to justice, because Umar Patek, in their view, should be shot.</seg>
<seg id="3">Patek, who was nearly ten years as one of the most wanted persons in Southeast Asia on the run, was sentenced yesterday for his role in the construction of explosives for the bombing to a sentence of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="4">With punitive suspension, he could be released after 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="5">The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many more were injured.</seg>
<seg id="6">A guilty verdict also took place in a series of terrorism-related charges, including a wave of bomb attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.</seg>
<seg id="7">The prosecution had demanded a life sentence, even if it is referred to the man who "because of his reputation as a master bomb-maker known as" Demolition Man, asking for the death penalty could have.</seg>
<seg id="8">The decision has aroused painful memories in June Corteen, a mother from Perth, which has lost its 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the Patek and his Mitverschwörern almost ten years of devastation.</seg>
<seg id="9">Fighting with tears, she said, should be sentenced to death had Patek.</seg>
<seg id="10">I really believe that he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.</seg>
<seg id="11">"We should put him in front of a firing squad," said Corteen told AAP.</seg>
<seg id="12">I have to live with it every day that I will have no further grandchildren, and I will never see my daughters.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Sari Club has been razed to the ground when a powerful bomb exploded on October 12, 2002, shortly after 11 p.m. in a small truck, which was parked in front of the nightclub.</seg>
<seg id="14">Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar, where only 20 seconds left before a suicide bombers explode a backpack filled with explosives.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the attack, he fell into a coma for a month and "died" three times while he was on a life support system.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hughes said Patek have earned the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah, Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra - who were responsible for the massacre and were executed four years ago.</seg>
<seg id="17">Really, this guy should get the death penalty before any other.</seg>
<seg id="18">To keep him alive - no, there is no reason to keep him alive.</seg>
<seg id="19">For 20 years after he killed 202 people and injured hundreds, is not much.</seg>
<seg id="20">Patek is the last of the Bali bomber, who was in court.</seg>
<seg id="21">He cheated nearly a decade of the arrest, but was finally in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, picked up where US forces less than four months later, the former al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden killed.</seg>
<seg id="22">During the trial, an FBI agent said that intelligence reports had provided the reference that Patek was in Pakistan, in order to meet bin Laden with the aim of the link between Southeast Asian terror groups and al-Qaida to rebuild.</seg>
<seg id="23">"He has not asked, Corteen said.</seg>
<seg id="24">Until recently, he has shown no remorse for the way he has a great deal of suffering to other people.</seg>
<seg id="25">The ruling was issued before the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, which is celebrated with commemorations in Bali and Australia.</seg>
<seg id="26">"This year, there will be many tears," said Corteen.</seg>
<seg id="27">Patek may object to his judgment or appeal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Profits at Bombardier to decline in numbers and supply contracts</seg>
<seg id="2">The Canadian aerospace and rail manufacturer Bombardier Inc on Thursday reported a 15-percent decline in net profit, due to declining orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and contract problems in the rail division under pressure.</seg>
<seg id="3">Bombardier, based in Montreal, released a flight test data for his brand-new CSeries aircraft and gave no new information as to whether the plane could go under the ambitious timetable next September in commercial use.</seg>
<seg id="4">The maiden flight of the test aircraft, one and a half months, only three more starts, what it is calling the testing phase is proceeding as planned so far followed.</seg>
<seg id="5">The results fell short of forecasts and led to a drop of more than eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.</seg>
<seg id="6">Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, on Thursday lowered its rating of "outperform" "performance sector" in view of the fact that the stock has over the next one to two quarters of a limited course potential.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Although weaker sales figures were expected on planes, but the margins of development in the transport sector, we are clearly disappointed," Doerksen said in a client.</seg>
<seg id="8">We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries, if the test program is progressing on the plane.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, if no new orders will be announced in the coming months, we expect the market to be more sceptical towards the program.</seg>
<seg id="10">Bombardier hopes that the series of the CSeries aircraft can catapult the company into the lower end of the market, which is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.</seg>
<seg id="11">The first test plane was presented to the public in March, after months of delays and flew for the first time in September.</seg>
<seg id="12">But so far, binding orders are for the CSeries with 177 moderate, as potential buyers wait for the results of the flight tests and see whether the claims of the company in terms of fuel efficiency and cost-saving potential of the new commercial jet aircraft are correct.</seg>
<seg id="13">Currently, there are a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.</seg>
<seg id="14">CEO Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will achieve its goal of 300 binding orders at the start of the commercial use of the jets.</seg>
<seg id="15">The company said on Thursday with analysts and media, the program is on schedule.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The test aircraft is no longer than expected, remained on the ground," said Beaudoin during a telephone conference and added that during the lifetime of the aircraft were ground tests and software updates have been scheduled.</seg>
<seg id="17">Each manufacturer is planning.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have decided to take a first flight and then add a review period, what we have done.</seg>
<seg id="19">This happens during the entire flight program.</seg>
<seg id="20">The second of five test planes will probably start in the coming weeks, the remaining shortly afterwards, it said corporate side.</seg>
<seg id="21">However, analysts remain skeptical that the first customer to 12 months after its maiden flight, take a CSeries aircraft in operation.</seg>
<seg id="22">Bombardier said it checked the planning of the operation (EIS), and will update them in the next few months.</seg>
<seg id="23">"The slow progress of the flight test - even if they are obviously BOMBARDIERS internal planning - reinforces our view that the commissioning of the first quarter of 2015, Doerksen said.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the third quarter with the end on 30 September BOMBARDIERS net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share a year earlier.</seg>
<seg id="25">The adjusted earnings per share is unchanged 9 cents.</seg>
<seg id="26">Sales fell slightly, from 4.2 to 4.1 billion dollars.</seg>
<seg id="27">Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and sales of EUR 4,56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.</seg>
<seg id="28">The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer indicates that he had delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter, a decline of 57 last year.</seg>
<seg id="29">The net orders fell from 83 airplanes to 26.</seg>
<seg id="30">The order book in the aerospace division amounted to 32.9 billion dollars on 30 September, and was unchanged from December 31.</seg>
<seg id="31">"In the field of aerospace, the results were in line with our targets, but the low order intake and the overall market conditions were" disappointing, Beaudoin said.</seg>
<seg id="32">Turnover in the aerospace division fell by 13 percent to $2 billion.</seg>
<seg id="33">Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, announced that sales in this area has increased by nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.</seg>
<seg id="34">The order book in the transport sector amounted to $32.6 billion at September 30, and has increased to 31 December.</seg>
<seg id="35">The profit margin in the field of transport has been hampered by handling problems in some big contracts.</seg>
<seg id="36">According to corporate governance, there will be new requirements for the fourth quarter.</seg>
<seg id="37">In afternoon trading on Thursday announced the Bombardier-share by 8.5 percent and stood at 4,83 Canadian dollars, after it was announced that the Google Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette will switch to the board.</seg>
<seg id="38">Brazil's Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and BOMBARDIERS closest rival, on Thursday reported a 10% drop in quarterly profit.</seg>

<seg id="13">The FAA regulations apply to US airlines.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, we are always interested in developments in regulations, which can benefit passengers, and the FAA decision and the reasons behind it certainly exactly.</seg>
<seg id="15">The decision affects of US companies differently depending on the age of the fleet.</seg>
<seg id="16">You have to prove that their planes, the radio interference from mobile devices can tolerate, and manuals, training materials, hand luggage programs as well as customers instruction.</seg>
<seg id="17">"After the airline confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can passengers using portable, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smart phones at every level allow," gave the FAA.</seg>
<seg id="18">In rare cases, where visibility, the crew will instruct passengers during the landing to disable the devices.</seg>

<seg id="1">Scientists have been able to throw more light on the context in which the tail is the equivalent of a dog with his mood.</seg>
<seg id="2">Previous research had shown that happy dogs with the tail stretched more to the right (from the perspective of the dog), while nervous dogs was the left side.</seg>
<seg id="3">But now scientists that other dogs perceive these subtle differences and respond to say.</seg>
<seg id="4">Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: "In humans is well aware that the left and right brain hemisphere react differently to stimuli, which cause positive or negative emotions."</seg>
<seg id="5">Here, we have tried to look at this in other species.</seg>
<seg id="6">He also noted that dogs, like humans, the right brain hemisphere for the movement of the left side is responsible and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings.</seg>
<seg id="7">To learn more about how dogs on the side focused their brethren respond, the researchers monitored the animals, these films from other dogs.</seg>
<seg id="8">They measured the heart rate of the four-legged and analyzed the behavior.</seg>
<seg id="9">Probably we will soon understand why the tail moved in one, sometimes in the other direction</seg>
<seg id="10">Professor Vallortigara said: "We have shown the dogs films with dogs - either a lifelike version or a silhouette to eliminate ablenkende other aspects, and we were able to control the movement of the tail to the left or right."</seg>
<seg id="11">If the animals looked like an otherwise-dog expression has moved the tail to the right (from the perspective of the fronds of dog from seen), they remained completely relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="12">But the tail inclination was mainly to the left (again from the perspective of the dog's leash), their heart rate rose and they looked nervous.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the opinion of Professor Vallortigara dogs deliberately do not communicate with each other through these movements.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rather, he is convinced that the dogs had learned from experience that they should be worried about movements and when they are not.</seg>
<seg id="15">He said: "If you have several meetings with other dogs and the swish is associated with the tail in one direction with a friendly attitude and the right side produces a less friendly behavior, then you can act on the basis of this experience."</seg>
<seg id="16">The researchers say that the findings of dog owners, veterinarians and trainers could lead to a better understanding of the emotions of their animal.</seg>
<seg id="17">John Bradshaw, an expert said on dog behavior and Visiting Fellow at the faculty of veterinary medicine at the University of Bristol, this was not the first study to examine whether on the left and right is important for dogs.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn your head to the left if they see an aggressive dog, and to the right, if it is a happy dog.</seg>
<seg id="19">In another research at the University of Victoria in Canada, said the following: "Dogs to go more to a robot dog, though, tail leash" on the left and the right not to be restless, rather than the other way around, as in the Italian study. "</seg>
<seg id="20">According to his testimony, the differences could stir, therefore, that the dogs in the various studies interpreted the animals in the movies or the robot dogs, not as a dog.</seg>
<seg id="21">A study of how dogs respond to real dogs, could help, he said.</seg>
<seg id="22">"While there is considerable evidence of many different mammals that the two halves of the brain are used for different purposes, but many of the details have yet to be determined - and dogs are no exception," said Bradshaw.</seg>
<seg id="23">Since their behavior can be easily record, however, it will probably not be long before we understand why the tail sometimes moves in one, sometimes in the other direction.</seg>

<seg id="6">The transfer of jewellery is not just a quick way to get money - 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amir (Inga - but also almost as cheaply as an unsecured bank loans.</seg>
<seg id="7">Pawnshops typically demand in Singapore, an effective annual interest rate of 17 percent, which is only just above the 15.4 percent, which requires the United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre.</seg>

<seg id="2">Actually, Waltraud Ries lives.</seg>
<seg id="3">Their house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with greenery, an ancient trees, nice neighbors and not too much traffic.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the city, there are only a few minutes by public transport.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Hopefully, you have no fear of spiders?" Asked Waltraud Ries and points to a big spider on the door frame.</seg>
<seg id="6">I am looking for me for some time now, a new home for my husband.</seg>
<seg id="7">But you know how difficult it is in Stuttgart.</seg>
<seg id="8">The reason, however, is not a spider phobia, but the concern to the age of the many steps to the house and no longer face in the apartment, she says.</seg>
<seg id="9">Moreover, since a Meniskus operation has Mitt fifty woman in the flesh, have to know what it means to handicap from floor to floor.</seg>
<seg id="10">Recently a book of her appeared on the theme of "Seattle live in old age - What home form is the best for me? '.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Our home is the best example of what is not in old age, it begins to tell.</seg>
<seg id="12">After more than 20 years ago with her husband in the duplex apartment, it was just a beautiful apartment.</seg>
<seg id="13">Fifty Today with mid-Waltraud Ries thinks differently.</seg>
<seg id="14">They also know that it is one of the few people who have to deal with the theme of "living in old age.</seg>
<seg id="15">Most of the crowd out there, as long as it is.</seg>
<seg id="16">The others are only ever, 'she says enduring.</seg>
<seg id="17">Only when the suffering is really big, you do think.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Then it can be too late, so Ries.</seg>
<seg id="19">In her book, the interior designer 17 residential models for a self-determined living in old age.</seg>
<seg id="20">"The residential form you choose an individual decision, however, is always, 'she says.</seg>
<seg id="21">D i e solution does not exist for the age.</seg>
<seg id="22">Even those who can afford the age retirement home in Tuscany or Brittany, should consider that he could also be ill.</seg>
<seg id="23">And: "Without a good knowledge of the language of one club late in the Dolce Vita," the author is willing to consider relocation.</seg>
<seg id="24">Among their models are classic models of care, alternative forms of living and the often-quoted pensioners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In old age, everyone has his tics and quirks</seg>
<seg id="26">"For me, it would be a residential community, but nothing," she says with a wink.</seg>
<seg id="27">Certainly not as a student-WG with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="28">"At the age you need his retreat, Ries.</seg>
<seg id="29">The fact that a senior-living community can work, however, the author does not rule out, however.</seg>
<seg id="30">But then it should be different than in the traditional student-WG.</seg>
<seg id="31">And sometimes you just want to even his calm, she believes.</seg>
<seg id="32">With this view, at least, it is not alone in the capital.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Most of the old people in Stuttgart want as long as they stay in their own homes, the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of the civil service is life in the age of the provincial capital.</seg>
<seg id="34">The department advises people around the theme of 'ageing'.</seg>
<seg id="35">Therefore, especially elderly people would often take inconvenience and restrictions, just to be able to stay in their familiar environment, which has also been testing the experience of the foundation.</seg>
<seg id="36">Today, there are many ways to make the house or apartment barrier-free.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ries recommends to instruct all who deal with age just rebuilding their house or apartment to check it thoroughly and not only the best craftsmen.</seg>
<seg id="38">Today, there are also the age just reconstruction specialists.</seg>
<seg id="39">Even in the apartment that one or two can be realized, and if it is only the toilet seat increase the interior designer to clarify.</seg>
<seg id="40">But the existing housing is not always appropriate for their age and transform this barrier-free, even if it is still so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="41">This experience has had to make Waltraud Ries.</seg>
<seg id="42">Indeed, one could install a stairlift within the apartment, the paved road with stairs to the apartment door, however, would be a much bigger obstacle.</seg>
<seg id="43">They will continue to search until they found the ideal object for herself and her husband.</seg>
<seg id="44">Before the move, we dread her more than before the spider on her apartment door.</seg>

<seg id="4">He was sentenced by the Liverpool Crown Court to three years in prison</seg>
<seg id="5">A well-known criminal defense lawyers, who warned of a drug baron in front of a major police investigation because he was afraid that could be revealed his secret drug addiction, was sentenced to three years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="6">Preferring Basharat, 42, supplied by world size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information on investigations into its activities in the drug trade, after he had been compromised by his own cocaine addiction.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Kriminalisten as a "premium" vaunted lawyer, nicknamed "Bash" was arrested at his home in 2011, after the police had monitored Scarborough, whom he had represented in a previous drug trial.</seg>
<seg id="8">Officials watched as Scarborough (32), three bags of cocaine at the house of a lawyer in Blackburn, Lancashire, while Cooper, with colleagues at a dinner of the Bar Association.</seg>
<seg id="9">The investigation brought to light that prefer regularly consume the class A drugs, after traces of cocaine in his hair, his wallet and credit cards were found in tests.</seg>
<seg id="10">Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he tried to obtain unauthorised information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of its partners.</seg>
<seg id="11">All four suspects were then monitored by the police as part of a major investigation procedure Heroin- and cocaine trade in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.</seg>
<seg id="12">They, along with 32 other people were arrested later, after police ensured in a series of house searches heroin and cocaine worth £1.5 million and 200,000 pounds in cash.</seg>
<seg id="13">Preferences, 42, gave information to the criminals, because he feared that his drug addiction could be publicized.</seg>
<seg id="14">Today, preferred, who works for the law firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, at Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial on two counts of obstruction of justice for convicted and sentenced.</seg>
<seg id="15">He admitted in a previous survey of the cocaine possession.</seg>
<seg id="16">The lawyer was transferred after the police found in their investigations against Scarborough, that it had been in February 2011 in regular telephone contact with preferring.</seg>
<seg id="17">Two investigators from followed the suspect and saw how he went to Dittas house and put the drugs with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf glove into the dustbin of the lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="18">Shortly after he had delivered the drugs, Scarborough was regularly with preferring, who was at the dinner in the football stadium of Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park.</seg>
<seg id="19">The lawyer returned home clinched the drugs and then nine messages were exchanged between the two.</seg>
<seg id="20">In court, it became known that preference was a "regular" consumer of cocaine after the class A drugs were discovered in tests in his hair, his wallet and his credit cards.</seg>
<seg id="21">Preference was later arrested, but denied to take cocaine and said he had spoken with the alleged dealer, because it was his client, and claimed that their discussion, "lawyer secret."</seg>
<seg id="22">During his arrest, preferred took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were seized and a hair sample was taken from him.</seg>
<seg id="23">During the police interrogation, he stated, both under his home address and an office in the workplace and clients would call him at home because of legal issues.</seg>
<seg id="24">In court, it was revealed that he had called key players in the drug trade, some of which he had previously represented, after significant arrests and informed about what the investigators knew about them.</seg>
<seg id="25">Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: "A criminal lawyer should know better than anyone else, breaking the law."</seg>
<seg id="26">Preference is accused of abusing his position as a criminal defender, because he has too much with certain clients.</seg>
<seg id="27">The relationship in question is not simply a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who supplies his lawyer with drugs.</seg>
<seg id="28">Part of his communications was undoubtedly legitimate, because he was the lawyer for these people.</seg>
<seg id="29">But that went far beyond the bounds of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.</seg>
<seg id="30">He resisting the police investigation as much as possible, so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.</seg>
<seg id="31">Mr preferring brought his profession into disrepute.</seg>
<seg id="32">He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed that its independence has been compromised.</seg>
<seg id="33">Preferred rejected any wrongdoing and claimed: "If I wanted to be a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and pass information to Scarborough, then I would not wait 15 hours, but do it immediately."</seg>
<seg id="34">But after the hearing, Lee Halstead superintendent of police in Lancashire, said: "Mr preferring has taken the step of a criminal defender to a criminal in the moment when he started to buy drugs from organised criminals."</seg>
<seg id="35">His cocaine addiction led to a hopeless compromise and the motives made him susceptible to leading members of organized crime, which commissioned him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.</seg>
<seg id="36">Lawyers need to maintain the highest standards of integrity and the public trust and confidence.</seg>
<seg id="37">Preference has betrayed that trust and trying to hide behind the facade of his profession.</seg>
<seg id="38">The Serious Crime Unit and arrangement of Lancashire, preferring headed the investigation that led to a conviction in three cases for possession of cocaine and obstruction of justice, which underlines our determination to bring criminals to justice.</seg>
<seg id="39">This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law.</seg>
<seg id="40">We will find you and bring you to justice.</seg>

<seg id="1">Council takes track facilities targeted</seg>
<seg id="2">The railway crossing "On the deer" elaborate to be converted to increase the safety?</seg>
<seg id="3">Yes, the local councils have decided.</seg>
<seg id="4">Schiltach must take for 220 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Deutsche Bahn wants to next year's Kinzigtal line.</seg>
<seg id="6">In particular, the security at railway crossings should be increased - it is regularly nationwide to collisions of trains with other vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="7">The communities agree to the restructuring measures, they must with a third of the cost, with the rest divided and federal.</seg>
<seg id="8">Schiltachs city builder Roland Grießhaber explained to the council the peculiarities of the Bahübergangs "On the deer."</seg>
<seg id="9">There, the city plans to build in the amount of the tunnel mouth west of the railroad tracks a bulge.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are also larger vehicles could, for example, to those who transport logs, standing at oncoming traffic, blocking the tracks.</seg>
<seg id="11">Grießhaber therefore proposed to construct a retaining wall so that the city could widen the subsequent street at the appropriate time to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.</seg>
<seg id="12">This has been discussed in the council controversial, as some councils, the need for a road expansion in doubt: Thomas Kipp said in his statement, the mood of the critics: "We must because so few vehicles have so much money?"</seg>
<seg id="13">Mayor Thomas Haas disagreed: The railway crossing "deer" will be used regularly for long wood shipments.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even the wood from the area "Kuhbach" will be transported via this route, in part, because the up to 20 meters long vehicles could use the route along the Häberlesbrücke because they could not turn into the main road.</seg>
<seg id="15">In addition, the route serves as a diversion for those vehicles that do not use the tunnel, if the road is blocked, Haas argued.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is conceivable that church mountain and Schlossberg tunnel and need to be cleaned up, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the railway crossing "On" deer "for an extended period, an important traffic.</seg>
<seg id="17">The council agreed to investigate what costs would cause the expansion of the street.</seg>
<seg id="18">Regardless of the reconstruction of the railway crossing the majority agreed with the proviso that the necessary supporting wall will be built in such a way that the subsequent road towards "Bahnhofstrasse" if necessary to meet the city traffic could increase to around 5.5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="19">The reconstruction of the railway crossing in the tanning Trautwein could draw against a different problem, which is access to the strong growth "Geroltzhäuser way."</seg>
<seg id="20">The administration had to examine the restructuring plans of the railway from the engineering firm Breinlinger, because they had doubts as to whether the planned end of Geroltzhäuser route is possible even without further ado.</seg>
<seg id="21">The study concluded that it cannot be ruled out that the tendency of road conditions could lead to longer vehicles do.</seg>
<seg id="22">The responsibility for this, in turn, carrying the city as a road last winner.</seg>
<seg id="23">The change could therefore take liability disputes.</seg>
<seg id="24">Since both the wood collection and turning in the current state of development work to support the reconstruction of the railway crossing, Haas argued.</seg>
<seg id="25">The risk of a collision of the train is here with a vehicle on the transition are significantly lower than in the other railroad crossings, because the mid-point is right next to it, which is a good visual contact.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even the terms should be spirals at this juncture that no collision threatened.</seg>
<seg id="27">The approval was largely the reconstruction of the railway crossing refused because the city Schiltach "the problem with aufsitzenden vehicles" would have to pay for, the councils, as the railway could after completing the construction of the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="28">In 2006, the panel considers the changes of the railway crossings "Before the village" and "Before Kuhbach" that have already been made arrangements with the railway junction.</seg>

<seg id="4">Most of the speakers are eliminated - the noise level will be significantly reduced.</seg>
<seg id="5">To create a more relaxed atmosphere, is the aim of this change.</seg>
<seg id="6">As Airport spokesman Peter Kleemann on Radio Vienna, follows the Vienna International Airport with the recruitment of announcements that affect individuals, an international trend.</seg>
<seg id="7">So, among other things, the airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai already refrain on the noisy calls.</seg>
<seg id="8">The disappearance of this by saying, on average, around 200 personal calls through the loudspeakers - there is going to hear on a quiet day at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="9">"It is evident in the experience that these individuals were perceived by relatively little to say, but at the same time sink all other information about passengers changed or departure times here a little bit," said Kleemann in conversation with the radio station.</seg>

<seg id="2">A 21-year-old woman from Sydney in Phuket has been sentenced to 15 days in prison, because they had falsely claimed to have been raped by a taxi driver, has appealed against the sentence and was released on bail.</seg>
<seg id="3">Stevie Bamford Rochelle was first found by a provincial court in Phuket on June 15, guilty of having made a false statement after she had indicated the Thai police, a local taxi driver told them in the early hours on Sunday, June 10, raped, while two other men clung to them.</seg>
<seg id="4">Later, however, the photographs showed a video camera that they had arrived safely in their hotel after they had been separated from her Australian boyfriend.</seg>
<seg id="5">The police in Phuket Bamford interrogated for two days, until she confessed to have invented the story.</seg>
<seg id="6">Before the trial, she was on the ground in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="7">Bamford was a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security detention centre stage on the edge of Phuket, rather than in a prison for adult women.</seg>

<seg id="2">Syria had destroyed important facilities for the production of chemical weapons and Gitftgasmunition, the global monitoring group on Thursday declared chemical weapons, while in the north of the country clashed near one of the sites, which allegedly toxic substances are stored.</seg>
<seg id="3">Also on Thursday, a group of Syrian activists announced that more than 120,000 people since the start of the civil war were killed, almost three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="4">The announcement of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came one day before the deadline on</seg>

<seg id="6">The conclusion of this process, which is basically the first stage of the destruction, is an important milestone of an ambitious timetable, which is aimed at the destruction of all Syria's chemical weapons by mid-2014.</seg>
<seg id="7">The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can produce no new chemical weapons.</seg>
<seg id="8">Damascus, still needs to begin to destroy the existing weapons and supplies.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to estimates in the country, there are about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and sarin gas.</seg>
<seg id="10">The announcement came at a time when fighting in the town of Safira took place on Thursday, experts say that there is a production facility for chemical weapons and storage sites, such as the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.</seg>

<seg id="2">The former News of the Word-editor Andy Coulson was supposedly "phone-hacking, monitoring and confrontation" in the attempt, a false tip about an affair of the former Home Secretary Charles Clarke.</seg>
<seg id="3">Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the court in the Old Bailey, the News of the World listened in May 2005, a false rumor that Clarke had a relationship with his "special adviser" Hannah Pawlby.</seg>
<seg id="4">The newspaper commissioned the private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack voicemails Pawlbys, and pursued them, but they also Coulson called and left messages, the court heard.</seg>
<seg id="5">"According to the public prosecutor Coulson, who is now the editor of the NotW, no one who stands in front of the apartment of people and hopes to monitor them, but one, faced with a history of people like to see their reaction," said Edis.</seg>
<seg id="6">He said that NotW use three procedures in order to investigate citizen stories: Phone-hacking, monitoring and confrontation.</seg>
<seg id="7">The publisher is personally involved in the third method.</seg>
<seg id="8">Obviously, he knows of the second, the surveillance, it cannot be otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="9">What about the first?</seg>
<seg id="10">He knows about the phone-hacking?</seg>

<seg id="1">Early puberty: Grow up faster</seg>
<seg id="2">African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty than their white age, as studies show.</seg>
<seg id="3">Physical changes mean not directly puberty</seg>
<seg id="4">There is no evidence that hormones and other chemicals are responsible</seg>
<seg id="5">Experts believe that the obesity epidemic is a trigger of the early puberty</seg>
<seg id="6">The trend toward early puberty is less pronounced among boys</seg>
<seg id="7">The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist based on children's health and family issues.</seg>
<seg id="8">A mother should be concerned when breasts and pubic hair grow their daughter already at the age of seven or eight years ago?</seg>
<seg id="9">At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics paediatricians Association this week in Orlando, Florida, a pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz said that these early physical changes are relatively normal among American girls and a new standard.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I spend a lot of time to reassure parents - usually, this is not a sign of puberty happens quickly," explained Kaplowitz.</seg>
<seg id="11">Obvious indicators of development, such as growing breasts, Scham- and Achselhaare and body odor, formerly show girls.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, there was only a slight shift in the age of the Menarche (first menstruation) over the last 40 years.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the United States, the average age at 12.5 years, slightly less than visual in 1970.</seg>
<seg id="14">"If the development of breasts starts, it will take" at least two to three years until the Menarche, Kaplowitz, author of the book "early puberty in girls said: The Essential Guide to deal with this commoner problem."</seg>
<seg id="15">The most accurate test is how puberty progresses.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is controversial, which is actually the onset of puberty, but it is ready for "early" if the breast augmentation is accompanied by a spurt of growth before the age of eight years.</seg>
<seg id="17">In most cases, the process has slowed down or stalled - something that can monitor a pediatrician.</seg>
<seg id="18">For faster progress tests could be indicated by a Endikronologen so serious problems such as tumor or cyst can be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="19">There are treatments for the delay of an early menstruation and the defense of another consequence: The premature aging of the bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and small stature in adults.</seg>
<seg id="20">The recommendations for a drug or hormonal therapy based on the age of the child, the speed of development, the growth rate and the emotional maturity.</seg>
<seg id="21">Psycho-social aspects are also important.</seg>
<seg id="22">Kaplowitz is cautious about drugs, but he admits: "That suppress puberty can mitigate behavioral problems and the feelings of girls, unlike their age to be."</seg>
<seg id="23">The other major problem is understandable: Parents simply do not want that their very young daughters have the period.</seg>
<seg id="24">"They worry about the risk of pregnancy, or about how they handle" the hygienic side, Kaplowitz said.</seg>
<seg id="25">"It was a shock, a woman whose daughter has received with ten remembers their days.</seg>
<seg id="26">Although there have been signs, and we talked about menstruation, they were not emotionally prepared.</seg>
<seg id="27">She was scared and excited home from school, because it was the first in her group of friends.</seg>
<seg id="28">There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages were found in the media.</seg>
<seg id="30">Young boys are like girls before puberty.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kaplowitz believes that the most compelling premise is the epidemic of obesity.</seg>
<seg id="32">He supported the implementation of a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine years, which establishes a connection between body fat and entering puberty.</seg>
<seg id="33">Other studies support that conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.</seg>
<seg id="34">In this country of African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty than their white age.</seg>
<seg id="35">There are various explanations for this.</seg>
<seg id="36">Global appears to be an early puberty influenced by all sorts of things, economic conditions, the climate and genes.</seg>
<seg id="37">Another mystery: Although boys grow the face and pubic hair before the trend towards a comprehensive early puberty is not as high as for girls.</seg>
<seg id="38">Other doctors at the AAP conference underscored the complexity of the issue.</seg>
<seg id="39">The emergence of acne and pubic hair is widespread even babies and young children.</seg>
<seg id="40">"We have to be careful how we identify the real onset of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA staff before accusations against Jonathan Lord charged with sex offences</seg>
<seg id="2">Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) were for sexual offences relating to children has been charged before 2011 accusations against child carers Jonathan Lord from Caringbah, such as the Royal Commission for sexual abuse of children learned.</seg>
<seg id="3">But, at the opening statement before the commission of the YMCA stated that we have had to do "in the organization never with an incident of sexual child abuse."</seg>
<seg id="4">CEO Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which a YMCA employee for offences had been charged with child pornography, and another in which a sports teacher of the YMCA Caringbah Hall in 1991 because of the abuse of children entrusted to him had been convicted.</seg>
<seg id="5">Hare Gail Furness, one of the Commission's assistance, a lawyer said that he had known of the first case, the second known but did not.</seg>
<seg id="6">He admitted that the opening statement of the YMCA to the Commission was also vague on the claim that "there was external reviews of the YMCA, where the YMCA has been recognised as being at the forefront in terms of child safety."</seg>
<seg id="7">Evidence before the commission that the YMCA has been informed that he had received the second-lowest rating of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities (Department of Education) in August of this year show.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hare, who started with 21 at the YMCA, acknowledged that the company had "from me downwards" in the recruitment of Lord failed and failed to ensure that employees have been aware of their obligations to report violations of the regulations on the safety of children.</seg>
<seg id="9">Lord was sentenced earlier this year for sexual offences against 12 boys during his two-year career for the YMCA.</seg>
<seg id="10">He was sentenced to a minimum of six years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="11">Hare denied, however, that the YMCA would have a cultural problem that employees have held them to report violations of Lords regarding the safety of children.</seg>
<seg id="12">The employees said they had observed violations, among other things, that Lord was alone with children, she privately as a babysitter, they sit on his lap, leaving one said that he had loved it, and children play with his mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="13">Danielle Ockwell, whose leader was Lord, who had asked for a training course on child protection, because she was concerned for his behavior, said that the children's services director Jacqui Barnat, who was at the YMCA Caringbah the supervisors Lords daunting, "and most of the time was very remote."</seg>
<seg id="14">The director said that he would not accept statements by officials that they had not had the courage to report to their superiors.</seg>
<seg id="15">Instead, he said, but their friendship with Lord have affected their judgment, which is why they had not reported it.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hare said that he had the board of the YMCA NSW shared his view that the lesson that the organization from the "Jonathan-Lord-incident" to consider, "not reporting" by staff concerns, and the Board have agreed with him.</seg>
<seg id="17">Hare said that the decision to push the employees to sign confidentiality obligations, shortly after the allegations were made by the director of the YMCA of children's services, Liam Whitley.</seg>
<seg id="18">He said the contamination of the evidence should be avoided, but what had been overzealous "and" poorly implemented.</seg>
<seg id="19">The YMCA NSW was at a time when Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011, no organization safe for children, Professor Stephen small bone from Griffith University, an expert on sexual child abuse, said the Commission.</seg>
<seg id="20">He explained that there had been "serious problems" in recruitment, screening, training, training and supervision of employees.</seg>

<seg id="8">The tour starts quite unspectacular: "We start in the garage," says Schulze.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the 1970s, the city fathers wanted a car-oriented city, and that is why it remained from the remains of the ancient city wall only, which was not too big.</seg>

<seg id="1">George Kerevan: European unbundling gives the Scots election</seg>
<seg id="2">A new day, a new horror story to independence.</seg>
<seg id="3">This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to meet the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is the key word for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a secure border with barbed wire along of Hadrian's Wall.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, it was in the communication template pointed to the potential economic benefits that greater freedom of movement in the rest of Europe would entail, but it played - as expected - no role in the headlines.</seg>
<seg id="6">No one has also mentioned that the EU member states often bent to their strict rules, if it is cheaper for them.</seg>
<seg id="7">As Scotland is not part of the Schengen area, would be the continued disregard for Brussels, only a small concession in exchange for what it really wants from the Scots.</seg>
<seg id="8">So, no story.</seg>
<seg id="9">And one that has come a long way in the years that they already resembles a fossil: The first time I have the "independence means passport controls" -Ente before at least 40 years.</seg>
<seg id="10">An interesting point is lost in the constant refrain of this ancient history.</seg>
<seg id="11">Why should we expect from an independent Scotland, dancing to the tune of Europe?</seg>
<seg id="12">Why does the London yoke against the trade from Brussels, especially now?</seg>
<seg id="13">These are the real European news: The big, taken after the war plan to the unification of Europe has stalled.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the euro crisis, the project is officially died Europe.</seg>
<seg id="15">Throughout the EU parties are gaining ground, the EU is hostile or the euro as a common currency would throw overboard.</seg>
<seg id="16">Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic party was founded Alternative for Germany - until this year - Edith nearly five million votes in the federal election in September and distribute them effectively, the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.</seg>
<seg id="17">There was always domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.</seg>
<seg id="18">The current economic crisis, it turns out, however, as a turning point.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Berlin and the European Central Bank imposed strict austerity in connection with the straitjacket that the national economy is being forced by adhering to the common currency, many people are of the opinion that the European project has gone too far.</seg>
<seg id="20">The crisis of the euro has little to do with national governments cause excessive budget deficits - that was only the case in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="21">Instead, the Eurosystem nailed its members to exchange rates that are beneficial for German exporters - and that German politicians would like to keep it that way.</seg>
<seg id="22">Without the possibility of a devaluation of the local currency, Southern Europe finds itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage vis-à-vis Germany.</seg>
<seg id="23">The only way is to cut wages and public spending - spurred on by Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Behind the current Etat- and currency problems a deeper European productivity problem.</seg>
<seg id="25">As a result of the prescribed by Brussels "green" energy policies - a code for subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers - the European industry pays compared with the United States twice for electricity and four times for gas.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we have seen in Grangemouth.</seg>
<seg id="27">All pay fixed the world protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed by cheap US shale gas into the corner.</seg>
<seg id="28">As a result, a revolt rolls, particularly in France, the former cheerleader of the EU.</seg>
<seg id="29">After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check and lift Paris on an equal footing with Washington.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, Paris, Berlin needs no longer as a gateway to the political legitimacy and Europe has imposed its own economic policy, giving the ailing French economy is struggling.</seg>
<seg id="31">The result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, anti-EU National Front has just won a key by-election, and that the ruling Socialists pointed to three.</seg>
<seg id="32">The National Front is now the most popular party in France, with 24 percent of the votes - a timely warning for the British Labour Party that they do not want a split in the right spectrum would automatically mean benefits for the left.</seg>
<seg id="33">What Le Pen with its newly gained popularity is among the white working-class French?</seg>
<seg id="34">They want the EU elections next year to take an anti-EU, anti-common currency bloc in the European Parliament to forge.</seg>
<seg id="35">If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections - and it is very well possible - it could be the first time such a block dominate the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="36">This is the point I want to make: In the not too distant future, is the growing resentment against the EU and the single currency together on the abolition of the euro.</seg>
<seg id="37">The EU will not disappear, but it will be more "something like that" Europe of (sovereign) nations that General de Gaulle favored.</seg>
<seg id="38">Germany and its satellite economies may keep the euro, but France and Southern Europe will return to their own currencies.</seg>
<seg id="39">I expect that Britain distances itself from this project in the hope to curry favour with the United States.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, Washington's growing interest in Pacific suggests that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain.</seg>
<seg id="41">Where Scotland remains in all this?</seg>
<seg id="42">We can decide a region of (ultimately) Little England.</seg>
<seg id="43">Or we can defend our own economic interests, including Berlin and Brussels to say what they are where hinstecken.</seg>
<seg id="44">I suspect that Scotland could be in a looser European Grouping quite well, as long as we keep our own currency.</seg>
<seg id="45">The cooperation with others, like-minded countries is not in a federal Europe of the Nations.</seg>
<seg id="46">Otherwise, we should consider it emulate Norway and keep our economic independence.</seg>
<seg id="47">The SNP government in Scotland - remarkably - the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and has a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the rejection of the proposed cuts made (and won), which the Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition were to blame.</seg>
<seg id="48">It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence, only to be imposed upon them from Berlin and Brussels austerity.</seg>

<seg id="10">You may not start again when the plane reached an altitude of three kilometers, and the captain gives the green light.</seg>
<seg id="11">When entering the landing the passengers need to disable them again and may not start them again before the plane has landed.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the new guidelines could airlines whose planes are secured against electronic malfunctions, allow its passengers to use the devices for takeoff, landing on the tarmac, the FAA said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Most of the new commercial aircraft and other planes for the use of Wi-Fi have been converted into greater heights, should meet the criteria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Laura Glading, president of the Association of Flight Attendants, welcomed the changes.</seg>
<seg id="15">"If the new regulation is implemented safely - and we are working closely with the airline in this regard - will benefit both sides," Glading said.</seg>
<seg id="16">We are told it honestly sorry to have to deal with this issue as minders.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, remained Internet connections for surfing, exchange of e-mails, text messages or downloading data still banned under three kilometres, the agency explained.</seg>
<seg id="18">Passengers are urged to enable smartphones, tablets and other devices in flight mode.</seg>
<seg id="19">So still no "Words With Friends," the scrabble classified online game that the actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when he publicise a jet of American Airlines had to leave because he refused to turn off the device, while the plane was parked at the gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">And heavier devices such as laptops must continue to be stored as an injury risk here if they fly through the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="21">Mobile phone calls during the flight will also continue to banned.</seg>
<seg id="22">The regulatory authority for telephone calls at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not with the FAA.</seg>
<seg id="23">FAA may lift ban on certain electronic devices during takeoff and landing</seg>
<seg id="24">Last month, Mark Rosenker said of the Transportation Security Administration National Transportation Safety Board, security expert for national transport issues at CBS News, mobile phones are still viewed as a risk.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Mobile is really a problem, not only because they could potentially cause problems in navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that the transfer from the air can also disrupt transmission towers," Rosenker.</seg>
<seg id="26">An advisory committee of the industry, which was created by the FAA to investigate this issue, recommended last month that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices.</seg>
<seg id="27">In recent years, the pressure on the FAA has increased to loosen restrictions on its use.</seg>
<seg id="28">Critics such as the Democratic senator from Missouri to overtake Japan take the view that there is no valid security reasons for the ban.</seg>
<seg id="29">The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce, because the use of the devices has become ubiquitous.</seg>
<seg id="30">In some studies, the speech that forgets up to one-third of the passengers of the closure of the device or ignored.</seg>
<seg id="31">The FAA began in 1966, the use of electronic devices by passengers, after reports of disturbances of navigation and communication devices by passengers keep FM radios were aware that the latest technology trends.</seg>
<seg id="32">New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA that electronic interference represent them nothing.</seg>
<seg id="33">Airlines offer passengers for several years, Wi-Fi, if the altitude is reached.</seg>
<seg id="34">The Wi-Fi systems adapted planes are also less susceptible to interference.</seg>
<seg id="35">The vast majority of passenger aircraft for the greater use of electronic devices to be placed under the new guidelines, Huerta said.</seg>
<seg id="36">Today's electronic devices are generally much less phone radiation than previous generations.</seg>
<seg id="37">E-Reader, for example, provide only minimal radiation, if one umblättert.</seg>
<seg id="38">However, when downloading or sending data transfer values are stronger.</seg>
<seg id="39">Among the supporters of an easing of restrictions on the use of passenger counts Amazon.com.</seg>
<seg id="40">In 2011, company officials invited a passenger plane full of Kindle e-reader and made a test flight in order to identify problems, but none could say.</seg>
<seg id="41">Members of the FAA's advisory committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk in the use of devices.</seg>
<seg id="42">Douglas also from the passenger Association, National Association of Airline Passengers said he was of the view that the disruption of the device is real, even if the risk is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="43">Other committee members said that there were only scattered reports of pilots who favours a disruption of aircraft systems by the devices, and most of them are very old.</seg>
<seg id="44">However, the committee recommended the FAA to allow pilots to mandate in instrument landing under poor visibility conditions of the closure of the devices by the passengers.</seg>
<seg id="45">A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes, describing it as a sensible adjustment for travelers who are now well equipped with technology.</seg>
<seg id="46">"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a passenger experience is not incompatible with the security," Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Gechingen: No absolute protection possible</seg>
<seg id="2">"We want to involve the people early in the planning," Mayor Jens Häußler opened the public information event for flood protection concept in Gechingen.</seg>
<seg id="3">About 80 participants had come into the town hall in order to explain the measures planned to ask questions to express concerns and ideas.</seg>
<seg id="4">Häußler clear: "The ultimate decisions, the members of the municipal council."</seg>
<seg id="5">The flooding that hit Gechingen on May 15, 2009, unprepared, was a crucial event that raised the question of protective measures for the future, Häußler.</seg>
<seg id="6">A river basin investigation had been given with the neighbouring village of Stuttgart, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.</seg>
<seg id="7">"The protection of cultivated land" is the goal, Häußler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Based on the planning of the protection is in front of a noisy German weather service statistically every 100 years to expected flooding.</seg>
<seg id="9">The climate change is a 15-percent surcharge.</seg>
<seg id="10">In expert circles, this is called "HQ 100a climate."</seg>
<seg id="11">The water, which in 2009 Gechingen had resulted in serious damage, represented a 1,000-year flood.</seg>
<seg id="12">"There is not an absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement," says Häußler.</seg>
<seg id="13">In order to achieve the protection HQ 100a climate, around four million euros will be invested in Gechingen, with the community can expect to land shots to the tune of around 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="14">But Häußler pointed out that there are promoting only if a master plan will be implemented.</seg>
<seg id="15">The community is dependent on the participation of the citizens.</seg>
<seg id="16">An elaborate planning and approval process needs to be completed.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the best case, 2016 could be started with the implementation.</seg>
<seg id="18">Among other things, the protection plan that was presented last week in the municipal council members of local measures in the flow of the river valley from the IRM Stammheimer envisages.</seg>
<seg id="19">Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants took the opportunity to bring their concerns.</seg>
<seg id="20">Among other things, has been questioned why not more dams and reservoirs are planned for the protection of the place.</seg>
<seg id="21">Gregor Kuehn, designer of the contracted engineering firms forest and Corbe from hillside home, who introduced the concept, stressed that it needs the cooperation of all measures presented to achieve the desired goal in the sum.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition, it is required to find the most economical solution, Joachim forest of forest and Corbe.</seg>
<seg id="23">There was anger in countries bordering the Altorts who suffer even under normal storm rain again under an overload of the canal network.</seg>
<seg id="24">The problem is known in the administration and the first steps have already been taken.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, Häußler pointed out that the guidelines for canal systems are different than for flood protection and it should not be mixed.</seg>
<seg id="26">The community is obliged to interpret the canal network so that two to three-year rain events will be recognized.</seg>

<seg id="1">The newly designed Opschlag shines with a new cafe.</seg>
<seg id="2">One thing that invites to linger and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="3">One thing that would make the name for the program.</seg>
<seg id="4">As Déjà Vu, according to the dictionary is a psychological phenomenon that manifests itself in the sense of having a new situation experienced or seen before.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the case of the visit of the cafes on Opschlag in the county town of Kleve in sight at the Hochschule Rhein-Waal, it is not in the pure Déjà Vu-feeling.</seg>
<seg id="6">Finally, the cafe with the wonderful name exactly the goal: To make a real stay not only intellectually, but hand firmly and repeatedly.</seg>
<seg id="7">Precisely because it is fun and simply beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="8">A look into the inner life on Opschlag 8 gives the viewer on a good feeling.</seg>
<seg id="9">The ultra-modern, but not cool cafe-style looks like a place to relax.</seg>
<seg id="10">The team will spoil here with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top of the guest with various tea or cocktail variants.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is delicious cakes or individually ranked fresh baguettes.</seg>
<seg id="12">The owners, both 33 years old, have already made before the opening of the pretty cafes on Opschlag as restaurateurs a name: In Kranenburg, she led the "Art Lounge."</seg>
<seg id="13">The move to Kleve in Opschlag hope the likeable cafe-lovers more audience.</seg>
<seg id="14">Last but not least, by the university.</seg>
<seg id="15">"However, we have no specific target, Daniel Buettner stresses.</seg>

<seg id="23">Two events, there's already in the bright cafe.</seg>
<seg id="24">Rather one.</seg>

<seg id="28">But not everyone's cause.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perhaps, Daniel Buettner is also not a great fan of event nights: "You can's, not all of the time."</seg>
<seg id="30">And with an event, I always speak only those who are interested in the special event.</seg>
<seg id="31">That is why events will be the exception rather with us.</seg>

<seg id="1">Jumbo manufacturers argue in the face of large orders for seat width</seg>
<seg id="2">Between leading aircraft manufacturers, there has been a debate about the width of seats in economy class on long-haul flights, which sets the tone for a bitter clash at the Dubai Airshow this month.</seg>
<seg id="3">The dispute revolves around the seat width offered passengers on long flights in economy class - not always the ones that airlines seek the most, but the designated area is the key to the effectiveness of claims in the latest aircraft from Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.</seg>
<seg id="4">Airbus this week called for an industry standard, which is a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in economy class, but the US January Boeing says that the airlines should decide.</seg>
<seg id="5">The controversy comes at a time when the aircraft manufacturer vying to sell even larger versions of its twin-engine long-haul planes, and expected at the event from 17 to 21 November record orders.</seg>
<seg id="6">As the rear part of the plane is fleshed out, especially if it ranks with nine or ten seats - is crucial to the economic results indicated that the new "mini-jumbo" design is to deliver.</seg>
<seg id="7">Boeing claims its modernized "777X" group 406 people in seats in economy class, which is about 17 inches wide and so allow 10 per series.</seg>
<seg id="8">Airbus says that the competing version of the A350 car 350 people in 18-inch wide seats in economy class, and there are nine per series.</seg>
<seg id="9">Aircraft giants often share of blows on technical details through advertisements in the trade press.</seg>
<seg id="10">Airbus now calls before the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X, with over 100 orders are expected to make the race, directly to the public.</seg>
<seg id="11">Recently, the company introduced an ad that showed the start of a new war and donors could display a picture in which three people are squeezed in a restaurant, and accept the title: "Would you?"</seg>
<seg id="12">"Boeing is proposing long-haul flights in seats that are more closely than regional turbo-props," says Airbus sales chief John Leahy.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the face of changed eating habits, the people are thicker, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.</seg>
<seg id="14">Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined the modern long-distance travel, and the end of the century, has the weight of the average American male between 40 and 49 years increased by 10 percent, the data from the US Health Ministry.</seg>
<seg id="15">The average American Taillenumfang of male in the 21st century, according to US health statistics 100,8 cm.</seg>
<seg id="16">Airbus says that his rival is a seat concept from the 1950s, when the average body size of the fresh "Jet Set" was slim.</seg>
<seg id="17">We have, as Airbus, carried out studies that showed that raises an extra inch (2.54 cm) per seat, the quality of sleep by 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="18">Boeing disputes the figures of Airbus on the seat and says it is not at the discretion of the manufacturers to decide how the balance between airlines flight fares and body shape.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also explains, according to surveys, the experience in the plane depends on more than the seat width.</seg>
<seg id="20">"It is really important to give companies flexibility, so that they can do what they think they need to be successful," the airline cabin expert Kent Craver explained by Boeing.</seg>
<seg id="21">You do not want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.</seg>
<seg id="22">You know their business better than anyone else.</seg>
<seg id="23">For passengers, it is about more elbow, but for manufacturers, it is increasingly an issue that can affect the sales.</seg>
<seg id="24">Behind the dispute is a race for aircraft orders, with an estimated volume of at least 700 billion US dollars at list prices in the coming decades, what a profound impact on the export performance of the US or Europe could impact.</seg>
<seg id="25">As Reuters reported in July for the first time, the seating layout is the driving force behind the debate about the new jets.</seg>
<seg id="26">Both Airbus and Boeing say 20 percent more efficiency per seat in its latest twin-engine long-haul designs as the market leader in this segment, the 365-seater Boeing 77-300ER.</seg>
<seg id="27">Boeing's statements on the results depend in part on the fact that the 777X with its ten seats per row is compared with the original design of nine seats in the 777.</seg>
<seg id="28">The increased cost per unit is still lower than currently used machines with ten seats per row.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Boeing Quet CHT so more seats in his plane to make it more competitive for our products," Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort in the European Airbus says.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other hand, analysts say, full cabins with ten seats per row with existing feature indicated that many passengers could opted for closer arrangement, which go hand in hand with cheaper air fares.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Eighteen-inch seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is that, from an economic point of view is the Airbus offer from the threat of the 777-driven," said Mary Kirby, an expert on cabin no direction, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.</seg>
<seg id="32">Airbus and Boeing offer no seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which the airlines can choose.</seg>
<seg id="33">The world passenger jet sellers bear even tape measure, the establishment of the competition after expending.</seg>
<seg id="34">Even if they extol the convenience, all manufacturers offer but also jets with hochverdichteter design for low-cost airlines and regional flights.</seg>
<seg id="35">Airbus A350, with 10 seater series, has sold but say none.</seg>
<seg id="36">Until recently, Airbus has stressed the importance of greater adaptability of the cabin and was offered for some Jets wide seats in the corridors.</seg>
<seg id="37">Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the call for a new industry standard will probably fizzle, but the wave of 777X-sales could distract.</seg>

<seg id="1">Veganism is, according to dictionaries the vegetarianism, but differs from that in a very significant way.</seg>
<seg id="2">Because while vegetarians allow the consumption of cream cake, ice cream or a strong Edam, these feasts are not on the menu of a Veganers.</seg>
<seg id="3">Milk, cheese, eggs, alongside the renunciation of meat and fish, the vegan from all consumption of animal products - even honey is denied.</seg>
<seg id="4">What remains, one might ask, but on closer inspection, the vegan nutrition world through a considerable ingenuity.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Sandwich spreads are very popular," Ute Henkel Mann, the owner of the local reform House, which provides a variety of special products for vegans.</seg>
<seg id="6">Reuben Proctor also visited the store in the Domgasse.</seg>
<seg id="7">For 13 years, the native New Zealanders living vegan, in waters it is (almost) everything he needs to live. "I asked my diet in 1997 and was" vegetarians.</seg>
<seg id="8">At the turn of the next step was then and I was vegan.</seg>
<seg id="9">"The conviction came not only because of the food, but because of the shoe choice," says Proctor, who prefers artificial normal leather.</seg>
<seg id="10">He acknowledged that it is also in other everyday needs no animal products.</seg>
<seg id="11">First and foremost is his vegan an ethics.</seg>
<seg id="12">"I don't want that animals have to die for me," Proctor says the maxim of vegans, which covers the entire consumer behavior.</seg>
<seg id="13">Instead of hinterherzutrauern burgers, Rühreiern or rubber bears the vegan, quickly discovered a new products, rose the enthusiasm.</seg>
<seg id="14">"It is a double bonus, Proctor said today," is actually his vegan no surrender, no asceticism, but it is an asset. "Back the assumption that blend with the diet, the choice of dining options, Proctor has more on the power of habit.</seg>
<seg id="15">And it is precisely these conditions could also fail some well-intentioned attempt.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The addiction is a crucial factor, which leaves many give up quickly, similar to the smoking," Proctor to a settlement.</seg>
<seg id="17">And a: "Certain tastes are not pin on the animal."</seg>
<seg id="18">It is often the spices or the type of preparation, which make up the taste.</seg>
<seg id="19">"You can also produce the same effect in other ways," illustrates the vegan.</seg>
<seg id="20">At a barbecue Proctor brings, for example, eggplant, mushrooms and a few vegan sausages.</seg>
<seg id="21">He looks at a balanced and varied diet, which is supposed to taste first proper.</seg>
<seg id="22">Of course, you want to have something between the teeth, which is legitimate.</seg>
<seg id="23">"It should taste, but that is not only to reduce animal food," said Proctor.</seg>
<seg id="24">Health damage to eating disorders, another widespread assumption that he had not suffered.</seg>
<seg id="25">For me, the change had a positive aspect.</seg>
<seg id="26">I am not a foreign cholesterol and have an increased share of vitamin.</seg>
<seg id="27">There are high-performance athletes who eat vegan exclusively.</seg>
<seg id="28">"My blood values are well, I let myself often check," says Proctor.</seg>
<seg id="29">In particular, the lack of vitamin B12 warn many Vegansimus critics.</seg>
<seg id="30">"As animals are fed with animal feed, instead of grazing on pasture, it is questionable whether the meat in the freezer purchases of vitamin B12 share is high," finds Proctor.</seg>
<seg id="31">For Vegans, there is also the possibility to take the products in the form of tablets.</seg>
<seg id="32">"My B12-values are in order," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="33">Wide paths to Proctor, the food supply is not go.</seg>
<seg id="34">Finally, there are basic foodstuffs everywhere and every supermarket has now soy milk and other products.</seg>
<seg id="35">Everything I need, I think on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="36">Only now and I buy something special.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Many people overlook that only the finished products are expensive, but as it is" ordinary "finished products as well."</seg>
<seg id="38">In any case, the preparation of vegan dishes is much cheaper and less time-consuming than commonly thought.</seg>
<seg id="39">"In the home kitchen, there is a lot to discover, with a few small tips can be good, if not sometimes produce better results," Proctor said.</seg>
<seg id="40">Margarine instead of butter, a bit more baking powder and carbon dioxide instead of egg, with its vegan cheesecake Proctor could also bring his in-laws.</seg>
<seg id="41">Family firm of the vegan gives a new condiment.</seg>
<seg id="42">It has dynamic when you boil it together, has a new significance.</seg>
<seg id="43">"The situations that can arise, however, are as different as the people themselves," Proctor said.</seg>
<seg id="44">Of course, he was also shown skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="45">My food tastes you?</seg>
<seg id="46">"Shall I now feel bad because I drank milk?" - on such issues, we must act as a vegan with sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="47">"I reject the people do not, I am part of this society," Proctor would end no enclaves.</seg>
<seg id="48">And more precisely in the everyday world seems to be not so vegan foreign suspect - and the vegan not restricted in everyday life, as commonly believed.</seg>
<seg id="49">Even fast food is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="50">There are French fries everywhere!</seg>
<seg id="51">"Many travel stores offer falafel, or a vegetarian Yufka," Proctor said.</seg>
<seg id="52">In a pizzeria he is avoiding on pasta dishes, or everything just order a pizza without cheese, a matter of habit.</seg>
<seg id="53">The restaurants are so slow.</seg>
<seg id="54">"When I started 13 years ago to feed me vegan everything was" much more difficult to make the New Zealanders can find a development: "You have to talk to the people, they point out."</seg>
<seg id="55">"If enough demands come, they are probably inclined to supplement the menu," he hopes.</seg>
<seg id="56">Vegan restaurants develop, such as the galley in Mannheim, or the café bird.</seg>
<seg id="57">Proctor has the desire that other restaurants have at least one veganes dish on the menu.</seg>
<seg id="58">Basically, for all are vegan dishes.</seg>
<seg id="59">Everyone can eat them, so they are precisely the opposite of exclusivity.</seg>
<seg id="60">"Meat dishes are not exclusively, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others," Proctor.</seg>
<seg id="61">"If you want to avoid food scandals, veganism is a safe way, the largest proportion of" to make impossible from the outset, Proctor said.</seg>
<seg id="62">But the shopping vegan products can be a little difficult at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="63">Especially when you learn to understand, which also contain additives in animal peanuts and its donors, it seems to comply with the ethics to leave with so many hurdles and quickly fall of courage.</seg>
<seg id="64">Not only so Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen wrote a book: "Veganissimo - animal ingredients and their alternatives," explains the many ingredients, but the food is also buried detergents.</seg>
<seg id="65">"Gradually, it developed a scanner and you know the signs and logos to respect" It is sometimes has to do better than small steps or to stumble, "says Proctor.</seg>

<seg id="1">New anti-nicotine vaccine could be the pleasure in smoking experiences</seg>
<seg id="2">Scientists have an anti-nicotine vaccine, which could spoil the fun at the smoking.</seg>
<seg id="3">A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice a lifetime against nicotine addiction.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before tests on humans further tests are needed, which could still take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, said the first results are good.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We are very hopeful that this kind of vaccination strategy can even help millions of smokers who have tried and tried to stop all methods are available on the market, but saw that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches," said Cornell.</seg>
<seg id="6">The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been changed so that the genetic information for the manufacture of nicotine-containing antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="7">The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="8">The antibodies chase the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, causing a smoker no nicotine-high.</seg>
<seg id="9">In experiments vaccinated mice that nicotine was administered retained their normal level of activity.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mice without vaccination against a "break" would have taken, the researchers said, a sign that the nicotine have achieved their brains.</seg>
<seg id="11">The experiments are described in the journal Science translational medicine.</seg>
<seg id="12">Former tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="13">The vaccines had to be given to maintain the Antikörperpegels so often that they were expensive and impractical.</seg>
<seg id="14">But the cost of the new vaccine are likely to be significantly lower, because it transforms liver cells in antibody factories.</seg>
<seg id="15">As Professor Crystal said a future vaccine could, for people if he is sure to be administered to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, and thus prevent nicotine addiction.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is more likely that smokers would use him to stop.</seg>
<seg id="17">"You know that if they begin to smoke it, because of the nicotine vaccine, no more pleasure, and that helps them to give up the habit," he explained.</seg>
<seg id="18">British scientists said the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that it still further research is needed.</seg>

<seg id="2">Mohammed Morsi places the oath of office, but his day of triumph should not mean the end of the political disputes in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a "new Egypt" when he was sworn in as the first freely elected president of the country and took the succession of Hosni Mubarak, who was expelled from office 16 months ago.</seg>
<seg id="4">With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi, the first freely elected Islamist president in the Arab world, and Egypt's fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.</seg>

<seg id="6">"We strive for a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic," Morsi said at the ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Today, the Egyptian people, the foundation for a new life - absolute freedom, a genuine democracy and stability," said the 60-year-old Morsi, a US-trained engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that since its inception in 84 years mostly as a banned organisation of the respective government had been targeted.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building, when Morsi arrived shortly after 11 p.m. local time in a small car convoy.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only a few hundred supporters had gathered outside the court to cheer the new president, and unlike the presidential pomp from the Mubarak-era was only briefly stopped traffic, so that the car convoy was able to cross the usually bustling streets, the city centre with the southern suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="10">When the Brotherhood uncharismatisches "spare tire" mocked his personal prestige has grown since his victory and a Friday speech in which he wanted to express itself not only as a candidate of the Islamists, but all those presented to the aspirations of the uprising in 2011 from the year against the authoritarian Mubarak.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Egypt" is now a civilian, national, constitutional and modern state, in a blue suit with a red tie clad Morsi told the judges in the wood-panelled chamber, where he took the oath of office.</seg>
<seg id="12">Morsi later went to the University of Cairo, where he should keep his inaugural speech.</seg>
<seg id="13">He was officially welcomed by a military band played the national anthem, which he listened to in Habachtstellung.</seg>
<seg id="14">The military leader, Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.</seg>
<seg id="15">He was on his arrival of hundreds of people in the main auditorium of the university, chanting "The army and the people are welcomed a hand."</seg>
<seg id="16">Founded in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, Cairo University has developed in the 1970s to a stronghold of Islamist groups of students.</seg>
<seg id="17">Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, the birthplace of the uprising last year at the end of the authoritarian rule of Mubarak, and vowed to reclaim presidential powers that the military council of the hunted leader from office.</seg>
<seg id="18">But, with the departure of the official oath before the court and not as usual in front of the parliament, he defers to the will of the military, indicating that the power struggle will continue.</seg>
<seg id="19">Morsi's speech at the Tahrir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.</seg>

<seg id="1">Frontier Airlines charges for hand luggage</seg>
<seg id="2">Frontier Airlines plans to up to 100 dollars to demand from passengers who want to stow away on their flight hand luggage.</seg>
<seg id="3">Frontier Airlines intends to up to $100 for a piece of hand luggage and 2 dollars for coffee or soda to calculate, even though the announcement on Wednesday was to read that passengers should keep the entire can.</seg>
<seg id="4">The new fee applies to hand luggage in the overhead baggage compartment above the seat, small bag under the seat remain free.</seg>
<seg id="5">Frontier said it charged 25 dollars if the fee will be paid in advance, and $100 for travelers who paid only at the gate.</seg>
<seg id="6">Frontier-spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the fee of $100 introducing to move travelers, in the run-up to the payment.</seg>
<seg id="7">"We do not want to charge this amount," she said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Airlines began in 2008 to demand for the first and second checked baggage fees.</seg>
<seg id="9">Passengers who tried to evade them, therefore, have plugged into the cabin baggage as much as possible, with the result that the baggage compartments are often overcrowded over the seat.</seg>
<seg id="10">Fees are a way to encourage passengers to take less on board.</seg>
<seg id="11">O'Malley said the new fee was not really trying to make money.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is about the most loyal customers of Frontier, which had clearly expressed that it will be increasingly difficult to find space in the box above the seat.</seg>
<seg id="13">Passengers who buy your tickets on the website of the airline, will not have to pay.</seg>
<seg id="14">This means that a passenger at the gate of Frontier, under certain circumstances should carry a bag for free, but the next person must pay $100 for a similar baggage.</seg>
<seg id="15">O'Malley said that the site of Frontier and the self-service check-in procedures would be changed so that the passengers were informed about the fee before they come to the gate.</seg>
<seg id="16">The new hand baggage fee of Frontier only enters into force in the summer, there is an exact date yet.</seg>
<seg id="17">Passengers often ranting about baggage fees and other charges, but airlines are keen to return to it.</seg>
<seg id="18">They argue that the transportation of the baggage costs money and passengers should pay for this service, if they wanted him.</seg>
<seg id="19">Many on Wall Street view the new baggage fees as a sign that the airlines have enough money to cover after years of losses, the cost of air travel.</seg>
<seg id="20">Most are so far, however, the fingers of charges for hand luggage.</seg>
<seg id="21">Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded three years ago as the first charges for hand luggage and, later, the giant Air, a low-cost carriers.</seg>
<seg id="22">The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, said the airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely follows the additional charges.</seg>
<seg id="23">He estimated in a report in December 2011 that the hand baggage fee Spirit annually bring 50 million US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="24">Sorensen, who previously held a senior position in Midwest Airlines, recently flown with spirit and was curious about what he would expect at the gate, where passengers with the unusual hand baggage fee, the company would face.</seg>
<seg id="25">"The boarding process was one of the most fluid, which, in my career, I have experienced in aviation," he said.</seg>
<seg id="26">I expected to see gnashing of teeth and physical discussions at the gate.</seg>
<seg id="27">"The plane was full," he said, "and the boarding ran like lubricated."</seg>
<seg id="28">Frontier spirit is also the 2 dollars, which are required for coffee, tea, soda or juice.</seg>
<seg id="29">The company said that passengers who bought lemonade or juice, which would keep all can and will be filled with free coffee.</seg>
<seg id="30">Water is still free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="31">Us Airways tried briefly in 2008 to demand for soft drinks, it made money, but reversed seven months later, after passengers had complained and no other large company.</seg>
<seg id="32">Frontiers step to charge fees for hand luggage if passengers don't buy directly from the airline, is the latest initiative to customers on their own website should be directed.</seg>
<seg id="33">Airlines pay online travel agencies such as orbitz 10 to 25 U.S. dollars per ticket sold.</seg>
<seg id="34">It provides an incentive for all societies, passengers to buy directly from them rather than moving through an online travel agency.</seg>
<seg id="35">Frontier has gone in this area, however, most.</seg>
<seg id="36">In September, the company began, when booking through an online travel agency, only half as many frequent flyer miles.</seg>
<seg id="37">On Wednesday, the miles have been cut again to 25 percent of the flight.</seg>
<seg id="38">A third-party booked a flight with Frontier over 1,000 miles brings customers, therefore, only 250 miles.</seg>
<seg id="39">Passengers can also book solely with the direct purchase on the website of Frontier.</seg>
<seg id="40">Frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in Denver, but the business is shrinking, and the company is losing money.</seg>
<seg id="41">The revenue fell by 9 percent and the flight capacity fell almost 13 percent in the first quarter, as reported in the financial report, which was released on Wednesday by the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc., released.</seg>
<seg id="42">Republic has tried to get under the sale of the company's finances of Frontier.</seg>

<seg id="4">The investigators of the Sheriff of Royal Horseguards County concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, the family of the 17-year-olds, however, doubts.</seg>

<seg id="5">In a speech transmitted by video link on the Open Government conference in London, Kerry said: "There is no question that the president and I and others in the government learned of some things that are almost by autopilot expired, simply because the ability to do so, which is still in the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and, of course, dating back to September 11."</seg>

<seg id="18">Moreover, I go to Europe, make it clear that in the fight against terrorism, we must continue to work together, regardless of their anger over the NSA programs.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott had a conflict of interest with parental leave</seg>
<seg id="2">The billionaire and Member Clive Palmer says, Prime Minister Tony Abbott had a conflict of interest in his plans to leave because his daughters become pregnant and therefore could benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="3">The mining magnate, who is in a legal dispute over the payment of $6 million in carbon tax, made the assertion when he wanted to wipe off the table issues, whether it was in a conflict.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important for deciding whether the carbon and mining taxes will be cut or reduced.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Palmer claimed that only ministers may have conflicts of interest and the daughters of Abbott personally by the laws would benefit.</seg>
<seg id="6">"He is a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because if one of his daughters is pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether or not they will leave," Palmer said.</seg>
<seg id="7">Two months after the election, the electoral commission said Palmer with 53 votes ahead after the recount officially to the winner of the Sunshine Coast-seat of Fairfax.</seg>

<seg id="1">ESA decides on large space missions: Missions for billions</seg>
<seg id="2">Distant planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects, which they want to start in the next few years.</seg>
<seg id="3">30 proposals were available, five are still in the race.</seg>
<seg id="4">Distant worlds.</seg>
<seg id="5">More than 1,000 planets around other stars, astronomers have already found.</seg>
<seg id="6">Whether there is at least some of them, no one knows.</seg>
<seg id="7">The selection is difficult: One is to look for gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="8">Or prefer to explore the origin of the cosmos?</seg>
<seg id="9">Or go to discover billion planets and thus perhaps alien life?</seg>
<seg id="10">These issues, the leaders of the European Space Agency ESA.</seg>
<seg id="11">For her program "Cosmic Vision" they are looking for ideas for two major space projects to advance the research.</seg>
<seg id="12">The budget for such "L-missions" is about a billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="13">The launch is expected to be 2028 and 2034.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the beginning of September, the elite of the European Space Research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.</seg>
<seg id="15">30 ideas on the table, five of which have come into the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">Many bodies examine the proposals, according to the researchers.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the next few days, a final decision by the scientific program committee should fall.</seg>
<seg id="18">A total of four major issues has chosen the Esa, which is to find the missions of the programme initiated in 2007 "Cosmic Vision" answers.</seg>
<seg id="19">What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life?</seg>
<seg id="20">The exact processes in the formation of stars from large clouds - and thus the formation of planets that orbit their stars - are still in the proverbial dark.</seg>
<seg id="21">A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness.</seg>
<seg id="22">And if a star has a planet, under what circumstances life can there be?</seg>
<seg id="23">Following this issue, is expected to start in 2017, the space telescope "royal dynasty," with the 500 known planetary systems are being investigated in our neighbourhood.</seg>
<seg id="24">The options are limited, however, his is a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million.</seg>
<seg id="25">With larger instruments astronomers could map erdähnliche planet and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres and search for "biomarkers" so: Gases, which are seen as an indicator for biological activity.</seg>
<seg id="26">As the solar system works?</seg>
<seg id="27">This question will ultimately be light on what conditions are there for the emergence of life.</seg>
<seg id="28">An important part of the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field and the particle radiation emanating from him with the planetary system.</seg>
<seg id="29">In our solar system, these events can be investigated as an example.</seg>
<seg id="30">The Solar Orbiter "Esa has already a mission of the M-Class (there is the budget at about half a billion euros) for this issue.</seg>
<seg id="31">The probe is expected to start in 2017 and observe surface and activity of the sun.</seg>
<seg id="32">Of great interest to the researchers are Jupiter and its moons.</seg>
<seg id="33">You want to find out what role of the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system.</seg>
<seg id="34">The Esa sees the first of three L-missions of the "Cosmic Vision" programme.</seg>
<seg id="35">The probe "Juice" (Jupiter Icy moons Explorer) begins its journey to 2022.</seg>
<seg id="36">Eight years later, she reaches Jupiter and is designed to study the atmosphere of the planet and the icy moons Europa and Ganymede KALLISTO.</seg>
<seg id="37">What are the fundamental physical laws of the universe?</seg>
<seg id="38">The space offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions, and thus to investigate whether the laws of nature we know there are still valid.</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps deviations that could show the physicists on the way to a new theory that all known laws of nature can be combined.</seg>
<seg id="40">How the universe was created and what it is?</seg>
<seg id="41">13.7 billion years ago, our universe was created by the Big Bang.</seg>
<seg id="42">In addition to the familiar material from the stars, planets and life as we are, there are dark matter, whose gravity galaxies and galaxy clusters, and dark energy, through which the expansion of the universe is accelerating.</seg>
<seg id="43">So far, the researchers do not know what were valid physical laws in the first split second of the Big Bang - measuring CMB, providing dark matter and dark energy.</seg>
<seg id="44">"Euclid" has the Esa here already approved an M-mission, whose launch is scheduled for 2020.</seg>
<seg id="45">With a special telescope, the probe will examine the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the whole sky and provide information on the nature of dark matter and dark energy.</seg>
<seg id="46">Who could make the race</seg>
<seg id="47">Only two of the 30 proposals will remain at the end of the selection process left.</seg>
<seg id="48">The best chances for a permit as L-mission, according to many experts "E-Lisa," an ambitious concept for the detection of gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="49">Some physicists changes in the structure of space-time that Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="50">They were not yet proven.</seg>
<seg id="51">Elisa that could create, the scientists hope behind the project.</seg>
<seg id="52">The mission provides a two or three probes existing detector, which is stationed in space.</seg>
<seg id="53">It could prove contrary to plant on earth, gravitational waves that were created in the Big Bang, and so provide new insights into the origins of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="54">Four other proposals are competing for the second L-mission: A large X-ray telescope called "Athena," which, among other things, is to study black holes, "Icy Planets," another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism," a mission to survey the cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder," the planet is to detect and investigate erdähnliche.</seg>
<seg id="55">Already retired include proposals for the samples-returning from Mars, the exploration of the moon, Venus and asteroids, as well as to the solar physics.</seg>

<seg id="5">The firefighters managed to bring a dog in security, which trapped on a 15-metre-high lead in a rock wall.</seg>
<seg id="6">The nine months old Cockerspaniel-dog Ruby was after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon running and survived three days alone, on Wednesday, before they were rescued from a quarry.</seg>
<seg id="7">Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend, Becky Hall, 20, the dog, came to the quarry Flappit in Denholme, West Yorkshire, Ruby in reception and to thank the firefighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.</seg>

<seg id="1">U.S. border: "Super-tunnel" discovered the drug smuggling</seg>
<seg id="2">On the border between Mexico and the United States have a "super-tunnel investigators" for drug smuggling discovered and shut down.</seg>
<seg id="3">As the US Customs told, was the more than 500 meters long tube between Tijuana and San Diego with electricity, railway tracks and a ventilation system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Thus, three suspects were arrested, seized eight tons of marijuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine.</seg>
<seg id="5">The tunnel had been taken, according to the information not yet in use.</seg>
<seg id="6">"These cartels are stupid if they think they can get away by digging under the radar," said the general prosecutor of the US District Southern California, Laura Duffy, at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego, where one end of the tunnel had been discovered.</seg>
<seg id="7">Turning to the drug gangs, Duffy said: "If you continue to build such tunnels and trying to use them, we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money."</seg>
<seg id="8">Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a long-running fight against the drug cartels.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since 2006, more than 77, 000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with the drug-related crime.</seg>
<seg id="10">Constructed by experts</seg>
<seg id="11">Because of the elaborate equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it was designed by architects and engineers, and that the construction took about a year to complete.</seg>
<seg id="12">The railway track was designed in such a way that electrically powered cars could be deployed there.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the Mexican side of the access is located in a building, which is 80 meters from the border.</seg>
<seg id="14">According to authorities, a ladder leads 20 meters in depth to the actual tunnel entrance.</seg>
<seg id="15">The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters in height and 90 centimetres wide.</seg>
<seg id="16">In doing so, he would have been well suited to encourage illegal immigration to the US.</seg>
<seg id="17">Two of the suspects were in connection with the cocaine-Fund arrested.</seg>
<seg id="18">The third, a Mexican, was taken because of the confiscated marijuana.</seg>
<seg id="19">All three face a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, officials said.</seg>
<seg id="20">Since 2006, eight such tunnels have been discovered, it further said at the press conference in San Diego.</seg>
<seg id="21">But it is the first time that cocaine was found in a tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="22">Normally, cocaine is smuggled in small quantities and not through tunnels.</seg>
<seg id="23">This shows the "desperation" of drug gangs, whose traditional routes are cut off by now, Bill Sherman of the drug investigation DEA in San Diego said.</seg>
<seg id="24">You would do everything to get into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="25">The detainees, no details have been announced, at least one is Mexicans, it said.</seg>
<seg id="26">You have to reckon with prison sentences of up to 10 years.</seg>

<seg id="1">Parents can choose from inter-sexual children "gender vague"</seg>
<seg id="2">Germany is the first European nation in which a third sex is recognised for children who were born with ambiguous genitals.</seg>
<seg id="3">Newborn will no longer rigidly assigned male or female.</seg>
<seg id="4">Under the new law, parents must be no more sex for such children, but will "vague" or "not" on the birth certificate.</seg>
<seg id="5">The goal of the law is to take the pressure from parents, so that they will have no hasty decisions relating to operations for a gender assignment in newborns, and to fight against the discrimination of sexual beings.</seg>
<seg id="6">An inter-sexual person, according to BBC years later said: "I am neither man nor woman.</seg>
<seg id="7">I remain a patchwork that was created by doctors, mutilated and full of scars.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is estimated that one in 2,000 children comes every year, either as a boy or a girl.</seg>
<seg id="9">They belong to the inter-sexual, a group that fall under the diagnosis of "sexual differentiation disorder" (DSD), an umbrella term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testes) or unusually developed genitals.</seg>
<seg id="10">Wallis Simpson was Inter-sexually.</seg>
<seg id="11">The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts advise in the US, one should use the best available information on gender assignment if a provision is not possible, and not wait for the psychological and physical development of the child before it decides - if any - for an operation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who has focused on the issue of gender identification, said that the new German law "sound for a good cause."</seg>
<seg id="13">-sexual children constitute an ethical dilemma.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Some people have for life-threatening diseases that make a surgical procedure, but most children do not need it, he said.</seg>
<seg id="15">We can make a gender assignment without surgery, and then wait to see how the identity is developing.</seg>
<seg id="16">The scientific data about how a child develops at all his gender identity, are not very closely.</seg>
<seg id="17">No one knows why it is happening.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is like the mystery of why people are gay.</seg>
<seg id="19">In a report to the European Commission in 2011, it says, sexual people are transsexual and transgender people to distinguish, for their status is not gender-related, but by their biological constitution, which is neither male nor female exclusively, but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them.</seg>
<seg id="20">These properties were in junior sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitalia or chromosome structures and hormones.</seg>
<seg id="21">The report also gives an overview of the discrimination, Inter-sexual, and transgender people face in the workplace and about the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice crime.</seg>
<seg id="22">Not consistent with the image of men and boys now have a special camp.</seg>
<seg id="23">Now it is possible in Australia and Nepal for adults, on official documents, male, female or "third sex."</seg>
<seg id="24">In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) as the world's first "gender-free" person acknowledged after a court, the lifelong maintenance of a "unspecified" gender status was granted.</seg>
<seg id="25">German identity cards have alongside M and W, a third allocation in the future, X for Inter sexually, the Ministry of Interior.</seg>
<seg id="26">In neighboring France gender issues are still controversial, as a news story on France 24.</seg>
<seg id="27">In 2011, dozens of French Members of the strict Catholic country signed a petition that the "gender theory" should be removed from school books.</seg>
<seg id="28">The US Catholic Online website has also voted against the German law, claiming: "If the world is being dragged into a new state, where the sex is a decision, but not sexual activity, then we twist two other pillars of civilization."</seg>
<seg id="29">The mother of a newborn baby from Maryland told zone, it would be better if babies at birth will be assigned to a sex.</seg>
<seg id="30">"The parents existence is already stressful enough without further restrictions, especially if you know the sex of their child," she told the parents' website.</seg>
<seg id="31">Children need stability and security.</seg>
<seg id="32">Historically, children who were born with both male and female sex parts, known as Hermaphroditen, after the Greek god who had both sexes.</seg>
<seg id="33">Ten years ago, the medicine regarded the sex as something that you could wipe out and then build new.</seg>
<seg id="34">But now the ethical foundations are questioned an operation, now known as the gender identity is complex, and that doctors can also be wrong because they do not know how the child feels while growing up with their assigned gender.</seg>
<seg id="35">"In the middle of the 20th century, one called it a" psychiatric emergency, "Drescher said.</seg>
<seg id="36">If such a child was born, one called the psychiatrist, but the surgeon.</seg>
<seg id="37">The prevailing theory about the treatment of children with ambiguous genitals to Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who took the view that the sex was malleable.</seg>
<seg id="38">He coined the term "gender identity" and argued that social and environmental initiatives, such as the parents educate a child - interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and characterized as whether a person regard themselves as male or female.</seg>
<seg id="39">But in one under the title "John / Joan" case from 1966 his theories have been controversial.</seg>
<seg id="40">He advised the parents of a boy whose penis was severed in a botched circumcision to neuter the child and to remove his testicles and keep him as a girl.</seg>
<seg id="41">"Money presented this case as a successful example of a conversion, which he was not, however," says Drescher.</seg>
<seg id="42">When the boy was about 15, he moved back to the male sex and married a woman.</seg>
<seg id="43">With 38 but he committed suicide.</seg>
<seg id="44">According to Drescher, there are still physicians who practice this model.</seg>
<seg id="45">But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of this sex operations have come to the public, who are "not happy" with the outcome.</seg>
<seg id="46">For example, when Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born male XY chromosomes, but ambiguous genitals.</seg>
<seg id="47">The doctors were not clear about whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never a "satisfactory life" as a man.</seg>
<seg id="48">So its external body and testicles were removed shortly after birth in 1976, he was brought up as a girl.</seg>
<seg id="49">At the age of 12, he received female hormones.</seg>
<seg id="50">"I knew that I am not a girl," he said on ABCNews.com</seg>
<seg id="51">I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.</seg>
<seg id="52">At the age of 18, he should receive a vaginal plastic.</seg>
<seg id="53">But because he was depressed and that something was amiss knew, he asked for his medical records.</seg>
<seg id="54">What he found was shocking.</seg>
<seg id="55">I have been sterilised in my birth - and no one has ever told me.</seg>
<seg id="56">Bruce was born with a DSD, his body could not produce enough testosterone to the development of the genitals.</seg>
<seg id="57">After he had told the truth, he moved back to the male identity, received testosterone injections and had his breasts removed.</seg>
<seg id="58">The operation, he has become barren.</seg>

<seg id="60">But Anne Tamar-Mattis, executive director of the California-based rights group Advocates for Informed Choice, worries that the German law "for stamping and stigmatised" could encourage.</seg>
<seg id="61">"Many activists are worried that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and the child, not to", "she explained.</seg>
<seg id="62">We fear that favours interventions.</seg>
<seg id="63">We think it would be better to give the male or female sex and then wait.</seg>
<seg id="64">But we still do not know how the law will impact, so we can only speculate.</seg>
<seg id="65">Tamar-Mattis said her organization supported the Australian law, because it allows adults, "the recognition as a third sex."</seg>
<seg id="66">"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex," she said.</seg>
<seg id="67">The German law is about the allocation at birth.</seg>
<seg id="68">This is not a war in which one should force small children at this time.</seg>
<seg id="69">When they grow up, they can decide on their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="70">But Dr. Arlene Baratz, supports a breast radio login from Pitt, who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and hundreds of others in a self-help group, says that the German law "authority" both parents and children.</seg>

<seg id="72">The target because of the faulty receptor cells for testosterone Katie developed female characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="73">She has a vagina, but no uterus and ovaries.</seg>
<seg id="74">Today, Katy 29 and is married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as a co-worker in the child psychiatry.</seg>
<seg id="75">Although it is barren, but hopes to get through adoption or a surrogate mother to a child.</seg>
<seg id="76">"The law gives parents room, so they do not have to make hasty decisions," Baratz said.</seg>
<seg id="77">It gives them the time to make various tests and to clarify things and gives them more time before they "male" or "female" write.</seg>
<seg id="78">In this way, everything is fine, you take the child and loves it.</seg>
<seg id="79">We have a wonderful baby and enjoys the parental happiness.</seg>
<seg id="80">And we must not rush to make an operation that can no longer be reversed.</seg>
<seg id="81">"That includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that concerns parents because they believe that they would not do the right thing," she explained.</seg>
<seg id="82">Ultimately, the child determines the sex, which is more suited to him - and this is wonderful.</seg>
<seg id="83">As a result, children will be able to make the decision themselves.</seg>

<seg id="1">A black box in the car?</seg>
<seg id="2">American road planners are looking for a source of money, the decaying highway system repair, and believe the solution in a small black box on the dashboard of every car.</seg>
<seg id="3">The devices, each mileage record and report the information to the authorities, are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the planning offices of the federal states, the antiquated system of financing American roads to review.</seg>
<seg id="4">The normally rather boring area of road planning has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colorful alliances.</seg>
<seg id="5">Libertarian have allied themselves with environmental groups, argue that the government of the small boxes to record the mileage - and possibly even where they were driven to use - and then use the information to calculate tax modest.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Tea Party is appalled.</seg>
<seg id="7">The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a series of data protection concerns.</seg>
<seg id="8">But while in Congress could not agree on a course of action, several states are not waiting any longer.</seg>
<seg id="9">You are looking at how they can over the next ten years to switch to a system in which drivers per-mile danger pay.</seg>
<seg id="10">Thousands of drivers have the tachograph, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring, already tested.</seg>
<seg id="11">This really is a must-have for our country.</seg>
<seg id="12">"There is nothing that we will only use it," Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Assn. of government processes said, which is planning a record of driven miles on all California motorists in the state in 2025.</seg>
<seg id="13">The way in which we pay these taxes, will change.</seg>
<seg id="14">The technology is there.</seg>
<seg id="15">The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is financed by taxes, the Americans pay at the pump, broke.</seg>
<seg id="16">But in America is no longer as much fuel as before.</seg>
<seg id="17">Cars consume less gasoline.</seg>
<seg id="18">The state-run petroleum tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 euro cents per liter) has increased for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="19">Politicians dare not at high fuel prices, raising the tax by a penny.</seg>
<seg id="20">"The gasoline tax" is simply not sustainable, Lee Munnich, an expert on business law at the University of Minnesota.</seg>
<seg id="21">His state has recently 500 cars equipped with tachographs, a mile-based payment system is to be tested.</seg>
<seg id="22">"This is the most sensible alternative in the long term," he said.</seg>
<seg id="23">Bureaucrats call it as a mileage-based user fee.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is not surprising that the idea is popular with urban liberals, because the tax could be used, for example, to influence the behaviour that congestion and climate-damaging emissions are reduced.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Californian planners rely on the system in formulating policies that the ambitious, statutory objectives of the federal state on climate change is to be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="26">But the Republican Bill Shuster made from Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, also said that he see it as the most viable long-term alternative.</seg>
<seg id="27">The free marketer of the Reason Foundation are pleased with the idea to allow drivers to pay zurückgelegter route.</seg>
<seg id="28">"This is not a tax that disappears into a black hole," Adrian Moore, vice president for policy at the Reason.</seg>
<seg id="29">People pay directly for what they get.</seg>
<seg id="30">The movement is also supported by two former American transport ministers who had urged in a report to Congress in 2011 to move in the direction of mileage-based billing.</seg>
<seg id="31">The US Senate last year approved a $90 million expensive pilot project that would have included 10,000 cars.</seg>
<seg id="32">But the majority in the House of Representatives blocked the move and responding to the concerns of MPs from rural areas, representing the people who need in everyday life, often many miles on the way to work or travel to the city.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several states and cities are still on their own in this direction.</seg>
<seg id="34">The most active Oregon, which currently 5,000 drivers for the biggest experiment in the country is mobilizing.</seg>
<seg id="35">These drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of the petroleum tax to the state.</seg>
<seg id="36">Nevada has already completed a pilot project.</seg>
<seg id="37">New York City is considering such a also.</seg>
<seg id="38">Illinois, it is testing limited with trucks.</seg>
<seg id="39">And the I-95-coalition, to which the transport ministries from 17 states on the east coast, including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently examining how one could introduce the change.</seg>
<seg id="40">The concept is not a universal hit.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Nevada, where recently 50 volunteers were fitted with the devices, motorists were skeptical of the idea that the government could pursue each of their movements.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Concerns about Big Brother and such things were a big problem," said Alauddin Khan, head of strategy and product management at the Transport Ministry of Nevada.</seg>
<seg id="43">The people wanted it.</seg>
<seg id="44">When the trial started, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: "It is relatively easy to turn the tachograph in mature monitoring devices."</seg>
<seg id="45">There is no need to build a gigantic, bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.</seg>
<seg id="46">Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology, which the state can capture the mileage, but not exactly when and where.</seg>
<seg id="47">Thus, Khan, the public would be some.</seg>
<seg id="48">The hunt for this technology has some authorities to a small startup company called True mileage in California.</seg>
<seg id="49">The company is not originally taken to help states in the taxation of drivers.</seg>
<seg id="50">Rather, it was their goal, in an emerging market for car insurance, in which drivers based on the miles driven to pay.</seg>
<seg id="51">But the devices are tested for road planners are interesting, because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information that is regularly uploaded via modem.</seg>
<seg id="52">"People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded," Ryan Morrison, managing director of True mileage said.</seg>
<seg id="53">In some of these public pilot programs big mistakes have been made.</seg>
<seg id="54">There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="55">In Oregon, the planners are experimenting with motorists to give a series of choices.</seg>
<seg id="56">You can opt for a device with or without GPS.</seg>
<seg id="57">Or they can choose any device and instead pay a flat fee, based on the average of all the inhabitants of the state driven miles.</seg>
<seg id="58">Others hope that the concept of a suspicious public sale by providing the equipment with more functions than with little.</seg>
<seg id="59">In New York City traffic officials want to develop a device for taxation, which can also pay parking fees to be paid only for driving distances insurance must be collected and speed data from other vehicles in real time, thanks to which drivers will be able to avoid traffic jams.</seg>
<seg id="60">"Motorists would be the added value of the benefits of the system, motivated to participate," says a planning document of the city.</seg>
<seg id="61">Some traffic planners wonder, however, whether the pay per mile over all the talk is not only a huge distraction.</seg>
<seg id="62">The Metropolitan Transportation Commission, the area of the San Francisco Bay for officials said, the Congress, the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund can simply by raising the fuel tax.</seg>
<seg id="63">An additional one-time fee or an annual levy could motorists with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume less gasoline, so they pay their fair share.</seg>
<seg id="64">"There is no need for an operation, even if an aspirin is enough," said Randy Rentschler, director of legislation and public affairs of the Commission.</seg>
<seg id="65">If we do that hundreds of millions, of drivers about their privacy, and many other things.</seg>

<seg id="1">Security concerns in Mozambique grow in the face of clashes between influential personalities</seg>
<seg id="2">Thousands of people gathered in the centre Maputos under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder and first president of Mozambique, in a rare public demonstration, calling for peace.</seg>
<seg id="3">"We want peace, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, managing director of an investment company.</seg>
<seg id="4">Out of fear for the future of the country, they have their business attire for a T-shirt with the inscription "We want security" in Portuguese and exchanged the crowd on Thursday in Independence Square in the capital.</seg>
<seg id="5">For two weeks, there are almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and RENAMO, which are among the worst fighting since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="6">A notorious rebel movement RENAMO, which was initially supported by the white-ruled Rhodesia and later the apartheid government of South Africa was once in an effort to destabilize the country's independent government.</seg>
<seg id="7">After the 1992 peace treaty, she became an opposition party.</seg>
<seg id="8">Analysts believe it is unlikely that the country back case back into a full-scale conflict, but recent events have alarmed foreign investors and locals.</seg>
<seg id="9">For the fast-growing economy is a lot at stake, since the discovery of huge gas reserves off the coast and coal camps in the northwest over the next few years, could investment of more than $50 billion from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, ENI of Italy and Anadarko from the United States into the country.</seg>
<seg id="10">The ruling FRELIMO Party, the dominant force since 1975, and RENAMO are blaming each other for the tensions.</seg>
<seg id="11">RENAMO claims that the government had provoked the recent clashes, as they had attacked on 17 October, its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold Renamos.</seg>
<seg id="12">The attacks on the former rebels escalated when government troops attacked RENAMO-bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, said Renamos spokesman to the Financial Times.</seg>
<seg id="13">The government gives RENAMO, the blame for the clashes and accused the organization to have attacked soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="14">President Armando Guebuza has tried to play down concerns about instability.</seg>
<seg id="15">With AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama regard themselves as a "loser" who "wants to use all its remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions of the government."</seg>
<seg id="16">Both FRELIMO and RENAMO stress that they want to avoid a war.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the concerns have increased since Mazanga quoted with the words, RENAMO to give the peace agreement in 1992.</seg>
<seg id="18">To the FT, he explained that he meant that FRELIMO no longer respect the agreement.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Our vision is to resume negotiations and" seriously, Mazanga said.</seg>
<seg id="20">Previous talks between the parties have contributed little to resolving the tensions that have been fired by a series of clashes this year.</seg>
<seg id="21">"We have two adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama), who heads collide," says Joseph'Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique expert.</seg>
<seg id="22">None of them are good at bargaining and no one is willing to make the necessary concessions.</seg>
<seg id="23">RENAMO, which is pressing for electoral reform, has already said that it will boycott the local elections in November.</seg>
<seg id="24">Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.</seg>
<seg id="25">Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an ailing movement's attempt to obtain concessions and financial incentives from the government.</seg>
<seg id="26">Shrink Renamos electoral success since 1992, while a new party, a former RENAMO member, founded Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM), likely will improve in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="27">Mazanga claimed that Guebuza, whose resignation comes when his second term ends next year, wants to destroy the country's democracy.</seg>
<seg id="28">"He wants a multiparty democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he wants no peace because he will not give up the presidency," said Mazanga.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is unclear what capacity RENAMO, but it has disruptive attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south connections.</seg>
<seg id="30">Most of the fighting took place in the province of Sofala, which lies a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo, Beira is, however, the port, the mining companies like Rio Tinto and Vale use for the export of coal.</seg>
<seg id="31">In June, Rio interrupted a month for the use of the railways, after RENAMO announced an attack on the track.</seg>
<seg id="32">Mazanga responded cautiously to the question of whether RENAMO will repeat that threat.</seg>
<seg id="33">RENAMO, the international community "wanted to warn that" things are not going well in Mozambique, Mazanga said.</seg>
<seg id="34">The instability has increased the frustration over the government nor Fernando Lima, Head of Media Coop, an independent media company says, because many people already worried about the corruption, the slow progress in the development and a recent wave of kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="35">"People think that the future of the country and the government is responsible for the president and he should be the one to find solutions to the problems," he says.</seg>
<seg id="36">Omar sultans, a demonstrator, said that people simply wanted stability.</seg>

<seg id="4">At a joint meeting of the councils from Haslach, years later, mills, fishing stream, Alpine and catfish Chen health prepared on Saturday to the changes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Because nothing is more in the fundamental decisions to change the diocese and the parish councils to implement them as well.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the course of the day, it was very clear: The skepticism about the new is tentatively but increasingly a confidence.</seg>
<seg id="7">The ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and the size of the parish council filed the very constructive discussions of the six bodies with the main official of the ministry teams.</seg>
<seg id="8">Regional dean George Schmitt explained in a presentation of the revised guidelines for ministry units in the diocese of Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="9">After that, the SE Haslach forms as a parish in the future, a public body that enters the rights and obligations of the past six individual parishes.</seg>
<seg id="10">There will be only a single parish council and a foundation board, where the pastor force office is represented.</seg>
<seg id="11">In every parish at least two elected members are to be represented in the six parishes so-called community teams will be formed on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="12">Their task will be to promote the religious life in the village.</seg>
<seg id="13">When asked about the finances of the individual parish considerable conversation needs showed.</seg>
<seg id="14">The innovations provide that accumulated assets remain in the parishes earmarked.</seg>
<seg id="15">By contrast, the liabilities go to the whole community.</seg>
<seg id="16">Particularly in view of the large planned investments, whose commitment to make all parishes, there have been major concerns.</seg>
<seg id="17">"In the past has been invested in projects that could be managed by individual parishes alone," Haslachs parish council chairman Bruno Prince Bach relativism.</seg>
<seg id="18">Practical experience with a joint body for five parishes described Barbarian Knight, the chairman of the board at the ministry unit Schutterwald-Munich.</seg>
<seg id="19">In 2006, they had to be "One, five remain" and noted that it is not so simple.</seg>
<seg id="20">The bodies of the Haslacher ministry unit were then to answer the questions on the future composition and size of the joint parish council and the practical work of the local teams.</seg>
<seg id="21">The compositions are specified in further meetings and decided in another joint meeting of all six bodies next spring.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the end, parish council Michael Pleasant from Steinach presented the new logo of the ministry unit, which was approved by a clear majority.</seg>

<seg id="1">Report: Obama's campaign considered to replace Biden by Hillary Clinton</seg>
<seg id="2">The closest advisers of President Barack Obama have considered in secret to replace Vice President Joe Biden in the 2012 campaign by Hillary Clinton, the New York Times.</seg>
<seg id="3">The revelation is the surprise of the long-awaited work by Mark John and get healthy man on the 2012 campaign, "Double Down: Game Change 2012."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Times is a copy of the forthcoming book, and they reported on Thursday evening that the president Topberater "extensive group meetings and opinion polls at the end of 2011" had carried out to find out whether the appearance of Obama's dwindling hopes of re-election better if he let fall Biden.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to Jonathan Martin, national political correspondent for the Times, the book carefully traces the history of efforts from senior officials of the campaign and the White House to exchange names of former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley to measure what effect it had on the poll numbers, the former Secretary of State Clinton against the vice president.</seg>
<seg id="6">The potential change was a closely guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and in the Oval Office.</seg>
<seg id="7">Only half a dozen of the president's closest advisers - including Daley, Obama's former campaign manager, Jim Messina, and the former White House senior adviser, David Axelrod and David Plouffe, knew about the planned change.</seg>
<seg id="8">In "Double Down" is claimed, Daley had stood at the forefront of efforts to exchange Biden, despite their "close, personal relationship" before it finally decided against such a move after the data showed that the Clinton's candidacy "would not significantly improve the chances of Obama."</seg>
<seg id="9">In an interview with Martin Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered to replace Biden by Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I made a whole series of things that you should consider, and this was one of them," Daley told the magazine.</seg>
<seg id="11">We must remember that the president had terrible poll numbers, so we thought: "For God's sake, what do we do?"</seg>
<seg id="12">While Daley described the investigation as "due diligence," Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN said that the re-election of considerable effort has been made during the campaign to find out whether such a move is paid in relation to the ballot box.</seg>
<seg id="13">"In campaigns is not spent so much money on surveys and focus groups, if you don't think seriously about something," said Martin on AC360.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team thought about an exchange.</seg>
<seg id="15">Martin said on CNN, he asked Daley whether his former boss had known about the potential change.</seg>
<seg id="16">Although Daley said that he does not believe that the president of the possible change was "aware" that the former chief of staff, admitted that it was "possible" that Obama did not know about it.</seg>
<seg id="17">Martin added that "Double Down" deliver a definitive answer to the question of whether the political soundings have reached Obama's desk.</seg>
<seg id="18">Martin Cooper, whether he seriously think asked Obama knew nothing of the inquiries about whether we should let Biden in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Possible," said Martin.</seg>

<seg id="2">Whenever it comes to City Council meetings about the budget, Mayor Ralph Gerster has a good laugh.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Gemeindesäckl in oven cheeks-Schönach is well stocked and debt already knows the administration no longer since 2005.</seg>
<seg id="4">The financial year 2012 can be recorded in this sense as an unqualified success.</seg>
<seg id="5">This was during the presentation of the annual accounts for 2012.</seg>
<seg id="6">As Andrea Roth mouth explained that the administration budget has been with around 7.6 million euros over a million euros higher than planned.</seg>
<seg id="7">The surplus of the administrative budget bed with some 1.8 million euros, about one million euros over the approach.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thanks to the surplus was mainly higher business tax revenues and the share of income tax.</seg>
<seg id="9">The capital budget was again well above the planned values.</seg>
<seg id="10">Instead of the proposed EUR 1.5 million last year, it amounted to EUR 2.5 million.</seg>
<seg id="11">"This is due largely to the higher feed from the administrative budget," says Roth.</seg>
<seg id="12">As for the financial year 2012 are made less investment than planned, the reserves feeding is higher.</seg>
<seg id="13">Overall, the general reserve could be increased by about EUR 2.1 million to a total of EUR 4.9 million now.</seg>

<seg id="1">Desperate cry of an Obama voter</seg>
<seg id="2">I have twice elected President Obama in the hope that change is possible</seg>
<seg id="3">He said that Obama has made commendable efforts that have been thwarted by the Republican blocking tactics</seg>
<seg id="4">The blockade policy does not excuse the website problems of Obamacare, the drone strikes</seg>
<seg id="5">Obama's memoir about the 2008 campaign is a sad reminder of what would have been possible.</seg>
<seg id="6">Nathaniel P. Morris is a student in the second year at Harvard Medical School.</seg>
<seg id="7">Currently, I read a terribly sad book.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is a book which I have believed that it would be sad council during the second year of my medical studies and give me hope again.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is called "The Audacity to Win" (courage to win) and describes the memoirs of Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the evening, when I'm finished with my patients transcripts and go to bed, then the book brings me back to a time when the policy inspired millions and rob a talk the breath.</seg>
<seg id="11">The election was a landslide victory and intelligence spokesman being considered to lead the historical significance of this hour.</seg>
<seg id="12">My classmates wept with joy and my parents collected all the newspapers that they could find.</seg>
<seg id="13">A young team of visionaries was on the way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.</seg>
<seg id="14">That changed when Obama into office in 2008, he had approval values of 82%.</seg>
<seg id="15">And then I close the book.</seg>
<seg id="16">To switch back to the present is a rude awakening, as if it is taken from a dream.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is hard to remember this optimistic times - they seem to be a faint memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the years since I made my voice for the first time, in fact, something has changed.</seg>
<seg id="19">But there is simply nothing that I could have imagined.</seg>
<seg id="20">I recognize the great and versatile things, which Obama has achieved, the passage of the Affordable Care Act for health insurance until the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of forced city of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden.</seg>
<seg id="21">I also believe that the partisan obstruction tactics have tilted too many efforts that our nation should be brought forward: Immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closing of Guantanamo Bay, to name but a few.</seg>
<seg id="22">But after countless times, the Obama administration has defended with colleagues and friends, I am with my statement try at the end.</seg>
<seg id="23">I have reached a point of political desperation.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Republican blockade policy could not explain why it allows the interception of foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas.</seg>
<seg id="25">It cannot explain why the National Security Agency data about the private lives of Americans and why be punished whistleblowers who disclose government misconduct.</seg>
<seg id="26">It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki was an American citizen, was killed without trial, nor why the public financing and spending limits during the presidential elections.</seg>
<seg id="27">It does not justify the results of a report, which says that the efforts of the White House to restrain the media were "the most aggressive... since the Nixon administration."</seg>
<seg id="28">And it cannot excuse jüngstens's inability to draft in more than three years since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, a simple website.</seg>
<seg id="29">I don't know if it is what I should have expected.</seg>
<seg id="30">Whether I should have to understand that the government could contradict the work of her previous political campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="31">Obviously, this is not a predictable course Abgeordnetenamt, as an opposition party and random events like the Newtown massacre-shape the public debate.</seg>
<seg id="32">But when I look at the above examples, they seem to be largely chosen by the government itself.</seg>
<seg id="33">And that bothers me the most.</seg>
<seg id="34">I have chosen Obama again in 2012, not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.</seg>
<seg id="35">Mitt Romney was a confusing and half-baked alternative, he seemed not define its direction and positions.</seg>
<seg id="36">I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would meet the hope that we have heard for so long.</seg>
<seg id="37">But with the sinking of the ratings for Obama to less than 45% this week is a return to the year 2008 through this book has become even harder.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is the longing for the many promises that have vanished into thin air makes me.</seg>
<seg id="39">This week I read a section in the book, which describes how Obama has dealt a heavy loss against Clinton in the primaries in Pennsylvania.</seg>
<seg id="40">In a meeting with the election officials after the decision, he told his staff, they would have to come back on track and follow the purpose of their cause.</seg>
<seg id="41">"I want us to" rediscover our magic, he said.</seg>
<seg id="42">We need to remember who we are. "</seg>
<seg id="43">There are five years later, Mr. President, and I could not agree with you more.</seg>
<seg id="44">The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nathaniel Morris.</seg>
