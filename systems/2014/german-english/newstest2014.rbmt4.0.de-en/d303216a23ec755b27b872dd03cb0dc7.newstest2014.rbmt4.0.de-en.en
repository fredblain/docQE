Bath thin home: A dream becomes true for the FC
At the importance for the city and the soccer club the official opening celebration did not pay for anything for the artificial turf sports ground in spite of the cold weather and the rain one.
Presumably all had wanted a more pleasant ceremony on the last Saturday, however, Petrus did not want to play in this case.
So all those had the checking, that came without umbrella or could not hold one like that for any reason.
That went the musicians that framed the ceremonial act just the same as some speaker.
Also the FC chairperson Albrecht Schlenker who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream became wet therefore.
His thanks were meant first and foremost for mayor Walter Klumpp that committed himself to the conversion of the project strongly, the district council, the shared enterprises and association members that brought in.
Here completely especially Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The r√ºstigen pensioners laid out 400 square meters of paving stones for the new ways.
Also the landtag State Parliament representative Karl Rombach acknowledged this remarkable honorary engagement.
Further greeting words spoke for the urban sport committee Hubert Baier, the district chairperson of the south Baden soccer association Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr of the planning office, who announced a donation for the youth department of the club.
Mayor Klumpp brought into memory, that always again weather influences turning round in the spring and fall added the initial field so, that it could not be played on.
Already 15 years ago there were the first considerations to the solution of the problem when the construction of a third place was thought of near the ground of the soccer club or near the secondary school at the saltworks lake.
Both was rejected again.
Six years ago thoughts for the application of an artificial turf sports ground arose, which was regarded as the ultimative solution generally.
Concrete plannings were incorporated two years ago, when the FC took over the Schabelstube into heritage lease, a cost participation of 100 000 euros for the construction of the place accepted and the country promotion means of 104 000 euros approved.
The district council concluded in October 2012 the takeover of the remaining 356 000 euros at the total costs of 560 000 euros, summarized Klumpp.
The start of building of the 68 times 108 meters of big artificial turf place occurred on 4th June.
During the more than three months continuous construction phase 3000 cubic meters of earth were leveled from which half was used for the application of a Dirt-Bike-stretch
