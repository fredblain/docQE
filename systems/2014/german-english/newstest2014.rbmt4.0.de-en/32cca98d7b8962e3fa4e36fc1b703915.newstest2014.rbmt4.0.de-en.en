Shrill cheeping disturbs residents
Rhenus Midgard invested also ashore strongly.
You distribute the coal coming of the ships onto the slope.
The enterprise has at the location now several irons in the fire.
Next to the coal import Rhenus Midgard puts among other things on wind installation logistics.
Black the coal glimmers on the storage area in front of the dike
Two tremendous blue Slope pour- and moving-chargers chargers distribute or load the coal here as required.
At every movement of the envelope devices a shrill warning-noise sounds over the ground.
"The signals are used for the security and are by law stipulated", says Matthias Schrell, manager of the Rhenus Midgard, in Wilhelmshaven.
At wind standing detrimentally that is to be heard unfortunately to a large extent - and so there were already some complaints of people from the city north.
He accepts the complaints very much and contacted therefore the concerned persons, says the 40-year long one.
In narrow agreement with the authorities one is now at holding the danger signals with technical measures more quietly
Also in the future he puts on the open dialog with the neighbors.
Because Matthias Schrell plans still some at the location
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony bridge Rhenus Midgard keeps on putting on the coal import for power stations and one of the large ones is on this sector in Europe.
Thanks to the chaise longue tub hollow on 18.5 meters in front of the terminal also Capesize bulk carriers can be dispatched for a long time here.
"This year we" want "to crack" during the envelope" the 3-million-ton-brand according to Schrell.
Next to the Eon power station on site the import coal goes to power stations in the inland.
If the GDF-Suez power station still goes onto the net, 5 million tons of coal import per annum are well realistic.
The three Schiffsentlader on the bridge as well as the second conveyor belt could create up to 10 million.
