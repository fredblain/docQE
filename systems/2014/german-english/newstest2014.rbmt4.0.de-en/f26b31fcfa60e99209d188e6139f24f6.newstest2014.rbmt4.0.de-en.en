USA keep on wanting to pursue Snowden legally
The USA did not change their attitude to the former US secret service employee Edward Snowden.
He keeps on being reproached to have passed on without authorization secret information.
Therefore he must be confronted in the USA with a punishment procedure, said the speaker of the US foreign ministry of State, Jennifer Psaki, in Washington.
Also the recent comments of Snowden would not change anything at that.
Before the German greens politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had appealed to the USA after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow, not to keep on threatening it with punishment
Psaki stressed, that it is a question of those of a parliamentarian with the case of Ströbeles comments and not around those of a German government member.
