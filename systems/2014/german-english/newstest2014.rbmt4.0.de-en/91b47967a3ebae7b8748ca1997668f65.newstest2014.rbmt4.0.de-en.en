FAA: Passengers can use now electronic devices in airplanes (but no mobile conversations lead)
Flight travellers can hear now of the takeoff up to the landing their electronic devices for the reading, works playing, music and the renown of films use, not phone, however, with the mobile, so the new guidelines that were handed over by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Thursday in the USA.
Nevertheless the passengers should not expect that these changes are transformed immediately.
How they were implemented quickly would depend on the respective airline, declared FAA-employee Michael Huerta on a press conference.
The airlines must prove the FAA that airplanes correspond to the new guidelines and that they updated the training manuals of the flight personnel as well as the regulations for the stowage of the devices according to the new rules.
The FAA declared, she received already from some airlines plans that would like to build up the use of portable electronic devices in airplanes.
Also delta and JetBlue were among these airlines.
„According to state of the plan we could very soon approve the extended use of electronic devices", announced the FAA in an announcement.
Currently passengers must switch off smartphones, Tablets and other devices if the airplane doors are closed.
You may not start it before then again if the airplane has reached a height of three kilometers and the captain gives green light.
With the case of the entry into the landing the passengers must switch it off again and they must not start again before the airplane landed.
To the new guidelines airlines whose airplanes are protected against electronic troubles could allow their passengers, the devices also at start, landing and the FAA declared to use on the landing field.
Most new airliners and other airmen which were adapted by Wi-Fi for the use in bigger heights should fulfill the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the professional association of professional flight attendants, welcomed the changes.
„If the new regulation is secure moved – and we cooperate concerning that with the airline closely –, both page of that, Glading commented on," profit.
We are it honestly said, to have to feel us with the case of this topic as overseers.
Nevertheless internet connections to the surf remained, the authority explained exchange of E-Mails, kept on being forbidden to plaintext messages or to download of data under three kilometers.
Passengers are asked to move smartphones, Tablets and other devices into the flight mode.
Therefore still no „Words With Friends", the online game resembling Scrabble that played the actor Alec Baldwin 2011 on his smartphone, than he public-effectively had to leave a jet of American Airlines because he refused to switch off the device while the airplane was being parked at the gate.
And heavier devices as laptops must be packed also furthermore since an injury danger exists here if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile conversations during the flight keep on being forbidden also furthermore.
The regulation competence for telephone conversations is near the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not at the FAA.
FAA cancels possibly prohibition for certain electronic devices with the case of start and landing
Last month mark of Rosenker of the road safety authority National Transportation Safety Board said, security expert for national traffic questions on CBS news, mobiles would still be considered as a risk.
„To Handy are real a problem, not only because they could cause troubles potentially near navigation devices, but because we of the FCC know that the transfer from the air can interrupt also transmission fattenings", according to Rosenker.
A consultation committee of the branch which was started up by the FAA for the investigation of this topic recommended last month that the government allows a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In the last years the pressure increased itself to the FAA, to loosen restrictions on the use.
Critics as the democratic senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri represent the opinion there are not any valid safety reasons for the prohibition
The restrictions are to be put through also increasingly more heavily because the use of the devices became omnipresent.
In some studies it is talked about that, that forgets up to a third of the passengers the shutdown of the device or ignores.
The FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic devices through flight travellers after reports about troubles of navigation and communication devices through VHF-radios carried along by passengers which then represented the newest technique trend had become known.
New airplanes are by far more dependent on electric systems as former generations of aircraft, but they are also so constructed and approved by the FAA, that them electronic interferences nothing form.
Airlines are offering passengers Wi-Fi already for some years if the altitude is reached.
The airmen adapted onto Wi-Fi-systems are also more immune opposite interferences.
The predominant majority of the passenger planes should be suitable for the stronger use of electronic devices to the new guidelines, said Huerta.
The present electronic devices give in general considerably less radio radiation than former generations.
E-Reader give for example only minimum radiation if one umblättert.
However, in the case of the download or sending of data the transmission parameters are stronger.
Amazon.com numbers among the advocates of a loosening of the restrictions on the device use through passengers.
In 2011 company employees loaded a passenger plane fuller Kindle E-Reader and did a test flight in order to determine problems, could not arrest, however, any.
Members of the FAA consultation committee expressed mixed feelings, which concerns to the risk during the use of devices.
Douglas Kidd of the passenger association National Association of Airline Passengers said he thinks, the trouble through the devices is really even if the risk is minimal.
Other committee members said there are only occasional reports by pilots who would speak for a trouble from airplane systems through the devices, and most of them are very old.
The committee recommended the FAA, however, to allow pilots to order the shutdown of the devices in the case of instrument landing under bad view relations through the passengers.
A grouping from the travel branch welcomed the changes and referred as a reasonable adaptation for travellers who would be endowed with technique today extensively.
„We are pleased with the FAA recognizing that a pleasant passenger experience does not stand contrary to the security said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
