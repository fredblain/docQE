Rat takes railway constructions siding tracks into the visor
Is the level crossing "Am deer" supposed to be rebuilt extensively in order to increase the road safety?
The district councils decided.
Schiltach must take 220 000 euros for that into the hand.
The German Railways want to improve in the coming year the Kinzigtal bus route.
Especially the security is supposed to be increased in this case at level crossings - regularly it keeps up in a nationwide way to collisions of trains other vehicles.
If the municipalities agree to the structural alteration measures, they must participate with a third in the costs, railways and Federal Government divide themselves the rest.
Schiltachs city master builder Roland Grießhaber explained the special features of the Bahübergangs "Am deer" to the district council.
There the city plans, in to build height of the nonlocal tunnel mouth west of the railway tracks a deflection.
There can also bigger vehicles, for example such that transport long-cut wood with the case of oncoming traffic traffic stand without having to block the rails
Grießhaber suggested therefore to construct a necessary retaining wall so.
This was discussed in the district council controversially since some councils questioned the necessity of a street circulation: Thomas Kipp brought the atmosphere of the critics with his comment onto the point: "We must take so much money because of so few vehicles into the hand"?
Mayor Thomas Haas contradicted: The level crossing "deer" is used regularly for long-cut wood transportations.
Even wood from the field "cow creek is transported in part over this stretch because the up to 20 meters long vehicles could not use the stretch at the Häberlesbrücke because they could not turn there into the main road.
In addition the stretch is used as Umleitungfür the vehicles that must not use the tunnel if the main road is spaced, argued Haas.
Since it is to be foreseen that Kirchberg- and castle mountain tunnels would have to be rebuilt and renovated as this is currently the case in Wolfach, "Am "deer" also for a longer period can be to the level crossing "of an important traffic importance
The councils agreed on making examine which costs the thought broadening of the street would cause.
Despite that was agreed the reconstruction of the level crossing mainly with the possible specification, that the necessary retaining wall is built so that the city can extend the subsequent street where appropriate direction "Railway station trasses" for meeting traffic on about 5.5 meters.
On the other hand the reconstruction of the level crossing near the tannery familiar wine could involve a very different problem which affects the access into the "Geroltzhäuser Weg" going up strongly.
The administration had made examine the reconstruction plans of the railways of the engineering office Breinlinger since she had doubts about whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser way is still possible without further one.
The investigation came for the result, that it is not to be excluded that the inclination relations of the street could result in longer vehicles sitting up.
The responsibility for that supports in turn the city as a road construction load carrier.
The reconstruction can involve accordingly liability quarrels.
Since both the wood removal and the turning in the current capacity stage functioned, one is not supposed to agree to the reconstruction of the level crossing, argued Haas.
Also the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle standing on the crossing is clearly smaller at this place than at the other level crossings because the breakpoint middle to which a good line of sight connection exists is directly next to that.
Even trains of the central station would have to be here at this place already so far slowed down that no collision threatens.
Mainly the approval was refused the reconstruction of this level crossing since the city of Schiltach "would have to pay" for the problem with vehicles sitting up, according to the councils since the railways can withdraw from the responsibility on completion of the construction works.
The committee considers the reconstructions as unproblematic at the level crossings "Before hay creek and "Before cow creek for which already crossing agreements with the railways were reached.
