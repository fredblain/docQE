Tourism: Descent to the Romans
On about 120 meters length is below Cologne a sewer from the Roman time keep.
Who goes to Cologne does not pass by the cathedral.
About 157 meters jut out the two towers into the sky and turn it into the second-highest church building of Europe.
Nevertheless only few visitors who gaze at the two filigree church towers foresee that discovering an amount gives also under the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert as regards underworld of Cologne.
The service-center of Cologne-tourism is meeting place for his leaderships directly at the cathedral.
The round begins very unspectacularly: "We begin in the basement garage", Schulze says.
In the seventies the city fathers wanted an selfjust city, and therefore only that kept on standing from the residues of the old city wall, which was not too large.
Most users of the multi-storey car park hurry therefore past today also at the roman remains and park only their car.
However, who in a more exact way hinschaut, discovered in the parking deck D2 an archeological place of finding separated by metal railings.
About five meters of high ruins are to be seen of palm of the hand big stones.
"There are residues of the roman city wall which was built in the second half of the first century according to Christ", tells Schulze.
Before it goes again back onto the daylight, Schulze makes the participants on the upper park level fling another look into a shaft dark, 15 meters deep.
That is the well of the old cathedral which is also hardly perceived unfortunately.
The Prätorium is next station of the round, and here the participants climb again down into the depth.
We experience the seat of the once most powerful man here north of the alps, the pregate of the CCAA.
A visitor would like to know what means CCAA.
"The abbreviation stands" for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium", what on good German" so much as "City of roman right and city the Agrippinenser, founded under emperors of Claudius at the place of the altar for the emperor cult means".
And near the Prätorium it is a question of the former governor palace, the power center of the roman empire at the Rhine.
From the vestibule of the exhibition a tunnel access leads to the roman sewer which is to receive length here on about 120 meters.
"You can go along a piece quiet along the so-called Cloaca maximums if you want" Schulze muntert the guests on.
Schulze still has a surprise.
After his getting the key at the cash box, it leads the group to a shaft 16 meters deep, accessible.
"We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath", it declares.
The Jewish municipality built their bath deeply into the ground in order to come onto the groundwater that was indispensable for the ritual ablutions.
Until today different water levels are ablesbar in the lower end of the Mikwe that origins decrease until the eighth century through changing turn-off levels of the Rhine.
The Mikwe becomes part of an archeological zone on the city hall place for which the construction works shortly are supposed to begin.
Up to the finishing still some years will go by, however.
