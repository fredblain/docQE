Halloween 2013: In numbers
When I was small, Halloween had something magic.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, stay up late and dress ourselves up for the neighborhood.
Today I rather became the Halloween-sourpuss.
In the last two years I did not declare myself readily to distribute sweets from my apartment, and will not do it presumably also this year.
But according to statistics I am a black sheep, which concerns to Halloween.
The majority of the Americans - 158 million, in order to be exactly – this year of Halloween celebrate and in total 6.9 billion United States dollars for sweets, costumes and decorations distribute in this case, according to the US American association of the retailers (NRF).
A thing, onto which I me every Halloween then nevertheless again pleases, the trend values are.
The costumes will form about 1.2 billion of the 6.9 billion of spent United States dollar, according to the NRF.
This year seductive inanimate objects are the last scream.
Women must wrap no more in sexy clothing, they can embody now pizza, hamburger or carrots also seductive food as about instance.
I every amount expect what concerns to men zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bets, the Daft punk space men will get it this year into the Instagram-Feeds.
According to Google zombies, Batman, pirates and witches are the meistgesuchten costumes.
I presume, it nothing is turned at tradition.
We covered last year our dogs and were not in this way alone for my astonishment.
In fact Americans spend 330 million dollars this year for costumes of their domestic animals, according to the NRF.
Those ones are an amount „Hot Dogs".
We are not what concerns to sweets oversensitive.
Americans will spend this year 1.9 billion dollars for that, according to The Nielsen Company.
Those ones are about 270 million kilograms at chocolate bars, lollipops, candies and rubber bears.
Therefore good news for those according to US Board of Trade of Commerce of Commerce 41 million people that pull „Sweet or Acid" through the quarters with the saying.
In fact we will buy more than 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – we do not show anything to ourselves – eat.
The only thing which we would not like to consume is the sugar-sweet Candy Corn; nevertheless 15 million kilograms of that are sold around Halloween, according to the National association of the sweets manufacturers.
Those ones are about instance nine billion maize kernels.
It is a puzzle which I could not solve yet.
Nothing belongs anymore to Halloween as houses which it haunts.
You have splendid names as „Terror Behind the Walls" (what after all the way stands in a real prison), „Howl-O-Scream" and „The House of Shock".
There are in fact 1,200 officially acknowledged spook houses to America Haunts so in the United States that 500 million dollars achieve proceeds, and that includes the wonderful photos on which one pees just into the trousers and that friends put then on Facebook, where one does not rid oneself of it again, and the type onto which one stands leaves a comment to one then as „nice facial expression".
But let's come at last to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown machte vertraut us with the Large Pumpkin when we were children, and the carving of a pumpkin lantern is as the adorning of the Christmas tree – something, that we have done of small on.
Fortunately that one began „Baby in the pumpkin" trend only last year thanks to pint rest, so that most of us grew up with carving the pumpkin, and not, to be in that.
This year Americans will spend about 106 million dollars for pumpkins, so the US Census office.
The pumpkin lantern which rots slowly in the front garden comes presumably from Illinois, where this year 245 million kilograms of pumpkins were harvested.
If you liked to score correctly, you Tim and Susan Mathisdon call then into Napa, californiums at and you carve something pretty from their 921 kilos heavy pumpkin.
