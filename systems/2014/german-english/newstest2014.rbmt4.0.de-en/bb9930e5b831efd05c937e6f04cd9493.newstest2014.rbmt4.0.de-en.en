Esa decides on great space missions: Missions for billions
Far planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts of the European space travel agency must agree now on two large projects which want to start it in the next years.
30 proposals were selectable, five are still in the running.
Far worlds.
Astronomers already found more than 1000 planets at other stars.
No one knows whether at least there are lives on some of them.
The selection is difficult: Is one supposed to search for gravitational waves?
Or investigating the origin of the cosmos more gladly?
Or searching for earth-similar planets and discovering maybe extraterrestrial life in this way?
These questions are just asked to the European space travel agency Esa the persons responsible in charge.
For their program "Cosmic Vision" they search ideas for two great space travel projects which are supposed to voranbringen the research decisively.
The budget for such "l-missions" is in each case about instance near a billion euros.
The start will be 2028 and 2034 probable.
At the beginning of September the elite of the European astrionics met in Paris, around proposals for such missions to discuss.
30 ideas were under discussion, five of them were short-listed now.
Numerous committees examine the proposals haken with the researchers after.
In the next days a final decision is supposed to fall through the scientific program committee.
The Esa onto which the missions of the program "Cosmic Vision" initiated in 2007 are supposed to find Answers selected in total four great questions.
What are the conditions for the origin of planets and lives?
The exact processes during the formation of stars from big gas clouds - and in this way also the origin of planets that circle these stars - lie still in the proverbial darkening.
A big infrared telescope in the space could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has planets, under which circumstances life can arise there?
In order to follow this question, the space telescope "Cheops" with which 500 already known planetary systems are examined in our nearer surroundings in a more exact way is supposed to start in 2017.
The possibilities are, however, restricted, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With bigger instruments the astronomers could show earth-similar planets and analyze them even the composition of their atmospheres and search them so according to "Biomarkern": To gases which are valid as an index for biological activity.
How does the solar system function?
Also this question is supposed to give ultimately information about which conditions there are for the origin of lives.
An important role plays the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of his magnetic field as well as the particle radiation going out of it with the planetary system.
In our solar system these processes can be examined exemplarily.
With the "Solar Orbiter" the Esa granted already a mission of the M-class (there the budget is near about instance half a billion of euros) for this question.
The probe is supposed to start in 2017 and observe surface and activity of the sun exactly.
From great interest in the researchers also Jupiter and his moons are.
You want to find out which role the giant planet played during the development of the solar system.
For that the Esa plans the first of the in total three L-missions of the "Cosmic vision"-program.
The probe "Juice" (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) probably begins their journey in 2022.
Eight years later it reaches Jupiter and is supposed to examine the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy moons Europe, Kallisto and Ganymed.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The cosmos offers many possibilities, matter to study under extreme conditions and to examine so, whether the natural laws, known to us, are still valid there.
Maybe also deviations which could show the way for a new theory under whose roof all known natural laws can be united to the physicists are found.
How did the universe arise and of what does it consist
Before 13.7 billion years our cosmos arose through the Urknall.
Next to the matter, us common, from the stars, planets and living beings how we withstand, there are Dark matter whose force of gravity galaxies and galaxy heaps hold together, and Dark Energy, the expansion of the cosmos at an accelerated rate through their work.
Neither up to now the researchers do not know yet which physical laws were valid in the first fractions of a second of the Urknalls from which withstand Dark Matter and Dark Energy.
With "Euclid" the Esa granted also here already a M-mission whose start is planned for 2020.
With a specific telescope the distribution of the matter is supposed to examine the probe for the first time in the universe at the entire sky and facilitate so inferences onto the state of Dark Matter and Dark Energy.
Who could do the race
From the 30 proposals only two will remain at the end of the selection method.
"E-Lisa", a pretentious draft has the best chances on an approval as a L-mission in opinion of many experts as proof of gravitational waves.
Physicists mean changes in the structure of the room time by that, the Albert Einstein almost 100 years ago had predicted.
They were not proved until today.
Elisa could create that, the scientists hope behind the project.
The mission plans a detector consisting of two or three probes which is stationed in the space.
It could prove unlike installations on the earth also gravitational waves which arose with the case of the Urknall, and supply so new findings about the origin of the cosmos.
Four more proposals still compete for the second L-mission: a big X-ray telescope by the name of "Athena" that is supposed to explore among other things black holes, "Icy Planets", a further mission to the external planets of the solar system, "Prism", a mission for the measurement of the cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder" that earth-similar planets trace and that is supposed to examine.
Already proposals for the test return transport of the Mars, for the exploration, dropped out among other things of moon, Venus and asteroids as well as for the sun physics.
