District council is pleased with sound budget
Whenever it is a question of the budget in district council meetings mayor Ralph Gerster laughed well.
The Gemeindesäckl in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and the administration does not know debts anymore already since 2005.
Also the financial year 2012 can be credited as full success in this sense.
This became clear during the idea of the annual accounts for 2012.
How Andrea Rothmund explained is the administration budget with about 7.6 million euros more than one millions of euros more highly unusual than planned.
Also the surplus of the administration house hold lies with about 1.8 million euros about one millions of euros above the approach.
The surplus is to be owed to particularly higher trade tax gains and the municipality part of the income tax.
Also the property budget lay again clearly about the planned values.
Instead of the planned 1.5 million euros it was in the last year 2.5 million euros.
"This is due basically to the higher supply from the administration budget", according to Rothmund.
Since in the financial year 2012 less investments were made than plannedly, also the reserve supply turned out more highly.
In total the general reserve could be increased by about 2.1 million euros on now in total 4.9 million euros.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and their team for the good work
"One does simply not joggle such work from the sleeve", Gerster with look onto the annual accounts praised.
It and the district councils were pleased with the good numbers visibly.
It likes to ring paradoxical, nevertheless exactly these good numbers can the citizens soon to stand expensively come.
Through the good financial condition the municipality could renounce in the past high tax factors.
Through that in turn subsidies were already often shortened, however, by the country according to Gerster.
For these subsidies from various compensation sticks there are conditions.
Among other things the cities and municipalities which apply for subsidies must show certain tax factors.
"We must have a look at the topic tax factors since in the coming years investments wait for which we would have subsidies gladly" announced Gerster in this connection
