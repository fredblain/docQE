NSA declares, an „internal error and not hacker are fault at the crash of the web site
The shadowy National Security Agency declared on the late Friday, an error crippled their public web site some hours and not hacker, as in an online way was claimed.
„NSA.gov was not tonight accessible for some hours since during a planned update an internal error occurred", explained the espionage agency in an announcement sent by E-Mail.
The problem is solved at this evening.
The claim the loss is distributed by one Denial of service attack carried out (DDoS) caused, is not true.
In the early evenings it was liked online-server tracing-core that the NSA web site was not accessible for at least six hours and is not this also furthermore for some users.
Before a speaker of the NSA had declared opposite ABC news the sensitive internal network of the authority is not compromised „in any manner".
Secret information are not in danger, according to the speaker.
At least a group of Hacktivisten used for itself, to have crippled the NSA web site with a DDoS attack.
In the case of such attacks the target web site with side calls is flooded to which servers are overloaded and the web site collapses.
The Cybertaktik is relatively simple and the attacks are not used for interrupting the internal network of the destination system.
The formerly supersecret NSA, whose nickname once No Such Agency (None such an authority) said, finds itself meanwhile in the bright light of the public and sees itself after the disclosures become known in the last months about their extensive monitoring program program exposed to sharp criticism nationally and internationally – a result of the secret NSA data that were stolen by the disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden and published.
The wachsende controversy around the secret service inspired initial speculations about that, which is incident today the result of a purposeful Cyperoperation.
