When the horse show experts became accustomed to crowd in Cardiff in order to choose the horse of the year, they were conscious that a hard competition approached.
However, no one was prepared for the three years old Fenton Kirkland.
The little fellow that is not even in the kindergarten yet and only a few months ago did his first steps, and his Shetland pony toffee trotted loosely through the three rounds and got the first price – at which 30 grown-up opponents let it behind themselves.
The inseparable pair, both of the same size, were praised because of their appearance behavior and style during the annual competition, which is on its way from the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry Cardiff is organized.
During his appearance in competition against men and women with elegant melons he had put on his plate cap in an insolent angle and led the two years old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the Juroren for his natural abilities with the case of the contact with the pony who would lie far about his age.
And Toffee received best notes for his appearance and his personality.
Fenton had gotten toffee last March as a present to his third birthday and practiced since then every day with the Shetland-pony.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: „Fenton and toffee are a splendid team."
You had to compete with the entire participant field and went with gold cup and rosette from the place.
It was first the second time that he had participated in a competition with toffee, and we were all enthusiastic when he won.
Complete foreigners in the arena held it for so phenomenal, that they wanted to be photographed with it
The small boy from the village Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows into the footprint of his aunt Sharon Howells who is demonstrating horses for more than ten years.
Told to Howells: „The whole public was how electrifies and all fired it and clapped."
He ran the entire length of the arena on sand and in spite of his looking so tiny, it achieved fantastic work
Fenton is mad on animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens which he takes care of.
So as it started, it will long not last, to it on that one „Horse of the year" show is – and I am sure, that he will come off well.
A speaker of the annual horse show said: „Fenton is first to three, but he knows how he must deal with his pony."
Together they are a fabulous team.
The Juroren measured Fenton and toffee according to how they would have beaten themselves well and presented themselves in the demonstrating-ring.
You pay attention to good cooperation between Pony and leader – and there Fenton and toffee were the best in the ring.
I am secure that Fentons sweet clothing contributed their part to that to myself, that really matched the reason perfectly.
