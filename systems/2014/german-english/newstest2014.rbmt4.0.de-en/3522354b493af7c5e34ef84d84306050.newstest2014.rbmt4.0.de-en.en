Kindergarten found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands", says Winterlingens mayor Michael Maier.
The commune sold the former kindergarten in the garden street to a private person.
The district council agreed to the sale in his recent meeting in the part not public.
The building changed his owner for an "adequate" price.
"The municipality is satisfied", stresses Maier.
In the budget 100 000 euros were applied.
Not yet clear is, as the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten.
Right is it to the mayor, that Winterlingen handed over the responsibility for the building to somebody else before the winter and thus more does not have to pay for the conversation of the house, as to give off a good heat, to look to the garden and to evacuate the walkway.
"This expenditure is now away", Maier pleases itself.
