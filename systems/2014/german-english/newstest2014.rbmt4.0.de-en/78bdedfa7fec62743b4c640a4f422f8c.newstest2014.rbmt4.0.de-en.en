Airport Vienna abolishes passenger-calls
Mr Max Maier, please you come to gate 24.
There will not be announcements as these in the future at the airport Wien-Schwechat anymore.
A majority of the loudspeaker announcements is omitted in this way - the noise level is supposed to be lowered so clear.
To create a looser atmosphere is the objective of this innovation.
As Airport-Sprecher Peter Kleemann announced opposite radio Vienna, the Vienna airport with the attitude follows an international trend from announcements that affect single persons.
So the airports renounce already among other things the noisy calls in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai.
Through the abolition of these announcements - on average about 200 personal calls sound on a day through the loudspeakers - it is supposed to go on in the future more quietly at the airport.
"It it proved also in the experience that these individual announcements relatively were perceived to little, however, also all other information on changed gates or departure times sink here a little simultaneously", according to Kleemann in the conversation with the radio station.
