The site fence painted on the Bechtle-plot
A group of the citizen initiative "Swiss Wiese" embellished the site fence on the Bechtle-plot at the spa promenade in bath gentleman nightmare
In addition cleaned and it widened the footpath, it is called in a press release.
The planned uncovering of the house falling apart in the rear part of the plot had not been allowed from safety reasons, because the ground tends to slide.
Alfred Abel, who currently administers the plot, had agreed on the embellishment action with his colleague Reinhard Domke from the BI.
A banner with the message was before the action of the BI "We are for that" attached.
That disturbed the about 20 members of the citizen initiative at their action little, however.
Your motto on the big poster was called "We are against construction ruins".
In this way it wanted to refer to the danger of even bigger ruins on the Swiss meadow - the giant project should fail one day.
In the conversation with many passers-by in front of the "construction site" it became clear that some citizens believe that many will feel better with the realization of the project of the city although few do not have the same questions onto the dimension of the presented project as the BI.
But they start giving up because the city keeps on putting off these answers it is said vonseiten the BI.
As was to be heard, also the public comments of the mayor affect.
May had said in the district council meeting that he fears the Aus for the hot spring, should the population with the case of the civil decision against the plans for one Bathed- and Wellnesskomplex on the Swiss meadow vote.
Some appear therefore almost ver√§ngstigt, others feel it than "ungainly attempted blackmail" at the population, it keeps on being said in the press release of the BI.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all helpers.
