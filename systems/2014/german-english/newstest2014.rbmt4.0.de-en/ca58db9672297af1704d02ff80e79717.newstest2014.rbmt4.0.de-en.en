Frankfurt parking fees are supposed to increase strongly
Parking in Frankfurt could become soon sensitively more expensive.
The municipal council of the city discusses this morning about a presentation of traffic departmental head Stefan Majer (Greens Party).
Accordingly the parking fees are supposed to be increased around 50 percent.
However not the prices are supposed to be begun an, but be shortened the time interval from parking meters and park appearance automats from 30 on 20 minutes.
In December the Stadtverordnetenversammlung must still decide.
The retail trade committee of the IHK Frankfurt does not hold that "for any good idea".
The park possibility immediately in front of the business is "an advantage not to be underestimated for smaller authorized dealers".
The Germany traffic club thinks that a rise is "absolutely adequate and actually for a long time overdue" after two decades.
The public local traffic becomes also more expensive.
