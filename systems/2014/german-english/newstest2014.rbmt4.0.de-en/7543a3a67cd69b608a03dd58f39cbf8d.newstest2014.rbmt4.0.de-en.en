Up to the present time the police inspection Kempten can look back upon a quiet Halloween-night.
The officials were called to children egg-flinging only twice too that flung these against house facades.
Since the houseowners recognized this in time and the ones remote like Eierreste, also no property damage might have arisen.
Furthermore also some Sylvesterb√∂ller were presumably ignited in the town area, but also here no property damage arose.
A resident in the Bischof-Freundorfer-Weg announced, that his Pkw with loo paper wrapped and were stolen his wheel facing strips.
Up to the arrival of the police the man discovered his wheel facing strips again, however, in immediate proximity all of them, for which the police did not keep on having to become active.
