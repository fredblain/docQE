Fancy for ice cream which shines in the dark?
A British entrepreneur developed the first in the dark bright ice – with the aid of jellyfishes.
Charlie Francis made the fluorescent properties of the sea animals zunutze and a radiant titbit created from that.
The idea on that came to him after he had read a study work about jellyfishes and could convince Chinese scientists to make the radiant protein artificially
The ice cream reacts with the case of the consumption with the tongue by which the pH-value is raised in the protein and the brightness activated.
Chris declares, the ice cream reacts to the heat in the mouth and that shines – more each therefore one licks the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company „Lick Me I'm Delicious", says: „The product is incredible, however still in a very early production phase, and so one gets two grams of that for 200 pounds."
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue with the case of a neutral pH-value.
If the mouth warms up the protein, the pH-value increases and the ice shines.
We tested it in the last months and it seemed ideal to us to launch it at Halloween because it has this wonderful shining-effect.
It is probably the most expensive ice cream which I ever manufactured, because the jellyfish phosphor is four times more expensive than gold is.
Every ball costs me about 140 pounds.
But for that it tastes delicious.
Charlies experimental company with seat in Bristol is famous for their unusual taste directions which beer, cheese, beef and gold foil belong to.
Nevertheless his newest creation is supposed to become even more ambitious.
He says: „I would like to develop gladly an invisible ice cream."
That is impossible at and for itself due to the refraction which is caused by the ice crystals which ice cream consists of; but I presume we find a possibility to create it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish that is made by Chinese scientist artificially
