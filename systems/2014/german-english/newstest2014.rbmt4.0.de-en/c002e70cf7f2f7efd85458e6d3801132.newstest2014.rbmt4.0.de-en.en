Parents of intersexual children can choose „Sex indefinitely"
Germany is the first European nation in which a third sex is acknowledged for children who were born with genitals not unequivocal
More is not assigned to newborns inflexibly manly or in a feminine way.
According to the new law parents do not have to explain any sex more for such children, but can indicate „indefinite" or „not defined" on the birth certificate.
It is an objective of the law to take the pressure of parents so that they do not have to make any rash decisions with respect to operations for a sex assignment with newborns, and to combat the discrimination of intersexual people.
An intersexual person said years later according to BBC: „I am not either Mann or woman."
I remain the patchwork which was created by doctors, mutilated and full scars.
Approximately one thing does not come from 2,000 children to the world every year either as a boy or as girls.
You belong to the intersexual ones, a group that falls under the diagnosis „Sexualdifferenzierungsstörung" (DSD) a comprehensive term term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (Eierstöcken or testicles) or unusually genitals developed.
Wallis Simpson was possibly intersexual.
The sense of the sex identification is not yet very well developed, nevertheless most experts recommend that in the USA, one is supposed to use the best available information to the sex assignment if a definition is not possible, and wait not for the psychological and physical development of the child, before one decides – when anyway – for an operation.
The New York psychiatrists' Dr. Jack Drescher who specialized on the problems natures of the sex identification said the new German law „rings to a good thing".
Intersexual Children represent an ethical dilemma.
„Some people have life-alarming illnesses which require a surgical intervention, however, that is not valid for most children", he said.
One can carry out a sex assignment without operation and wait for it then, as the identity develops.
The scientific data above how a child develops anyway his sexual identity are not very exactly.
Nobody knows why it happens.
It is as the secret why people are homosexual.
In a report onto the European commission from the year 2011 is called it, intersexual people are of transsexual or to distinguish Transgender persons, because their status is not sex-gotten, but necessitated by their biological constitution that neither is not feminine manly yet exclusively, but typically both simultaneously or not defined as one thing by that clearly.
These properties were proved in lower-level sexual characteristics as muscle measures, hairiness, breasts and stature, major sexual characteristics as reproductive organs and genitals or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report gives also an overview of the discrimination, that intersexual and see Transgender persons abandoned in the professional life as well as about the extent of molestation, power and prejudice criminality.
Boys agreeing not with the sex picture have a specific camp now.
Meanwhile it is possible in Australia and Nepal for adults, on official documents masculine, feminine or to declare „third sex".
In June Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as worldwide a first „sexless" person after a court had granted the lifelong retention of a sex status „not defined".
German identity cards have a third assignment, X for intersexual in the future next to M and W, according to the Ministry of the Interior Office.
In the adjacent France sex topics are still controversial, such a notification of message on France 24.
In 2011 French representatives of the severely Catholic country signed dozens a petition, that the „sex theory" is supposed to be removed from school books.
The US American web site Catholic Online spoke out also against the German law, with the reason: „If the world is dragged into a new state, where the sex represents a decision, sexual activity, however, not, then we twist two more columns of the civilization."
The mother of a newborn from Maryland declared opposite baby zone she would find it better if a sex is assigned to babies at the birth.
„The parent existence is already stressful enough also without further restrictions especially if one" does not „know" the sex of the own child, she said to the parent web site.
Children need stability and security
Children were seen historical to, that both with masculine as also feminine genitals were given birth, than described to hermaphrodites, after the attractive Greek God that had both sexes.
Still ten years ago the medicine considered the sex as something which one can wipe out and establish again then.
Nevertheless meanwhile the ethical basics of an operation are doubted after now known is, how the sexual identity is in a complex way, and that doctors can be also wrong because they do not know how the child feels while growing up with the sex assigned by them.
„In the middle of the 20th century one mentioned that a ,psychiatrischen emergency" Drescher said.
If such a child was born, one called not the psychiatrist, but the surgeon then.
The prevailing theory about the treatment of children with genitals not unequivocal goes back to Dr. John Money from the Johns Hopkins University who represented the opinion the sex is plastic.
It shaped the concept „sexual identity" and argued, social and environment-conditional impulses – as the parents bring up a child – interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and shaped so, whether a person considers herself as masculine or feminine.
However in a case become known under the title „John/Joan" from the year 1966 his theories became controversial.
He recommended the parents of a boy whose penis had been separated at a bungled curtailment completely to castrate the child and to remove also his testicles and to raise him then as a girl.
„Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation, which he, however, was" not, according to Drescher.
As the boy about 15 was, it returned to the masculine sex and a woman got married.
With 38, however, he committed suicide.
According to Drescher there are still doctors who would practise this model.
However in the 1990th years, with the entry of the Internet, survivors of these sex operations stepped onto the public that is not „happy with the result".
So about instance with Jim Bruce, a 36 years old author from Montana that was born with XY-masculine chromosomes, however, ambiguous genitals.
The doctors were not clear about that, whether he had a big clitoris or a small penis and were convinced, it can never lead a „satisfactory living" as a man.
Therefore his external organ and the testicles shortly after the birth 1976 were removed surgically and he was raised as a girl.
In the age of 12 he received feminine hormones.
„I knew that I am not a girl", it declared opposite ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really heavy to ask questions.
In the age of 18 he should receive a vaginal plastic
Nevertheless since it was depressive and knew, that something was not right, it demanded his medical files.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilized at my birth – and no one ever said that to me.
Bruce was born with a DSD through which his body could not produce enough testosterone for the development of the genitals.
After his having found out the truth, he changed again for the masculine identity, received testosterone injections and made remove his breasts.
Through the operation he became infertile.
Today he fights for others in an organization by the name of interface Project for intersexual people as normal being perceived.
However Anne Tamar-Mattis, manageress of the right group of Advocates for Informed Choice resident in californiums, worries, that the German law to the stamping and Stigmatisieren can encourage.
„Many activists are worried, that the German decision could encourage parents, to assign" fast decisions to hit and the child a ,nicht defined‘, she declared.
We fear that favors interventions.
We think it would be better the masculine or feminine sex to assign and to wait then.
However nor we do not know how the law will affect, therefore we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said their organization supports the Australian law, because „it makes the recognition for adults possible as a third sex".
„Adults should be in the situation to make own decisions on their legal sex", it declared.
With the case of the German law it is a question of the assignment at the birth.
That is not a fight which one should force small children to this time to.
If they are grown-up, they themselves can decide on their body.
However, Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast radiologist from Pittsburg who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation trouble and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group says the German law „authorizes" both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with masculine chromosomes, a DSD has, however, by the name of complete androgen resistance.
Because of the receptor defect of the target cells for Testosteron Katie developed feminine characteristics.
It has a vagina, however no uterus and no ovaries.
Today Katie 29 is and marries; she works on the University of Pennsylvania as an employee in the child psychiatry.
Indeed it is infertile, hopes, however, for being able to get a child through adoption or a lending-mother.
„The law gives parents to room through which she does not rush decisions must hit", Baratz said.
It provides them with the time, to do different tests and to clear things and time gives so to them before they „manly" or „in a feminine way" write.
In this way everything is all right – one raises the child and loves it.
One has a wonderful baby and enjoys the parent luck.
And one does not have to carry out rashly an operation which cannot be canceled anymore.
„That closes the children into the decision with one and removes the fear that drives parents because they think they would not „do" the correct thing" explained it.
Finally the child decides on the sex that co-ordinates to it better – and that is wonderful.
Through that children are moved into the situation to make the decision itself.
