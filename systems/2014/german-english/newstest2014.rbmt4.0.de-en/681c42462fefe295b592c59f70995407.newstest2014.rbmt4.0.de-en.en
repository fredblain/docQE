Rangnick-Schelte for ski resistance: Mane no swallow king
So satisfied Ralf Rangnick with the current top form of Federal League Tabellenführer Red Bull Salzburg also is, so disappointed the sport director of the "bulls" of the referees showed himself.
"There is currently a dangerous tendency that Mane and Alan into the category are pushed swallow kings", he defended the two Offensivwirbler on Thursday on a press conference in Salzburg.
Recent reason for Rangnicks criticism was yellow for Mane at the 3:0 against Grödig on the last Sunday at which an alleged acting for the doom became to the Senegalese - that certainly was not a how the TV pictures showed.
"A blatant incorrect decision", meant Rangnick, the referee Harkam as "completely overtaxed" described.
Harkam would have contributed furthermore "his part" to the escalation between Salzburg-coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig-coach Adi Hütter to the lot.
He defended his German compatriot dezidiert: "There I would have behaved in every single situation now as Roger Schmidt".
Schmidt himself does not want to have had after the Scharmützel with Hütter any contact with his colleague.
I would not know, why.
"Because I am that one that was offended", stressed the 46-year long one.
Faced with the success race Rangnick sang, however, a praise hymn.
"For that there are only two words: Correctly well", he stated.
Misfiring a lot does not give.
Particularly the kind and way in which the team plays is impressive.
That is supposed to go on quietly so.
There will hardly be cadre changes in the winter transfer time.
There are not any splendid reasons to change something.
"Except for a player confronts with the wish, that he wants to leave the association", Rangnick explained.
