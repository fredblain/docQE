Drama in Uruguay: Boys kill Spielkamderaden with machete
Two children admitted the murder of an 11-year long one in Uruguay.
The two 14 and 12 years old boys had invited their victim to to go onto bird hunt with them.
Armed with machetes and knives they stabbed the 11-year long one to death on Tuesday and flung the corpse into a well "El Pa√≠s" told the newspaper on Thursday.
Afterwards they would have played soccer before their apartments in a worker quarter.
The corpse was discovered in the following night in the small town Cerro Pelado 15 kilometers north of the excluding beach place Punta del Este.
As an alibi a five year old half-sister of the junior who they had taken along should state it was attacked by the boy sexually.
When the girl, however, described the action course of events without mention of an attack against them before the police, the two boys admitted the deliberate killing of the 11-year long one.
The older man mentioned a rivalry as a reason among other things in the football match.
It was delivered temporarily into a psychiatric youth institution.
