Is it ready to Europe's elite to do businesses with Great Britain?
Business for Britain was started in April with the intention to bring the economy onto a table and to define, which those ones that provide prosperity and work in Great Britain would like to change at our relationships to the EU.
Too we commissioned the greatest and most comprehensive inquiry to this purpose among British economic leaders and they asked what they think about Great Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov consulted more than 1,000 managers from the economy, that into about instance the British enterprise sizes, -sectors and show regions
The results of the inquiry will surprise many.
We found out that meanwhile the predominant majority of the enterprises exports outside of Europe and concentrates on countries that modernize and increase while the states are stagnating in the EU.
You want that from government page new commercial connections with countries as China, India and Brazil are favored instead of stopping oneself with the long and hard process to reform the obscure EU institutions.
The majority of the economic leaders of the opinion the control of these key competences should be fetched back according to Westminster is asked for their opinion on certain by law controlled topics – of the restrictive trade practices act up to the product legislation.
There was it general dissatisfaction with the home market since meanwhile according to the enterprises the costs of the Brussels rules would outweigh the advantages to be part of Europe's commercial zone – even 40 percent of the large-scale enterprises that are traditional at the Europe-friendliest agreed to that.
Finally, and that says presumably the most, our questioning of economic leaders made, that a clear majority change of the agreement is wished from Great Britain a course in the direction and a relationship to the EU that is based on trade not on politics
This discovery which finds itself with the case of enterprises of all sizes and leading company groups shows that the economy is urgent onto a „reasonable change" which brings the notebook of the action again to Great Britain.
It is a question of a lot – a change of the agreement and better conditions for Great Britain would lead at 16 percent to an opinion change for the benefit of the whereabouts in the EU in a plebiscite.
The prime minister should not have any doubts: This inquiry shows that the British economy stands behind his plan for the new negotiations of the British conditions for the EU membership
It also shows that the enterprises expect a clear shift of the power relations of some new negotiations back to Great Britain.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and necessary in increasing measure, after the euro zone moves now in the direction a narrower economic and fiscal agent union.
Jobs and growth must be the priority in Great Britain, as the result of our inquiry it shows which enterprises an increasing attention to trade and a basic change in the Brussels approach for rules means.
