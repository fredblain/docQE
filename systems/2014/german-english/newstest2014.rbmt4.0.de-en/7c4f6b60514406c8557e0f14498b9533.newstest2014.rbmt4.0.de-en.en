Australian appeals against prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year old woman from Sydney who was condemned in Phuket to 15 days of prison because she had said by mistake to have been raped by a taxi driver appealed against the judgment and was released on bail
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was been first of all from a province court in Phuket on the 15th June for guilty to have done a false statement after it had indicated opposite the Thai police a local taxi driver oppressed it in the morning hours on Sunday, the 10th June, while two other men were holding it
Later, however, the photos of a video camera showed that it had surely reached their hotel after her having been separated by their Australian friend.
The police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until she confessed to have thought out the history
Up to the hearing it was on site in police custody
Bamford was condemned to a 15-day long prison sentence in a custody institution with low security level on the fringe of Phukets, instead of in a prison for grown-up women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Rubgy-league who turned to the foreign ministry of State in Canberra with the request around help for his daughter.
Tunks declared opposite the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney, the whole family is „extremely worried" about the well-being of his daughter and it wanted to have it back in Australia.
„We make ourselves of course great worries, but we hope for her being as soon as possibly again at home", said Tunks.
Bamford appealed against the judgment and is on free foot against a bail of 50,000 bahts.
In Australian reports it was to be read that it does vacation in the meantime in the holiday resort Krabi in south Thailand.
Vonseiten of the court was to be heard, Bamford is represented through a local attorney in Phuket and he was warned against the appointment being able to lead also to the imposition of a higher punishment from up to two years in a prison for adults.
However, it is also possible that after the recent assassination of the travel business woman Michelle Smith in Phuket it could be bothered to Thailand to correct his changed touristisches image, and comes it therefore for an acquittal.
