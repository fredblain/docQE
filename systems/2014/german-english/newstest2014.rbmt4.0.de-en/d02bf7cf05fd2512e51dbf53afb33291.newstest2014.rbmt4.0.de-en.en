A black box in the car?
US American street planners are in search of a money source in order to repair the deteriorating highway-system, and believe to have found the solution in a small black box that finds place in the instrumentation panel of every car.
The devices which record every driven kilometer and which information onto the authorities announce are central point of a controversial attempt of Washington and the planning offices of the Federal states to rework the obsolete system for the financing of US American streets.
The usually rather boring field of the road planning provoked suddenly an intense debate with colored alliances.
Libertäre allied with environmental groups and speak out for that, that the government use the small boxes for the write-out of the driven kilometers – and possibly also, where they were driven – and be able to use the information then for the calculation of notices of assessment assessment notices bills demands levies.
The Tea Party is horrified.
The American civil rights union (ACLU) is also most deeply worried and expresses a series of data protection objections.
However, while one is not can agree on a procedure in the congress, several Federal states do not wait longer.
You check currently how they can change in the course of the next ten years for a system with the driver per driven mile pay.
Thousands of motorists already tested the tachographs from which some are endowed with GPS-supervision.
That is really a must for our country.
„It is not anything, that we will use only possibly", Hasan Ikhrata, manager of the Southern California Assn, said. of Governments who plans a recording of the driven miles with all Californian motorists in the Federal state from 2025.
The kind and manner as we pay these taxes will change.
The technology for that is there.
The initiative comes to a time since the highway trust is broke to Fund which is financed from the taxes which US Americans give at the petrol pump.
However, in America as much is not refueled more as formerly.
Cars consume less gasoline.
The state mineral oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 euro cents per liter) has not been increasing for 20 years.
Politicians do not dare with the case of high spirit prices also to lift the steering wheels only around a cent.
„The gasoline tax is simply not future-capable", according to Lee Munnich, an expert for traffic legislation at the university of Minnesota.
His Federal state furnished 500 cars with tachographs with which a mile-based paying-system is supposed to be tested recent.
„That represents the on a long-term basis most reasonable alternative" he said.
Bureaucrats refer to it as a mile-based user fee
It does not surprise that urban liberals approve the idea, because the tax could be used for example dazu to influence the driving behavior so that jams and climate-harmful waste gases are reduced.
The Californian planners put on the system during the preparation from strategies with which the ambitious, by law anchored objectives of the Federal state for the climate change are supposed to be reached.
Nevertheless the republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania, chairperson of the House Transportation Committee, also declared that he sees the most feasible long-term alternative in that.
Also the free ones Vermarkter of the Reason Foundation are caused from the idea to make drivers to covered stretch be paid.
„That is not a tax which disappears in a black hole", declares Moore, vice-president, Adrian for guidelines at Reason.
Paying the people directly for what they get.
The movement is supported also by two former American Ministers of Transport that had asked in a report in the year 2011 the congress to move in direction of mile-based billing.
The US senate approved last year a pilot project 90 million dollars expensive which would have contained 10,000 cars.
Nevertheless the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the advance and reacted in this way to the objections of representatives from rural fields which people represent who must often cover many miles in the everyday life on the way to the work or into the city.
Several Federal states and cities move nonetheless on own initiative in this direction.
Oregon, which recruits currently 5,000 drivers for the greatest experiment of the country, is at the most engaged.
These drivers will pay soon the mile fees to the Federal state instead of the mineral oil tax.
Nevada finished already a pilot project.
New York City considers also one like that.
Illinois tests it in restricted measure with trucks.
And the I-95-Koalition which the traffic ministries belong to from 17 Federal states at the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) examines currently as one could introduce the change.
The draft is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where recently 50 volunteers were equipped with the devices, motorists were sceptical with the case of the thought the government could pursue each of their movements.
„Objections against Big Brother and such things were a great problem", declares Alauddin Khan, conductor of the strategy and result management, in the traffic ministry of Nevada.
The people did not want it.
When the test started, the ACLU of Nevada warned on their web site: It would be relatively simple to change the tachographs into full-grown invigilators."
No necessity to establish a gigantic, unwieldy technological infrastructure which would be used unavoidably to entering data about the daily movements of individuals exists.
Nevada does not belong to a row exactly from Federal states that stay now according to affordable technology look-out with which the state can capture the driven kilometers, however, when and where.
In this way, so khan, also the public would be more calmed.
The hunt according to this technology led some authorities to a small startup-enterprise by the name of True Mileage in californiums.
The company did not line up initially in order to help Federal states from motorists during the taxation.
Rather it was their aim of gripping in a rising market for Kfz insurances feet in the case of which drivers are supposed to pay on basis of the driven miles.
Nevertheless the devices tested by her are interesting also for the street planners because they do not work with GPS and only restricted information that are loaded regularly by modem deliver.
„The people are rather ready to participate in that if their speed and locations are not recorded", declared Ryan Morrison, manager of True Mileage.
In some of these public pilot programs great errors were made.
There are considerably cheaper and less intrusive possibilities to transplant this.
In Oregon the planners experiment with giving motorists a series of choices.
You keep yourself up for a device or without GPS decide.
Or they do not choose at all any device and pay one instead of this flat rate on basis of the miles on the average driven by all inhabitants of the Federal state.
Other places hope for being able to sell the draft to a mistrustful public when they endow the devices with more functions when with wenigeren.
In New York City traffic officials want to develop a device into the taxation with which make pay also parking fees, an insurance must be paid only for driven kilometers and speed data are raised by other vehicles in real time thanks to which motorists can evade jams.
„Motorists would be motivated to the participation by the added value of the advantages which the system offers", it is said in a planning document of the city.
Some traffic planners wonder however, whether the whole gossip is not only a gigantic diversion about the paying per mile.
With the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the field of the San Francisco Bay officials declared, the congress can solve the problem of the bankrupt highway trust find simple through rise of the fuel tax.
An additional unique fee or an annual delivery could be imposed on motorists with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles which consume little gasoline so that also these pay a fair part.
„There is not any reason for an operation if an aspirin also suffices", explains Randy Rentschler, the conductor for legislation and public matters of the commission.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists do themselves worry about their privacy and numerous other things.
