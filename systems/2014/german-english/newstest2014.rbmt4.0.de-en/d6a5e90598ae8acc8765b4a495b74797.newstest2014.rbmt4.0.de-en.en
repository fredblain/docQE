Security objections in Mozambique increase faced with collisions between influential personalities
Thousands of people met in the center of Maputo among the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the state founder and first presidents of Mozambique in order to start at a rare public demonstration peace calls.
„We want again peace, we want stability", Vanessa de Sousa, manageress of an investment enterprise, said.
For fear around the future of the country she exchanged their business clothing against a T-shirt with the label „We demand security in Portuguese and connected on Thursday of the amount on the independence place of the capital.
For two weeks there are almost daily reports about collisions between government strengths and Renamo which number among the worst combats since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was at one time a notorious rebel movement, that initially of the Rhodesia ruled over from white and later the Apartheitsregierung Südafrikas was supplementary in the bothering, to destabilize the independent government of the country.
According to the peace treaty of 1992 she became an opposition party.
Analysts hold it for improbable that the country lapses again into a full-grown conflict, nevertheless the recent events worried foreign investors and locals.
For the rapidly growing economy a lot stands on the game, because the discovery of gigantic gas occurrences in front of the coast and coal stockyard in the north-west could bring into the country in the next years of investments of more than 50 billion United States dollars of companies as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the USA.
The ruling Frelimo party, since 1975 the dominating strength, and Renamo blame mutually for the tensions.
Renamo says the government provoked the recent collisions when it would have attacked their members on 17th October in the province Sofala, a traditional stronghold Renamos.
To kill the infringements of the former rebels escalated Afonso Dhlakama, attacked as government troops Renamo footholds and attempted, the chief of the group, declared Renamos speakers opposite the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the collisions and the organization accuses, to have attacked soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza attempted to ran through objections about an instability.
Opposite AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama considers himself as „a loser that wants to use „all his still residual strengths in order to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government".
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they would like to avoid a war.
Nevertheless the objections increased since Mazanga with the words was quoted, Renamo gives the peace agreement from 1992.
Opposite the FT it declared it thought in this way that Frelimo does not respect the agreement anymore.
„Our vision is it, to resume negotiations and serious indeed", Mazanga said.
Former conversations between the parties contributed only little to the settlement of the tensions that was inspired by a series of collisions this year.
„We have here two grown-up men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) that the heads collide", thinks Joseph Hanlon, university lecturer, at the Open University and Mozambique-expert.
No one of them is good in the negotiating and it is not ready to any to do the necessary concessions.
Renamo who insists on choice reforms declared already she will boycott the local choices in November.
Premiership and parliament choices are planned for next year.
Some commentators interpreted the use of power as the attempt of a kränkelnden movement to obtain concessions and financial sales allowances of the government.
Renamos choice successes shrink since 1992 while a newer party, the Movimento Democrático de Moçambique founded by a former Renamo-member (MDM), will presumably be improving at the choices
Mazanga says that Guebuza – whose resignation waits if his second term of office ends in the next year – wants to destroy the democracy of the country.
„He" wants no increase party democracy, „he does not want any transparent choices he does not want any peace because he does not „want" to give up the presidency" so Mazanga.
It is unclear which capacities Renamo has, however, she has on attacks bringing about noise on police stations and vehicles one important north south connections done.
Most combats occurred in the province Sofala, the some a Hundred Kilometers north of Maputo lies, in which there is Beira, however, the harbor use the mining industry skilled one as Rio Tinto and Vale for the export of coal.
In June Rio suspended for a month the use of the railroad after Renamo had announced an attack on the stretch
Mazanga answered cautiously the question whether Renamo will repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted „the international community warn against the things" not „standing in Mozambique well Mazanga said.
The instability still increased the frustration over the government, says Fernando Lima, conductor of Mediacoop, to an independent media enterprise, because many people worried already because of the corruption, the slow progress at the development and a recent kidnapping wave.
„The people think" that the government and the president for the future of the country are responsible and he should be that one who finds solutions for the problems", it declares.
Omar sultans, a demonstrator, said the people simply wanted only stability.
„Renamo and Frelimo do not interest any, they simply want peace and usable streets only again", he declared.
