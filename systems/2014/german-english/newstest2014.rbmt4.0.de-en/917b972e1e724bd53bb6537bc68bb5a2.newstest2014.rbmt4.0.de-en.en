George Kerevan: The choice gives the Scots European deconcentration
A new day, a new terror history for the independence.
This time we are warned against an independent Scotland being necessary in order to join the Schengen-room as a condition for the EU membership
That supplies the keyword for histories about passport checks into Berwick and a border safeguarded with barbed wire along the Hadrianswalls.
In fact the possible economical advantages which more travel freedom would bring in the remaining Europe with themselves were referred in the Strathclyde-presentation nevertheless this did not play any role – as expected – in the headlines.
Also nobody mentioned that the EU member states bend their strict rules to themselves frequently if it is more favorable to them.
Since Scotland does currently not belong to the Schengen-room the consecutive nonobservance would be only a small concession for Brussels in the corresponding train for what one really wants from the bulkheads.
Therefore actually no story.
And one, the already so in the years has come, that it resembles already a fossil: The first time I meant the „independence passport check" duck at least 40 years ago belongs.
In this case an interesting point disappears during the constant repetition of this ancient history
Why should one expect of an independent Scotland that it dances to the European whistle
Why exchange the London yoke for that of Brussels, especially now?
Those ones are the real European news: The plan great, understood after the war to the union of Europe came to a standstill.
With the euro crisis the project Europe died officially.
Everywhere in the EU parties at ground win which are EU enemy or would like to fling the euro overboard as community currency.
Even in Germany the euro-sceptical party alternative could get just five million voices for Germany – set up only this year – during the Bundestag Federal Parliament choice in September for themselves and drive out in this way the Free democrats (the equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats) effectively of the Bundestag Federal Parliament.
There was always domestic resistance to the plan to create a federalistic Europe.
The current depression turns out, however, as a turning point point.
Because of the severe saving-politics imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the straitjacket into which the respective national economy is forced by the adherence at the common currency many people think, the project Europe went too far.
Little has to do the crisis of the euro with national governments causing excessive budget deficits – that was the case only in Greece.
Instead of this the euro system tied down his members to exchange rates that are useful for German exporters – and German politicians would like to let that so gladly.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the local currency Southern Europe with a built-in productivity disadvantage opposite Germany recovers itself.
The only possibility consists in abbreviating wages and public editions – encouraged by Berlin.
Behind the current budget and currency problems a deep lies going European productivity problem.
As a consequence of the „green" energy guidelines prescribed by Brussels – a code for the subsidization of French and German energy enterprises at the expense of the consumers – the European industry pays compared with the United States the Double for electricity and the fourfold thing for gas.
That is a paralyzing cost disadvantage how we could already look into Grangemouth.
All wage celebration spellings of the world do not protect the European petrochemical industry against that, of cheap American slate gas to be pushed into the corner.
When consequence works up a revolt, especially in France, the former Cheerleader of the EU.
After the war the political elite of France saw the EU as a vehicle with which one could hold Germany in chess and lift that to Paris onto eye level with Washington.
Nevertheless Berlin does not need Paris more than gate for the political legitimization and Europe pressed his own economic policy which the changed French economy has to fight with.
The result: Marine Le Pens rightly directed, EU enemy front National won just a decisive by-election and referred in this way the ruling socialists to place three.
The most popular party is to the front National now in France with 24 percent of the votes – a first-in first-out warning for the British Labour party, that it cannot come from that, a split in the right spectrum would mean advantages automatic for the left winger.
What makes Le Pen with theirs for popularity wonly again among the white French of the working class?
It would like to use the EU choices for that next year, one Anti-EU-, to forge anti-community currency block in the European Parliament.
If the Anti-EU-Parteien come off at these choices well – and that is very well possible –, such a block could dominate the European Parliament for the first time then.
This is the point onto which I want out: In future not far too far the wachsende resentment against the EU and the common currency will find itself for the abolition of the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but she will rather become something as the „Europe of the (sovereign) nations" which favored general de Gaulle.
Maybe Germany and a few of his satellite-economies hold on to the euro, but France and Southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect that Great Britain distanziert of this project in the hope to ingratiate oneself with the USA.
However, Washington's increasing interest in the Pacific room advises that Great Britain will only stand in the Atlantic rain.
Where does that have Scotland at all of them?
We can decide, a region of to be (in last consequence) small England.
Or we can defend our own economical interests – to which also it belongs to say Berlin and Brussels what they where can put.
I presume Scotland could go in a looser European compound very well provided that we keep our own currency.
The cooperation with countries other, thinking similarly is simpler in a Europe of the nations not föderierten.
Otherwise we should consider, to match it to Norway and our economical independence kept.
The SNP-government in Scotland is – bemerkenswerterweise – the most successful political movement against the saving-politics in Europe and gained in 2011 a spectacular majority due to the refusal of the shortenings suggested (and carried out) which the Labour Minister of Finance Alistair Darling and the following Tory-Lib Dem-Koalition had to account for.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to decide for an independence now only in order to get a saving-politics forcedly then from Berlin and Brussels.
