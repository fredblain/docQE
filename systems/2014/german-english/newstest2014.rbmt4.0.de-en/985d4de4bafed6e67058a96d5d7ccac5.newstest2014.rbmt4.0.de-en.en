The again designed Opschlag shines with a new Cafe.
One that invites to the staying and returning.
One which would like to turn the name into the program.
One refers as Déjà Vu according to lexicon to a psychological phenomenon that the feeling is shown in by having experienced a new situation already once or seen.
In the case of the visit of the café of the same name at the Opschlag in the district town Kleve within sight to the college Rhein-Waal it does not have to remain with the pure Déjà Vu-Gefühl.
Finally the café with the beautiful name has exactly that to the objective to make an actual stay not only intellectual but solidly always recurringly erlebbar.
Because it does now fun and simply beautiful is.
A look into the inner life at the Opschlag 8 gives the observer immediately a good feeling.
The café-ambience state-of-the-art, but not cool looks like a place for the feeling well.
Here the team with the founders Mirjam van of the Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top spoils the guest with most different coffee or cocktail variants.
For this purpose there are delicious cake or individually busy fresh French loaves.
The holders both 33 years old, made already before the opening of the neat café at the Opschlag as gastronomes a name: In Kranenburg they led the "Art Lounge".
The agreeable café-lovers expect more public from the move after Kleve onto the Opschlag.
Last but not least also through the college
"At what we do not have any certain target group" stress Daniel Büttner.
Rather here young students would like to speak to the two just the same as seniors and all age groups between that.
Apropos café-lover.
The agreeable holder pair stands behind the coffee-pleasure
Enjoy the smelling hot brew in the most different variations themselves.
Expressofan
The Expresso fan and Mirjam van of the Stelt is Daniel Büttner rather the cappuccino alcoholic.
"For this purpose a French loaf - that is my thing, the NRZ betrays it".
There were already two events in the bright café.
Better said one.
Because the harbor celebration occurred really rather outside - the café Déjà Vu did not profit by that.
But there was also the Ringelnatzabend.
The two 33-year long ones found, "beautiful, successful and witty".
But now not Everyone's thing.
Maybe Daniel Büttner is not also therefore an expressed fan of event-evenings: "One can do it really now not all right".
And with an event I always speak only to the ones who are interested also in the specific event.
Therefore events will rather be the exception with us.
"We would like to interrupt the very normal company so little as possibly".
Is supposed to mean Déjà Vu stands also for reliability.
With respect to the quality of the products that are offered here, in the same way, as onto the team and the beautiful surroundings at the Opschlag in Kleve.
To the street which develops more and more to itself into a gastronomy mile.
For the joy of a lot of Klever, the guests' from near and far and the students', that the guest Rome hurry and so that also the café Déjà Vu discover for themselves.
