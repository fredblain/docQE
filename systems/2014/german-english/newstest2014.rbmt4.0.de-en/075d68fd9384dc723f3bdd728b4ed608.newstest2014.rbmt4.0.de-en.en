Secret service discloser Edward Snowden is fundamentally ready for a conversation with German authorities.
First he wants to know, however, his situation clearedly.
The former NSA-employee searched by the USA explained that in a not addressed writing which the greens-politician Hans-Christian Ströbele published on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and passed on to Federal Government, Bundestag and general Federal Government attorney.
The writing has following wording according to a translation spread by Ströbele:
Onto the responsible ones
I was asked for writing to you concerning your investigation for the mass supervision.
I am called Edward Joseph Snowden and was formerly contractual and/or busy about a direct employment as technical expert with the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (SLIDE) of the United States.
In the course of my employment in these facilities I became witness of systematic law violations of my government that led me from moral duty to the action.
I saw myself as a result of the publication of these objections I exposed to a fatal and continuous agitation that forced me to leave my family and my home.
I live currently in the exile and enjoy limited asylum which gives me the Russian Federation according to international right.
I am encouraged from the resonance onto my political action, both in the USA and elsewhere.
Citizens on the whole world and also high office-bearers - including the United States - judged as a service the disclosures for a system of the universal supervision which is not account guilty to anybody at the public.
These espionage-disclosures involved many proposals to new laws and guidelines which were aimed at the formerly concealed abuse of the public confidence.
The benefit for the society from these gained findings becomes increasingly clearer; simultaneously the accepted risks were reduced visibly.
Although the result of my efforts was nachweislich positive, my government dissent still handles as a faith break and strives for that, political opinion comment to kriminalisieren and to charge.
Nevertheless: To express the truth is not a crime.
I am confident, that the government of the United States with support of the international community will put aside this detrimental attitude.
I hope for my being in the situation if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are settled me appropriate at the responsible clarification of the facts of affairs concerning the statements made in the media, in particular with regard to truth and authenticity of the reports, and law-appropriate involve.
I am pleased onto a conversation with you in your country, as soon as the situation is clarified and it thanks you for their efforts to protect the international right that protects us all.
Testified to Edward Snowden through Hans-Christian Ströbele
