Germany's biggest national church has an Offensivegestartet in order to advertise the profession of the pastor.
Background is a possible priest lack: The evangelic Hanover national church reckons that the number of their currently about 1,800 woman ministers and pastors according to present situation to 2030 will halve itself.
For young people of today the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects, said pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in the conversation with the Evangelic News Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the work and day course itself.
With Burfien the national church charged for the first time a pastor to inspire young people for the theology study on a full place.
At the time of decide always less young people after the school-leaving examination, to study theology.
Burfien puts this down to the process of the Entkirchlichung: "Gottes Stimme is quiet the world is loud".
In this case the profession is shaped from great freedom and variety.
I am a gentleman of my diary and can put my emphases, where it is important to me, there.
Pastors could be very near as ministers with the people.
You deserved so much as teachers and could live well on that.
Certainly more is paid in the free economy, but for that theologians would have a secure employer.
That complies with the young people for whom it is a question not only of career, but of a sense-fulfilled work from today.
According to information of the national church which contains three quarters of Lower Saxony about currently per annum 60 pastors retire.
Simultaneously about 40 graduates of a theology study begin their curacy.
In sparsely populated fringe ranges as the resin, the Emsland or the turning-country it can become in the future heavy to fill places.
Burfien wants to organize among other things study days for young people and invite also prominent persons to that, have studied the theology.
The theology study offers a wide training.
One can become in this way even Federal President.
