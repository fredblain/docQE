Ben Greenman: Ten years New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
One could say that New York City is the birth place of Stand-up Comedy in America: Just a hundred years ago the Varietekünstler Frank Fay who worked as a compere in the Palace Theatre at the Broadway began with telling jokes to the amount directly in the form of a conversation.
Over the years Fays was extended innovation, so as at last on the New York Comedy Festival.
Started up and led by Caroline Hirsch, the Gründerin of the state-up-institution of Carolines, the festival celebrates this year his decennial anniversary with more than sixty shows in small clubs and big theaters.
Most of these head liners caught at Carolines at and became then increasingly more successful until they were sometime too known in order to perform in a club", Hirsch said.
We designed this festival so that we keep on being able to work with them.
During the this year's event there are appearances of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher as well as also of „State Up for Heroes", an annual music and Comedy benefit performance for army veterans in the Madison Square guards, at which Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby perform among other things.
With the festival also the world increased to the Comedy.
A row the comedian's, that participate in the festival this year, became known over rather unconventional ways, as for example broadcastings on smaller TV channels as Comedy Central, FX and spike.
Nod Kroll became known with a Sitcom in the cable television (the ironic-lewd Fantasy American football series „The League" on FXX) and has now his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was both with „Saturday Night Live" than also at „Parks and Recreation" Part of the occupation, although it is best known to their viral video series „Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Both Kroll as also Slate and others young comedian's with characteristic voices (that surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the W. Kaumau Bell ironic, concentrated on race topics) products of the decentralized world are to the American Comedy.
An interview belongs to the biggest visitor magnets of the festival: David Steinberg speaks with Larry David.
Steinberg began as Stand-up comedian, developed, however, into a TV and filming director looked at as well as too an unofficial Comedy-historian.
From 2005 to 2007 he moderated a telecast with the title „Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" at TV Land.
The meeting occurs in the Town Hall right in Manhattan.
„The city is definitive in the Comedy-DNA of Larrys of entire work said Steinberg.
It told me if it is here, then it goes sometimes through the lane between two buildings and he thinks himself: Hey if I lose my whole money maybe I live then here.
