There keeps on being good atmosphere, even if the SG is Achim/Baden for four game days without victory, with the Handball-Oberligisten.
At that coach Tomasz Malmon does not let at all any doubts.
They are all fully kept on being motivated with the case of the thing.
Nevertheless I hope for our winning also once again at last
"Because I white yes no more already at all as such a victory tastes" Malmon expects a success experience of his team at the VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even if the third league reserve has currently not pulled out yet any trees of Fredenbeck, Malmon previously lifts the forefinger warningly.
I myself trained many players still in the A-youth.
Of therefore they motivate against their ex-coach surely completely especially.
"Furthermore it is to wait necessary, whether strengthening from the First in this case is still", the SG coach clarifies.
In order to return to the success track at last again, the Malmon-team must increase itself in any case in comparison with the last appearances.
Nevertheless before all things in the cover work and during the switching game it last haperte tremendously.
Also the chance utilization must become definitively better.
Therefore I hope for my players getting the head freely during the short pause at last
