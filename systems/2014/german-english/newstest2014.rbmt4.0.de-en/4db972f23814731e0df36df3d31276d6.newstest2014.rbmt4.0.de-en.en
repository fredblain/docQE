Traffic lights on continuous reds: Paying attention to waiting time
Sometimes some traffic lights do simply not become green.
The contact bow in the street does not react, or the light sign is defective.
What one is supposed to do then - with the case of reds go
A concerned person waited long enough at some red traffic lights and the crossing is free, it can weiterfahren, the Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker declares in the magazine "motorcycle".
The waiting time must be, however, "adequate", which can be laid out from case to case differently.
Becker recommends to wait at least five minutes from a malfunction of the traffic lights go out is.
Who continues the journey in spite of red light must be, however, im Klaren over his bearing the full fault for an accident caused through that.
Who is patient less than five minutes does long enough not wait possibly, warns Becker and refers Hamm to a decision of the upland court
In the discussed case a driver had ignored the traffic lights after about three minutes of continuous red and had to justify himself for a negligent red light violation.
The traffic lights were not indeed defective, but they jumped little later onto green around.
A going-prohibition kept on being spared him because of the special situation - the fine, however, not.
