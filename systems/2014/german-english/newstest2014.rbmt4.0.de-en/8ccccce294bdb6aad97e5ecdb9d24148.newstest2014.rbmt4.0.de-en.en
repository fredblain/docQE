Hearing in front of the Royal Commission: Two YMCA employees in front of accusations accused of Sexualdelikten against Jonathan Lord
Two YMCA-employees from New South Wales (NSW) were accused of Sexualdelikten in connection with children before 2011 reproaches were raised against the child nurse Jonathan Lord from Caringbah as the Royal commission heard from children for sexual abuse
However with the case of the opening declaration in front of the commission the YMCA had declared one had never had to put in the organization from sexual child abuse with an incident.
Manager Phillip Hare was questioned about a case in which a YMCA employee had been accused of offenses with child pornography and another, at which a sport teacher of the YMCA Caringbah Hall 1991 because of the abuse had been condemned it children's entrusted with.
Hare said to Gail Furness, an attorney assisting the commission, that he knew about the first case, did not know the second, however.
He added the opening declaration of the YMCA opposite the commission was also inaccurate in the claim „there were external inspections of the YMCA, in which the YMCA than at most front front with the case of the child security was acknowledged
Proofs in front of the commission rather show that the YMCA was informed about that.
Hare that began with 21 at the YMCA granted, the management failed „from me" of Lord „downwards" during the attitude and not guaranteed that employees realized their obligations to be reported violations of the guidelines for the child security
Lord had been condemned at the beginning of the year because of Sexualvergehen at twelve boys during his two-year activity for the YMCA.
He was condemned to at least six years of prison.
Hare denied, however, that the YMCA would have a cultural problem which kept employees from that to announce lords violations with respect to the security of children.
The employees stated they would have observed violations among other things, that Lord was alone with children, was in charge of it privately as sitters, made her be on his lap it told with regard to one that he has it dearly, and made play children with his mobile.
Danielle Ockwell testified, that superior Lord was and that had asked for a training to the child protection because it was gotten because of his behavior, that the child service head Jacqui Barnat that in the YMCA Caringbah the superior was to lords „very intimidating and most time was very unapproachable".
The manager declared their superiors it would not accept statements of employees according to which these would not have dared announcement refund.
Instead of this, so he said, their friendship with lord rather influenced their discernment, for which they would not have announced it
Hare declared it informed the executive board of the YMCA NSW of his opinion that the lesson that has to draw the organization from the „Jonathan lord incident not the reporting" through employees affects, and the executive board agreed to it
Hare said the decision to push the employees from secrecy obligations for the signature shortly after appearance of the accusations was made by the manager of the child services of the YMCA, Liam Whitley.
He said a Kontaminierung of the proofs should be prevented in this way, which, however, „übereifrig" and badly was transplanted.
The YMCA NSW was not an organization secure for children in the time, when Jonathan lord was there busy in between 2009 and 2011, declared professor Stephen Smallbone of the Griffith University, expert for sexual child abuse the commission.
It explained that there were „serious problems" during the attitude inspection, training, training and supervision of the employees.
The hearing was adjourned until 20th December.
