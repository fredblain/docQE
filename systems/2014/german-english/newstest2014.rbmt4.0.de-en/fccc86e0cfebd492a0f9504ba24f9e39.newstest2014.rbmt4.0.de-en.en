In Pfullendorf the stream becomes more expensive
The citizens Pfullendorfs must prepare themselves for higher stream costs.
As the manager of the city works Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed opposite the SOUTH COURIER, 70 to 90 euros of additional costs per annum come up to a four-headed Pfullendorfer family.
The rise of the so-called EEG-apportionment of 5.277 is essential reason of the pending increase in prices on 6.3 cents per kilowatt-hour.
This apportionment is set every year in October of the four operators again that of the big stream routes.
These number the additional costs arising for them from the energy turn which can raise it through an apportionment about the electricity tariff.
The city works Pfullendorf form the last link in this chain.
The supervisory board of the energy enterprise had taken even a higher apportionment as a basis in his predictions as Jörg-Arne Bias tells.
Now the concrete ones would have to pay be calculated before the city works could inform their customers of the exact increase in prices next week.
"We go from an increase from 1 cent plus x", so Bias which the number will rather be near near the 2 cents.
