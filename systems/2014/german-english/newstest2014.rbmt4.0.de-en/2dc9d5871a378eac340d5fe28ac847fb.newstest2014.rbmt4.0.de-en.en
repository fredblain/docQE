Bird saved by air rescue service from North Sea drilling rig again released
A bird flown by air rescue service onto the coast that had been found exhaustedly on a North Sea drilling rig was retired again in the nature.
The Wasserralle was flown last month to Aberdeen, where she was fed up by the Scotch animal protection organization SPCA in their rescue centers in Alloa, with a helicopter.
Colin Seddon, conductor of the center, said: „This Wasserralle was probably a winter migrant from Nordeuropa which was stopped through the strong winds above the North Sea."
Apparently the exhausted bird searched refuge on the drilling rig.
He added: „It could not weiterfliegen anymore, for which we were contacted with the request around help
With the case of their release the Wasserralle was again fit and healthy.
