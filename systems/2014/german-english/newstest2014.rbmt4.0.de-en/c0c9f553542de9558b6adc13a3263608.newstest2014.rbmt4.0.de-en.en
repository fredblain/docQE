Excellent the fight mastered
The role of the Santiago, the old man in Hemingways novelette "The old man and the sea", is cut to Horst Janson onto the body.
Janson is even an old hare in his profession, the dramatic art.
The old man Santiago cannot fool to any during the fishing.
So the two of them complement themselves simply splendidly.
One almost thinks to be able to see the wrinkles in the nape of the old man which the Fisherman-Young Manolo speaks of.
If Santiago in a tired way of the life fits bently on the chair, that is really at Janson.
Next to that the role of the old fisherman through and through is a character role which Janson masters excellently.
Hemingway told the history of a fighter, a courageous man who does not give up and finally gains the fight through his knowledge and also his will strength against the fish.
Janson is in wide stretches as alone actors on the stage.
It manages to focus the attention of the public on himself so that his monologs are no moment boring.
His efforts, to grow the fish at last onto the surface of the water, are so really that the spectators forget that nevertheless the sea consists only of blue illuminated water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann makes the old man in the boat before the fishing village act.
During the performance he puts the in each case active scene in the light: The hut of Santiago, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Gunst, that with theirs songs' and their marvellous voice's the joy of living of Cuba records.
The four musicians play Cuba's rhythm for this purpose and are at the same time guests of the bars.
