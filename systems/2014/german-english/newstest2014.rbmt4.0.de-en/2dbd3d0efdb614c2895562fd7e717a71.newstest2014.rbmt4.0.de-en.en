Gutach: Still more security for pedestrians
You do not stand any 100 meters of each other away: On Tuesday is in Gutach the new at 33 pedestrian crossing light at the village parking place in operation taken - in range of vision of the older city hall traffic lights.
Two installations so near with each other: Intention or Gothamite prank?
Gutachs mayor answered this question clearly yesterday.
"The city hall traffic lights were installed then because this safeguards the way to school", explained Eckert yesterday.
The Kluser traffic lights safeguard both cyclists and bus passengers and the Bergle inhabitants.
The yesterday officially in operation taken installation is important for the crossing field brawn creek way/Kirchstraße.
We have the museum, two churches, spa gardens, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area >Grub<.
"During the high traffic and pedestrian appearance must to those one security some further traffic lights here", so Eckert.
This confirms also Peter Arnold of the District Administration Office open castle.
"According to current measurements daily about 12 000 vehicles go through the municipality Gutach on the B 33, from that about ten percent are heavy load traffic", stresses Arnold.
Therefore the construction is more than necessary to some further traffic lights: "Security simply goes on here", so Arnold.
In total four traffic shows were carried out, also a roundabout was thought, was rejected, however, again because of the narrowness in the crossing field brawn creek way/Kirchstraße.
It was tested to traffic light posts before according to Arnold during the location choice the everything: "Means' of one means of transportation extra burdened with especially long wood tribes for us have we ausgestestet, whether these vehicles can go from the brawn creek way onto the B 33, without which to snap" traffic light posts.
The about 15 000 euros expensive traffic lights installation itself is that most "modern, what currently there is on the market", Arnold explained.
The installation is endowed with colored LEDs which shine so strongly that the lights are to be recognized by the motorists for example also at inferior sun well.
And it is economical also: The older lighting systems use about 100 watts, that new just once eight watts.
Per driving direction there are three lighting systems.
Arnold explained the technique of the new installation This is equipped with two radar sensors.
The pedestrian presses the traffic lights button, tests the upper radar sensor the traffic situation.
The street is free, green comes immediately for the pedestrian, if not, it lasts about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks, whether the green phase can be ended for the pedestrian.
"Should a group or gehbehinderte people about the street go, the green phase is prolonged, it comes therefore every secure above the road", Arnold declared.
Of course the motorist must show initiative here as a partner and observe the road.
This was not yesterday the case: Hardly the traffic lights did not show for pedestrians green, a superclass vehicle roared through - with the case of radiant red.
