Jumbo jet manufacturers argue in view of great orders about seat width
Between leading airplane manufacturers it resulted in a quarrel over the width of seats in the tourist class with the case of long-distance flights what gives the clay to Dubai Airshow for a bitter collision on that one this month.
The quarrel turns around the seat width that is offered to passengers in the case of long flights in the tourist class – not always those ones, airlines make an effort for those ones the most, however, this shown room puts SAS and Boeing Co the key from airbus for the efficiency claims at the newest airplanes. dar.
Airbus required this week a branch standard, one seat-wide of at least 46 cm (18 customs) in the tourist class specifies, however, the US American ore rival Boeing says the airlines should decide on that.
The quarrel comes to a time since the airplane cages compete for selling even greater versions of their zweimotorigen long stretch airmen and expect record tasks of the 17th to 21st November during the event.
How the rear part of the airplane is built up – in particular whether there are rows with nine or ten seats – is decisive for the indicated economical results which the new „mini-jumbo jet design „is supposed to supply.
Boeing says his modernized „777X" grabs 406 persons near seats in the tourist class that more than 17 customs are wide and allow so ten per row
Airbus declares, the concurrent version of the A350 carries 350 persons in 18 customs wide seats in the tourist class with the case of which there are nine per row
Airplane giants distribute frequently blows about technical details by means of advertising in the trade press.
Now airbus appeals directly to the public before the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X with more than 100 orders will probably do the race.
Recently the enterprise presented an advertisement which are the beginning of a new advertisement war can and financiers a picture showed, in which three persons are squashed in a restaurant, and for this purpose the title: „You would accept that"?
„Boeing suggests long-distance flights in seats which are narrower than regional Turbo-Props", says airbus marketing leader John Leahy.
Faced with changed feeding habits the people become fatter, however, airplane seats did not change radically.
Between the early 1970ern, than the Boeing defined the modern long stretch journey in 747, and to the at the end of the century the weight of the masculine average American between 40 and 49 years increased around ten percent, so the data of the US Department of Health, Education and Welfare.
The waist extent of the masculine average American in the 21st century is according to US American health statistics 100.8 cm.
Airbus says his rival sticks to a seat draft from the 1950ern when the average body extent of the freshly christened „jet set" was narrower.
One has carried on, so airbus, investigations, the busy ones, that one additional customs (2.54 cm) per seat increases the sleep quality around 53 percent.
Boeing denies the numbers of airbus to the seat measures and says, to decide in the discretion of the manufacturers how airlines arrange the balance between flight rates and equipment it does not stand.
The enterprise also declares according to investigations the experience hangs in the airplane from more than the seat width.
„It really comes to giving airlines flexibility so that they can do that what they according to their opinion must in order to be successful" the flight cabin expert Kent Craver of Boeing explains.
You would not like, that we dictate to them what makes it profitable.
You know their business better than anyone else does.
For passengers it is a question of more elbow-room, but for manufacturers it becomes in increasing measure a topic which can affect the turnovers
Behind the quarrel a race stands around airplane orders with an estimated volume of at least 700 billion United States dollars according to list prices in the coming decades, which could affect the export balance of the USA or Europe lastingly
As Reuters in July for the first time reported, the seat layout is the floating strength behind the quarrel around the new jets.
Both airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat with the case of their newest zweimotorigen long stretch designs as the market leader in this segment, the 365-sitzige of Boeing 77-300ER.
The statements of Boeings for the results depend in part on the 777X being compared with their ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in that one in 777.
The climbed costs per unit are still smaller than at currently used machines with ten seats per row
„Boeing squashes therefore more seats into his airplane in order to turn it into our product more competitively", says Kevin Keniston, conductor for passenger comfort at the European airbus.
On the other hand analysts say full cabins with ten seats per row at available 777s indicated that many passengers decided for the narrower order, what could be accompanied by cheaper flight rates.
„Eighteen customs seat width would be fabulous for passengers, however the reality is: from an economical point of view the airbus-offer headed" from the threat" "through the 777 of them", says Mary Kirby, expert for cabin equipment Gründerin and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer any seats, but a catalog of subcontractors which the airlines can select from.
The world-traveling jet sales assistants bear even measuring tape with themselves in order to measure the equipment with the case of the competition
Even if they recommend the comfort nevertheless all manufacturers offer also jets with highly condensed arranging for cheap airlines and regional flights so.
Airbus offers a A350 with zehnsitzigen rows did not sell, however, yet any according to own statement
Until recently airbus showed how more adaptability of the cabins is importantly and wide seats demanded for some jets at the walks
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of big modern jets experts say that the call after a new branch standard will presumably blow up, but could turn away from the wave from 777X-Verkäufen.
