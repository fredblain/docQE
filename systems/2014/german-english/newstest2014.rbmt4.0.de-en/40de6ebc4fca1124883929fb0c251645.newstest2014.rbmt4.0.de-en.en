Rescue parcel more than 325 millions Australian dollar for Tasmanian health service
The Australian government insists on the hard conditions, that are tied together with the rescue parcel more than 325 millions Australian dollar for the Tasmanian health service, in order to guarantee that the government of the Federal state cannot waste the money.
Federal minister of Health Tanya Plibersek announced, that Commonwealth will take „immediate measures" in order to avert a crisis that through an aging population of the developing island country, a higher rate at chronic illnesses and system restrictions has been caused.
The financing for a period of four years was concluded after government consultations with the independent Tasmanian representative Andrew Wilkie.
„The government tied up an emergency rescue parcel that concerns to the unique challenges to which the Federal state sees itself opposite according to our opinion declared Plibersek today.
The 325-million-dollar-parcel contains 31 million dollars Soforthilfe for choice services.
Remains are supposed to be removed by further 2600 operations, including orthopaedic interventions and treatments because of gray star.
In addition there is money to services for day clinics into Hobart and Launceston, better aftercare after stationary stays, the specialist training, in the field psychological health and the introduction of a system for the electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.
„These investments correspond" to the ideas from which affected clinic employees said to me they are the best possibility to correct the Tasmanian health system", said Tanya Plibersek.
The minister insisted on a severe report and account duty of the Tasmanian government.
The Federal state must retain the current financing level in order to be able to receive money from the Commonwealth, and report monthly about where the additional money was spent.
A three-headed commission is established and is supposed to guarantee, that the Federal state provides National Health Service so effectively and efficiently as possibly.
As Wilkie declared today, the 325 million dollars would be useful only little if „they are not accompanied from real reforms which bring the public Tasmanian health system onto a more lasting course."
Nevertheless he praised the government for her reacting to his request around urgent help which it expressed first opposite the prime minister at the beginning of May.
„I am confident, that the federal aids will perform" „a great contribution to taking the public health system of the Federal state of the worry list", Wilkie said.
According to the government of the Federal state these choice services will wettmachen the recent incisions to a large extent.
Nevertheless the health-political speaker of the opposition on Bundesebene, Peter Dutton, thinks the present announcement is only a „plaster solution".
„We are therefore in the present situation because the lab state government deducted 430 million dollars from the health system", he said opposite ABC TV.
It cannot be, that a state government tears almost half a billion of dollars from the system and sticks in the Commonwealth 300 million and then so do as if were the good straightening.
Dutton asked Plibersek to guarantee that a single dollar of the rescue parcel is not spent for additional bureaucracy.
