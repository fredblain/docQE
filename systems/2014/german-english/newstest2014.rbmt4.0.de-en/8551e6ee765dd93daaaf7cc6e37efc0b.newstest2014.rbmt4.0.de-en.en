Early puberty: Being arisen more quickly
Afro-American and hispanische girls tendentially rather achieve the puberty as their white contemporaries as investigations show.
Physical changes do not mean the puberty immediately yet
There is not any proof of hormones or other chemicals being responsible
Experts believe, the epidemic corpulence is a trigger of the early puberty
The trend towards the early puberty is less marked with boys
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is one journalist, that specialized on child health and family topics.
Should a mother be worried if from seven or eight years breasts and shame hairs increase to their daughter already in the age?
Declared during the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics child specialist association this week in Orlando, Florida, the pediatric Endokrinologe Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, that these early physical changes are relatively normal among American girls and represented a new norm
„I spend a lot of time with calming parents – usually is that no sign for the puberty setting in now quickly" explained Kaplowitz.
Obvious advertisements of the development as for example wachsende breasts, shame and armpit hairs as well as body odor, are proved with girls formerly.
Nevertheless it gave only a slight shift with the case of the age of the Menarche (Appearance of the first rule bleeding in the last 40 years.
In the United States the average age at 12.5 years, a little little, lies as 12.75 in the year 1970.
„If the development of the breasts begins, it lasts still at least two to three years up to the Menarche", said Kaplowitz, also author of the book „Morning puberty with girls: The essential mentor for the contact with this problem occurring frequently".
During the most exact test is, as the puberty strides.
It is controversial what in fact represents the beginning of the puberty, nevertheless it is valid „precociously" if the breast enlargement is accompanied from a growth push before an age of eight years.
In most cases the process slows itself down or stagnates – something, that a child specialist can control exactly.
In the case of faster striding tests could be indicated by an Endikronologen so that serious problems as tumors or cysts can be excluded.
There are treatment methods to the delaying of an early menstruation and the defense of another consequence: to the early aging of the bones that can lead ultimativ to growth inhibition and in this way small body growth with adults.
The recommendations for a medikamentöse or hormonal therapy base themselves on the age of the child, the development speed, the growth rate and the emotional maturity
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz what concerns, but grants medicines is reserved: „The suppression of the puberty can moderate behavior problems to be different than their contemporaries and the feelings of girls."
The other great problem is understandable: Parents would simply not like, that their very young daughters have the period.
„You worry because of the pregnancy risk or about that as they handle the hygienic page said Kaplowitz.
„A shock was", a woman whose daughter got their days with ten remembers.
Even if there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation, it was not emotionally prepared.
It came verängstigt and annoyed by the school home because she was the first in their circle of friends.
There are many comprehensively published theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there are not any conclusive proofs of hormones in milk or other food, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media being causal.
Boys come similar to girls into the puberty formerly.
Kaplowitz thinks the most convincing premise is the epidemic of the corpulence.
It supported the realization of a study in the age of six to nine years that makes a connection between body fat and the entry into the puberty per year in 2001 above girls.
Other investigations support this conclusion, but there are many other factors which played a role.
In this country Afro-American and hispanische girls tendentially rather achieve the puberty as their white contemporaries.
There are for that different declarations
Globally an early puberty seems from all possible things to be influenced, of economic conditions about the climate up to the genes.
A further puzzle: Although the face and shame hairiness increases to boys already formerly, the trend towards a vollumfänglichen former puberty is not as marked as with girls.
Other doctors on the AAP-conference underlined the complexity of the topic.
The emergence of acne and shame hair is spread even with babies and small children.
„We must be cautious as we identify the true beginning of the puberty", said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric Endokrinologe, at the Goryeb Children's hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate with making oneself from their child specialist be advised as they should speak with their child.
„That can mean, that one formerly than expected a conversation must lead, Kaplowitz guessed.
If one remains quiet the child reacts usually well.
Girls that early blossom need the insurance, that the process is a normal part of the life, self when it formerly than thought kicks in.
