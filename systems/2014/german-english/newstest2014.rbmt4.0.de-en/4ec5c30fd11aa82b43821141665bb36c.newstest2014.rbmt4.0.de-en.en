Profit losses at Bombardier according to drop with the case of delivering-numbers and tasks
The Canadian airplane and railroad manufacturer Bombardier Inc announced on Thursday a 15 per cent drop of the clear profit after he had gotten under pressure through regressive orders and deliveries over at airplanes in the third quarter as well as contract problems in the railroad section.
Bomb published with seat in Montreal also no flight test data for his brand-new airplane of the CSeries and did not give any new information about that, whether the airplane according to the ambitious schedule in next September into the commercial use can go.
Onto the old maid flight of the test flight stuff before one months up to now only three more starts followed, what makes him appear questionable, whether the test phase on schedule proceeds.
The results remained behind the predictions and led to a sharp fall in prices from more than eight percent at the stock exchange from Toronto.
Cameron Doerksen, analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered on Thursday his evaluation of „outperform" on „sector perform" in the regard on a restricted course potential having the stock in the next one to two quarters.
„Indeed weaker delivering-numbers were largely expected at airplanes, however, from the margin development in the transportation field we are very clearly disappointed", said Doerksen into one to customer writings.
We think that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries if the check programme strides for the airplane.
If, however, in the coming months no new orders are announced, we expect then that the market becomes more sceptical opposite the program.
Bomb hopes, that the airplane row of the CSeries can catapult the enterprise into the lower market segment that currently is dominated by Boeing and airbus.
The first test flight stuff was introduced in March to the public and flew after delays lasting for months for the first time in September.
However up to now obligatory orders are for the CSeries with 177 moderat since potential buyers would like to wait for the results of the flight tests and see whether the claims of the enterprise with regard to fuel efficiency and cost saving-potential of the new nozzle airliner are appropriate.
Currently there are in total 403 orders and promises of 15 customers and societies.
Executive board chairperson Pierre Beaudoin gives himself confidently, that Bombardier will reach his objective of 300 obligatory orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the jet.
The management in addition assured on Thursday opposite analysts and media the program lies in the aging schedule.
„The test flight stuff did not stay longer at the ground than expects", „Beaudoin would say at a telephone conference" and would add during the endurance life of the airplane ground tests and software updates were scheduled.
Every manufacturer plans differently.
We decided on undertaking a first flight and attaching a reworking period then which we also did.
That happens during the entire flight program.
The second of five test airplanes will start probable in the next weeks, the remaining ones shortly after that, it was called from enterprise page
Nevertheless analysts remain sceptical whether twelve months after the old maid flight the first customer can take an airplane of the CSeries in operation.
Bomb declared, it checks the planning for the initiation (ICE) and will update these in the next months.
„The slow striding the flight test – also when they correspond to Bombardiers of internal planning obviously – confirms" Doerksen said „our opinion that the initiation postpones onto the first quarter in 2015".
In the third quarter with end on 30th September Bombardiers clear profit fell on 147 million dollars and/or 8 cents per stock from 172 million dollars and/or 9 cents per stock per year before.
The adapted profit per stock is as before 9 cents.
The turnover gave insignificantly and sank from 4.2 onto 4.1 billion dollars.

The worldwide fourth-tallest airplane manufacturer declares he handed over in this quarter 45 airplanes a drop of 57 in the last year.
The net orders fell from 83 airplanes on 26.
The order backlog in the air and space travel section was on 30th September 32.9 billion dollars and was in this way unchanged opposite the 31st December.
„In the field air and room journey the results lay within the framework of our handicaps however the low incoming orders and the market conditions in total were disappointing", Beaudoin said.
The turnover in the air and space travel section fell about 13 percent onto two billion dollars.
Bomb, the worldwide tallest railroad manufacturer, announced that the turnover increased in this section around just eleven percent on 2.1 billion dollars.
The order backlog in the transportation section was on 30th September 32.6 billion dollars and was in this way slightly increased opposite the 31st December.
The profit margin in the field transportation was influenced at some major contracts by handling problems.
According to management there will be for the fourth quarter new handicaps
