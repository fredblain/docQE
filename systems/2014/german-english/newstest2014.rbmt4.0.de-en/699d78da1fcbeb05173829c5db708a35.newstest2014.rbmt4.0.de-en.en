A study which is supposed to increase the advantages of the HS2 railroad project for Scotland was announced by the British government.
In the work of HS2 Ltd it is suggested to realize already with beginning of phase 1 per year 2026 high-speed links between Scotland and the north of England.
Traffic minister Baroness Kramer said, the project will bring together Great Britain nearer.
The Scotch Minister of Transport Keith Brown declared it is very delighted with the British government at this plan to work.
Phase 1 consists of a new high speed railroad connection between London and the west Midlands.
On completion of phase 2 there will be according to connections Manchester and Leeds.
In June the government corrected the estimated costs for the construction of the high speed trasses between London and north England of 32.7 billion pounds on 42.6 billion pounds.
The British government which stands in conversations with transportation Scotland charged HS2 Ltd to search for further stretch capacities and travel time improvements for north England and Scotland.
The possibility of a travel time of finally three hours or little belongs to that from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baron's daughter Kramer said: „Our objective for HS2 is a really national railway network, the Great Britain and his cities nearer brings together."
We precede with HS2 because it brings enormous advantages with themselves.
Without it we stand before a capacity crisis in our traction network.
However it is a question also of the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, that is improved thanks to HS2.
The Scotch undersecretary Alistair Carmichael commented: „The present announcement is a good information for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scotch government Keith Brown Carmichael asked to support the Scotch integration „unmistakably" into the HS2-network.
Brown said: „The high speed railroad connection contains the potential of enormous economical advantages for Scotland, simultaneously also the economic strength of Scotland supplies, however, an argument for fast railroad connections in whole Great Britain."
Therefore we are delighted to work as a partner of the British government and to examine the options for a high speed railroad connection in Scotland that creates advantages for all and the connection Glasgow-Edinburgh complements that the Scotch government already plans.
I look forward to examining the research report with the British ministers in the next year and deciding on the next steps together.
