NSA-disclosures intensify company paranoia because of state supervision
On a mild day at the end of August a German police helicopter flew deeply over the US consulate in Frankfurt on the Main, the finance capital of Germany.
On the instructions of the federal velvet for intelligence service and terrorism abatement (BVT), the German inside secret service, he should photograph the roof of the US Außenpostens that there is little as 5 km of the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve.
According to German media the BVT wanted to prove the existence of supervision antennae and the action led for an argument into Berlin between the USA and the German foreign ministry of State.
James Clapper, US American Director of National Intelligence, insisted in September once again on the USA not using any possibilities of the foreign espionage „in order to steal the companies confidential secrets of foreign enterprises on behalf of US American companies in this way these their international competitive capacity or their profit could extend."
However since Edward Snowden, the former employee become to the Whistleblower, began with the publication of his horn of plenty at US American supervision secrets, European governments and enterprise leaders are not more sure, whether they can take the director with the case of the word.
Reports according to which the American National Security Agency ausspioniert the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and got herself for data of American Cloud providers including Google and Yahoo brought the company paranoia onto a new highest level because of state supervision.
The barrel for the overrun brought the disclosure, that chancellor Angela Merkels was a telephone verwanzt, possibly already for ten years.
If the most powerful person can get into the visor in Europe, also managements are potential objectives then with security
Snowden made the intense cooperation between US secret services and enterprises transparent.
I believe, it is conceivable that these data are used to the mutual benefit.
„Germany must wake up", declares Oliver Grün, president of the BITMi who represents small and middle IT companies in Germany.
German enterprises believe, the USA represented now an almost just as great risk as China did if it is a question of industrial espionage and data theft, such an inquiry that was published by the consultant company EY in July.
In the documents seeped from Snowden it, however, up to now did not give any proof that the USA passed on the companies confidential secrets of foreign enterprises to own companies.
Politicians expressed their worry over the EU lacking certain IT and internet possibilities and her should reduce their dependence on the USA.
The enterprises are sceptical concerning that.
In the Bundestag Federal Parliament it was suggested we should build up a German Google.
I can close only my eyes and open it slowly again...
„So that does not function, Hasso Plattner, chairperson of the German SAP software manufacturer, says.
If one had wanted a strong European IT industry, one should not have made her become extinct 20 years ago then.
All in Germany is subsidized, of the coal above cars up to the agriculture.
All, up to the IT branch.
Nevertheless companies that before had seen the greatest espionage risk in China shocked range and technical smartness of the US espionage authorities uncovered from the Snowden-disclosures.
With the Cloud Computing a great change occurs because European enterprise conductors are now more conscious that in the USA stored data of the nonlocal jurisdiction are defeated and therefore potentially endangered are.
According to an inquiry carried out by the Cloud Security Alliance, a commercial institution, rejected after the disclosures about the US American data Mining activities with Prism for instance ten percent the not in the USA resident members plans, to be useful an American provider.
Jim Snabe, deputy manager of SAP, says: „We see a new question of customers that a year ago there was not yet – it says: Where my data are stored and you can guarantee that these stay physically in this right room
Many German enterprise conductors represent the opinion the recent reports only simply confirm that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore these must be guarded at all costs what they in any case already knew indeed.
That industrial espionage occurs is not a surprise.
That was always like this.
„A topic was for many years and did not change itself through the current discussion in a basic way", says Kurt Bock, chairperson of the chemistry enterprise BASF.
The Americans spy us on commercial and industrial level, so as we that also do, because it is in the national interest to defend our enterprises.
The management does not boast usually about the countermeasures that one took, because with that provides assailants advantages.
In great enterprises employees are already long blued to, that the taking along of a free USB-Sticks on a fair or the unattended forgetting of a laptop in the hotel room is not advisable, putting it mildly.
Collecting the mobiles so that they cannot be used as monitors says to Ulrich Hackenberk, board member near car manufacturer Audi, that it belongs to the standard practice for years before an executive board meeting.
The German BVT recommends managers to use simple Prepaid-mobiles if they go onto trips abroad because smartphones can be possibly compromised.
The Prepaid-mobiles are thrown away afterwards.
The worry withstands it, however, that small and middle enterprises remain Hacking and supervision vulnerably opposite.
In Germany many of these enterprises are worldwide market leaders in the respective niche.
„Small and middle enterprises often miss the experience, the personnel and the financial resources in order to protect companies confidential secrets effectively against not authorized access the BVT warns in a report.
The USA warn own companies against industrial espionage through other countries.
According to Washington mail office France, Russia and Israel were classified in the US National Intelligence Estimate in February behind China on rank two of the countries which used the Hackings for the procurement of economic data.
A board member of a German Blue-chip-enterprise agreed if it is a question of industrial espionage, then „the French are the worst".
Bernard Squarcini, former conductor of the French inside secret service DCRL, was quoted this month in an interview with following words: „The secret services know very exactly that all countries ausspionieren their allies even if they cooperate in the fight against the terror."
