Coulson used Telefon-Hacking for the checking of a tip
The former news of the Word-Herausgeber Andy Coulson employed supposedly „Telefon-Hacking, supervision and confrontation" during the attempt to confirm a wrong tip about an affair of the former Minister of the Interior Charles Clarke.
Public prosecutor Andrew Edis QC declared the court in the Old Bailey a wrong rumor that Clarke would have a relation with his „attractive special adviser" Hannah Pawlby belonged to news of the World in such a way in May 2005.
The newspaper charged the private detective Glenn Mulcaire to chop Pawlbys voice mail, and hunted, however Coulson also called her and left behind news as the court found out.
„According to opinion of the prosecution Coulson that now Herausgeber is the NotW is not to catch anybody that stands before the apartment of people and hopes it on fresh action but one, the people's confronted with a history gladly in order to see their reaction" declared Edis.
He said NotW uses three procedures in order to investigate histories investigativ: Telefon-Hacking, supervision and confrontation.
The editor is participated in the third method personally.
Obviously he knows about the second, the supervision, it cannot be different.
How does it look with the first?

Rumors about an affair Clarkes were picked up first by the feature editorial staff from NotW when a source that was sexually interested at Pawlby was said to: „You" do not „waste your time, she is with Charles together."
A volume with voice mail of their telephone of at least three reasons apartment was guaranteed in August 2006 in Mulcaires.
The observers in addition found entries on the computer of the detective on whom Pawlby and their sister as „projects" were stored.
In the time, when the investigations ran, the grandparents of Pawlby received anonymous calls in which they were asked for information about them, declared Edis.
Meanwhile the former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and the former reporter James Weatherup supervised the supervision of the movements of Pawlby.
On 18th June 2005 Coulson left a voice mail with following contents to her: „I have a story which we want to bring out tomorrow which I would like to talk about gladly with Charles."
Edis declared about instance the former Minister of the Interior David Blunkett Coulsons activities with the case of this story followed the same pattern as with other important personalities.
The jurors heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett confronted because of an affair with a married woman that had been then married when it was associated even with the co-defendant Rebekah Brooks.
