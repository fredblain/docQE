Post hardly empties on Sundays yet
"Many citizens will not have noticed it yet, the red points for the Sunday emptying are still found at different mailboxes of the town center and the quarters, but one reads the small print at the yellow receptacles of the limited company mail office, one finds out that the emptying does not "occur" on Sundays and holidays anymore quickly" the FDP informs.
An inquiry of the FDP confirmed that.
On Sundays and holidays people only still empty before the mail office building in the seriousness-Ludwig-street 36 and in the Jakob-miller-street 1 in Hüttenfeld.
Whether in court home and rose garden Sunday is also still emptied, is not answered in the answer to the inquiry of the FDP.
The social and youth political speaker of the FDP, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants here nachhaken.
The Sunday emptying is an important mail service just near appointment mail office.
"This enterprise thins out Diesen in spite of the increase in prices for letters at January 2013 radically and unreasonably".
Thomas Bittner, faction and city association chairperson of the liberals, supports his faction colleague: "What annoys me is the fact that gorge-secretly the emptying times are changed here or "are also deleted".
From public-friendliness the mail office is mile-wide in this case removes.
"At least new castle and rose garden must be cleared the mailboxes in the quarters again on Sundays", so Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisono.
Also for the town center is valid, especially fellow citizens not mobile would have to be able to reach a mailbox with Sunday emptying also fußläufig.
Röhrenbeck asked in the city parliament whether the municipal administration plans conversations with the mail office about this thing.
Mayor Erich Maier answered, the mail office did not communicate with Lampertheim.
His knowledge's it, however, gives in court home also a Sunday emptying.
Your party spoke out for denationalizations.
"Then decisions are made at other place", said Maier.
