Also this year a Hubertusmesse is celebrated on name-day of the saint Hubertus in the parish church St. Marien at the Hülsbergstraße.
St. Hubertus was according to the legend a quite inconsiderate hunter who was converted by a vision and later appointed the bishop of Lüttich.
The hunting horn blower group of the Jagdreiter Westphalia under the management of Brigitte Kluth plays Parforcehörnern (Natural horns in the atmosphere It) according to old, initially French melodies.
The blowers wear riding-clothing because they help riders, horses and Hundemeute on dragging hunts musically above all.
The solemn fair occurs on Sunday, 3rd November, at 11.30 o'clock.
