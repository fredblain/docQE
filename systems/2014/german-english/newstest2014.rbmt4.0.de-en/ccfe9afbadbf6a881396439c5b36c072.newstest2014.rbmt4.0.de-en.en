The throw away society does not think
The night was long, the music loud and the atmosphere well, but sometime it is slow house.
Only: In the stomachs of the people on the co-driver and moving seat the hunger becomes noticeable.
Clear, for that one or the other cocktail or champagne likes to be responsible!
What seems likely there, than to go to the next Drive-In gechillt in order to treat oneself on a small thing?
I add, I am gladly with in this case, if it late at night and/or in the early morning goes onto the Fastfood-getting.
A few chips, a coke, a Burger - and then nix as off home and into the bed!
However, on the way home the obvious differences become noticeable between me and other hungrigen Disco-GÃ¤ngern.
Because what one must lack, that one flings his Fastfood bags from the car window with constant regularity?!
Paper bags thrown away are due particularly to the weekends at street edges and on parking places.
"Why?" I ask to myself.
The people are too dumb, around the bags with home respektive to take up to the next garbage can?
It is not only like this, that the paper stuff's the landscape verschandelt.
Bags already concealed traffic facilities as guardrails and activated accidents through that.
Said "throw away society" does not think about something like that, however, presumably she not even knows what means this word actually.
If one is in the evening more often on the way, first rakes with several people in the car, knows one, as a moving-bank after celebrated nights can look: Rags, bottles and other garbage pile up there.
Nevertheless there a few bags would form more or less also nix - unlike the street, where no one wants to stamp on the food residues of others.
I see really already the day coming, at which the removing becomes too stupid to the cities and to municipalities - and have to demand the Fastfood chains for their bags pledge.
