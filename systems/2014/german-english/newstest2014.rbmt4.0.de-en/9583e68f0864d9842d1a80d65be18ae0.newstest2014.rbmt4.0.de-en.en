Joy city: Fast actions überrumpeln hosts
With a narrow cadre the gentlemen I of the TSV joy city in the Schiller school gymnasium in Reutlingen against the TG Gönningen of the Swabian one nightmare had to line up.
The Älbler stood indeed with a practised team on the other net page
Soon it was proved however, that they could completely not keep up, also age-conditional, with the fast actions of the joy town-dwellers.
With the hard and placed impacts the Gönninger did themselves extremely heavily.
Repeated they missed that of Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz cleanly above the net middle passed passports and attacks and were not during the block defense to the place.
Two high first sentence profits expressed clearly the superiority of the joy town-dwellers in all interests
Faced with this crushing and game-determining achievement the third sentence was gained then a little laxly and listlessly to the 3:0 closing balance (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
There a considerably more efficient opponent will stand on the 2nd November with the TV Baiersbronn which could continue in Nagold clearly on the field.
TSV joy city of I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-class the second teams suited themselves in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn from Baiersbronn and opposite joy city.
You delivered a two-hour-match in a hard way umkämpftes.
Nervousness on both pages caused particularly with the case of the ball assumption errors and dot presents; also with the case of the passports the precision was now and then scare commodity and in some critical mock bullfights the overeagerness prevented the look for possible dot profits.
In this from the point of view of performance very much harmonious meeting the big physical use and a pleasant engagement of both teams was right in the TSV-team of Marcus Blasutto but altogether.
