Pope Franziskus appoints in February first cardinals
Pope Franziskus will call on 22nd February for the first time new cardinals of the Catholic church as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the rank-highest clergymen in the Catholic church after the Pope and they that elect a Pope so that Franziskus in this way will appoint the first group of men that finally will participate during the choice of his successor are it also.
Currently there are 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal that an old man of 80 years reached cannot participate anymore in the pope election – that falls to a group from 120 „elective cardinals".
In a declaration in which the information was announced padre Federico Lombardi, a speaker of the Vatican, said a meeting of all cardinals will occur before the ceremony for the appointment of the new cardinals is kept off which is known also as a Konsistorium.
„Papst Franziskus decided on announcing his decision for the calling of the Konsistoriums in February in advance in this way other meetings, that" the participation of cardinals from all world require", be able to be planned, Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of the elective cardinals until February will probably have sunk.
It declared the number of the elective cardinals again in this way a Pope appoints usually as many cardinals as necessarily in 120 is, and as many cardinals above 80 as it would like.
The Konsistorium in the next year is important, because it is the First since the choice of Franziskus in March this year's, so Valero.
Currently there is a certain overhang of aufseiten Europe and in particular Italy.
„It will be interesting" he said „to see whether the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world in order to reconstruct the balance".
Forty percent of the Catholics live in South America, however, they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
The cardinals will be also the First ones to be called since the education of the council of the cardinals based by Franziskus for finding a group of eight cardinals from the whole world that has the task possibilities for the reformation of the church.
In the past the Pope decided on everything alone.
„Now Franziskus selected these eight cardinals who are supposed to help him", said Valero.
It declared it is „well possible" that Franziskus the cardinals around council please.
However up to now we were not in this situation – that is everything very again.
Valero said that the bishops would appoint as cardinal typically from big places, nevertheless Franziskus of „full surprises" puts „– we do not know therefore who he appoints".
