Pawnshops boomen in Singapore, since the crisis arrived in the middle class
In a pawnshop in the shopping center Bendemeer in Singapore Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a golden bracelet, a ring and a few earrings in order to be able to pay the school fees of their daughters.
„My husband and I bought just a house, there my whole money is „in that", Amirthalinga says.
Although they every month 3,000 Singapore dollars (ca 1,730 euros) than administration employee deserves and their husband also works, the monthly family income does not suffice, it explains.
In fact the demand is so great in parts of Southeast Asia – where the indebtedness of the budgets increases – that ValueMax, where she carried out their exchange, became the third pawnshop to be listed at the Singaporean stock exchange this week.
The pawning of jewelry is not only a fast way in order to get money – 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as favorable as an unsaved bank loan.
Typically pawnshops require in Singapore an effective year interest of 17 percent that lies only just over the 15.4 percent that the United Overseas demands Bank a local credit grantor with a branch in the same shopping center.
Pawnshops offer, however, the advantage that no inspection of the creditworthiness or income proofs are necessary here, for which loans are more fast than possible near banks
For this reason millions of people turn in the region to pawnshops after families sense the pressure through increasing costs of living as well as an increasing budget and consumer indebtedness.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credits due to a loose financial policy in the developed markets families with smaller and middle incomes consult pawnshops in order to balance so the difference with the case of stuttering economy.
This week the rating agency described standard & Poor's wachsende budget indebtedness, main through increasing mortgages, as a factor of risk for the creditworthiness of Asiatic banks
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have according to assessment of the agency the highest budget indebtedness in Asia in relation to the gross domestic product.
Malaysia stands with 80 percent of the BIP at the top of the list, a rise of 60 percent still in the year 2008.
Nation business persons worry also because of the high consumer indebtedness in Thailand, which came out this week just from a technical recession.
On Thursday the data showed an export weakness keeping on existing and a remission of the consumer demand.
„In the final effect that means, that faced with increasing costs the people in the middle one will attempt to lower segment (the income scale), their to complement" „incomes where that is always possible," says song Seng Wun, economist, at CIMB, a Malaysian bank
Historical highest levels with the case of the gold prices of gold in the last two years still intensified the trend towards the pledge of personal objects since the people take the opportunity for changing the jewelry of the family into cash.
In Singapore about 70 percent of the pawned objects are gold in the 200 pawnshops of the city state.
The people tell: „The gold price of gold looks good, let us grandmother's Goldkette pawn and fetch back next month."
The tallest Thai pawnshop operator, EasyMoney, experienced a 20 per cent customer increase in his branches in the last months.
The growth in the pledge business is so strong, that ValueMax would like to expand, operator of the branch in Bendemeer and 15 more in Singapore, not only into the adjacent Malaysia – where the enterprise practices four houses –, but also outside of Asia, so Yeah Lee Ching, manageress of ValueMax.
The enterprise finances that with 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore-dollars which it took this week with the initial public offering in Singapore.
While some credit grantors were getting into the cross fire because of high interest rates, Yeah declares that pawnshops would not offer only more favorable interests than other lenders, but did not increase the debts directly either.
„Customers grant a loan on objects which they already own and the liquefaction of personal articles of value does not extend the Haushaltsverschulung", it explains.
The pawnbroking business is accepted socially increasingly as a short-term, protected financing.
Also all people are not, use the pawnbroking, in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore come also into the branches of ValueMax in order to pawn gold bars and Rolex-clocks for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price cash.
To us customers come from every social shift
„Prosperous ones who lend something at short notice for a business or an investment, or small enterprises which must bridge bottlenecks in the Cash Flow belong to that", says Yeah.
Sometimes they also simply need money only very much quickly.
