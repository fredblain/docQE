Schools are kept from bigger focus on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In courses to English literature pupils must handle at least a piece of Shakespeare, a novel of the 19th century, romantic lyric poetry and contemporary British novels from 1914 in the future.
Into the examination find also „unseen texts" Entry in order to stimulate to wider reading.
The combined course from English literature and language is abolished.
From 2015 pupils must take an independent GCSE-examination for language in the case of which choosing English literature as a separate qualification gives strong stimuli for that.
The education ministry will publish tomorrow the new curricula for English and mathematics – the first compartments to be reshaped radically.
Other nuclear compartments are changed next year.
In a separate initiative Ofqual, the inspectorate for examinations will give a re-organization of the GCSE-structures in a best known way, including a new marking system and less course work
In a speech in the summer education minister Michael Gove said that to „spread" it one „gives consensus that we must reform our examination system in order to reconstruct the public confidence" at what it stressed the GCSEs would become „provoking, ambitious and severe become.
Studies show that in English schools less time is spent for mathematics - 116 hours per annum or three hours weekly per school year – than in most other countries.
On the other hand Australian schools teach on the average 143 hours annually and pupils in Singapore receive 138 hours.
Indeed no formal requirement will give to plan more time in the schedule for mathematics, however, from coalition circles it is said the comprehensive maths examination – combined with a stronger weighting of the compartment in ranking lists – will presumably encourage Schulen to scheduling more giving time to pay.
In the curriculum more attention to „Problems" is put „from the correct living", including financial mathematics.
