Living with future perspective
Actually Waltraud Ries lives marvellously.
Your house lies in one quiet residential area's of Stuttgart with a lot green, an old tree stock, nice neighbors and neither too much traffic.
Into the city it is only few minutes with public means of transportation.
"You are not afraid it is to be hoped of spiders"? Waltraud Ries asks and points at a fat spider at the door frame.
I search already for some time a new apartment for my husband and me.
But you know how difficult that is in Stuttgart.
The reason is, however, no spider phobia, but the worry, it declares not to be able to overcome the many stairs anymore in the age to the house and in the apartment.
Furthermore: For a meniscus-operation the Mittfünfzigerin has had to find out at the own body what means to move from storey with Handicap to storey.
Recently first a book was published from it on the topic 'Live happily in the age - Which Living-Form the best is for me?'.
'Our apartment is the best example of what' does not 'work' in the age at all begins to tell it
When it more than 20 years ago with their husband moved into the May sonnet apartment, it was only simple a beautiful apartment right in the Green Party member
Today with middle fifty Waltraud Ries thinks different about that.
She also knows, however, that she belongs to the few people who deal with the topic 'Live in the age' anyway.
Most replace it as long as it works.
Only the others get old always', she says smiling.
Only if the suffering pressure is really big one is concerned.
'Then it' can 'be', however', already too late', according to Ries.
In their book the interior designer presents 17 living-models for an even specific living in the age.
'Which living-form one, however, chooses is always an Individualentscheidung', it declares.
There is not D i e solution for the age.
Even who can afford the age transition fit in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that he can become also sick.
And: 'Without good knowledge of the national language vereinsame one also in the Dolce Vita', the specialized book book authoress Aussiedlungswilligen gives to consider.
Under their models classical care models, alternative living-forms or the often quoted Rentner-WG, are found.
In the age everyone has so his tics and flaws
'For me such a flat-sharing community would not be, however, anything' she thinks with a wink.
Already not at all as in a Studenten-WG with a common bath and a kitchen.
'In the age one simply needs also his withdrawal rooms', according to Ries.
That nevertheless a senior flat-sharing community can function nevertheless does not want to exclude the book authoress.
That must go by then differently, however, than in the classical Studenten-WG.
And sometimes one simply wants also only his rest', she believes.
With this opinion it does not stand at least in the capital only there.
Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay 'as long as it works in their own apartment', also the experience of Theresa Rütten is, the head of the civil service life in the age of the capital.
Your office advises people around the topic 'Get older'.
Therefore older people would just accept also inconveniences and restrictions frequently only in order to be able to stay in their usual surroundings that is also the experience of the foundation product test.
In this case there are today many possibilities to design the house or the apartment barrier-freely.
Ream is recommended to all that deal with the age-just reconstruction of their house or their apartment first once thoroughly to inform and not to charge the first-best craftsman.
Today there are specialists also for the age-just reconstruction.
Even in the flat let for rent one or the other can be realized, and if it is only the toilet seat increase, the interior designer clears up.
But not always the existing apartment is let age-raked and reshape in this way barrier-freely even if it is still so beautiful.
This experience had to make Waltraud Ries.
Indeed one could install a stairs lift within the apartment, the way paved also with stairs to to the apartment door would be, however, the by far greater obstacle.
It will weitersuchen until she found the ideal object for itself and their husband.
She is terrified by the move more by it than by the spider at their apartment door.
