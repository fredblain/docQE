CDC publish allergy guidelines for schools
On Wednesday those ones published Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) a series of guidelines for the contact with food allergies of children at schools.
These are the first such guidelines which the US American government handed over since the number of the school ages children with food allergies climbs.
One thing of 20 children in the United States has meanwhile a food allergy.
The circulation of food allergies among children increased according to CDC around 18 percent in between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines contain information for schools that are supposed to wake a consciousness with the staff and the employees for food allergies and that is supposed to be handled as with children that show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have Epinephrin in an in stock way – the car-injection of the brand EpiPen is used most frequently – in order to be able to encounter a potentially fatal Überempfindlichkeitsreaktion.
The legislators in the Federal states changed recently the rules so that schools Epinephrin in a more simply in stock way can hold.
In the report also a list is contained typical symptoms that are named by children that show an allergic reaction.
Maybe children say: „It feels as if something presses onto my tongue My tongue feels, as if a hair lies on that" or „My tongue itches".
