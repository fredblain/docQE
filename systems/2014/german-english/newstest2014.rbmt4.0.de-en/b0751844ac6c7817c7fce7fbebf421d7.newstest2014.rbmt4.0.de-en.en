Parents of a teenager from Georgia who died in the case of tragic accident believe in murder
The parents of the teenager whose corpse was found in a wrestler mat rolled up in the gymnasium of his High School are convinced, the attorney of the family declared that their son was murdered on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the US American Georgia Federal state was found on the 11th January in a mat uprightly set up which stood behind the bleacher in the school gymnasium.
The investigators of the sheriff of Lowndes county came to the conclusion, that Johnson died at a tragic accident, which the family of that 17-year, however, doubts.
„You are convinced from that of their son being murdered", declared Benjamin Crump, the attorney of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, opposite FoxNews.com.
You would never have believed, he died so as the sheriff concluded it.
„You think that it lacks every logic against which expels laws of the physics as also against the healthy human intellect", according to Crump.
Rather they are convinced, the truth is hushed up in order to protect the person or persons that are responsible for the death of their son.
It comments, „your son went for the learning into the school and came in the corpse bag back".
US public prosecutor Michael Moore said on Thursday there will be a formal determination for the death of Johnsons since a series of important questions are still unclear.
What was the death cause?
Is his death to be put down to a crime?
That declared bogs at a press conference in the Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts, to which direction they also lead.
It is my objective to find out the truth.
„I represent the opinion that a sufficient basis exists for a formal determination he said.
Moore declared opposite reporters the initial autopsy indicates that Johnson had passed away at the consequences of a „position-conditional suffocation".
A second autopsy showed, however, another death cause, according to Moore.
„There is a series of questions which must be answered or confirmed", he said.
Moore added, if there are sufficient proofs of a legal or civil law investigation for the death of Johnsons, he will charge the FBI the realization of the investigations.
A representative of the authority of the county to sheriffs was open our inquiry to the Thursday there not immediately ready for a comment.
A court in the south Georgias ordered on Wednesday that the authorities must release all supervision videos which checked the observers.
The parents of the teenager said they hoped for the video recordings containing tips on how he died.
