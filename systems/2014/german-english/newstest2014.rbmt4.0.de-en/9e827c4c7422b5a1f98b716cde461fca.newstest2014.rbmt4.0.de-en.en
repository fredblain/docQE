The Veganismus is subordinated to the vegetarianism according to lexicons, distinguishes from this, however, nevertheless in very considerable way
Because while vegetarians are allowing themselves the consumption of cream cake, ice or a strong Edam cheese, these Schlemmereien do not stand on the menu of a Veganers.
Milk, the Veganer lets cheeses, egg, in addition to the renunciation of meat and fish of the all consumption of animal products off - also honey is denied.
One likes to wonder what remains, however, in the case of nearer consideration the vegane feeding world is characterized by a considerable imaginativeness.
"Spreads are very popular", declares Ute Henkelmann, the holder of the local health food store who prepares a great number of specific products for Veganer.
Also Reuben Proctor goes to the shop in the cathedral lane gladly.
For 13 years the native New Zealander is living vegan, in Lampertheim he finds (almost) all which he needs to the life. "In 1997 I changed my feeding and Vegetarier became".
Around the turn of the century then the next step occurred and I became Veganer.
"The conviction came, however, not only because of the feeding but due to the shoe choice", says Proctor who prefers imitation leathers to normal leather.
He recognized that it works also in other everyday interests without animal products.
In the first place is vegan be an ethic.
"I do not want animals to have to die for me" expresses the maxim of the Veganer which applies to the entire consumer behavior Proctor.
To mourn instead of Burgern, Rühreiern or rubber bears, the Veganer discovered quickly very new products that enthusiasm increased at.
"It is a double bonus", says Proctor today, "in fact sets vegan be no renunciation no asceticism dar, but it is an enrichment". Proctor rather puts down the assumption that one reduces the selection with the feeding adaptation at food options to the power of the habit.
And exactly these conditionings let also some still so well-meant attempt fail.
"The addiction factor is a very decisive factor, which makes many be given up quickly, similarly as while smoking", Proctor sets up a comparison.
And objects: "Certain tastes are not to be identified with the animal".
Often it is the spices or the kind of the dressing which define the taste.
"One can produce, however, the same effect also in another manner", the Veganer clarifies.
For a barbecue Proctor brings along for example aubergines, champignons and also a few Veganwürste.
It pays attention to a balanced, varied feeding with the case of which it is absolutely supposed to taste also once solid.
Of course one would like to have something between the teeth, that is legitimate.
"It is supposed to taste good, but that is not to reduce" only to animal food", according to Proctor.
He did not suffer sanitary damages up to Essstörungen, a further widespread assumption
For me the adaptation had a positive aspect.
I do not incorporate any foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin part.
There are high performance athletes who eat exclusively vegan.
"My blood values are at best, I make myself be often checked", Proctor betrays.
Many Vegansimus-critics warn in particular against the lack of vitamin B12.
"Since animals are fed with fodders instead of grazing on the pasture it is questionable whether in the meat which one buys in the freezer the vitamin-B12-part is high", thinks Proctor.
For Veganer there is furthermore the possibility to take the co-enzyme in shape of trays to himself
"My B12-values are in order", it declares.
Widens ways must go Proctor for the food procurement not.
Finally there are basic foods everywhere and every supermarket has in the meantime soya milk and other products.
I find all which I need on site.
Only now and then I buy something specific.
"Many people overlook that only the finished products are expensive now, but so it also behaves near usual finished products as is generally known".
Anyhow the dressing of veganer courts is by far more favorable and less time-consuming than gemeinhin accepted.
"In the house kitchen it gives to discover a lot, with a few small tricks can one good if results not in part better achieve" Proctor says.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbonic acid instead of egg, with his veganen cheesecakes could bring also his parents-in-law to Proctor to the astonishment.
The Veganer gives a new spice to family celebrations.
That has dynamics, if one cooks together, that has a new significance.
"The situations which in this case can arise are as different as the people themselves" are, says Proctor.
Of course skepticism was already evinced for it however.
Does my food not like to you anymore?
"I am supposed to feel now bad because I drink milk"? - with the case of such kinds of questions one must act as Veganer with intuition.
"I do not refuse the people, I am a part of this society Proctor would not like to survive any enclave existence.
And the everyday life world does not appear in a more exact way considered then at all as veganfremd as presumed - and the Veganer not restricted so in the everyday life as gemeinhin accepted.
Also Fast Food is allowed.
There are chips everywhere!
"Many Dönerläden offer Falafel, or now a vegetarian Yufka", Proctor says.
In a pizzeria he switches to paste courts or orders now a pizza without cheeses, everything a question of the habit.
The restaurants appear so slowly on that.
"When I 13 years ago started eating vegan, everything was still much more difficult", the New Zealander can make a development ausfindig: "One must talk to the people, make it attentive on that".
"If sufficient demands come, they are inclined maybe in order to complement the menu" it hopes.
Vegane restaurants develop, as for example the galley into Mannheim or the café Vogelfrei.
Proctor cherishes the wish, that also other restaurants have stood at least a veganes court on the menu.
Basically vegane courts are for all of them there.
Everyone can eat it, they are therefore exactly the opposite of excluding.
"On the other hand meat dishes are excluding, and indeed in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others" Proctor finds.
"If one wants to avoid food scandals, Veganismus is then a secure way to make the biggest part from the beginning impossible", says Proctor.
The purchase of veganer products can be, however, at the beginning a little difficult.
Contain that also into peanuts, in particular when one learns to understand, animal additives as color donors his can, one seems the courage to leave with the compliance of the ethic near so many hurdles and traps quickly.
Not only therefore Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen wrote a book: "Veganissimo - Animal contents materials and their alternatives" explains the many contents materials that Food- however also detergents are buried.
"Little by little one develops a scanner look and white, to which signs and logos one has to pay attention It is" Proctor "to do small steps sometimes better than to conk out or to stumble," white.
The Veganismus, he is an important moral hint that beats onto the consciousness.
Maybe it does completely not manage that one puts aside his habits, however, at least it can teach the consumer to question his habits critically
