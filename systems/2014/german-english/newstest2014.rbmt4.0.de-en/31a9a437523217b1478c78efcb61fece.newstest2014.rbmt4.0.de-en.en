Foreign employees with 457-visas could be subjected „to genuineness test"
The government thinks within the framework of broadened measures about a „genuineness test" for foreign employees with 457-visa.
The test should be introduced, it would be used about a criterion that is supposed to prevent that that is used 457 for the occupation of unqualified jobs or as a back door for the Zuzug of family and friends to Australia.
Today a discussion proposal of the government was published after the former representative of the lab-party, Maxine McKew, had condemned the comments of the government with regard to foreign employees because these of the neighbors of Australia could be understood as an insult.
„Loud declarations as ,Ausländer are supposed 'to act behind‘ and 'stop ,Australier first‘ is a very unpleasant relapse into times in which trade unions demanded a protected labor market", she told the Australia India institutes today.
Historically considers was said that, that white workers should be protected – and if some vernähmen a reverberation of this historical artifact in the region that would not surprise me.
The discussion proposal outlines twelve measures which once were thought by the former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration minister Brendan O'Connor who yesterday stayed to conversations about human being smuggling in Sri Lanka transformed five of the recommended changes, the others are still considered.
If the „genuineness criterion" is taken over, somebody that applies for a visa could be checked then in such a way, whether „the request is really in the cases, in those of the proposers in a related way or personally united with the holder or a relevant person of the supporting enterprise is."
Companies could in addition be obliged to put aside account for the number of the 457 visa holders after finally in the past enterprises which first of all wanted to support only a small number of workers employed hundreds.
Meanwhile a 35-year old Sri Lankan asylum-seeker died presumably of a heart attack after it had arrived this week with a refugee boat on the Christmas Island.
The verstörte nine year old son of the man who had come to Australia with it is looked after by a grown-up cousin who was also on the boat since the death of his father on Wednesday.
Australian authorities brought the man into the Christmas Island Hospital where he died.
