Supreme Court confirms Obamas health law
It is a great victory for the government Obama: The US American Supreme Court decided today that the health law closely associated with Barack Obama is constitutional.
With five to four voices the judges judged, that the single mandate of the patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – it forces US American citizens to finish a health insurance to 2014 or to pay a punishment – within the framework of the tax authority of the state is constitutional.
The uppermost judge John Roberts beat himself onto the page of the four more liberal members of the chamber, during the judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy on the other hand decided.
The court confirmed also the remaining sections of the law containing 2700 pages and in addition represented the opinion the handicap of the health law according to which Federal states would have to broaden the access assumptions for Medicaid either or otherwise all state Medicaid-promotions would be deleted is not unconstitutionally restricting.
The complaint procedure against the law had been exerted by 26 Federal states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law had been refused by all leading republican premiership candidates including the final challenger Mitt Romney, in the preselection fight 2012 decisively.
