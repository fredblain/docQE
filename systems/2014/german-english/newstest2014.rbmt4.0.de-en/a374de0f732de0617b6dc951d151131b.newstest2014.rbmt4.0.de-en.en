New anti-nicotine-vaccine could do the Garaus to the pleasure with the case of the smoking
Scientists developed an anti-nicotine-vaccine which could spoil the fun at the smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could long protect mice against nicotine addiction a life.
For tests at the human being even further attempts are needed which can last still some years, however, professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results are good.
„We are very hopeful, that this kind can help millions of smokers that attempted to stop and in this case all methods available on the market tried out, but that had to experience that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches from vaccinating-strategy once", so Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus which was changed so that it contains the genetic information on the production of nicotine-antibodies.
The virus infects selectively the liver cells which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize it before they reach the brain through which a smoker does not find out any Nikotin-High.
In attempts vaccinated mice to which nicotine was given retained their normal activity level.
Mice without inoculation on the other hand would have taken a „time-out", declared the researchers, a sign, for the nicotine reaching their brain.
The experiments are described in the technical journal Science Translational Medicine.
Former tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The inoculations had to be given for the maintaining of the antibody turn-off level so frequently that they were expensive and impractical.
Nevertheless the costs of the new vaccine are probably clearly lower, because it changes liver cells into antibody factories.
As professor Crystal said, a future vaccine could be given to children for people if it is sure before they were tempted to try a cigarette, and prevent so nicotine addiction
It is more probable, however, that smokers would use it in order to stop.
„You know then: If they resume smoke, they do not feel any pleasure anymore in this case because of the nicotine vaccine, and that helps them with putting aside the habit" it explains.
British scientists said, the results are interesting, they warned, however, simultaneously, it even further research is necessary.
