Statute labor animal Airlines raises fees for Handgepäck
Statute labor animal Airlines intends to demand up to 100 United States dollars from passengers who would like to pack hand luggage on their flight.
Statute labor animal Airlines intends, to charge hand luggage and 2 dollars a piece for up to 100 United States dollars for coffee or lemonade even if in the announcement on Wednesday was to read that passengers might keep the whole can.
The new fee is valid for hand luggage in the luggage locker above the seat, small bags under the seat keep on being free.
Statute labor animal declared one calculates 25 United States dollars if the fee in advance is paid and 100 United States dollars with travellers that paid first at the gate.
Statute labor animal speaker cottage O'Malley said, the fee of 100 United States dollars is aimed at persuading travellers to see to the payment previously.
„We would not like to calculate this sum", it declared.
Airlines began in 2008 with demanding fees for the first and second piece of luggage given up.
Passengers that attempted to go around these stuffed therefore so much as possibly into the hand luggage, which results in the consequence that the luggage lockers are frequently full above the seat.
Fees are a possibility to convince passengers of that less to take Bord.
O'Malley said with the case of the new fee it is really not a question of earning money.
It is a question of the most loyal customers of statute labor animal to have expressed clearly that it becomes increasingly heavier to find place in the compartment above the seat.
Passengers do not have to pay that buy your tickets on the web site of the airline.
That means that a passenger may take along a piece of luggage freely from statute labor animal possibly at the gate, the next person, however, must pay 100 dollars for a comparable piece of luggage.
O'Malley declared the web site of statute labor animal and the Check-in-Verfahren would be changed so that the passengers are informed of the fee before they would come to the gate.
The new hand luggage fee of statute labor animal does not come into force before in the summer, there is not an exact date yet.
Passengers swear frequently about baggage surcharges and other fees however, airlines fall back gladly to that.
You argue, that the transportation of the baggage costs money and passengers should pay this service if they wanted it
Many at the rampart Street consider the new baggage fees as signs for the airlines taking enough money in order to cover the costs of air trips after years of the losses.
Most let up to now the fingers of fees however, for Handgepäck.
Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded three years ago as First Fees for hand luggage and later Allegiant Air, also a cheap airman followed.
The single other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, declared the Airline-Berater Jay Sorensen who pursues the addition fees attentively.
He reckoned in a report by December 2011 that the hand luggage fee Spirit is 50 million United States dollars worth annually.
Sorensen that formerly held a leadership position with Midwest Airlines flew recent with Spirit and was curious, what it at the gate would expect, if passengers were confronted with the unusual hand luggage fee of the enterprise.
„The Boarding-process belonged to the smoothest which I experienced in my career in the aviation", he said.
I expected to see tooth crunching and obvious discussions at the gate.
„The airplane was full", it declared, „and the Boarding ran as lubricated."
Statute labor animal follows Spirit also at the 2 dollars which are demanded for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The enterprise declared that passengers who bought lemonade or juice might keep the whole can and coffee is refilled gratis.
Water keeps on being free.
US Airways had attempted in 2008 on a short-term basis to demand money for soft drinks, this made however, seven months later again declining, after passengers had complained and had tightened no other large society
Statute labor animal's step, to raise fees for the hand luggage if passengers do not buy directly near the airline is the recent initiative with which customers are supposed to be directed to the own web site.
Airlines pay online travel agencies as Orbitz 10 to 25 United States dollar per sold ticket.
That provides all societies with a stimulus, to convince passengers of the direct purchase with them instead of above an online travel agency.
Statute labor animal is widest in this field however, gone.
In September the enterprise began with assigning so much Vielfliegermeilen in the case of booking about an online travel agency only still half.
On Wednesday the miles were shortened once again on 25 percent of the flight stretch
An air trip booked with a third provider with statute labor animal above 1000 miles is only another 250 miles to customers worth therefore.
Passengers can reserve also exclusively places during the direct purchase on the web site of statute labor animal.
Statute labor animal has a loyal clientele at his seat in Denver, nevertheless the business shrinks and the enterprise loses money.
The proceeds decreased about 9 percent and the flight capacity shrank just 13 percent in the first quarter as in the financial statement is to read that on Wednesday of the mother company group, Republic Airways holding companies Inc was published..
Republic attempted to get the finances of statute labor animal into the grip within the framework of the sale of the society
