US wants to continue to prosecute Snowden
The US has not changed its position on the former US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden employees.
He will continue to be accused of hacking secret information.
Therefore, it should be a criminal trial in the United States, said the spokeswoman of the US State Department, Jennifer Psaki, in Washington.
The recent statements by Snowden would not change this.
Previously, the German Green politician Hans-Christian Stroebele, after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow calls on the United States, not to threaten him with further punishment.
Psaki stressed that Str√∂beles statements was a parliamentarian and not that of a German government member.
