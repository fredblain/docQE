Schlaflos in New York
On the way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students learned of the Black Forest-Gymnasium, the American city of New York.
After eight hours of flight, it was going to the Brooklyn Bridge, which was to walk to the heart of the city, Manhattan.
There was already a fascinating look at the world-famous skyline, which constitutes a special charm in the evening light.
By the time difference, the students were almost 24 hours on the legs, but in line with the motto "the city is not sleeping," the day was decided in Times Square.
Despite the shutdown on the second day of the Freedom statue was achieved with a ferry and climbed on foot.
Then it went through the financial center to Wall Street to the memorial of 11 September.
On the third day, the students were from 373 metres high viewing platform of the Empire State Buildings-gain an overview of the fascinating large city and enjoy the view.
Then it went through the hectic bustle of the New York streets on the Rockefeller Center, Central Park, which was an ideal opportunity for short stay in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students are now in their host families and experience the school day at the Weymouth High School.
