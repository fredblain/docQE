A car driver was imposed a fine of £ 1000 because he was driving between his legs with up to 210 km/h and a hot drink.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on May 27, with his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree.
After the police had stopped, they discovered the drinks cup between his legs.
Before the District Court of Colchester Howie pled guilty, without the necessary care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month ban.
Howie was also sentenced to pay costs of £ 90 and a victim surcharge of £ 100.
