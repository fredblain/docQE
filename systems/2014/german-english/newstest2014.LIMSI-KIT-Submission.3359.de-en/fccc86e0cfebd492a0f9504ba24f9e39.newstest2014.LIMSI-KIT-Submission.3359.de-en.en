The citizens Pfullendorfs have to adjust to higher electricity costs.
As the business leaders of the municipal works, Jörg-Arne bias, confirmed to the SUEDKURIER, 70-90 euros on a four-person Pfullendorfer family extra costs per year.
The rise in the so-called EEG levy of 5.277 is fundamental to the forthcoming price increase to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This levy will be re-established in October by the four operators of the major electricity roads every year.
They put them out of the Energiewende additional costs that they impose a levy on the price of electricity.
The Stadtwerke Pfullendorf are the last link in the chain.
The Supervisory Board of the energy company was even in its forecasts based on a higher levy as Jörg-Arne bias.
