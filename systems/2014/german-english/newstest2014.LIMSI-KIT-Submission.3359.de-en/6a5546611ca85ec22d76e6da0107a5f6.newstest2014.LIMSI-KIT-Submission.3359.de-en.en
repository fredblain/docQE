With future prospects
Actually, Waltraud Ries lives.
Their house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with greenery, an old trees, nice neighbours, and not too much traffic.
In the city, there are only a few minutes by public transport.
"I hope they are not afraid of spiders?" Asks Waltraud Ries and points to a big spider at the door.
I am looking for a new home for my husband and me for some time.
But you know how difficult it is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not a spider phobia, but the concern, at the age of the many steps to the house and no longer in the apartment, she explained.
Moreover, since a meniscus tears operation, the Mittfünfzigerin have experienced what it means to move with handicap from floor to floor.
Recently published a book of her on ' Glücklich live in old age - Which living form is the best for me? '.
' Our apartment is the best example of what is not in old age, ' she begins to tell.
When she moved more than 20 years ago with her husband in the duplex apartment, it was just a beautiful apartment located in the green.
Today, in his mid-fifties Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it.
But she also knows that she is one of the few people who could deal with the issue of ' living in old age.
Most of it, as long as possible.
They are old, only the other ', says schmunzelnd.
Only when the suffering is great pressure, you are thinking.
' Then it may be too late, " Ries.
In her book, the interior designer 17 residential models for a self-determined living in old age.
' What residential form but one chooses, is always an individual decision, " she explained.
The leading solution exists not for the age.
Even those who can afford the Altersruhesitz in Tuscany or Brittany, should always consider that he could be ill.
And: ' Without good knowledge of the country's language vereinsame in the Dolce Vita, " the specialist book author Aussiedlungs willing to consider.
Among their models are classic models of care, alternative forms of housing, or the pensioners often quoted-WG.
At the age of each has his tics and quirks
' For me, it would be a residential community, but nothing, ' she says with a wink.
Certainly not as a student-WG with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
' In the age you just need his withdrawal rooms ', so Ries.
A senior residential community can still work, the author does not want to exclude.
It must then work differently than in the classical student WG.
And sometimes you want to simply his rest, " she believes.
With this view, it is not, at least in the country's capital alone.
' The most old people in Stuttgart want to stay as long as it is in their own home, is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of the civil service life at the age of the country's capital.
The department advises people around the topic of ' ageing '.
That is why older people would often just inconvenience and restrictions, only to be able to stay in that environment, that is the experience of the Stiftung Warentest.
There are many ways to make the house or apartment barrier-free.
Ries recommends all dealing with the age of just remodeling their house or apartment, once thoroughly and not just the best craftsmen.
Today, there is also the age fair reconstruction specialists.
Even in the rental apartment is one or the other, and if it is only the Toilettensitzerhöhung, clarifies the interior designer.
But not always the existing apartment can transform age and thus accessible, even if it is so beautiful.
This experience has had to make Waltraud Ries.
Although we could install a stair lift inside the apartment, but the road paved with stairs to the street would be a far greater obstacle.
It will continue until she has found the ideal property for herself and her husband.
Before the move her dread more than before the spider on her front door.
