Local council appreciates sound budget
Whenever it comes to the budget in council meetings, mayor Ralph Gerster, has a good laugh.
The Gemeindesäckl in Wangen stove-Schönach is well stocked and debt already knows the administration since 2005.
The 2012 budget can be booked as an unqualified success in this respect.
This was evident in the presentation of the annual bill for 2012.
As Andrea Roth mouth explained, is the administrative budget of around EUR 7.6 million over a million euros higher than planned.
The surplus of the administrative budget is around one million euros over the approach, with about 1.8 million euros.
Thanks to the surplus mainly higher business tax revenues and the share of the income tax.
The household wealth again was significantly higher than the planned values.
Instead of the planned amounted to EUR 1.5 million in the last year of EUR 2.5 million.
"This is due largely to the higher allocation from the administrative budget," says Roth.
As fewer investments have been made as planned in the 2012 budget, is also the supply of reserves.
Overall, the general reserve could be increased by about 2.1 million euros to a total of 4.9 million euros.
Mayor Ralph Gerster, thanked Roth and her team for their excellent work.
"A work not just shakes" from the sleeve, praised Gerster, with a view to the year.
He and the local councils rejoiced visibly on the good figures.
It may sound paradoxical, but it is precisely these good numbers could soon be citizens dearly.
The good financial position, the community could forgo high rates in the past.
This, in turn, but several times, according to Gerster, subsidies have been cut from the country.
There are conditions for these grants from various compensation.
Among other things, the cities and towns to apply for the grants, certain rates.
"The issue of lifting rates, we have to look at, because in the coming years, investment, for which we would like to support," Gerster, announced in this context.
