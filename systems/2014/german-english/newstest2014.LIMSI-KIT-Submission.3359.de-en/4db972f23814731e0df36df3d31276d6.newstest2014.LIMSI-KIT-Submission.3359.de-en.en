Traffic lights on Dauerrot: on waiting time
Sometimes it is simply not a green light.
The contact loop in the street does not respond, or the light is broken.
What can we do in red?
A stakeholders has waited long enough at a red light and the crossing is free, he can, explains the Stuttgart law lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "motorcycle."
The waiting time but should be "appropriate", which could be interpreted differently from case to case.
Becker recommends imperils at least five minutes before is a functional disruption of traffic lights.
Those who ride despite Rotlichts continues, however, should be aware that an accident caused by the full blame.
Those who are tolerated less than five minutes, may not be long enough, warns Becker and points to a decision of the Hamm.
In the case, had negotiated a driver after about three minutes Dauerrot ignored traffic lights and had to be responsible for a negligent breach of red light.
The traffic light was not broken, but jumped a little later on green.
A driving ban was spared because of the particular situation - but not the fine.
