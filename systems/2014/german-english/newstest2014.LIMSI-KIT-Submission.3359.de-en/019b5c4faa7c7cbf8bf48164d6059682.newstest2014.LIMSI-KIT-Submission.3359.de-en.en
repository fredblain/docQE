Rapist in South Africa: twice life imprisonment
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the offender has been sentenced to two life sentences on Friday.
It reported the broadcaster SABC.
The victim was later died from the effects of severe injuries.
Johannes Qana had been at the beginning of the week of the crime found guilty.
The country has had a horror.
The 21-year-old was raped Anene Booysen in February in an industrial area in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
14 hours, the doctors fought for the survival of the victim, but to no avail.
The sight of young people was so appalling that the carers and nurses needed psychological assistance.
Qana had admitted during the trial, in the Tatnacht with Booysen in a bar.
He also admitted that they have beaten and raped, but he denied being responsible for the death of the girl.
The police initially assumed several offenders, however, dismissed two suspects from detention, because the evidence against them was not adequate.
The prosecutor also said during the trial that she was convinced that Qana at the time of the attack was alone.
