21 years saw Georges Bwelle of his sick father repeatedly lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals, which did not have the resources to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in 1981 in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
First, he had a broken arm, but then formed an inflammation, expanding on his brain, causing a Hämatom that should affect him for the rest of his life.
"There was no neuro-surgeons in Cameroon," says Georges Bwelle.
We would have him released from Cameroon, if we had had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years to accompany his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals to receive the treatment they had to offer.
"It is not easy," commented Bwelle.
You can run at five o 'clock in the morning to leave the house and to the hospital, to be the first one, and it is not first.
There are very many patients.
Indeed, some people die because they have to wait.
The situation has changed little since Bwelles father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for every 5000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
In contrast, the ratio in the United States is a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there was a doctor for them, could not afford most Cameroonians the visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three-quarters of health spending in the country are private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
To see his father and so many of his country people suffer in mature Bwelle decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers have conducted last year 700 free operations.
He himself was a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a nonprofit organization called ASCOVIME travels on weekends in rural areas and free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32000 people.
Almost every Friday, he squeezed and up to 30 people in minibuses and continue with the verschnürten medical equipment on the roof of unbefestigtes terrain to the villages that need help.
Not everything is proceeding smoothly.
More than once they have had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they will be welcomed as heroes: a feast, singing and dancing and the best accommodation, the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a cause for celebration and Bwelle – with his broad smile and his boundless energy – in the joyful celebration.
The next morning, the team then begins with the examination of hundreds of patients.
"Each trip we treat 500 people," says Bwelle.
They come from a 60-kilometre radius around the village – and on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crutches, donated glasses or free birth certificates, a document that is required for the school, but many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team simple operations with local anaesthetic.
The operations are usually in a school, the City Hall or an apartment; after the surgery, the patients and the recreation area in order to make room for the next.
The lighting for the surgery and the Desinfektions equipment is fed by the generator of the group and Bwelle and his volunteers until the early hours on Sunday.
It is an arduous tasks, but the village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated.
"They drum all night, so that we can stay awake and continue our work," says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team goes back to the city, tired but proud of the work done.
The group – a mixture of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – free operations carried out last year, 700 and knows that it is an enormous difference to the people with their work, which helps them.
A man explained that the free operation of a hip break he received enabled him to return to work.
"It changed the future of my family," said the man.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon at the hospital works Bwelle night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job he finanziere 60% of his charitable work, Bwelle; the rest come from private donations.
"I really do not know when he is asleep," says Katie O 'Malley, who participates in the second year at Drexel University in Philadelphia studied medicine and voluntarily in Bwelles group.
He is always either in hospital or is trying to raise money for the organization, so that he can go to these campaigns.
Support for medical and nursing students like O 'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe and Bwelle, this is an opportunity to gain practical experience that they would never get at home.
"We can be in operations, where we help blood abzutupfen or instruments for Bwelle Dr.," says O 'Malley.
That would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
The students pay for their trip to Cameroon usually themselves, often with donated medical equipment.
But once in Yaoundé, Bwelle accommodation, transport and guide.
"He is undoubtedly a hero," says O 'Malley.
He dedicated his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people, knows no boundaries.
For Bwelle is almost no permanent workload.
Others to give to a happier life, and thus to fulfill a promise he made to his father, he has a great deal of pleasure.
"I am so happy when I am doing this work," says Bwelle.
And I am thinking of my father.
I hope he sees what I do.
I do it to make people laugh, and in order to alleviate the pain.
