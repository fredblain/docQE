Security concerns grow in Mozambique in the face of clashes between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputos under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, founder and first president of Mozambique, in a rare public demonstration of peace.
"We want peace, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, leader of an investment company.
They fear for the future of the country has exchanged their clothing business against a T-shirt with the inscription "we demand security" in Portuguese, and on Thursday joined the crowd on the independence square of the capital.
For two weeks, there are almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, which are among the worst battles since the peace agreement, more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, which was initially supported by the white-ruled Rhodesia and later the Apartheits South African government in a bid to destabilise the independent government of the country.
It has become an opposition party after the peace treaty in 1992.
Analysts consider it unlikely that the country back into a full-scale conflict trap, but recent events have alarmed foreign investors and locals.
For the fast-growing economy is a lot at stake, because the discovery of huge gas reserves off the coast and coal camps in the northwest could bring into the country in the next few years, investments of more than $50 billion from companies like Rio Tinto and Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko from the US.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo are blaming each other for the tensions.
Renamo claimed that the government had provoked the recent clashes by attacked on October 17, its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold Renamos.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated when government troops Renamo-bases attacked and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the group, Renamos spokesman told the Financial Times.
The government gives Renamo the blame for the clashes and the organisation accused of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to downplay concerns about instability.
He told AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama himself as a "loser", the "all its remaining forces wants to prove that the government can impose its decisions."
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid a war.
But the concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted as saying that Renamo the peace agreement of 1992.
He told the FT that he had meant that Frelimo no longer respect the agreement.
"Our vision is to resume negotiations and seriously," said Mazanga.
Earlier talks between the parties have contributed little to resolving the tensions that have been fueled by a series of clashes this year.
"Here we have two adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who heads collide," says Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique expert.
None of them is good in bargaining and no one is prepared to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, which is pushing for electoral reforms, has already declared that it will boycott the municipal elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt to ailing movement to obtain concessions and financial incentives from the government.
Renamos electoral successes shrink since 1992, while a new party, which was founded by a former Renamo member Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM), is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claimed that Guebuza – whose resignation, when his second term ends next year, wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He does not want multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace, because he does not want to give up the presidency," Mazanga.
It is unclear what capacity Renamo, but it has made disruptive attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south links.
Most of the fighting took place in the province of Sofala, located a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo in Beira, but use of the port, mining companies like Rio Tinto and Vale for the export of coal.
In June, Rio had announced a month for the use of the railways, after Renamo an attack on the track.
Mazanga responded cautiously to the question of whether Renamo will repeat that threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique," said Mazanga.
The instability have increased the frustration with the government, says Fernando Lima, Head of Media coop, an independent media company, because many people already were concerned about the corruption, the slow progress in the development and a recent wave of kidnapping.
"People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems," he says.
Omar sultans, a protestor, said that people simply wanted stability.
"Not interested in Renamo and Frelimo, they just want to restore peace and usable roads," he said.
