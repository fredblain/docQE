Scientists were able to throw more light on the context in which leaves the tail of a dog with his mood.
Previous research had shown that lucky dogs with the tail to the right wedelten (from the perspective of the dog), while it was the left-hand side in nervous dogs.
But now scientists say that other dogs can these subtle differences and respond to it.
Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist of the University of Trento, said: "in humans is well known that the left and right brain react differently to stimuli, positive or negative emotions."
Here we have tried to look at this in other species.
He also noted that in dogs, just as in humans, the right brain hemisphere is responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings.
To learn more about how dogs on the lateral tail leaves react to their fellows, the researchers monitored the animals, while other dogs these films.
They measured the heart rate of four-legged and analyzed the behavior.
We will probably soon understand why the tail in two moves in the opposite direction
Professor Vallortigara said: "we have shown the dogs films with dogs, either a lifelike version or a silhouette to eliminate ablenkende other aspects, and we have been able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or right."
If the animals looked like a dog's tail otherwise free expression, moved to the right() has seen from the perspective of the wedelnden dog, they remained completely relaxed.
But it was mainly the tail slope to the left (from perspective of the dog wag), their heart rate rose and they saw restless.
According to Professor Vallortigara communicate the dogs not deliberately by these movements.
Rather, he is convinced that the dogs had learned from experience that movements they should worry and when not.
He said: "if you have several encounters with other dogs and a swish with the tail in one direction is linked with friendly behaviour and the right side produces a less friendly behavior, then you react on the basis of this experience."
The researchers say that the findings of dog owners, veterinarians and trainers could lead to a better understanding of the emotions of their animal.
John Bradshaw, an expert on dog behavior and visiting fellow at the Faculty of veterinary medicine at the University of Bristol explained that this was not the first study, which was investigated, both left and right is important for dogs.
Last year there was a team from the University of Lincoln that dogs turn the head to the left, when they see an aggressive dog, and to the right, if it is a happy dog.
In another research work at the University of Victoria in Canada: "dogs tend to go to a robot dog, if his ' tail wag ' on the left and the right not to be restless â€“ just the opposite, as in the Italian study."
According to his statement, the differences could stem from the fact that the dogs in the various studies, the animals in the movies or the robot dogs not interpreted as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help, he said.
"Although there is considerable evidence of many different types of mammals that both halves of the brain are used for different purposes, but many of the details have yet to be determined, and dogs are no exception," says Bradshaw.
Since their behavior but simply put, it will probably not be long before we understand why the tail, sometimes in one, sometimes moving in the opposite direction.
