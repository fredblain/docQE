Snowden could also testify in Russia
The former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could make statements in the US Spähaffäre in his Russian asylum.
Representatives of the federal General State Prosecutor could either ask questions in writing or the 30-year-olds personally in Russia.
It reported the agency Interfax, citing not named circles who are familiar with the situation.
Such a question could be resolved intergovernmental, it said.
A Snowden's departure from Russia is virtually impossible.
In this case, "he loses his refugee status," the agency quoted its source.
Because Germany is an ally of the United States, Snowden threatens the extradition, it said further
