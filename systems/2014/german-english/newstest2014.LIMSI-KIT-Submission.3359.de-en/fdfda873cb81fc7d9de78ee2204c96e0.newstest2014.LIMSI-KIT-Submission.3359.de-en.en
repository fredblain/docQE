Josef Winkler writes for more than 30 years, the plight of his childhood and youth of the soul.
The disasters of his Catholic childhood village - the silence, the tendency to brute force and blunt sexuality, a corner and Freudlosigkeit - has often described the Carinthian poet.
Is the Büchner-laureate primarily as a writer of prose, theater texts are rare in his work.
