Early puberty: grow up faster
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty than their white age, as studies show.
Physical changes mean not directly puberty
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic is a cause of early puberty
The trend toward early puberty is less pronounced in boys
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in children's health and family issues.
A mother should be worried if her daughter at the age of seven or eight years to grow breasts and pubic hair?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics paediatricians Association this week in Orlando, Florida, said the paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz that these early physical changes are relatively normal among American girls and a new standard.
"I spend a lot of time to reassure parents – normally, this is not a sign that is rapidly entering puberty," explained Kaplowitz.
Obvious displays of development, such as growing breasts, shame and Achselhaare and body odor, with girls.
However, there was only a slight shift in the age of the Menarche (first menstrual period) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age at 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
"If the development of breasts begins, it will still take at least two to three years to Menarche," said Kaplowitz, author of the book "early puberty in girls: the essential guide to deal with this problem frequently occurring."
Time is the most accurate test, as puberty progresses.
It is controversial, as indeed is the beginning of puberty, but it is "precocious" when breast augmentation is accompanied by a growth spurt before the age of eight years.
In most cases, the process is slowed down or stalled – something that can closely monitor a pediatrician.
Tests by a Endikronologen displayed so that serious problems such as tumors or cysts can be excluded for faster progress.
There are methods of treatment to delay an early menstruation and another consequence: the premature ageing of the bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and small body grew in adults.
The recommendations for medical or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the speed of development, the growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psycho-social aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious about drugs, but he admits: "the suppression of puberty can mitigate behavior problems and the feelings of girls, unlike their age mates."
The other major problem is understandable: parents simply do not want their young daughters have the period.
"They are concerned about the risk of pregnancy or about how they handle the hygienic side," said Kaplowitz.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter has received her ten days.
Although there were signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
She was scared and excited by the school home because it was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty.
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other food products, chemicals in the environment or the cause of sexual messages in the media.
Young are similar to girls in puberty.
Kaplowitz believes that the most compelling premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported the implementation of a study on girls in 2001 at the age of six to nine years, a link between body fat and entry into puberty.
Other studies support that conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country tend to be African-American and Hispanic girls puberty rather than their white age.
There are various explanations for this.
Globally, an early puberty seems to be influenced by all sorts of things, economic conditions on the climate to the genes.
Another mystery: although the boys face and Schambehaarung earlier grows, the trend towards a full earlier puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference underscored the complexity of the issue.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is even babies and toddlers.
"We need to be careful how we identify the true beginning of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to take advice from their doctor, how they should speak with their child.
"This may mean that you must sooner than expected," advised Kaplowitz.
If we remain quiet, the child usually reacts well.
Girls bloom early, need the insurance, the process is a normal part of life, even if it occurs earlier than expected.
