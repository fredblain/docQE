If Santiago tired of life bowed to sit on the chair, that is when Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman and a character role excellently Janson.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a courageous man who does not give up and, ultimately, through his knowledge and his strength will win the battle against the fish.
