Fancy ice cream that glows in the dark?
A British businessman has developed the first in the dark luminous ice – with the help of jellyfish.
Charlie Francis, the fluorescent properties of marine animals and created a luminous bounties.
The idea came to him after he had read a research work on jellyfish and was able to convince Chinese scientists to produce the luminous protein artificially.
When eating the ice cream reacts with the tongue, making the pH value is raised in the protein and the lights.
Chris explains the ices in response to the heat in the mouth and may shine unto – the more you licks, the lighter it is.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I am Delicious", says: "the product is unbelievable, but still at a very early stage of production, and so you get two grams of 200 pounds."
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue with a neutral pH.
When the mouth warms the protein, the pH value shines and the ice.
We have tested it in recent months, and it seemed to us to bring it to Halloween on the market, because it has this wonderful Leuchteffekt.
It is probably the most expensive ice cream I have ever made, because the Quallenleuchtstoff is four times more expensive than gold.
Each ball costs me about 140 pounds.
But it tastes delicious.
Charming read experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual taste, which include beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his latest creation will be even more ambitious.
He says: "I would like to develop an invisible ice cream."
It is impossible because of the refraction, which is caused by the ice, from which there is ice cream, but I suspect that we will find a way to do it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish, which are artificially produced by Chinese scientists
