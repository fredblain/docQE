Re-released by air rescue service from North Sea oil rig bird rescued
An air rescue service to the coast geflogener bird, which was found on a North Sea oil rig, was released back into nature.
The Wasserralle was flown by a helicopter to Aberdeen, where she was from the Scottish animal welfare organisation SPCA in their rescue centre in Alloa aufgep√§ppelt last month.
Colin Seddon, director of the centre, said: "this Wasserralle was probably a winterlicher migrant from Northern Europe, which was halted by the strong winds over the North Sea."
The exhausted bird apparently sought refuge on the rig.
He added: "he could no longer fly further, which is why we have been contacted with a request for help."
The Wasserralle was fit and healthy for their release.
