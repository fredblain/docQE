The newly designed Opschlag shines with a new cafe.
One that invites you to linger and re-.
One thing that would make the name of the program.
As Déjà Vu is according to a psychological phenomenon, which leads to the feeling of having already experienced or seen a new situation.
In the case of the visit of the cafés in Opschlag in Kleve district town within sight of the Rhine-Waal university must not remain pure déjà vu feeling.
After all, the cafe with the beautiful name exactly the target: a real stay not only intellectually, but always hand repeatedly.
Because it is fun and it is simply beautiful.
A look into the inner life of the Opschlag 8 gives the viewer to a good feeling.
The ultra-modern, but not cool cafe atmosphere looks like a place to feel good.
Here, the team with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Buettner at the top of the guest with a variety of coffee or a cocktail.
There are delicious cakes or individually fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, even before the opening of the charming cafés in Opschlag as restaurateurs made a name: in Kranenburg attributed the "art Lounge".
The move to Kleve in Opschlag hope the likable cafe-lovers more audience.
Not least by the university.
"We do not have a specific target group," said Daniel Buettner.
Instead, the two want to address young students as well as seniors and all age categories.
Speaking of coffee lovers.
The friendly owner couple stands behind the coffee.
The fragrant hot brew itself in different variations.
Expressofan
Daniel Buettner is rather the Expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt cappuccino-drinking.
"A baguette - that is my thing," she tells the NRZ.
Two events there was already in the bright cafe.
Rather, one.
Because the port was more out there - the Café Déjà Vu benefited from it.
But there was also the Ringelnatzabend.
"Beautiful, successful and funny," the two 33-year-olds.
But not everyone's thing.
Perhaps Daniel Buettner is not a real fan of event evenings: "you can do it is not all right."
And with an event, I am only ever, which is also interested in the special event.
That is why events will be the exception rather than with us.
"We want to disrupt the normal operation of as little as possible."
Should read: Déjà Vu also stands for reliability.
In terms of the quality of the products that are offered here, as well as on the team and the beautiful surroundings of the Opschlag in Kleve.
The road that is increasingly becoming a mile gastronomy.
To the delight of many Klever, guests from near and far, and the students who discover the gastro mile and the Café Déjà Vu.
