Concert space in hot temperatures
The Musikverein Hammereisenbach gives a concert on the terrace of the inn.
As a conductor Bianca Willmann highlights at 7.30 p.m., the thermometer shows still 25 degrees.
About 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of Hammricher musicians.
The chairman Manuela Honeck explains the pieces of music.
Honeck thanked everyone in this context, who had helped the first Musikerhock successfully.
