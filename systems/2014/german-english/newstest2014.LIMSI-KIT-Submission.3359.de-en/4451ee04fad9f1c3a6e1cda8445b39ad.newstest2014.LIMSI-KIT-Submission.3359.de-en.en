You could call it the Dostoyevsky in the United States.
Philip K. Dick was a Gottsucher, a meta-physicist, his novels and stories have something serial.
Amazingly the kinship abroad: the sharp eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And so, as M. Fyodor Dostoevsky, with its massive oeuvre as Ergründer and apologist for the Russian soul, read Philip K. Dick as American Prophet, which is quite a bit in his own country.
Some titles are published in the publishing house, certainly one of the Haffmans-cassette with 118 stories sells Zweitausendeins.
Dick explains America - the realm of the stunning technical progress, coupled with paranoia, security madness and the belief to be chosen.
Dick had God's experiences, his late books read like a mixture of the revelation of John and a computer manual.
Perhaps he was crazy, drugs had added to his brain.
He has figured early on that the computers are Divinitäten.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a person from a machine, the creator of his creation.
This is the ' Blade Runner ' problem.
The killing.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories have inspired film regiss exporters like Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
Now this story is particularly significant.
The "minority Report" dates back to 1956, he exudes the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy tribunals.
It is the principle of "pre-crime", "pre-Crime", which is now more or less official doctrine of the White House.
In Dicks world that ours is frightening mutants look to the future - and the police.
"We collect individuals who have violated any law," says the head of the authority.
"We catch them before they can commit a violent crime."
And: "in our society, there is no serious criminals, we have a criminal warehouse full of Pesudoverbrecher." Read.
They assume that bad things happen, and prevent the criminal idea into practice.
Dicks narrative acts as the blueprint for the anti-terror laws and the noise of the NSA eavesdropping.
Anticipation of the attack: that is also Obama's drones philosophy and practice.
But Dicks story is not over yet.
The police chief complained that there is no separation of powers, the military controls the everyday - and what is left of the state.
The monitors will be monitored and transferred to a future crime.
The system is.
It is perfect, but it is lying.
It invents its own conditions.
Mistakes and is not only victims, but builds upon it.
The system creates the danger that it opposed.
Philip K. Dick read is, again, to get closer to the truth.
