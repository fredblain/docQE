Profits at Bombardier to decrease in numbers and supply contracts
The Canadian aerospace and rail manufacturer Bombardier Inc. reported a 15% drop in net profits on Thursday after he was declining orders and deliveries for aircraft in the third quarter and contract problems in the rail sector under pressure.
Bombardier could be based in Montreal, published no flight test data for its new aircraft of the CSeries and gave no new information on whether the aircraft under the ambitious timetable next September in commercial use.
On the Jungfernflug of test aircraft followed one and a half months, so far, only three more starts, which begs the question of whether the test phase is proceeding as planned.
The results were back behind the forecasts and led to a drop of more than eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, on Thursday lowered its rating of "outperform" to "sector perform" in view of the fact that the shares in the next one to two quarters has a limited potential rate.
"Although weaker delivery figures were largely expected on aircraft, but the margins in the development of trans-sports field, we are clearly disappointed," said Doerksen in a customer.
We believe that new orders for the Bombardier CSeries, if the test program is proceeding on the plane.
If no new orders will be announced in the coming months, we expect that the market is more skeptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the aircraft series of CSeries can catapult the company into the lower market segment, which is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was introduced in March, the public and flew for the first time after months of delays in September.
But so far, binding orders for the CSeries with 177 moderate, as potential buyers wait for the results of the flight tests and want to see whether the claims of the company in terms of fuel efficiency and cost-saving potential of the new Düsenverkehrsflugzeugs is correct.
Currently, there are a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
Board Chairman Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will achieve its goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the jets.
The company's management assured on Thursday, in addition to analysts and the media, the program is in the schedule.
"The test aircraft is no longer on the ground than we expected," said Beaudoin during a telephone conference and added that during the lifetime of the aircraft had been ground tests and software updates.
Each manufacturer is planning differently.
We have decided to take a first flight and then attach a review period, what we have done.
This is happening throughout the flight programme.
The second of five test planes will probably start in the next few weeks, the remaining shortly afterwards, it was said by company.
However, analysts remain skeptical that twelve months after the Jungfernflug the first customer is an aircraft of the CSeries.
Bombardier said, check the planning for the commissioning (EIS) and will update them in the next few months.
"The slow progress of the test flight, even if they are obviously Bombardiers internal planning – reinforces our view that the commissioning of the first quarter of 2015," said Doerksen.
In the third quarter coincided with the end on 30 September Bombardiers net profits to $147 million, or 8 cents per share of $172 million, or 9 cents per share in the previous year.

Net orders fell from 83 aircraft on 26.
The contract was the aerospace division was 32.9 billion on September 30 dollars and was unchanged compared to 31 December.
"In the field of aerospace, the results were within the framework of our targets, but the low order intake and the overall market conditions were disappointing," said Beaudoin.
Sales in the aerospace division fell by 13 percent to two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, announced that the turnover has increased in this division by nearly 11 percent to 2.1 billion dollars.
The contract was in the transport sector, on September 30, $32.6 billion and was slightly increased compared to 31 December.
