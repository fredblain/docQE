Even if the SG Achim/Baden for four days is without a victory, the handball-Oberligisten still good mood.
This coach Tomasz Malmon leaves no doubt about that.
All are fully motivated.
Nevertheless, I hope that we will finally win again.
"Because I know no longer, as a victory," Malmon expected a success of his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Although the third league reserve from Fredenbeck currently has no trees uprooted, Malmon in advance warning of the finger.
Many players I myself have trained in the A-youth.
Therefore, they will surely be particularly motivated against their ex-coach.
"It is also to be seen whether then reinforcements from the first," the SG-Coach.
At last, to return to the track, success needs to increase the Malmon team compared to the previous appearances, in any case.
Above all, in the Deckungs work and Umschaltspiel suffered last but enormous.
The chances of recovery must definitely be better.
I therefore hope that, at last, my players during the short break free of the head.
