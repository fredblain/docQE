Jumbo manufacturers argue about seat width in the face of large orders
Between leading aircraft manufacturers, there has been a dispute over the width of seats in economy class on long-haul flights, which set the tone for a bitter clash at the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute revolves around the seat width, the passengers will be offered on long flights in economy class – not always those that most airlines, but the designated area is the key to the effectiveness of claims in the latest aircraft from Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for an industry standard, which requires a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in economy class, but the US Erzrivale Boeing says that this should be decided by the airlines.
The controversy comes at a time when the aircraft are competing to sell even bigger versions of its twin-engine long-range aircraft, and at the event from 17 to 21 November expect record orders.
As the rear of the aircraft, in particular whether there are rows of nine or ten seats – is crucial to the specified economic results, which is to deliver the new "mini-jumbo" design.
Boeing claims its modernized "777X" take 406 people in seats in economy class, which are about 17 inches wide and ten per line.
Airbus says that the competing version of the A350 befördere 350 people in 18 inches wide seats in economy class, and there are nine per line.
Aircraft giants often share blows over technical details through advertisements in the press.
Now, Airbus appealed before the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X with over 100 orders is expected to make the race, directly to the public.
Recently, the company has an ad that could be the start of a new ad war and donors showed a picture in which squeezed three people sitting in a restaurant, and the title: "would you accept that?"
"Boeing proposes long-haul flights in seats that are more than regional turbo-prop aircraft," said Airbus sales chief John Leahy.
In light of changed eating habits, people are thicker, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747, the modern long-distance travel, and the end of the century, the weight of the male average American between 40 and 49 years increased by ten percent, the data from the US Department of Health.
The Taillenumfang of the male average American is in the 21 century, according to US health statistics 100.8 cm.
Airbus says that his rival is a seat concept from the 1950s, when the average body size of the newly getauften "jet Set" was narrow.
It was, Airbus, conducted research that showed that an extra inch (2.54 cm) per seat raises the sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing denies the figures from Airbus to the seat and says it is not at the discretion of the manufacturer to decide how airlines make the balance between air fares and furnishings.
The company also said, according to studies, the experience in the aircraft of more than the seat width.
"It really boils down to give airlines flexibility so that they can do what they think they need to succeed," explains the Flugkabinenexperte Kent Craver of Boeing.
They do not want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, there is more freedom elbows, but for manufacturers, it is increasingly an issue that can affect sales.
Behind the dispute is a race for plane orders with an estimated volume of at least $700 billion at list prices in the coming decades, which could have a lasting impact on the export performance of the US or Europe.
As Reuters reported for the first time in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the dispute over the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficient per seat than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seater Boeing 77-300ER in their latest twin-engine long-haul designs.
Boeing's statements on the results partly depend on the 777X with its ten seats per row is compared with the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased costs per unit are still lower than currently used machines with ten seats per row.
"Boeing therefore squeezes more seats on his plane to make it more competitive for our products," says Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort in European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say, full cabins with ten seats per row with existing 777 indicated that many passengers opted for closer alignment, which could go hand in hand with cheaper air fares.
"Eighteen inch seat width would be great for the passengers, but the reality is that from an economic face from the Airbus is controlled by the threat of the 777," says Mary Kirby, an expert on cabin furnishing, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing offer no seats, but a catalogue of suppliers, from which the airlines can choose.
The world travelers jet sellers even tape measure, for the creation of gherkins in the competition.
Even if they advertise the comfort, but also offer all manufacturers jets with highly condensed form for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers a A350 with zehnsitzigen ranks, but has not yet been sold, according to its own statement.
Until recently, Airbus has stressed the importance of more cabin adaptability and wide seats for some jets in the corridors.
Without the support of the only other major manufacturer of modern jets, experts say that the call for a new industry standard will probably fizzle, but could distract from the wave of 777X-sales.
