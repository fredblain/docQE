Until now, the police inspectorate Kempten can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
The officials were only twice to egg-throwing children who threw them against building facades.
Because the homeowners realized it in time and removed the eggs, will be no material damage.
Furthermore, were also some Sylvester BÃ¶ller detonated in the city, but there is no material damage.
A resident in the Bishop-Freundorfer path reported that his car with Klopapier wrapped and his Radzierblenden were stolen.
Until the arrival of the police, the man has his Radzierblenden, however, all found in the immediate vicinity, which is why the police had no further action.
