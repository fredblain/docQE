Rules on electronic devices on planes will remain in force for now in Australia
Australian airline passengers must continue to switch tablets and smartphones for takeoff and landing, despite efforts in the US to relax the rules for such devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows U.S. airlines to change their targets so that passengers on their devices during critical phases of flight read e-books, videos, or play, provided they are in the "flight mode."
During most of the flight, passengers are already allowed, but there are many people angry that they can't read at the launch and landing their e-books.
Australian companies are watching the decision to implement the US airlines oodles of work, but no immediate plans to change their rules.
The air traffic control authority CASA also declared that they will look at the announcement, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical phases of flight in Australia still apply.
"CASA currently has no specific rules on use of electronic devices on the plane," has been forthcoming on that.
The issue is subject to provisions requiring airlines to maintain security at any time and passengers follow the safety instructions given by the cabin crew.
Virgin has already led to the CASA talks on an extension of use of Wi-Fi-entertainment system on flights and said it was open to changes, but these should be initiated by the legislator.
"We would welcome a review of the authorisation of electronic devices by CASA, because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience, having (wireless entertainment) during the flight," said a spokesman.
Qantas said that it will remain with the current rules until further notice.
"Our current guidelines, electronic equipment at the launch and landing may not be used, and we currently have no plans to change that," the company said.
The FAA rules apply to U.S. airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations, of which passengers can benefit from, and we will certainly look carefully at the FAA's decision and the reasons behind it.
The decision has an impact on U.S. companies vary depending on the age of the fleet.
They must prove that their planes can tolerate radio interference from mobile devices and manuals, training materials, hand luggage-change programs and customer training.
"After an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers using portable, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at every level," the FAA announced.
In rare cases, poor visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to switch off during the landing equipment.
The group also recommended to heavier equipment at takeoff and landing safely under the seat or in the lockers.
