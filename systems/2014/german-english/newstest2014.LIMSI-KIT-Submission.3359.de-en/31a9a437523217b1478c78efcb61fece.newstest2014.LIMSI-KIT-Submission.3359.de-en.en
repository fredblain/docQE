Foreign workers on 457 visas could be subjected to "test" Echtheits
The government thinks under extended measures on a "Echtheits test" for foreign workers on 457 visa.
The test should be introduced, it would be a criterion that is designed to prevent the 457 is used to fill unskilled jobs or as a back door for the migration of family and friends to Australia.
Today a discussion proposal was published by the government, after the former members of the Labor Party, Maxine McKew, had condemned the comments made by the government in terms of foreign workers because they could be perceived as an insult by Australia's neighbours.
"Vocal statements such as ' foreigners should prepare themselves afterwards ' and ' Australians first ' are a very unpleasant throwback at a time when unions demanded a protected labor market," she said of the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, that meant that white labor forces should be protected, and if some people in the region vernähmen an echo of this historic artifact that would not surprise me.
The discussion proposal outlines 12 measures that were once considered by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O 'Connor, who visited yesterday to talk about human trafficking in Sri Lanka has five of the recommended changes, the others will be considered.
If the "Echtheits criterion", then someone who applied for a visa to be checked to see whether "the application is in cases in which the applicants with the owner or a relevant person related to support of the company or in person."
Companies could also be obliged to account for the number of 457 visa-holders, now in the past, companies that have only a small number of workers, eventually hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri lankischer asylum seeker probably died of a heart attack after he arrived this week with a refugee boat at Christmas Island.
The verstörte nine-year-old son of the man, who came to Australia with him, since the death of his father on Wednesday, supervised by an adult cousin, who was also on the boat.
Australian authorities brought the man in the Christmas Island Hospital where he died.
