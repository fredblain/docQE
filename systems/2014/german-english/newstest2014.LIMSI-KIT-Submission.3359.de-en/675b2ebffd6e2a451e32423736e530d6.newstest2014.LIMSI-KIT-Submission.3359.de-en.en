Booming mortgage houses in Singapore, as the crisis has arrived in the middle class
In a pawn shop in the shopping centre in Singapore Bendemeer trades Janani Amirthalinga a golden Armreif, a ring and a pair of earrings, in order to be able to pay the school fees of their daughters.
"My husband and I have just bought a house, because all my money is," says Amirthalinga.
Although they earn every month, 3000 Singapore dollars (about 1730 euros) as administrative assistant and her husband is working, the monthly family income, she explained.
Indeed, the demand in parts of south-east Asia – where household debt is growing – so large that ValueMax, where it has its own exchange, this week became the third pawn shop that is listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
The Verpfänden of jewellery is not just a quick way to get money – 1300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheaply as an unsecured bank loans.
Typically, demand deposit houses in Singapore a year effective interest rate of 17 percent, which is barely above the 15.4 percent, which requires the United Overseas Bank, a local lender, with a branch in the same shopping center.
But mortgage houses offer the advantage that no review of the credit or income evidence is required, which is why loans are faster than at banks.
Why are millions of people in the region to mortgage houses after families feel the pressure of rising living costs and growing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit due to a loose monetary policy in developed economy, families with lower- and middle-income mortgage houses on in order to offset the difference in stotternder economy.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's growing household debt, mainly by rising mortgages, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt in Asia relative to GDP according to the agency.
Malaysia, with 80% of GDP at the top of the list, an increase of 60 percent in 2008.
People economists also worry about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has come out this week just from a technical recession.
On Thursday, the data showed a continuing weakness in exports and a decline in consumer demand.
"In the end, this means that, in the face of rising costs, the people in the middle to lower end (of the income scale) will try to supplement their income, wherever possible," said Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historic highs in gold prices over the past two years have reinforced the trend towards pledging personal items, because the people have the opportunity to turn the jewelry of the family.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the pledged items in the 200 pawn shops in the city state.
People say: "the price of gold looks good, let us pledge grandma's gold chain and bring back next month."
The largest Thai Pfandhausbetreiber, Easy Money, has seen a 20% increase in customers in its stores in recent months.
The growth in the mortgage business is so strong that ValueMax, operator of the branch in Bendemeer and 15 further expansion in Singapore, not only in the neighboring Malaysia – – where the company operates four houses, but also outside Asia, Yeah Lee Ching, business leader of ValueMax.
The company financed with 60 percent of the Singapore 66 million dollars this week with the IPO in Singapore.
While some lenders are due to high interest rates in the crossfire, Yeah explains that deposit houses not only offer cheaper rates than other lenders, but not directly increased the debt.
"Customers finance items that they already have, and treat personal valuables does not increase the Haushaltsverschulung," she explained.
The Pfandleihgeschäft is increasingly socially accepted as a short-term secured funding.
Also, not all people who use pawn shop in financial difficulties.
Rich people come from Singapore in the branches of ValueMax to pledge gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they received up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
To our clients come from every social class.
"This includes wealthy that need to borrow in the short term for a business or an investment, or small businesses, the bottlenecks in the cash flow," says Yeah.
Sometimes they simply need very fast money.
