To hear the guests are mostly fans with their chants.
The South stand, where the most loyal of the loyal - and loudest BVB fans - are, first, exceptionally quiet: no chants, no battle cries.
The podium of the Capo, otherwise coordinates the common spirit, remained vacant.
And the front of the gallery lonely blew a large flag with the inscription "section of the stadium ban."
