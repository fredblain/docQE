Frankfurt parking fees are expected to rise sharply
Parking in Frankfurt could soon be sensitive to more expensive.
The municipality of the city advises this morning on a presentation of Verkehrsdezernent Stefan Majer (Green).
So the parking fees will be increased by 50 percent.
But it should not be raised the prices, but the time interval of Park watches and Parkscheinautomaten from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December must then decide the Councillor assembly.
The retail trade committee of the Chamber of Commerce holds the Frankfurt "is not a good idea."
The possibility of parking directly in front of the business is "a significant advantage for smaller retailers."
Germany's transport Club believes that an increase in two decades is "very appropriate and long overdue."
Public transport will also be more expensive.
