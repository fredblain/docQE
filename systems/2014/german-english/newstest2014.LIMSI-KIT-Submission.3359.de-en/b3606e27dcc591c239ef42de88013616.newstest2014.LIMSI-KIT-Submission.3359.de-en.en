In a speech transmitted by video link on the open-government conference in London, Kerry said: "there is no question, the President and I and others in the government of some of the things that happened almost by autopilot, simply because the ability to do so, even in the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and, of course, goes back to 9/11."
Then he confessed to the first high-ranking member of the US government that the US spying have crossed a line, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said: "in some cases, it is unreasonable to have gone too far."
The President is determined to create clarity and, therefore, a thorough investigation so that no one should feel that the abuse took place.

Kerry, however, insisted that the NSA was a force for good, and saved many lives through its surveillance operations.
He added: "we are dealing with a new world in which people are ready to blow up themselves."
There is a radical extremism in the world, the intent is to kill people attack to blow up and governments.

We have actually prevented aircraft crashes, attacks on buildings and the murder of people, because we have learned in advance of such plans.

He said that the European governments should their people to be honest about the type of spying programs that they themselves for years.
"We can change our monitoring programmes and better protect the rights of Europeans, but they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones to spy," says Murphy.
