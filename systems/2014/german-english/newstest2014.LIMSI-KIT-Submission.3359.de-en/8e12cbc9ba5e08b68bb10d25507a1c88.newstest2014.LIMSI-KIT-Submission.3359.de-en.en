Tourism: descent to the Romans
At around 120 metres below a sewage channel of Cologne from the Roman period.
Anyone who visited Cologne at the cathedral is not over.
About 157 meters above the two towers in the sky and make him the second highest church building in Europe.
But few visitors who see the two slender spires, knowing that there are also under the cathedral to discover a lot.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in Cologne underworld.
Meeting point for the tours is the service centre of Cologne tourism directly at the cathedral.
The tour begins very unspectacular: "we start in the garage," says Schulze.
In the 1970s, the city fathers wanted a fair city car, and that is why there was only by the remnants of the old city wall, which was not too great.
Most users of the car park today therefore also rush past the Roman ruins and their car.
But who is a closer look, discovered in a parking deck D2 separated by metal mesh rods.
To see about five metres high ruins of handtellergroßen stones.
"There are remnants of the Roman city wall, which was built in the second half of the first century A.D.," says Schulze.
Before it goes to the light of day, Schulze leaves the participants on the upper level still take a look at a dark shaft, 15 metres deep.
This is the fountain of the old cathedral, which, unfortunately, is hardly noticed.
Next station of this walk is the Pretorian, and here the participants climb back down into the depths.
We are seeing here is the office of the once-powerful man north of the Alps, the Prätors CCAA.
What does CCAA, would like to know a visitor.
"The acronym stands for" Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium ", which means in plain English as much as" city of Roman law and the city of Agrippinenser, founded under Emperor Claudius in the place of the altar for the Emperor "cult".
And the Pretorian is the former proconsul Palace, the power center of the Roman empire on the Rhine.
From the foyer of the exhibition, a tunnel access to the Roman sewer, which is here to around 120 metres.
"You can walk along a piece along the so-called Cloaca Maxima, if you want," Schulze is encouraging for the guests.
A surprise Schulze has yet.
After he has brought to the cashier the key, he leads the group into a 16-meter walk-shaft.
"We are now in a mikvah, a ritual Jewish bath," he says.
The Jewish community built its bath deep in the soil, in order to get to the groundwater, which was essential for the ritual washing.
To date, at the lower end of the mikvah, whose origins go back to the eighth century, different water levels by changing levels of the Rhine.
The mikvah is part of an archaeological zone at the Town Hall Square, for which the construction work will begin shortly.
Through to completion, but will still take several years.
