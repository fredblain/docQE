George Kerevan: European unbundling gives Scots the choice
A new day, a new horror story to independence.
This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland was required to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the cue for stories about passport checks in Berwick and a secure border with barbed wire along the Hadrianswalls.
In fact, in the Strathclyde template referred to the possible economic benefits that would bring more freedom to travel in the rest of Europe, but this was – according to expectations – no role in the headlines.
No one has mentioned that the EU member states often bent strict rules when it is convenient for them.
As Scotland currently does not belong to the Schengen area, would be the continued disregard for Brussels, only a small concession in exchange for what you really want from the Scots.
So not really a story.
And one that has already happened in the years that it already resembles a fossil, the first time I heard the "independence means passport controls" duck at least 40 years.
This is an interesting interes lost in the constant repetition of this ancient history.
Why should we expect from an independent Scotland that dances to the tune of Europe?
Why the London yoke against the trade from Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: the great plan for the unification of Europe, adopted after the war is faltering.
With the euro crisis, the European project is officially dead.
Throughout the EU, parties are gaining ground, hostile to the EU or the euro as a common currency would throw overboard.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic party, Alternative for Germany, founded this year – nearly five million votes in the Bundestags election in September to acquire and distribute effectively the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There have always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
The current economic crisis is a turning point.
Because of the strict austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, in conjunction with the straitjacket, forced into the national economy by adhering to the single currency, many people believe that the European project has gone too far.
The crisis of the euro has little to do with the fact that national governments create excessive budget deficits – that was the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has its members pinned down on exchange rates, which are beneficial for German exporters, and the German politicians would like.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the local currency is southern Europe with a built-in productivity disadvantage compared to Germany.
The only way is to cut wages and public spending – spurred on by Berlin.
Behind the current budgetary and monetary problems lies a deeper European productivity problem.
As a result of the imposed by Brussels ' green ' energy policies – a code for subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – the European industry compared with the United States twice for electricity and four times for gas.
This is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grange mouth.
All of the world Lohnfestschreibungen protect European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner of cheap US shale gas.
As a result of a revolt, especially in France, the former cheerleader for the EU.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a vehicle that Germany was kept in check and Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
However, Berlin, Paris does not need more than a gateway to political legitimacy, and Europe has imposed its own economic policy, the ailing French economy.
The result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, EU anti-National Front has just won a key by-election, and thus the ruling Socialists in third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France, with 24 percent of the vote – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a split in the right wing would automatically mean benefits for the left.
What makes Le Pen with their newly gained popularity among the white French working class?
She would like to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti-EU currency bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections – and it is very possible – it could for the first time such a block dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point I want to make: in the not too distant future, the growing resentment of the EU and the single currency will come together to the abolition of the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it is something like the "Europe" (sovereign nations), the favored General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies may keep the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect that Britain distanced himself from the project in the hope to curry favour with the US.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific region suggests that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where is Scotland in all this?
We can decide to be a region (ultimately little England).
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including Berlin and Brussels to say what they can hinstecken where.
I suspect that Scotland could go very well in a looser European network, if we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other countries, similar thinking is not a federal Europe of the Nations Group easier.
Otherwise, we should consider Norway and retain our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland – remarkably – the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and has a spectacular majority in 2011 because of the rejection of the proposed (and won) made cuts, which had the Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer, Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to decide now for independence, only to be imposed from Berlin and Brussels austerity.
