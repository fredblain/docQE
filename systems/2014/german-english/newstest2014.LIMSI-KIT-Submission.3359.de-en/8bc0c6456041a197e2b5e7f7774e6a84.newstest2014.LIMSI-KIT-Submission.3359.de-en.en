Germany's largest country church has launched a campaign to promote the profession of the pastor.
Background is a possible shortage of priests: the Evangelical-Lutheran Church country Hanover expects that the number of currently around 1800 Pastor and pastors to current situation will halve by 2030.
The profession is very attractive to young people of today and offer good future prospects, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in conversation with the Protestant press service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the work and day.
With Burfien instructed the country's church, for the first time, a pastor at a place to inspire young people for the study of theology.
Currently choose fewer and fewer young people after graduating to study theology.
Burfien leads the world in the process of secularisation: "God's voice is quiet, loud."
It is marked by great freedom and diversity of the profession.
I am Mr my calendar and my priorities, where it is important to me.
Pastors as pastors could be very close to the people.
They earned as much as teachers and could live well.
Certainly will be paying more in the free economy, but theologians have a secure employer.
This brings the young people of today, it is not just a career, but a meaningful work.
According to the country's church, which includes three-quarters of Lower Saxony, currently around 60 pastors per year in retirement.
At the same time some 40 graduates of theology studies begin their Vikariat.
In sparsely populated and peripheral regions such as the resin, the Emsland or the Wendland could in the future it will be difficult to fill posts.
Among other things, Burfien wants to hold study days for young people and also invite celebrities who have studied theology.
The theology studies offer a broad education.
You can even be federal president.
