Egypt first freely elected president sworn in
Mohamed Morsi sets the presidential oath, but his day of triumph will not mean the end of the political disputes in Egypt.
The Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised a "new Egypt" when he was sworn in as the first freely elected president of the country, and thus the succession of Hosni Mubarak, 16 months earlier had been expelled from office.
With his inauguration before the supreme constitutional court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt's fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He put the oath in front of the 18 judges dressed in black robes of the court, which has its headquarters on the Nile and is based on an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We strive for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," Morsi said at the ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.
"Today the Egyptian people laid the foundation for a new life â€” absolute freedom, a true democracy and stability," said the 60-year-old Morsi, an engineer trained in the US and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that since its founding in 84 years, mostly as an organisation banned by the respective government targeted.
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building, when Morsi arrived shortly after 11.00 a.m. local time in a small car convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered in front of the court to cheer the new president, and, unlike the presidential pomp Mubarak-era was only briefly stopped traffic so that the auto convoy was able to cross the usually bustling street that connects the city centre, with the southern suburbs.
As a uncharismatisches "Ersatzrad" the Brotherhood has mocked his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Freitags speech, in which he presented himself not only as a candidate of the Islamists, but all those who wanted the aspirations of the uprising in 2011 against the authoritarian Mubarak to your destination.
"Egypt is now a civilian, national, constitutional and modern state," said Morsi judges dressed in a blue suit with a red tie in the wood-panelled chamber in which he craftsman sworn in.
Later, Morsi went to the University of Cairo, where he should keep his Antritts speech.
He was officially welcomed by an army band played the national anthem, he was listening to Habachtstellung.
The military leader Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
On his arrival, he was greeted by hundreds of those present in the largest auditorium of the university with chanting "the army and the people are one hand".
The university was built in 1908 as a bastion of secular education in Cairo has developed into a stronghold of Islamist groups of students in the 1970s.
Morsi, on Friday a symbolic oath in Tahrir Square, the birth place of the uprising last year to the end of the authoritarian rule of Mubarak, and he vowed to reclaim presidential powers, the SCAF assumed by the head of state hunted out of office.
But with the divestment of the official oath before the court and not in front of Parliament, as usual, he is pandering to the will of the military, indicating that the power struggle will continue.
Morsi's speech at the Tahrir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
