Halloween 2013: in numbers
When I was a child, Halloween was something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, I grew late and dress up for the neighborhood.
Today, I am more become the Halloween casting.
In the last two years, I have not agreed to distribute sweets from my apartment, and it will probably not do so this year.
But, according to the statistics, I am a black sheep, as Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million, to be precise – to celebrate Halloween this year, a total of $6.9 billion for candy, costumes and decorations, the American Association of retailers (NRF).
One thing that I am every Halloween then again, the trend.
The costumes are about 1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year aufreizende inanimate objects are the rage.
Women need no longer sexy clothes, they can now also tempting food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daft Punk-space men will succeed this year in the Inst Zagreb feeds.
According to Google's most popular costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I suspect that there is nothing wrong with tradition.
Last year we have dressed our dogs and were not alone, to my amazement.
Indeed, Americans spend $330 million this year for costumes from their pets, according to the NRF.
These are a lot of "hot dogs."
As for sweets, we are not squeamish.
Americans will spend this year, 1.9 billion dollars, The Nielsen Company.
Approximately 270 million kilograms of Schokoriegeln, Lutschern, candies and wine gum.
Good news for the US Trade Department 41 million people living with the slogan "trick or Treat" through the quarter.
In fact, we will eat more than 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween buy – and let us not fool ourselves.
The only thing that we do not want to consume, the sugar sweet Candy Corn; nevertheless, 15 million kilograms are sold at Halloween, the National Association of confectionery manufacturer.
These are some nine billion corn grains.
It is a mystery that I could not solve.
Nothing is more than Halloween houses where it is on.
They have great names like "terror Behind the Walls" (which, incidentally, is in a real prison), "howl-O-Scream" and "the House of Shock".
In fact, there are 1200 officially recognized Haunted houses in the United States, the $500 million in revenue, America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photographs, where you are in the pinkelt trousers and friends on Facebook, where you do not get rid of it, and then the guy that says, "a comment like" nice facial expression.
But we finally come to the Kürbissen.
Charlie Brown made us familiar with the Great Pumpkin, when we were children, and the carving a pumpkin lantern is like the gingerbread decorating the Christmas tree – something that we have made from a young age.
Fortunately, the "baby in the pumpkin" trend only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up with the idea that the pumpkin zurechtzuschnitzen and not to sit in it.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million for pumpkins, the US Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lantern, slowly rotting in the front yard, probably dates from Illinois, where this year were harvested pumpkins 245 million kilograms.
If you want to score correctly, please call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and carve something Hübsches from their 921-pound pumpkin.
