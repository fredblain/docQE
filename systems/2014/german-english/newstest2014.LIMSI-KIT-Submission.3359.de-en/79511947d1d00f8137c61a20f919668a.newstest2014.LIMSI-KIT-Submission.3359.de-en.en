Ben Greenman: ten years New York Comedy Festival: the New Yorker
One could say that New York City is the birth place of stand-up comedy in America: nearly one hundred years ago began the Varietekünstler Frank Fay, who worked as a Conférencier at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, so that the right to tell jokes in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, the Fays innovation, as most recently at the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and directed by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the stand-up institution Caro Lines, the festival this year celebrates its tenth anniversary with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters.
"Most of these headliner began at Caro Lines and were always successful, until they were known to act in a club," said Hirsch.
We have designed this festival so that we can continue to work with them.
At this year's event, there are performances of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher as well as "stand Up for Heroes", an annual music and comedy fundraising event for army veterans at Madison Square Garden, among other things, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
The festival has also grown in the world of comedy.
A number of the comedian to take part in the festival this year, have become aware of more unconventional ways, such as example, broadcasts on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll was a sitcom on cable TV (the ironic-schlüpfrige fantasy football series "the League" on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was both "Saturday Night Live" and "parks and Recreation" part of the occupation, although she is best known for their viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedian with distinctive voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, ironic, focused on racial issues Kaumau W. Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
The largest visitor attraction of the festival include an interview: David Steinberg speaks with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but has become a respected television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a television programme entitled ' Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg " in TV land.
The meeting will take place in the middle of the Town Hall in Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry's entire work," said Steinberg.
He told me that if he is here, he will sometimes go through the alley between two buildings and thinks: hey, if I lose all my money, I live here, perhaps.
