Frontier Airlines charges for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to require up to $100 for passengers who want to stow hand luggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $100 for a piece of hand luggage and $2 for coffee or lemonade, even though, in the announcement on Wednesday that passengers should keep the entire box.
The new fee applies to hand luggage in the baggage compartment of the seat, small bags under the seat remain free.
Frontier said it charged $25 if the fee will be paid in advance and $100 for travelers who paid only on the flight.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O 'Malley said the fee of $100 is introducing travelers to move in advance about the payment.
"We do not want to calculate this sum," she said.
Airlines began in 2008, for the first and second to checked baggage fees.
Passengers who tried to circumvent this, therefore, as much as possible, plugged in your hand luggage, which means that the baggage compartments are often overcrowded on the seat.
Fees are a way to encourage passengers to take less on board.
O 'Malley said, the new fee, it is not really about money.
The most loyal customers of Frontier, which would have clearly stated that it will be increasingly difficult to find space in the seat.
Passengers who buy your tickets on the website of the airline, do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger on the flight of Frontier may charge a baggage, but the next person has to pay 100 dollars for a similar piece of luggage.
O 'Malley said, the website of Frontier and the check-in procedures would be changed so that the passengers were informed of the charges before they come to the flight.
The new hand baggage fee of Frontier is only in the summer, we do not yet have an exact date.
Passengers often grumble at baggage charges and other fees, but airlines like to fall back on.
They argue that the transportation of baggage cost money and passengers should pay for this service if they wanted it.
Many on Wall Street, the new baggage fees as a sign that the airlines take enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Most so far, however, the fingers of charges for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded three years ago, the first to charge for hand luggage and later, Allegiant Air, a low-cost carriers.
The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, the airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely followed the extra charges.
He estimated in a report in December 2011 that the Spirit hand luggage fee $50 million a year equals.
Sorensen, who previously held a leadership position in Midwest Airlines, recently flown with Spirit and was curious what would happen to him on the flight, if passengers were faced with the unusual hand baggage fee of the company.
"The boarding process was one of the smoothly I have experienced in my career in aviation," he said.
I expected to see gnashing and handgreifliche discussions on the flight.
"The plane was full," he said, "and the boarding ran as lubricated."
Frontier spirit is also $2 for coffee, tea, soda or juice.
The company said that passengers who bought lemonade or juice, are likely to keep the whole box and free coffee will be added.
Water is still free.
US Airways had briefly tried in 2008 to ask for Erfrischungs drinks money, but that was seven months later, after passengers complained and had no other large company adjusted.
Frontiers move to charge for hand luggage when passengers do not buy directly from the airline, is the latest initiative to customers on its own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies like Orbitz 10 to 25 U.S. dollars per verkauftem ticket.
It provides all companies an incentive to get passengers to direct purchase with them via an online travel agency.
Frontier is, however, most in this area.
In September, the company started, when booking through an online travel agency only half as many frequent flyer miles.
On Wednesday the miles were again cut to 25 percent of the flight.
A flight booked with a third party with Frontier brings more than 1000 miles customers therefore only 250 miles.
Passengers can also book exclusively with direct purchase on the website of Frontier.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in Denver, but the business is shrinking and the company is losing money.
The revenue fell by 9 percent and passenger capacity fell nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, as it is to read in the financial report published on Wednesday by the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic has tried to get the finances of Frontier under control within the framework of the sale of the company.
