Land Rover Rally Series announced
The interior contains Rennsitze and six-point belts and a Freisprechanlage.
The options range from enhanced brakes, a package of services with support from Bowler Works-mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, business manager of Bowler Motorsport, said: "the Rally customers who come to Bowler, have changed."
They are not all experienced cyclists, but people who are looking for excitement and adventure, as well as for an achievable path to world-class events.
We are pleased to open this road in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens up new opportunities to experience the various Rally-disciplines in the UK and abroad, and newcomers to the rigours and prepare for the reality of Rally Raid.
We had really fun to develop the Defender Challenge car â€“ it will be an entertaining championship.
In addition, there is a training and test in February and the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East in the Defender Challenge.
