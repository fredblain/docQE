Intelligence whistleblower Edward Snowden is basically ready to talk with the German authorities.
First, he wants to know, however, clarified his situation.
This has made it clear to the United States wanted former NSA employees in a letter addressed to the Green politician Hans-Christian Stroebele, published on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and federal government, parliament and General Confederation, a lawyer.
The letter, according to a translation of widespread Stroebele reads as follows:
The officials
I have been asked to write to you regarding your inquiry to mass surveillance.
My name is Joseph Edward Snowden and was contractually or via a direct job as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
In the course of my employment in these institutions, I witnessed systematic violations of law by my government, which led me from a moral duty to act.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I felt I faced a serious and persistent propaganda which forced me to leave my family and my home.
Now I live in exile and enjoy temporary asylum, which gives me the Russian Federation in accordance with international law.
I am encouraged by the response to my political action, both in the United States and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world, and also high officials - including the United States - have the revelations to a system of mass surveillance, which is answerable to, as a service to the public.
The spying revelations attracted many proposals for new laws and directives, which were aimed at the previously hidden abuse of public trust.
The benefits to society from these findings is becoming clearer; at the same time, the risks in visibly reduced.
Although the result of my efforts was demonstrably positive, my government treated dissent remains as fidelity and seeks to criminalise political freedom of expression and should be indicted.
However, the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the government of the United States will drop this damaging attitude with the support of the international community.
I hope that, if the difficulties are resolved this humanitarian situation, I will be able to participate in the responsibility of a full investigation of the facts relating to the media statements, particularly in terms of truth and authenticity of the reports, appropriately and in accordance with law.
I am looking forward to a conversation with you in your country, once the situation is clarified, and I thank you for your efforts to maintain the international law that protects us all.
