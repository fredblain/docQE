Anger over sentence for bombers in Bali
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died in 2002 at the bomb attack in Bali, reacted angrily at the verdict on the last of the instigator, who was brought to court, as Umar Patek should be summarily executed in their opinion.
Patek, who was nearly ten years as one of the most wanted persons in Southeast Asia in flight, was yesterday for his role in the construction of explosives for the bombing sentenced to a prison sentence of 20 years.
With criminal suspension, he could be released after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder because of the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many more were injured.
A guilty verdict was also in a number of terrorism-related charges, including a wave of bomb attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecution had demanded a life sentence, even though they can apply for the man who, because of his reputation as meisterlicher bomb builders as "Demolition Man," the death penalty.
The decision was painful memories in June Corteen, a mother from Perth, the 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Patek and his Mitverschwörern almost ten years ago.
Fighting back tears, she said Patek was to be sentenced to death.
I really think that he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
"We should put him in front of a Erschießungs command," said Corteen to AAP.
I have to live with that every day that I will receive no further grandchildren and I will never see my daughters.
The Sari Club was razed to the ground, on 12 October 2002, shortly after 11.00 p.m., a powerful bomb exploded in a small truck was parked in front of the nightclub.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar, where only 20 seconds earlier to explode a suicide bombers a backpack filled with explosives.
He fell after the attack a month into a coma and died " three times, while he hung on a Lebenserhaltungssystem.
Hughes said that Patek was deserves the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah, Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra, who were responsible for the massacre and were executed four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty before anyone else.
Let him alive – no, there is no reason to leave him alive.
To get 20 years after he killed 202 people and injured hundreds, is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers, who was in court.
He cheated nearly a decade of arrest, but was finally picked up in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US forces nearly four months later killed the former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden.
During the negotiation of an FBI agent said that intelligence reports had provided to point out that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden, with the aim to rebuild the connection between the Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
"He did not," said Corteen.
Until recently, he has shown no remorse for how much pain he has inflicted on other people.
The verdict came before the 10-year anniversary of the attack this year, with commemorations in Bali and Australia.
"This year there will be many tears," said Corteen.
Patek can still appeal against his sentence.
