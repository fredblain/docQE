Parents of a teenager from Georgia, who died in tragic accident, believe in murder
The parents of teenager whose body was found in a zusammengerollten Ringermatte in the gym of his high school, are convinced that their son was murdered, the lawyer's family said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the US federal state of Georgia was found on 11 January in a mat set upright behind the gallery in the school gym.
The investigation officers of the Sheriff of Lowndes County came to the conclusion that Johnson died in a tragic accident, as both the family of the 17-year-olds, however.
"They are convinced that their son was murdered," said Benjamin Crump, the lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, to FoxNews.com.
They would never have believed that he had died as they follow the sheriff.
"They are of the opinion that it has no logic, against the laws of physics, as well as breach of common sense," says Crump.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth will be covered up in order to protect the person or persons who are responsible for the death of her son.
"Her son went to school to learn and came back in the bag," he commented.
US state lawyer Michael Moore said on Thursday that there will be a formal investigation into the death of Johnsons, since a number of important issues are still unresolved.
What was the cause of death?
His death is due to a crime?
The Moore said at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts, in which direction they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe that there is a sufficient basis for a formal investigation," he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy sent out that Johnson had died from the effects of "Positions-related asphyxiation."
A second autopsy, however, have a different cause of death, Moore.
"There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if there is sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation into the death of Johnsons, he will instruct the FBI with the conduct of the investigation.
A representative of the Office of County sheriff was at our request on Thursday did not immediately available to comment.
A court ordered the South Georgias on Wednesday that the authorities need to release surveillance videos that have reviewed the investigators.
The parents of teenagers said they hoped that the video evidence that he had died.
