Rangnick-bashing for Schiris: no Swallows Mane King
So satisfied Ralf Rangnick with the current high form of federal league tables leader Red Bull Salzburg is also disappointed with the sports director of "cops" by implementing the judges.
"There is currently a dangerous tendency that Mane and Alan are pushed into the category of swallows kings," he took the two Offensivwirbler on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg.
Recent occasion for Rangnicks criticism was yellow for Mane at 3-0 against Grödig last Sunday, in which the Senegalese was an alleged acting fatal - but it was not, as the TV images showed.
"A wrong decision," said Rangnick, implementing Harkam judges described as "completely overwhelmed."
Harkam would also have "its part" to the escalation between Salzburg coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig trainer Adi Hütter after the game.
His German Lands man he defended resolutely: "because I would behave in every situation as Roger Schmidt."
Schmidt himself wants to have had no contact with his colleague after skirmishes with Hütter.
I do not know why.
"Because I am the one who was insulted," said the 46-year-old.
Given the success run was Rangnick but praise anthem.
"There are only two words:" well, he noted.
There is not much.
Above all, the way the team plays is impressive.
This should continue.
There will be little squad changes during the winter transfer period.
There is no great reason to change anything.
"Except for a player with the desire that he wants to leave the club," said Rangnick.
