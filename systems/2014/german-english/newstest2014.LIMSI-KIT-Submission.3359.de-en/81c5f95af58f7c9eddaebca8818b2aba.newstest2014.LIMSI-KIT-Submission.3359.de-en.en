RBS suspended two currency traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department, two people who are familiar with the situation; this is another sign that the world's official investigation into the alleged manipulation in the currency market exploded.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they are cooperating with the authorities in the investigation into the world's largest financial market, the daily $5.3 trillion to the owner.
The two dealers would be the first RBS staff who have been suspended in the widening investigation of the scandal surrounding the Libor interbank business.
The bank made no comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received information requests from authorities.
"Our investigations into this matter will continue and we are cooperating fully with the FCA and other regulatory authorities," said the bank two weeks ago.
Last month, the situation suggests that the RBS the records of e-mails and instant messages, and were sent to a former trader, forwarded to the British supervisory authority, the Financial Conduct Authority.
The dealer, Richard Usher, had left the RBS in 2010 and is now in its current position as a European head of forex spot trading at JPMorgan beurlaubt.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of the European spot trading at Citi, was suspended this week beurlaubt and Matt Gardiner, formerly a senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was this week at Standard Chartered.
None of these traders has been accused of any wrongdoing.
The instant message group of Usher were bankers at Barclays and Citigroup, said the situation close to people.
This week, UBS announced that it had taken steps against some of its staff, after the Swiss regulatory authority Finma had declared that they will examine the alleged manipulation of the foreign exchange market in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities around the world – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – currently deal with allegations that bankers have agreed on the currency market transactions.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or receive information requests from authorities, said familiar with the situation.
Banks debris instant messages and e-mails from several years in search of cases of misconduct.
The news of these investigations, the dealer in one area into turmoil, which belongs to one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks in recent years, but this year was under pressure because of low volatility in currencies restricts the opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair and said that it was almost impossible to manipulate the extensive and highly liquid currency market, but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true.
A leading dealers noted that despite the enormous daily volume in foreign exchange trading the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the increasing use of internal platforms by banks means that "one with very low ticket prices can have an impact on the market."
The news came out on the same day, when Credit Suisse announced that it had terminated this week, a distributor of London Exchange Traded Funds offices, after he had caused a loss of nearly six million dollars at the end of last year.
The bank promptly informed the relevant authorities and is cooperating with them.
"We are sure that the trader acted alone and that the matter is under control," said Credit Suisse.
