Because of suggestions from the population should be cut on this day in the area of the hut, the view of the valley, said Mayor Helmut Kaiser.
Many hikers, known as Kaiser, this area as the gem of the Schluchtensteigs, where the landscape offers the ideal setting for wonderful views.
He thanked the audience for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the Pflegetag is an appropriate instrument to strengthen the connection between man and nature.
He offers every citizen the opportunity to put themselves in nature.
At the same time, with the tourist aspect of ecological consideration.
This ecological aspect explained Friederike Tribukait by the Department of Conservation Freiburg governmental Bureau following the welcome by Governor Tilman Bollacher, who had sponsored and wished the action of a good luck.
The tourist destination of foresight, according to Tribukait with the aim of preserving the now heavily zugewachsene old Allmendweidfeld with its specific protected life room types by opening and connection to the pastures.
Certain species such as rare butterflies and grasshoppers cannot overcome barriers in the form of forests.
They need these free links to conservation.
Tribukait said that it would not fail to take up the cudgels for the planned biosphere.
Add to this planning is not only the current measure.
A biosphere area also offers the chance to sustainable economic as ecological development on the basis of the internationally recognised Unesco status and thus a continuous supplement to the existing nursing days with the Life project, as well as the achievements in the future.
After these different versions shared district director Christoph Wehle and Life project manager Cornelia Bischoff helpers in groups.
The larger trees had already been beaten in the run-up to the forestry tractors, if necessary.
A group of volunteers should take care of the exemption from Wacholderb√ºschen and the care of a Trockensteinriegels.
The aim was to look at the viewing point.
