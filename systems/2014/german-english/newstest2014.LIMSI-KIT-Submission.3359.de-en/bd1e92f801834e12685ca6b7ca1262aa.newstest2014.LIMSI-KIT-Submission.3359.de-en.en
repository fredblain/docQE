But now it is good.
She has eaten a couple of dogs.
It was a very unusual.
The fact that the dog was discovered, is unbelievable.
Peter Lau, specialist in the technical rescue team, said: "ruby had a giant luck."
There was a possibility that she was very seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was brought to the veterinarian to investigate, but found nothing except exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West York, said: "watching the rescue was frightening."
I could not believe it was really up there.
It was wonderful to keep them back to the poor.
The vet said that if the exhaustion has become too big and it would have collapsed, it would probably have crashed.
The firefighters have done an outstanding job.
It was really brave, what they have done.
We are just so grateful and every one of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added: "we were afraid that they would fall off, but they remained above."
The firefighters were great.
I can hardly believe, where she was.
