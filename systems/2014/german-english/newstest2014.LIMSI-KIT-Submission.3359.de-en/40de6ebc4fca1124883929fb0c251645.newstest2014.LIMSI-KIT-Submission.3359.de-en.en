Rescue package of 325 million Australian dollars for Tasman Stadsschouwburg health care
The Australian government insists on the harsh conditions that are linked to the rescue package of 325 million Australian dollars for the Tasmanian health care to ensure that the government cannot waste federal state money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take "immediate action" to avert a crisis that has been caused by an aging population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic diseases and system constraints.
The funding for a period of four years was decided after government consultations with the Tasman independent MPs Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has an emergency rescue package that we believe that the unique challenges faced by the federal government," said Plibersek today.
The 325-million-dollar package includes $31 million in emergency aid for election.
Through further 2600 operations, including orthopaedic interventions and treatments for grey Star, residues are to be eliminated.
In addition, there is money for clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better aftercare for inpatient stays, specialist training, services in the field of mental health and the introduction of a system of electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.
"These investments reflect the ideas that have affected hospital staff said that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system," said Tanya Plibersek.
The minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability of the Tasman government duty.
The federal government should maintain the current level of funding in order to be able to receive money from the Commonwealth, and the monthly report on how the extra money has been spent.
A three-member commission will be established and is intended to ensure that the federal state of health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie said today that the 325 million dollars would be of little use if "they are not accompanied by real reforms that bring the Tasmanian public health system to a more sustainable path."
Nevertheless, he praised the government for the fact that they have responded to his request for urgent aid, which he first against the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
"I am confident that the federal aid will be a major contribution to the public health system of the federal state from the list of concerns," said Wilkie.
According to the government of the federal state, these services are election largely offset the recent cuts.
But the health spokesman for the opposition at federal level, Peter Dutton, believes that today's announcement is only a "plaster solution."
"We are in today's situation, because the Labor state government $430 million deducted from the health system," he said to ABC TV.
It is unacceptable that a state government pulls nearly half a billion dollars from the system and the Commonwealth 300 million and then pretend that the good news.
Dutton called Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package will be spent on additional bureaucracy.
