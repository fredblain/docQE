UN announces new breakthroughs in the fight against poverty
The United Nations will begin immediately with the drafting of a new set of goals, with which the Millennium Development Goals announced 12 years ago to combat poverty should be replaced.
In the run-up to the UN summit on sustainable development, which began the evening in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in the push for "sustainable development goals" to replace the expiring in 2015 Millennium Development Goals.
They have been included in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Ms Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon declared the evening at the summit, the time has come, "thinking about the national interests".
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to a process that was agreed with the universal sustainable development objectives," he said.
" These objectives will build on our progress from the millennium development goals and form an integral part of the framework for the development after 2015.
I will spare no effort to me this mandate given by the member states to implement in order to achieve our vision of sustainable development goals, building on the success of the Millennium Goals. "
