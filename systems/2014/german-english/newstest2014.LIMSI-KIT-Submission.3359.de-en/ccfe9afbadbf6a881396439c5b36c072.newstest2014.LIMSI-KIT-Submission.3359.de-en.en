The disposable society does not think.
The night was long, loud music and the mood well, but at some point, it is home.
Only in the bellies of people on the front and rear seat of hunger is apparent.
Clearly, a cocktail or champagne may be responsible for it!
What is more, as gechillt next drive-in to take a bite?
I admit that I am happy with it, if it is late at night or early morning to fast-food fetching.
Some fries, a Coke and a burger - and then as the home and into bed!
But on the way home the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco GÃ¤ngern.
What must be a missing that constant regularity of its fast-food bags from the car window?!
Especially at the weekends are weggeworfene paper bags at the periphery and parking lots.
"Why?", I wonder.
The people are too stupid to take the bags back home or to the nearest dustbin?
It is not just that the paper disfigured the landscape.
Bags have already covered transport facilities such as guard rails and triggered accidents.
So what does this "disposable society" but not, they probably do not even know what the word actually means.
If one is more often, especially with several people in the car, you know how a bank can look after celebrating nights: clothing, bottles and other rubbish are there.
There were a few more or less bags but also nix, in contrast to the street, where nobody wants to eat the remains of other rumtrampeln.
I can already see the day when the cities and towns to dopey removal - and the fast-food chains must demand deposit for their bags.
