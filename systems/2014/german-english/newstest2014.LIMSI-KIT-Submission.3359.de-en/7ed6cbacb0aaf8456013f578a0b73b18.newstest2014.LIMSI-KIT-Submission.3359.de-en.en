Alfred Abel, who currently manages the plot, the Versch√∂nerungs had agreed with his colleague Reinhard Domke of BI.
Before the action of the BI was a banner with the message "we are in favour of it."
That rankled the approximately 20 members of the citizens ' initiative, however, little in their action.
Her motto was on the big poster "we are against Bauruinen."
So they wanted to draw attention to the danger of even greater ruins on the Swiss meadow - the giant project should fail in one day.
In conversation with many passers-by in front of the "construction", it was clear that some people believe that there will be many more with the completion of the project of the city, although many have the same questions to the dimension of the project presented as the BI.
But they are beginning to resign because the city continues to put these answers, it is part of the BI.
