<seg id="1">On the way by mud, rivers and jungles for free medical supply</seg>
<seg id="2">Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical assistance into remote villages in Cameroon</seg>
<seg id="3">Bwelle and its team almost spend each weekend to treat hundreds of patients</seg>
<seg id="4">In the West African country there are not many physicians, only one for 5.000 humans</seg>
<seg id="5">Co-ordinate here or with your Mobil equipment</seg>
<seg id="6">Dr. Georges Bwelle belongs to the Top 10 „the CNN Heroes OF 2013”.</seg>
<seg id="7">They can for it or one of the other heroes in the Top 10 co-ordinate, in order to select it to „the CNN Hero OF the Year”.</seg>
<seg id="8">The winner receives 250,000 dollar for the continuation of his unusual work.</seg>
<seg id="9">Long Georges Bwelle viewed 21 years, how his patient father again and again lost consciousness and to hospitals traveled, which did not have the means, in order to help him.</seg>
<seg id="10">Jamef Bwelle became 1981 with a car accident in close proximity to Yaoundé, which injures capital of Cameroon.</seg>
<seg id="11">First it had only a broken arm, but then formed an inflammation, which expanded on its brain and caused there a hematoma, which should impair it for the rest of his life.</seg>
<seg id="12">„It gave no to neurosurgeons in Cameroon”, thus Georges Bwelle.</seg>
<seg id="13">We would have brought it out from Cameroon, if we had had the money.</seg>
<seg id="14">Instead spent Bwelle years to accompany its father in overcrowded hospitals and hospitals to offer in order to get there the treatment, which they had.</seg>
<seg id="15">„It is not simple”, commentates Bwelle.</seg>
<seg id="16">One can at five o'clock in the morning the house leave and to the hospital run, in order to be first, and is nevertheless not first.</seg>
<seg id="17">There are a great many patients.</seg>
<seg id="18">Some humans die even, because they must wait.</seg>
<seg id="19">The situation hardly changed, since Bwelles father died 2002.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Cameroon there is only one physician for 5,000 humans each, so the World Health Organization.</seg>
<seg id="21">In contrast to this the relationship lies in the United States with a physician for 413 people.</seg>
<seg id="22">But even if there were a physician for it, most Kameruner could not afford the visit.</seg>
<seg id="23">Two of five humans in the country live below the poverty line and almost three-quarter of the expenditures for health in the country are private.</seg>
<seg id="24">„The only problem, which they have, is the poverty”, says Bwelle.</seg>
<seg id="25">And the poverty not possibly makes it to enjoy the life.</seg>
<seg id="26">Its father and so many of its compatriots suffering to see let mature in Bwelle the resolution to undertake somewhat against it.</seg>
<seg id="27">Dr. Georges Bwelle and its volunteer team accomplished 700 free operations in the last year.</seg>
<seg id="28">He became even a physician and works as a container surgeon in the cent ral hospital in Yaoundé.</seg>
<seg id="29">In addition it created a nonprofit organization named ASCOVIME, which travels to weekends to rural areas and offers there free medical supply.</seg>
<seg id="30">Since 2008 it and its volunteer group helped scarcely 32,000 humans.</seg>
<seg id="31">Almost each Friday obligations it and up to 30 people into minibuses and drive themselves with the tied medical equipment on the roof over fastened terrain into the villages, the assistance need.</seg>
<seg id="32">Always everything does not run smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="33">Already more than once they had to push the vehicles by rivers and mud.</seg>
<seg id="34">But if they arrive, they are received like heroes: a feast, a singing and dance and the best accommodation, which the place has to offer.</seg>
<seg id="35">In these villages free medical supply is real a reason to celebrating and Bwelle – with its broad smile and its boundless energy – participates gladly with the merry celebration.</seg>
<seg id="36">On the next morning the team begins then with the investigation of hundreds of patients.</seg>
<seg id="37">„Pro trip we treat 500 people”, thus Bwelle.</seg>
<seg id="38">They come from an area of 60 kilometers around the village – and to foot.</seg>
<seg id="39">Each of these weekend hospitals offers medical supply in a set of ranges.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many people are treated because of malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasite and sexual transferable diseases.</seg>
<seg id="41">Others receive sprags, donated glasses or free birth certificates – a document, which is necessary for the school, however many poor families simply not to afford know.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the evening the team implements simple operations with local anaesthetization.</seg>
<seg id="43">The operations normally take place in a school, the city hall or a apartment; after the interference the patients rise and go into the recovery range, around place making for the next one.</seg>
<seg id="44">The lighting for the OI and the disinfection equipment fed of the generator of the group and in such a way to work Bwelle and its volunteers into the early morning hours on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="45">It is a arduous workload, but the village musicians normally help to keep the team motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">„You drum the whole night, with it we to remain awake and our work to continue be able”, say Bwelle.</seg>
<seg id="47">On Sunday the team drives then back into the city, tiredly, but proudly on the performed work.</seg>
<seg id="48">The group – a mixture from Cameroonian physicians and foreign medical students – accomplished and knows 700 free operations in the last year that it causes an enormous difference for humans, who she helps with her work.</seg>
<seg id="49">A man explained that the free operation of a ledge break, which it received makes possible for him now to work again.</seg>
<seg id="50">„The future of my family changes”, meant the man.</seg>
<seg id="51">Beside the weekend hospitals and its work as a surgeon in the hospital Bwelle works also at night in private hospitals in Yaoundé.</seg>
<seg id="52">With this second job of financiers it 60% of its non-profit activity, so Bwelle; the rest originates from private donations.</seg>
<seg id="53">„I do not know really, when he sleeps, says” Katie O'Malley, which studies in the second year to the Drexel University in Philadelphia medicine and voluntarily in Bwelles group cooperates.</seg>
<seg id="54">It always either in the hospital or tried is to raise money for the organization so that it can go on these campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="55">For medicine and nursing for the sick students such as O'Malley, which come from the USA and Europe and support Bwelle, this is an opportunity to gain practical experiences which were never gotten it at home.</seg>
<seg id="56">„We can be with operations thereby, where we help, blood to dab or the instruments for Dr. Bwelle hold”, explain O'Malley.</seg>
<seg id="57">That would be in America as a medical student in the second year never possible.</seg>
<seg id="58">The students normally pay their travel to Cameroon and bring along frequently donated medical material.</seg>
<seg id="59">If they are however for a start in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over the accommodation, transport and the instruction.</seg>
<seg id="60">„He is completely certainly a hero”, says O'Malley.</seg>
<seg id="61">He does not dedicate his life to this organization and its desire to help the Cameroonian people knows borders.</seg>
<seg id="62">For Bwelle the almost constant work is not a load.</seg>
<seg id="63">Other to a happier life to help and thus a promise fulfill, which it gave to its father, prepares large joy for it.</seg>
<seg id="64">„I am so happy, if I make, mean this work” for Bwelle.</seg>
<seg id="65">And I think of my father.</seg>
<seg id="66">I hope, he see, what I do.</seg>
<seg id="67">I make it, in order to bring humans back the laughter and alleviate around the pain.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pope Franziskus appoints first cardinals in February</seg>
<seg id="2">Pope Franziskus will appoint new cardinals of the catholic church for the first time on 22 February, as Vatican announced on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Cardinals are the highest-ranking clerics in the catholic church after the Pope and them are it also, which select a Pope, so that Franziskus thereby will appoint the first group of men, who will finally participate in the choice of its successor.</seg>
<seg id="4">At present there are 201 cardinals.</seg>
<seg id="5">However a cardinal, who reached an age of 80 years, can do no more at the Papal election participates – is assigned to a group of 120 „cardinals entitled to vote”.</seg>
<seg id="6">In an explanation, in which the message was announced, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman of Vatican said, it a meeting of all cardinals will take place, before the ceremony is held for the appointment of the new cardinals, which admits also as consistory is.</seg>
<seg id="7">„Pope Franziskus decided, his decision for the summoning of the consistory in February in advance admits to be given, thus different meetings, which require the participation of cardinals from all over the world, be planned can”, said Lombardi.</seg>
<seg id="8">Jack Valero von Catholic Voices said that the number of the cardinals entitled to vote will have probably sunk until February.</seg>
<seg id="9">He explained, a Pope normally appoints so many cardinals as necessary, so that the number of the cardinals entitled to vote amounted to again 120, and so many cardinals over 80, as he would like.</seg>
<seg id="10">The consistory in the next year is important, because it is first since the choice of Franziskus in March this year, like that Valero.</seg>
<seg id="11">At present give it a certain overhang to up sides of Europe and in particular Italy.</seg>
<seg id="12">„It will see being interesting, whether the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world, around the balance to restore”, said it.</seg>
<seg id="13">Forty percent of the catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.</seg>
<seg id="14">The cardinals will be also first, who will appoint since the education of the advice of the cardinals created by Franziskus, a group of eight cardinals from around the world, who have the order to find possibilities for the reformation of the church.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the past the Pope decided everything alone.</seg>
<seg id="16">„Now Franziskus selected these eight cardinals, who are to help him”, said Valero.</seg>
<seg id="17">He explained, it was well possible „” that Franziskus asks the cardinals for advice.</seg>
<seg id="18">But so far we were not in this situation – that is completely new everything.</seg>
<seg id="19">Valero said that typically the bishops from large places would appoint as cardinals, but does not put Franziskus „full surprises – we know thus not, whom he appoints”.</seg>

<seg id="2">Business for Britain was started in April with the intention of bringing and of defining the economy to a table, what those, which provide in Great Britain for prosperity and work, would like to change in our relations with the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="3">For this purpose we gave the largest and most comprehensive survey under British industrial leaders in order and asked them, what them over Great Britain, which think economy and the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="4">YouGov asked over 1.000 executive personnel from the economy, who into for instance the British business sizes, - sectors and regions illustrate.</seg>
<seg id="5">The results of the survey will surprise many.</seg>
<seg id="6">We found out that the vast majority of the enterprises concentrates in the meantime outside of Europe exported and on countries, which modernize and grow, while the states in the European Union stagnate.</seg>
<seg id="7">They desire that from government side new business connections with countries such as China, India and Brazil are favored, to reform instead of be with the long and arduous process, the obscure European Union-institutions.</seg>
<seg id="8">For their opinion to certain legally regulated topics – from the cartel law to the product legislation – the majority of the industrial leaders of the opinion, control of these key competencies is in demand should for Westminster be brought back.</seg>
<seg id="9">It prevailed general discontent over the domestic market, since according to statement of the enterprises the costs of the Brussels regulations would outweigh in the meantime the advantages, to part from of Europe trade zone to be – even 40 percent of the large-scale enterprises agreed, which are traditionally Europeanfriendliest.</seg>
<seg id="10">Finally, and our questioning probably says from industrial leaders at most, showed that a clear majority desires of Great Britain a course toward change of the agreement and a relationship with the European Union, which is based on trade not on politics.</seg>
<seg id="11">This realization, which is at enterprises of all sizes and prominent companies, shows that the economy pushes meaningful change”, which brings the booklet of acting back to Great Britain on one „.</seg>
<seg id="12">It concerns – a change of the agreement much and improves conditions for Great Britain with 16 percent to a shift of opinion in favor of the whereabouts in the European Union in a popular vote would lead.</seg>
<seg id="13">The prime minister should not have doubts: This survey shows that the British economy behind its plan for the renegotiations of the British conditions stands for the EU membership.</seg>
<seg id="14">It shows also that the enterprises of a renegotiation expect a clear shift of the balance of power back to Great Britain.</seg>
<seg id="15">Better deals for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary, after the euro zone moves now toward a closer economic and fiscal union.</seg>
<seg id="16">The priority jobs and growth must be in Great Britain, as the result of our survey shows, what for enterprise an intensified attention to trade and a fundamental change in Brussels approach for regulations means.</seg>

<seg id="20">If the pedestrian presses the traffic light button, the upper radar detector the traffic conditions test.</seg>
<seg id="21">If the road is free, directly green comes for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="22">A further radar detector checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be terminated.</seg>
<seg id="23">“A group should or go-obstructed humans over the road to go, the green phase is extended, it comes thus everyone reliably over the lane”, explained Arnold.</seg>

<seg id="1">Halloween 2013: In figures</seg>
<seg id="2">When I was small, Halloween had somewhat magic.</seg>
<seg id="3">My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, stay up late and to disguise us for the neighbourhood.</seg>
<seg id="4">Today I became rather the Halloween Muffel.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the last two years I did not explain myself ready to distribute from my apartment from sweets and it this year will probably not do.</seg>
<seg id="6">But according to statistics I am a black sheep, which concerns Halloween.</seg>
<seg id="7">The majority of the Americans – 158 million, in order to be exact – celebrate this year Halloween and spend thereby altogether 6.9 billion US Dollar on sweets, costumes and decorations, so the US-American federation of the retailers (NRF).</seg>
<seg id="8">A thing, to which I look forward each Halloween then nevertheless again, are the trend values.</seg>
<seg id="9">The costumes will constitute about 1.2 billion of the 6.9 billion spent US Dollar, so the NRF.</seg>
<seg id="10">In this year are tantalizing dead articles the last word.</seg>
<seg id="11">Women do not have to wrap themselves no more in sexy clothes, them can now also seductive meal as for instance pizza, a Hamburger or carrots embody.</seg>
<seg id="12">Which concerns men, I expect a lot of zombies owing to The Walking DEAD, and I bet, which becomes Daft punk Weltraummänner it this year into the Instagram feeds to create.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to Google the most wanted costumes are zombies, Batman, Piraten and Hexen.</seg>
<seg id="14">I assume, it am wrong nothing at tradition.</seg>
<seg id="15">We disguised last year our dogs and were thereby to my astonishment not alone.</seg>
<seg id="16">Americans actually spend 330 million dollar this year on costumes of their domestic animals, so the NRF.</seg>
<seg id="17">Those are a quantity „Hot Dogs”.</seg>
<seg id="18">Which concerns sweets, we are not squeamish.</seg>
<seg id="19">Americans will spend this year 1.9 billion dollar on it, so The Nielsen Company.</seg>
<seg id="20">Those are about 270 million kilogram at chocolate bars, Lutschern, drops and gummi bear.</seg>
<seg id="21">Thus good news for according to US-Ministry of Trade 41 the millions of people, who pulls sweet or sour with the saying „” by the quarters.</seg>
<seg id="22">We will actually buy over 40 million kilogram of chocolate for Halloween and – will make we nothing pre to eat itself.</seg>
<seg id="23">The only one, which we would not like to consume, is the sugar-sweet Candy Corn; 15 million kilogram of it around Halloween are sold nevertheless, so the national federation of the confectionery manufacturers.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those are about nine billion corn grains.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is a mystery, which I could not solve yet.</seg>
<seg id="26">Nothing belongs more to Halloween than houses, in which it haunts.</seg>
<seg id="27">They have great names like „terror Behind of the embankment” (which is by the way located in a genuine prison), „Howl O Scream” and „The House OF shock”.</seg>
<seg id="28">There are actually 1,200 officially recognized spook houses in the United States, which obtain 500 million dollar proceeds, thus America striking NT, and the marvelous photos include, on which one pees oneself straight into the trousers and which friends place then on Facebook, where one does not get rid of her again, and then the type, on which one stands, leaves a comment to one like „nice facial expression”.</seg>
<seg id="29">But we come finally to the pumpkins.</seg>
<seg id="30">Charlie Brown made us familiar with the large pumpkin, when we were children, and carving a pumpkin lantern is like a decorating of the Christmas tree – something, which from small we made on.</seg>
<seg id="31">Fortunately began „the babies in the pumpkin” - trend only last year owing to Pinterest, so that most of us grew up thereby, the pumpkin to into shape-carve and not to sit in it.</seg>
<seg id="32">This year Americans about 106 million dollar on pumpkins will spend, so US the Census office.</seg>
<seg id="33">The pumpkin lantern, which rots slowly in the front garden, probably originates from Illinois, where this year 245 million kilogram of pumpkins were harvested.</seg>
<seg id="34">If you liked to score correctly, then you called Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and carve you somewhat pretty from its 921 Kilo heavy pumpkin.</seg>

<seg id="6">In discussions for many years, which began 2005, the government had pushed on public tenders for the leases.</seg>

<seg id="1">NSA exposures strengthen firm paranoia because of national monitoring</seg>
<seg id="2">On a mild day at the end of August flew a German law enforcement helicopter deeply over the US-consulate to Frankfurt/Main, the financial capital of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="3">On instruction of the federal office for protection of the constitution and counterterrorism (BVT), the German interior secret service, he should photograph the roof of the US-outguard, who less than 5 km of the European central bank and the Federal Bank is.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to German media the BVT wanted to prove the presence of monitoring antennas and the action led to a dispute between the USA and the German State Department in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="5">James Clapper, US-American Director OF national Intelligence, consisted to develop these again in September on it that the USA did not use possibilities of the foreign espionage to steal „around the trade secrets of foreign enterprises on behalf US-American companies thereby their international competitive ability or their profit could.”</seg>
<seg id="6">But since Edward Snowden, who is not to the Whistleblower former employees become, with whom publication of its Füllhorn at US-American monitoring secrets began, European governments and head of a company any more surely whether they can take the director with the word.</seg>
<seg id="7">Reports, according to which the American national Security Agency the Brazilian oil company Petrobas spied and data of American Cloud providers including Google and Yahoo procured itself, brought firm paranoia because of national monitoring on a new highest level.</seg>
<seg id="8">The barrel for overflowing possibly already brought the exposure that chancellor Angela Merkels telephone was verwanzt, for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="9">If the most powerful person in Europe can turn out in its sights, then also managements are potential targets with security.</seg>
<seg id="10">Snowden made intensive co-operation between U.S. secret services and enterprise transparency.</seg>
<seg id="11">I believe, it am conceivable that these data are used for the mutual benefit.</seg>
<seg id="12">„Germany must wake up”, explains Oliver Grün, Präsident of the BITMi, which represents small and middle IT-companies in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="13">German enterprises believe, the USA represented now almost just as large risk as China, if it concerns industrial espionage and data larceny, so a survey, which was published in July by the advisor company EY.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the documents oozed by Snowden there was however so far no proof that the USA passed the trade secrets on of foreign enterprises to own companies.</seg>
<seg id="15">Politicians expressed their concern over the fact that certain IT and Internet possibilities were missing to the European Union and their dependence on the USA it should reduce.</seg>
<seg id="16">The enterprises are in this connection sceptical.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the Bundestag was suggested, we should construct a German Google.</seg>
<seg id="18">I can close only my eyes and open her slowly again…</seg>
<seg id="19">„So functioned that”, does not say Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software vendor SAP.</seg>
<seg id="20">If one had wanted a strong European IT industry, then one had been supposed to let her become extinct not before 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="21">Everything in Germany is subsidized, by the coal over cars up to the agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="22">Everything, up to the IT-industry.</seg>
<seg id="23">Nevertheless range and technical refinement of the US-Spionagebehörden uncovered by the Snowden exposures shocked companies, which had before seen the largest espionage risk in China.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the Cloud Computing takes place a large change, because European enterprise leaders are conscious now that in the USA stored data are subject to the local jurisdiction and therefore potential are endangered.</seg>
<seg id="25">According to one of the Cloud Security Alliance, a commercial institution, accomplished survey rejected about ten percent not in the USA of the residents of members of plans after the exposures over the US-American DATA Mining activities with Prism to use an American provider.</seg>
<seg id="26">Jim Snabe, deputy managing director of SAP, says: „We see a new question of customer, who gave it one year ago not yet – she reads: Where my data become and can stored you guarantee that these remain physical in this right area?”</seg>
<seg id="27">Many German enterprise leaders hold the opinion, which confirms recent report simply only, what they anyway already knew, i.e. that powerful States of their most valuable secrets to steal want and these therefore at any price to be guarded to have.</seg>
<seg id="28">That industrial espionage takes place, is no surprise.</seg>
<seg id="29">That was always like that.</seg>
<seg id="30">„It was many years long a topic and by the current discussion fundamentally changed”, does not say Kurt Bock, chairman of the chemistry company BASF.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Americans spy us on commercial and industrial level, as we also make, because it is in the national interest to defend our enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="32">The management does not boast normally over the counter measures, which one seized, because provides for aggressors advantages.</seg>
<seg id="33">In large enterprises for a long time hammered into that carrying of a free USB stick forward on a fair or unguarded leaving of a laptop is not advisable in the hotel room, gentle is said to employees.</seg>
<seg id="34">Ulrich Hackenberk, Vorstandsmitglied with automaker Audi, says that it belongs for years to standard practice to collect before an executive committee meeting the mobile phones so that her not when listening units can be used.</seg>
<seg id="35">The German BVT guesses/advises executive personnel to use simple Prepaid mobile phones if they go on foreign travel, because smartphones can possibly be compromised.</seg>
<seg id="36">The Prepaid mobile phones are afterwards thrown away.</seg>
<seg id="37">There is however the concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain open to attack in relation to Hacking and monitoring.</seg>
<seg id="38">In Germany many of these enterprises are world-wide market leaders in the respective niche.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Australian government insists on the hard conditions, which are linked with the rescue package over 325 million Australian dollar for the Tasmanian health service, in order to guarantee that the government of the Federal State cannot waste the money.</seg>
<seg id="3">Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek announced, Commonwealth to that „immediate measures” will seize, in order to turn a crisis away, which was caused by an aging population of the island state, a higher ratio at chronic illnesses and system restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="4">The financing for one period of four years was decided after government consultation with the independent Tasmanian delegate Andrew Wilkie.</seg>
<seg id="5">„The government tied an emergency rescue package, which turns on in our opinion the singular challenges, to which opposite the Federal State sees itself”, explained Plibersek today.</seg>
<seg id="6">The 325-Millionen-Dollar-Paket covers 31 million dollar emergency aid for choice elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">By further 2600 operations, including orthopedic interferences and treatments because of grey star, residuals are to be eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="8">Beyond that there is money for day hospitals in kind of main header and Launceston, better aftercare after stationary stays, the specialist training, services in the range mental health and the introduction of a system as the electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="9">„These investments correspond to the ideas, of which hospital employees concerned told me, it are the best possibility, the Tasmanian health system to improve”, said Tanya Plibersek.</seg>
<seg id="10">The minister insisted on a strict report and accountability of the Tasmanian government.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Federal State must the current financing level maintained, in order to be able to receive money from the Commonwealth, and report monthly where the extra money was spent.</seg>
<seg id="12">A three-person commission is furnished and is to guarantee that the Federal State makes health services available as effectively and efficiently as possible.</seg>
<seg id="13">How Wilkie explained today, the 325 million dollar would only little use, if „they are not accompanied by genuine reforms, those the public Tasmanian health system on a lasting course bring.”</seg>
<seg id="14">Regardless of its it praised the government for the fact that she had reacted to its request for urgent assistance, whom he expressed first opposite the prime minister at the beginning of May.</seg>
<seg id="15">„I am that federal aid will make a large contribution in addition, the public health system of the Federal State from the concern list to take confidently”, said Wilkie.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to the government of the Federal State these choice elections will make up for the recent cuts to a large extent.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Canadian airplane and railway manufacturer bombard Inc. announced on Thursday a 15-percent decrease of the net profit, after it by declining orders and distribution were guessed/advised with airplanes in the third quarter as well as contract problems in the railway section under pressure.</seg>
<seg id="3">Bombard with seat in Montreal published also no flight test datas for his brand-new airplane of the CSeries and gave no new information over it whether in accordance with the airplane the ambitious schedule in next September into the commercial use can go.</seg>
<seg id="4">After the maiden flight of test flight things one and a half months ago followed so far only three further starts, which lets it appear questionable whether the test phase runs as planned.</seg>
<seg id="5">The results stayed behind the prognoses and led to a sharp fall in prices from over eight percent at the stock exchange of Toronto.</seg>
<seg id="6">Cameron Doerksen, Analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered on Thursday his evaluation of „outperform” on „sector by form” with this in view that the share possesses into the next course potential limited to two quarter.</seg>
<seg id="7">„Weaker delivery numbers were expected as far as possible with airplanes, but of the margin development within the transport range we are completely clearly disappointed”, said Doerksen in a customer letter.</seg>
<seg id="8">We are the opinion that bombard new orders for the CSeries will receive, if the test routine for the airplane progresses.</seg>
<seg id="9">If however in the coming months no new orders are announced, then we expect that the market the program becomes more sceptical opposite.</seg>
<seg id="10">Bombard hopes that the airplane row of the CSeries can catapult the enterprise into the lower market segment, which is dominated at present by Boeing and Airbus.</seg>
<seg id="11">First test flight things were introduced in the March of the public and flew to months-long delays for the first time in September.</seg>
<seg id="12">But so far obligatory orders for the CSeries with 177 are moderate, since potential buyers wait for the results of the flight tests and would like to see whether the statements of the enterprise are applicable regarding fuel efficiency and cost saving potential of the new jet passenger plane.</seg>
<seg id="13">At present there are altogether to 403 orders and promises of 15 customers and societies.</seg>
<seg id="14">Chairman of the board Pierre Beaudoin gives itself confidently that bombard his goal from 300 obligatory orders to beginning of the commercial use of the jet will reach.</seg>
<seg id="15">The management insured the program on Thursday in relation to analysts and media in addition, lies in the schedule.</seg>
<seg id="16">„Test flight things remained not longer at the ground than expected”, said Beaudoin at a telephone conference call and added, during the service life of the airplane ground tests and software updates were set.</seg>
<seg id="17">Each manufacturer plans differently.</seg>
<seg id="18">We decided to undertake a first flight and attach then one revision period, which we also did.</seg>
<seg id="19">That happens during the entire flight program.</seg>
<seg id="20">Second of five test flight witnesses will presumably start in the next weeks, the remaining briefly thereafter, was called it from enterprise side.</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts remain nevertheless sceptically whether after the maiden flight the first customer an airplane of the CSeries can take twelve months in enterprise.</seg>
<seg id="22">Bombard explained, it examine planning for start-up (ICE) and these in the next months will update.</seg>
<seg id="23">„Slow progressing the flight test – even if they correspond obviously to Bombardiers of internal planning – our opinion encourages that start-up shifts, said on the first quarter 2015” Doerksen.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the third quarter with end on 30 September Bombardiers net profit fell on 147 million dollar and/or 8 cent per share of 172 million dollar and/or 9 cent per share in the year before.</seg>
<seg id="25">The adapted earnings per share amount to invariably 9 cent.</seg>
<seg id="26">The revenue gave way slightly and sank from 4,2 to 4.1 billion dollar.</seg>
<seg id="27">Analysts had expected, so a profit of 10 cent per share and a revenue of 4.56 billion dollar Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.</seg>
<seg id="28">That world-wide fourth largest aircraft manufacturer indicates, he delivered 45 airplanes in this quarter, a decrease of 57 in the last year.</seg>
<seg id="29">The net orders fell from 83 airplanes to 26.</seg>
<seg id="30">The order books in air and space section amounted to on 30 September 32.9 billion dollar and were unchanged thereby in relation to 31 December.</seg>
<seg id="31">„Within the range the results were appropriate for air and space travel in the context of our defaults, but the low incoming orders and market conditions altogether were disappointing”, said Beaudoin.</seg>
<seg id="32">The revenue in air and space section fell by 13 percent on two billion dollar.</seg>
<seg id="33">Bombard, the world-wide largest railway manufacturer, it announced that the revenue in this section rose around scarcely eleven percent to 2.1 billion dollar.</seg>
<seg id="34">The order books in the transport section amounted to on 30 September 32.6 billion dollar and were easily increased thereby in relation to 31 December.</seg>
<seg id="35">The profit margin within the range transport was impaired by completion problems with some large contracts.</seg>
<seg id="36">According to management it will give new defaults for the fourth quarter.</seg>
<seg id="37">In the afternoon trade on Thursday the bombarding share gave way by 8,5 percent and was about 4,83 Canadian dollar, after it was also announced that the Google finance executive committee Patrick Pichette will change into the executive committee.</seg>

<seg id="1">Scientists could throw more lights on it in which connection stands for the tail whisks of a dog with his tendency.</seg>
<seg id="2">Earlier research had shown that happy dogs wagged the tail more to the right (from view of the dog), while it was with nervous dogs the left side.</seg>
<seg id="3">But scientists say now that other dogs can these subtle differences notice and to it react.</seg>
<seg id="4">Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuro scientist of the University of Trento, said: „With humans is well well-known that the left and right brain half differently to stimuli reacts, the positive or negative emotions cause.”</seg>
<seg id="5">Here we tried to view to us this with other species.</seg>
<seg id="6">In addition he noticed that with dogs exactly as with humans the right brain half was responsible for the movement of the left side and turned around, and that different roles played the two hemispheres with the feelings.</seg>
<seg id="7">In order to experience more over it, how dogs react to the lateral tail whisks of their animals of the same species, the researchers supervised the animals, while these films of other dogs viewed themselves.</seg>
<seg id="8">They measured the heart rate of the four-legged friends and analyzed the behavior.</seg>
<seg id="9">Probably we will soon understand, why the tail moves times into the one, times in the other direction</seg>
<seg id="10">Professor Vallortigara said: „We showed the dogs of films with dogs – either a version true to nature or a silhouette, in order to eliminate diverting other aspects, and we could steer thereby the movement of the tail more to the left or right.”</seg>
<seg id="11">If the animals saw, like an otherwise inexpressive dog (seen by the perspective of the wagging dog out), remained it moved the tail to the right completely eased.</seg>
<seg id="12">However if the tail inclination was primarily to the left (perspective of the dog, which wags), then its heart rate and it rose looked jerky.</seg>
<seg id="13">In opinion of professor Vallortigara the dogs do not communicate intentionally with one another by these movements.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is rather convinced that the dogs from experience would have learned, with which movements it itself worrying should and when not.</seg>
<seg id="15">He said: „If one different meetings with other dogs has and a wagging the tail in a direction rather linked with friendly behavior is rather a less friendly behavior produced and the right side, then one reacts to basis of these experiences.”</seg>
<seg id="16">The researchers say that the realizations could help owners of dog, veterinary surgeons and coaches to a better understanding of the emotions of their animal.</seg>
<seg id="17">John Bradshaw, Experte for dog behavior and guest scholarship holder at the faculty for veterinary science of the university of Bristol explained, this had not been the first study, with which it was examined whether on the left and on the right was important for dogs.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year found a team out of the university from Lincoln that dogs turn the head to the left, if they view an aggressive dog, and to the right, if it concerns a content dog.</seg>
<seg id="19">In another research work at the university of Victoria in Canada the following stood: „Dogs go rather toward a robot dog, if its, tail wags ` left and not right, instead of becoming jerkily – exactly differently than in the Italian study.”</seg>
<seg id="20">According to its statement the differences could agitate from there that the dogs in the different studies the animals in the films and/or the robot dogs not when dogs interpreted.</seg>
<seg id="21">A study, how dogs react to genuine dogs, could help, explained it.</seg>
<seg id="22">„There are considerable proofs for many different mammals that the two brain halves for different purposes are used, but must many of the details be still determined – and dogs form there no exception”, thus for Bradshaw.</seg>
<seg id="23">Since its behavior can be noted however simply, it will probably not for a long time last, until we understand, why sometimes the tail moves into the one, sometimes in the other direction.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pledge houses boom in Singapore, since the crisis arrived in the middle class</seg>
<seg id="2">In a pledge house in the shopping centre Bendemeer in Singapore exchanges Janani Amirthalinga a golden bracelet, a ring and a pair of earrings, in order to be able to pay the school fees of their daughters.</seg>
<seg id="3">„My husband and I have a straight house bought, there put my whole money in it”, say Amirthalinga.</seg>
<seg id="4">Although she earns each month 3,000 Singapore dollar (approx. 1,730 euros) as an administrative employee and its man also works, be sufficient the monthly family income not, describe it.</seg>
<seg id="5">Actual is demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where the indebtedness of the households increases – so largely that VALUE Max, where she made her exchange became this week the third pledge house, which is listed at the Singaporean stock exchange.</seg>
<seg id="6">Pawning of jewelry is too gotten – 1,300 Singapore dollar in the case of Janani Amirthalinga –, but also nearly as favorable not only a fast way, in order money as an unsecured bankers' loan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Typically pledge houses in Singapore an annual percentage rate of 17 percent, which lies only scarcely over the 15.4 percent, which requires United Overseas bank, require, a local creditor with a branch in the same shopping centre.</seg>
<seg id="8">Pledge houses offer however the advantage that no examination of the credit-worthiness or the income proof is necessary here, why loans are faster than possible with banks.</seg>
<seg id="9">For this reason millions of humans in the region turn to pledge houses, after families feel the pressure by rising cost of living as well as an increasing household and consumer indebtedness.</seg>
<seg id="10">After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credits due to a loose financial policy in the developed marketing areas families with smaller and middle incomes visit pledge houses to adjust with stuttering economy the difference.</seg>
<seg id="11">This week called the rating agency standard & Poor's increasing household indebtedness, mainly by rising mortgages, a factor of risk for the credit-worthiness of Asian banks.</seg>
<seg id="12">Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household indebtedness in Asia in relation to the gross domestic product according to estimate of the agency.</seg>
<seg id="13">Malaysia still stands with 80 percent of the Gross Domestic Product at the point of the list, a rise of 60 percent in the year 2008.</seg>
<seg id="14">Political economists worry themselves also because of the high consumer indebtedness in Thailand, which came out this week scarcely from a technical recession.</seg>
<seg id="15">On Thursday the data showed further existing export weakness and a leaving of the consumer demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">„Eventually that means that in view of rising costs humans in the middle to lower segment (the income scale) will try to supplement their income where that is possible always”, says for song Seng Wun, Ökonom with CIMB, a Malaysian bank.</seg>
<seg id="17">Historical highest levels with the gold prices in the last two years still strengthened the trend for the pledging of personal articles, since humans use the opportunity to transform the jewelry of the family into cash.</seg>
<seg id="18">In Singapore about 70 percent of the pawned articles in the 200 pledge houses of the city state is gold.</seg>
<seg id="19">The people say themselves: „The gold price looks good, lets us Großmutters gold chain pawn and next month back bring.”</seg>
<seg id="20">The largest Thai pledge house operator, EasyMoney, experienced a 20-percent customer increase in his branches in the last months.</seg>
<seg id="21">Growth in the pledge business is so strong that VALUE Max, would like to expand Betreiber of the branch in Bendemeer and 15 further in Singapore not only into neighbouring Malaysia – where the enterprise operates four houses –, but also outside of Asia, so Yeah Lee Ching, managing director of VALUE Max.</seg>
<seg id="22">The enterprise finances with 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollar, which took it this week with the initial public offering in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="23">During some creditors because of high interest rates in the crossfire are guessed/advised, explain Yeah that pledge houses would not only offer more favorable interest than other lenders, but also not directly the debts increased.</seg>
<seg id="24">„Customers beleihen articles, which already possess them, and which liquefaction of personal objects of value does not describe increased the Haushaltsverschulung”, it.</seg>
<seg id="25">The pledge borrowing business is accepted socially increasingly as short term, secured financing.</seg>
<seg id="26">Also not all humans are, the pawn shop use, in financial difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="27">Rich people from Singapore come also into the branches of VALUE Max, in order to pawn gold bar and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.</seg>
<seg id="28">To us customers come from each social layer.</seg>
<seg id="29">„To it belong wealthy ones, which borrow something at short notice for a business or an investment, or small enterprises, which must bridge bottlenecks in the cash-flow”, say Yeah.</seg>
<seg id="30">Sometimes they need also simply only very fast money.</seg>

<seg id="1">A study was announced by the British government, which was to increase the advantages of the HS2-Eisenbahnprojekts for Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="2">In the work of HS2 Ltd. one suggests realising with beginning of phase 1 in the year 2026 high-speed connections between Scotland and the north of England.</seg>
<seg id="3">Transport minister Baroness Kramer said, the project „Great Britain together will more near bring”.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Scottish transport minister Keith Brown explained, it was very much pleased to work with the British government about this plan.</seg>
<seg id="5">Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed railway connection between London and West Midlands.</seg>

<seg id="8">The British government, that stands in discussions with transport Scotland, assigned HS2 Ltd. to look for further distance capacities and travel time improvements for North England and Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="9">In addition the possibility belongs less travel time from finally three hours or from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.</seg>
<seg id="10">Baroness Kramer said: „Our goal for HS2 is a really national route network, the Great Britain and its cities more near brings together.”</seg>
<seg id="11">We precede with HS2, because it brings enormous advantages with itself.</seg>
<seg id="12">Without it we stand before a capacity crisis in our railway network.</seg>

<seg id="1">Live with future prospect</seg>
<seg id="2">Actually Waltraud Ries lives fantastically.</seg>
<seg id="3">Their house lies in a calm residential area of Stuttgart with much green, an old tree existence, nice neighbour and also not all too much traffic.</seg>
<seg id="4">Into the city there is only few minutes with public means of transport.</seg>
<seg id="5">“You have hopefully no fear of spiders? ”, Waltraud Ries asks and points to a fat spider at the door frame.</seg>
<seg id="6">I look for already for some time a new apartment for my man and me.</seg>
<seg id="7">But you know, how is difficult in Stuttgart.</seg>
<seg id="8">The reason is however no spider phobia, but the concern not to be able to master at the age the many stairway steps to the house and in the apartment no more explains it.</seg>
<seg id="9">Besides: Since a meniscus operation the woman in her fitties at the own body had to experience, what means it to induce itself with handicap from floor to floor.</seg>
<seg id="10">Recently only a book of it is published to the topic 'happy lives in the age - which apartment form is the best for me?'.</seg>
<seg id="11">'Our apartment is the best example of it, what does not go at all, begins in the age' it to tell.</seg>
<seg id="12">When it pulled more than 20 years ago with its man into the May sonnet apartment, it was simply only a beautiful apartment in the middle in the country.</seg>
<seg id="13">Today with center fifty Waltraud Ries thinks differently of it.</seg>
<seg id="14">In addition, she knows that she belongs to few humans, who argue at all with the topic 'living in the age'.</seg>
<seg id="15">Most displace it, as long as it goes.</seg>
<seg id="16">In each case anderen' one, say they become old grinning quietly.</seg>
<seg id="17">Only if the psychological strain is really large, one thinks.</seg>
<seg id="18">'Then it can be in addition, to late', already so Ries.</seg>
<seg id="19">In her book the interior decorator presents 17 patterns of dwelling for self-determined living in the age.</seg>
<seg id="20">'Which apartment form one selects however, is always an individual decision', explains it.</seg>
<seg id="21">D i.e. solution does not give it for the age.</seg>
<seg id="22">Even who can afford the age resting seat in Tuscany or Brittany, it should itself always considers that he also suffer become can.</seg>
<seg id="23">And: 'Without good knowledge of the national language,' the specialist book authoress Aussiedlungswilligen gives to consider vereinsame one also in the Dolce résumé.</seg>
<seg id="24">Under their models are classical support models, alternative apartment forms or the often quoted pensioner WG.</seg>
<seg id="25">At the age everyone has so its spleens and defects</seg>
<seg id="26">'For me so a group house would be however nothing', means it with a winking.</seg>
<seg id="27">Already not at all as in a student WG with a common bath and a kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="28">'At the age one needs simply also its retreat areas', thus Ries.</seg>
<seg id="29">The fact that a senior group house can function nevertheless does not want to exclude the book authoress nevertheless.</seg>
<seg id="30">That must run then however differently than in the classical student WG.</seg>
<seg id="31">And sometimes one wants simply only its Ruhe', believes her.</seg>
<seg id="32">With this opinion it does not stand at least in the state capital alone there.</seg>
<seg id="33">'Most old humans in Stuttgart want so for a long time it go in their own apartment remaining', are also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the chief the civil services the lives in the age of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="34">Their agency advises humans around the topic 'old becomes round'.</seg>
<seg id="35">Therefore straight older humans would accept frequently also to inconveniences and restrictions to be able to remain only in order in their used to environment that are also the experience of the foundation goods test.</seg>
<seg id="36">There are today many possibilities of arranging the house or the apartment barrier-free.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ries recommends all, which concern themselves with the agefair change of their house or their apartment, to inform for a start thoroughly and not to assign the firstbest craftsman.</seg>
<seg id="38">Today there are specialists also for the agefair change.</seg>
<seg id="39">Even in the rented flat let yourself or others realize, and if it is only the toilet seat increase, the interior decorator clears up.</seg>
<seg id="40">But always the existing apartment cannot be transformed agefairly and thus barrier-free, even if it lies still so beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="41">This experience had to make Waltraud Ries.</seg>
<seg id="42">One could install a stair lift within the apartment, the way to on the housing door, likewise paved with stairs, would be however the by far larger obstacle.</seg>
<seg id="43">It will continue searching, until she found the ideal object for itself and her man.</seg>
<seg id="44">Of the move it has a horror it more than of the spider at their housing door.</seg>

<seg id="1">Cocaine-dependent lawyer, the drug boss before police determination warned, must in the prison</seg>
<seg id="2">Basharat Ditta, 42, passed information on at underworld size Neil Scarborough</seg>
<seg id="3">The lawyer had fear, its secret drug addiction could to the light come</seg>
<seg id="4">He was condemned by the Liverpooler Crown Court to three years prison</seg>
<seg id="5">A well-known defence counsel, who warned a drug lord before a large police determination, because he had fear, its secret drug addiction could is uncovered, became to three years detention condemned.</seg>
<seg id="6">Basharat Ditta, 42, supplied underworld size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about investigations to its activities in the drug trade, after he had been compromised by his own cocaine craze.</seg>
<seg id="7">Lawyer with the nickname, praised of criminologists as „first-class a”, „the Bash” was arrested 2011 in its house, after the police had supervised Scarborough, which it had represented in an earlier drug procedure.</seg>
<seg id="8">Officials observed, like Scarborough (32) three bags cocaine at the house of the lawyer in Blackburn, Lancashire, delivered, while this was with colleagues with a meal of the bar association.</seg>
<seg id="9">The investigations brought to light that Ditta consumed regularly drugs of the class A, after with tests traces had been found by cocaine in its hair, on its wallet and at credit cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">During one period of eight months between January and August 2011 he tried to procure without permission information about the arrest of two men on behalf from Scarborough and one its partner.</seg>
<seg id="11">All four suspects were supervised at that time by the police in the context of a large preliminary investigation to heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and west Yorkshire.</seg>
<seg id="12">Together with 32 other people were later arrested it, after the police guaranteed with a set of house searches heroin and cocaine in the value of 1.5 million pound as well as 200,000 pound at cash.</seg>
<seg id="13">Ditta, 42, continued to give to the criminal ones, because he was afraid, its drug addiction to information can become public.</seg>
<seg id="14">Today Ditta, which works for the chancellery Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, at the Liverpooler Crown Court was found and condemned in a three-week procedure in two charges because of handicap of the law for guilty.</seg>
<seg id="15">It admitted the cocaine possession with an earlier questioning.</seg>
<seg id="16">The lawyer was transferred, after the police found out with its investigations against Scarborough that this had confessed in February 2011 in regular telephone contact with Ditta.</seg>
<seg id="17">Two investigators followed suspecting and saw, how he went to Dittas house and put the drugs with a purity there of 60 percent in a black gulf glove under the garbage can of the lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="18">Briefly after it had delivered the drugs, Scarborough telephoned regularly with Ditta, which was during dinner in the football stadium of the Blackburn Rovers in Ewood park.</seg>
<seg id="19">The lawyer returned home, got themselves the drugs and then nine reports between the two was exchanged.</seg>
<seg id="20">In court it became admits that Ditta was „a regular consumer” from cocaine, after with tests drugs of the class A in its hair, its wallet and on its credit cards had been discovered.</seg>
<seg id="21">Ditta was arrested later, denied however to take cocaine and said, he had spoken its discussion with the presumed dealer, because this is its mandator, and maintained, is subject „to the attorney-client privilege”.</seg>
<seg id="22">While Ditta took its wallet to its arrest and tried to remove a set from credit cards to but they were guaranteed and a hair sample was taken from it.</seg>
<seg id="23">For the police questioning it indicated, it operates both by its private address and on the job an office and a mandator it at home because of legal affairs would call.</seg>
<seg id="24">In court admits that he it had called and about it had informed important participants of the drug trade, from whom he had represented before some after important arrests, what the investigators knew about her.</seg>
<seg id="25">Public prosecutor Anne Whyte said: „A criminal law lawyer should know better than all different that one does not break the law.”</seg>
<seg id="26">Ditta is accused the abuse of its position as a defence counsel, since he admitted himself too much with certain mandators.</seg>
<seg id="27">The questionable relationship is not simple a drug dealer, but a drug dealer, who supplies its lawyer with drugs.</seg>
<seg id="28">A part of its reports was certainly legitimate, because he was a lawyer of these people.</seg>
<seg id="29">But went the far beyond borders of a normal relationship between lawyer and mandator.</seg>
<seg id="30">It worked against the police investigations as far as possible, so that they could follow further to their criminal activities.</seg>
<seg id="31">Mr. Ditta brought with it his profession in disrepute.</seg>
<seg id="32">It was close to certain mandator too, in particular Scarborough, and he permitted it that its independence was compromised.</seg>
<seg id="33">Ditta pointed each failure from itself and stated: „If I a corrupt lawyer would be, which I am not, and information at Scarborough to pass on wanted, then I would not wait 15 hours, but that immediately do.”</seg>
<seg id="34">But after the hearing superintendent said Lee Halstead of the police in Lancashire: „Mr. Ditta has to acquire the step from a defence counsel to a criminal one in the moment done, when he began, drugs from organized criminal ones to.”</seg>
<seg id="35">Its cocaine dependence led to a hopeless compromising and made it sensitive to the motives of prominent members of the organized crime, which it assigned to catch up valuable information about police investigations.</seg>
<seg id="36">Lawyers must maintain the highest standards at integrity and provide in the public for confidence and confidence.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ditta was issued this confidence and tried to entrench itself behind the front of its profession.</seg>
<seg id="38">The Serious and Organised Crime unit of Lancashire led the investigations against Ditta, which led also to a condemnation in three cases because of the possession of cocaine and law handicap, which underlines our determination to bring criminal ones in court.</seg>
<seg id="39">This case should be criminal ones a warning and shows that no can withdraw itself from the arm of the law.</seg>
<seg id="40">We find you and bring you in court.</seg>
<seg id="41">Scarborough was condemned to 14 years prison, after he had explained himself the conspiracy as heroin, cocaine and cannabis trade for guilty.</seg>
<seg id="42">Thirty-five further at the drug trade beteiligte'Personen to total penalties by 153 years because of drug offenses were condemned.</seg>
<seg id="43">On its website published Ditta a range with questions and answers over itself, in which he indicated, its dream job is too represented it, as a lawyer mandator in the death cell in America, its ultimative guest during dinner is Mohammed Ali and Chancenungleichheit is the motivation for its work.</seg>

<seg id="1">Advice takes railway tracks in its sights</seg>
<seg id="2">Is the railroad overpass to be converted “at deer” the complex, in order to increase the road safety?</seg>
<seg id="3">Yes, the local councils decided.</seg>
<seg id="4">Scold oh for it 220,000 euros must take into the hand.</seg>
<seg id="5">The German Railways wants to improve the Kinzigtal railroad line in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="6">Particularly thereby security at railroad overpasses is to be increased - regularly it comes country widely to collisions of courses with other vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="7">If the communities the structural alteration measures agree, they must take part with a third in the costs, the rest divide course and federation.</seg>
<seg id="8">Of scolding ACH architect-general Roland Grießhaber described the characteristics of the Bahübergangs to the local council “to deer”.</seg>
<seg id="9">There the city plans to build at height of the local tunnel mouth west the railway lines a projection.</seg>
<seg id="10">There also larger vehicles, for example such, could the long trunks transport, with oncoming traffic stand, without having to block the tracks.</seg>
<seg id="11">Grießhaber suggested from there designing a necessary retaining wall in such a way that the city could widen the following road at given time, in order to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.</seg>
<seg id="12">This discussed in the local council controversially, there some advice the necessity for a road spreading impugned: Thomas Kipp brought the tendency of the critics with his expression on the point: “Having we because of so few vehicles so much money into the hand to take?”</seg>
<seg id="13">Mayor Thomas Haas contradicted: The railroad overpass “deer” is used regularly for long trunks transportation.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even wood from the range “cow brook” is partly transported over this distance, because up to 20 meters could not use long vehicles the distance to the Häberlesbrücke, because they could not turn there into the main street.</seg>
<seg id="15">Beyond that serve the distance as bypass for those vehicles, which may not use the tunnel, if the main street is closed, argued Haas.</seg>
<seg id="16">Since it is to be foreseen that Kirchberg and lock mountain tunnels would have to be converted and reorganized, how this is in wolf oh the case at present, can come to the railroad overpass “to “deer” also for a longer period an important traffic meaning.</seg>
<seg id="17">The advice agreed, examine to leave, the widening envisaged of the road would cause which costs.</seg>
<seg id="18">Regardless of its change of the railroad overpass by the majority affirmatively under the condition that the necessary retaining wall is built in such a way that the city can remove the following road direction “Bahnhofstraße” if necessary for meeting traffic on approximately 5.5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="19">The change of the railroad overpass with the tannery cozy wine could lead to against it completely different problem, which concerns the approach road in the strongly rising “Geroltzhäuser way”.</seg>
<seg id="20">The administration had let examine the change plans of the course of the engineer's office Breinlinger, since it had doubts about it whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser of way was still easily possible then.</seg>
<seg id="21">The investigation came to the result that it was not to be excluded that inclination conditions of the road could lead to the fact that longer vehicles mount.</seg>
<seg id="22">The responsibility for this carries again the city as road construction load carrier.</seg>
<seg id="23">The change can therefore lead to liability disputes.</seg>
<seg id="24">Since both the wood removal and bending in the current development condition functioned, one was not to agree the change of the railroad overpass, argued Haas.</seg>
<seg id="25">Also here the risk of a collision of the course with a vehicle standing on the transition is clearly smaller than at the other railroad overpasses, because beside it the critical point center is directly, to which a good line of sight connection exists.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even courses from the main station would have to be already so far braked here that no collision threatens.</seg>
<seg id="27">By the majority the change of this railroad overpass the agreement refused, there the city scold oh the problem with mounting vehicles “to pay for would have”, so the advice, since the course can withdraw itself after conclusion of the construction work from the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="28">As unproblematic the committee regards the changes at the railroad overpasses “before hay brook” and “before cow brook”, for which crossing agreements were already met with the course.</seg>

<seg id="2">The earlier news OF the Word publishers Andy Coulson used allegedly „telephone Hacking, monitoring and confrontation” with the attempt to confirm a wrong hint over an affair of the Minister of the Interior at that time Charles Clarke.</seg>
<seg id="3">Public prosecutor Andrew Edis QC explained the World to the court in the old Bailey, news OF in May 2005 a wrong rumor to that effect heard that Clarke would have a relationship with its „attractive special advisor” Hannah Pawlby.</seg>
<seg id="4">The newspaper assigned the private detective Glenn Mulcaire to chop Pawlbys voice mails and pursued it, but Coulson also called it and left news, as the court experienced.</seg>
<seg id="5">„In the opinion the public prosecutor's office Coulson, which is now publisher of the NotW, is not anybody, which stands and hopes before the apartment of people to surprise her in the act but one, the people gladly with a history confronts, around their reaction to see”, explained Edis.</seg>
<seg id="6">He said, to NotW uses three procedures, in order to investigate to stories investigatively: Telephone Hacking, monitoring and confrontation.</seg>
<seg id="7">The publisher is personally involved in the third method.</seg>
<seg id="8">Obviously white it of second, the monitoring, differently can be it.</seg>
<seg id="9">How does it look with first?</seg>
<seg id="10">Knowing it over the telephone Hacking?</seg>
<seg id="11">It denies, but say we: „And whether he knew of it.”</seg>
<seg id="12">Rumors over an affair Clarkes were taken up first by the feature editorship by NotW, when one said to a source, which was interested in Pawlby sexual: „Wasting you its time, it is together not with Charles.”</seg>
<seg id="13">A volume with voice mails of their telephone of at least three causes was guaranteed in August 2006 in Mulcaires apartment.</seg>
<seg id="14">In addition the investigators found entries on the computer of the detective, on whom Pawlby and their sister were stored as „projects”.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the time, when the searches ran, grandparents received anonymous calls, in which they were asked for information about them, from Pawlby explained Edis.</seg>
<seg id="16">Meanwhile the former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and the former reporter James Weatherup supervised the monitoring of the movements of Pawlby.</seg>
<seg id="17">On 18 June 2005 Coulson left a voice mail with the following contents to it: „I have a story, which we want to bring out tomorrow, about which I gladly with Charles to speak would like.”</seg>
<seg id="18">Edis explained, Coulsons activities with this story followed to the same sample as for instance with other important personalities, the former Minister of the Interior David Blunkett.</seg>
<seg id="19">The jurors heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett had confronted because of an affair with a married woman, when he was associated with the codefendants Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at that time.</seg>
<seg id="20">Coulson and Brooks deny with others to have conspired to chop between 3 October 2000 and 9 August of 2006 telephones.</seg>
<seg id="21">Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted the telephone Hacking.</seg>

<seg id="1">Early puberty: Faster to be arisen</seg>
<seg id="2">Afro-American and Hispanic girls reach tendentious rather puberty as their white contemporaries, how investigations show.</seg>
<seg id="3">Physical changes do not mean yet directly puberty</seg>
<seg id="4">There is no proof for the fact that hormones or other chemicals are responsible</seg>
<seg id="5">Experts believe, epidemic obesity is a trigger of early puberty</seg>
<seg id="6">The trend to early puberty is less pronounced with boys</seg>
<seg id="7">The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist, which specialized in child health and family topics.</seg>
<seg id="8">Should a mother be anxious, if already at the age of seven or eight years breasts and shame hair grow their daughter?</seg>
<seg id="9">At the annual conference of the pediatrician federation American Academy OF Pediatrics Florida, the pediatric Endokrinologe Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained this week in Orlando, that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and represented a new standard.</seg>
<seg id="10">„I spend much time to calm parents down – normally that is not a sign for the fact that now fast puberty enters”, described Kaplowitz.</seg>
<seg id="11">Obvious announcements of the development, like for example increasing breasts, shame and axilarry hairs as well as body odor, show up with girls in former times.</seg>
<seg id="12">Nevertheless there was only an easy shift with the age of the Menarche (arise to the first rule bleeding) in the last 40 years.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the United States the average age is appropriate for less than 12.75 at 12.5 years, somewhat in the year 1970.</seg>
<seg id="14">„If the development of the breasts begins, lasts it still at least two to three years up to the Menarche”, said Kaplowitz, also author of the book „early puberty with girls: The essential guide to handling this frequently arising problem”.</seg>
<seg id="15">Time is the most exact test, as puberty progresses.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is disputed, which actually represents the beginning of puberty, but is valid it „for premature”, if the chest enlargement is accompanied by a growth spurt before an age of eight years.</seg>
<seg id="17">The process in most cases slows down or stagnates – to something, which a pediatrician can supervise exactly.</seg>
<seg id="18">With faster progressing tests could be shown by a Endikronologen, so that serious problems can be excluded such as tumors or cysts.</seg>
<seg id="19">There are working methods for delaying an early menstruation and the protection against of another consequence: the premature aging of the bones, which can lead ultimatively to growth inhibition and thus small body stature with adults.</seg>
<seg id="20">The recommendations for a medicamentous or hormoneal therapy orient themselves at the age of the child, the development speed, which growth rate and the emotional ripe one.</seg>
<seg id="21">Psychosocial aspects are likewise important.</seg>
<seg id="22">Kaplowitz is reserved, which concerns medicines, but he grants: „Suppressing puberty can moderate behavior problems and the feelings of girls to be different than their contemporaries.”</seg>
<seg id="23">The other large problem is understandable: Parents would not like simply that their very young daughters have the period.</seg>
<seg id="24">„You worry yourselves because of the pregnancy risk or over it, like them the hygenic side handle”, said Kaplowitz.</seg>
<seg id="25">„It was a shock”, remembers a woman, whose daughter with ten got her days.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even if there were first signs and we had spoken about menstruation, them were emotional preparatory.</seg>
<seg id="27">She came scared and excited from the school home, because it was first in her circle of friends.</seg>
<seg id="28">There are many comprehensively published theories about the causes of early puberty.</seg>
<seg id="29">But no conclusive proofs are present for the fact that hormones would be causal in milk or other food, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media.</seg>
<seg id="30">Young ones come similarly as girls in former times into puberty.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kaplowitz is the opinion, the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity.</seg>
<seg id="32">It supported the execution of a study in the year 2001 over girls at the age of six to nine years, which manufactures a connection between adipose and the entering puberty.</seg>
<seg id="33">Other investigations support this conclusion, but it gives many other factors, which played a role.</seg>
<seg id="34">In this country Afro-American and Hispanic girls reach tendentious rather puberty as their white contemporaries.</seg>
<seg id="35">There are for it different explanations.</seg>
<seg id="36">Early puberty seems global to be affected by all possible things, from economic conditions over the climate up to the genes.</seg>
<seg id="37">A further mystery: Although the face and shame hair coat grow boys already in former times, the trend is not as pronounced to full-extent earlier puberty as with girls.</seg>
<seg id="38">Other physicians to the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the topic.</seg>
<seg id="39">Emerging of acne and shame hair is even common with babies and infants.</seg>
<seg id="40">„We must be careful, like we the true beginning of puberty identify”, said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric Endokrinologe at the Goryeb Children's hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.</seg>
<seg id="41">Parents should not hesitate to leave itself advised by their pediatrician as they should speak with their child.</seg>
<seg id="42">„That can mean that one expects in former times than a discussion lead must”, guessed/advised Kaplowitz.</seg>
<seg id="43">If one remains calm, the child reacts normally well.</seg>
<seg id="44">Girls, who bloom early, need the insurance, who are the process a normal part of the life, even if it in former times than meant enter.</seg>

<seg id="2">Borussia Dortmund quit thereupon hard consequences on.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before the Fridays play the Ultras reacted to the soccer federal league against the VfB Stuttgart with a silence - first.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was unusual, nearly already eerie acoustics, which were offered to the viewer to shortly before the kickoff of the Bundesliga play between the German vice-master Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the signal Iduna Park.</seg>
<seg id="5">To hear the guest fans with their singing were predominant.</seg>
<seg id="6">The south grandstand against it, where the most faithful faithful - and loudest - BVB fans stand, presented itself first unusually quietly: No singing, no whoops.</seg>
<seg id="7">The landing of the Capo, which coordinates otherwise the common first fire mixture, remained vacant.</seg>
<seg id="8">And on the grandstand lonely a large flag with label “section stadium prohibition” blew completely in front.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only as goal keepers Roman Weidenfeller like always as first BVB players the place entered, broke brief jubilation up.</seg>
<seg id="10">When its crew colleagues followed, there were loud singing and blowing scarves - however do not lengthen everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the central blocks nothing moved 12 and 13 of the south grandstand.</seg>
<seg id="12">Also that Stadionsprecher Norbert Dickel enumerated again the positive experiences of the last days - derby victory, victory over arsenal, prolongation of a contract of coach Jürgen Klopp -, did not provide for celebration mood.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only five minutes before the kickoff the Capo its landing ascended - and by then almost the strain seizable with hands unloaded itself in a loud cry, when Dickel queried like used to the tendency on ranks in the stadium.</seg>
<seg id="14">As the latter always was like the south grandstand at the row - and finally was here again like used to the loudest place in the stadium.</seg>
<seg id="15">And at the latest as with kickoff of the south grandstand the loud request “derby winner rises” came, was again everything like always.</seg>
<seg id="16">The silence before was probably a reaction to the events of the past days.</seg>
<seg id="17">Directly before district derby with the FC Schalke 04 some traveled the BVB supporter flares had met into spectator ranks and on the place fired - and nearly goal keeper Roman Weidenfeller.</seg>
<seg id="18">The play was late whistled for the start because of the chaotic scenes.</seg>
<seg id="19">BVB boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had the points of the Dortmunder Ultras thereupon in its office received - and one believes Watzkes words, was this for the fan representatives a rather uncomfortable date.</seg>
<seg id="20">“It will give, announced solid cuts for the entire ultra movement” the BVB boss on Thursday evening on a panel discussion in Frankfurt.</seg>
<seg id="21">As immediate measure Watzke forbade the Ultras a choreography for the home game against the VfB Stuttgart.</seg>
<seg id="22">“I forbade, explained that” he.</seg>
<seg id="23">We cannot give the zero-tolerance politics up in things pyrotechnics.</seg>
<seg id="24">Besides the Ultras different possibilities of a punishment were pointed out - up to Tuesday to have these now to time of deciding for one.</seg>
<seg id="25">Otherwise, thus Watzke, will specify the BVB to end the coming week a sanction.</seg>

<seg id="2">Email is called actually electronic letter.</seg>
<seg id="3">With the draft of the Internet service was email converted similarly as technically at the conventional post office the secrecy of letters?</seg>
<seg id="4">With the conception of the early Internet services was the center of attention to make possible communication.</seg>
<seg id="5">Therefore one did not pay attention with basic technical minutes to create a stable foundation for a listen to-safe exchange of letters.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore a conventional email corresponds rather to an open postcard as a sealed letter.</seg>
<seg id="7">If user “Anna” sends a mail to “Benni”, are the computers of the two then directly connected?</seg>
<seg id="8">The email program or the browser of Anna sends the mail in the first step to the mail server of her service provider.</seg>
<seg id="9">If it has for example an GMail account, would be Google.</seg>
<seg id="10">This mail server sends contents to the provider, which Benni uses.</seg>
<seg id="11">On the distance the mail can run over some other servers on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="12">Bennie can call contents then with its provider.</seg>
<seg id="13">Are conventional emails on their way read too by the net?</seg>
<seg id="14">Most mails are read on the way several times from software robots.</seg>
<seg id="15">With the provider of the sender it is usually examined whether the mail leads a harming program as appendix with itself.</seg>
<seg id="16">On the receiver systems a virus check is likewise made.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition the providers examine whether it concerns an annoying and unwanted Spam mail, which is directly deleted or away-sorted at least into a Spam folder.</seg>
<seg id="18">Do the robots have still another further task?</seg>
<seg id="19">In systems like GMail the robot determines also the information, which Google needs for placing context advertisement.</seg>
<seg id="20">If Anna and Benni communicate by GMail over her coming holiday trip, Google can fade in appropriate left to holiday offers.</seg>
<seg id="21">Do also unknown humans read too the emails?</seg>
<seg id="22">The probability that unauthorized people read too a mail, is extremely small.</seg>
<seg id="23">Theoretically is however possible.</seg>
<seg id="24">In companies frequently administrators have the possibility of reading too electronic post office.</seg>
<seg id="25">Also the law enforcement agencies and secret service have legal possibilities of intercepting or of taking to the knowledge emails.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition possible illegal espionage actions come.</seg>
<seg id="27">Is it possible to protect emails from reading too?</seg>
<seg id="28">With an encoding after the OpenPGP standard an email can be coded effectively against reading too.</seg>
<seg id="29">At high technical expenditure it is also possible to mask the meta data of email communication so that easily it cannot even be recognized who with whom communicated.</seg>

<seg id="2">Background is a possible lack of minister: The Evangelical-Lutheran regional church Hanover counts on the fact that the number of their will halve itself at present approximately 1,800 ministers and ministers according to current situation to 2030.</seg>
<seg id="3">For young people today the profession is very attractive and offers good future prospects, said minister Mathis Burfien (43) in the discussion with the protestant news service.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is attractive to be able to determine the work and routine of the day.</seg>
<seg id="5">Burfien the regional church for the first time assigned a minister on a full place to inspire young people for the theology study.</seg>
<seg id="6">At present less and less young people decide after the Abitur to study theology.</seg>
<seg id="7">Burfien attributes this to the process of the Entkirchlichung: “God voice is quiet, the world is loud”.</seg>
<seg id="8">The profession of large freedom and variety is coined.</seg>
<seg id="9">I am master of my calendar and can my emphasis set, where it is important to me.</seg>
<seg id="10">Ministers could be completely close as pastors with humans.</seg>
<seg id="11">They earned so much like teachers and could well on it live.</seg>
<seg id="12">Surely in the free economy more one pay, but theologians would have a safe employer.</seg>
<seg id="13">That comes to meet the young people today, those it not only around career, but go around a sense-fulfilled work.</seg>
<seg id="14">To information at present approximately 60 ministers go to the regional church, which covers three quarters of Lower Saxony, into the retirement per year.</seg>
<seg id="15">At the same time about 40 graduates of a theology study begin their Vikariat.</seg>
<seg id="16">In thinly populated peripheral areas like the resin, which can become Emsland or the turning country in the future it difficult to occupy places.</seg>
<seg id="17">Burfien wants to organize and to it also well-known people invite among other things study days for young people, which studied theology.</seg>
<seg id="18">The theology study offers broad training.</seg>

<seg id="2">Two YMCA employees from new South Wales (NSW) were accused of sexual crimes in connection with children, before 2011 reproaches were raised against the child male nurse Jonathan Lord from Caringbah, as the royal commission for sexual abuse of children experienced.</seg>
<seg id="3">But during the opening explanation before the commission the YMCA had explained, one had never had to do „in the organization with an incident from sexual child abuse to”.</seg>
<seg id="4">Managing director Phillip Hare was asked over a case, with which an YMCA employee had been accused of offences with child pornography, and another, with which a PE teacher of the YMCA Caringbah resound 1991 children entrusted because of the abuse to it one had condemned.</seg>
<seg id="5">Shed said Gail Furness, one the commission assisting attorney the fact that he knew from the first case which however did not know second.</seg>
<seg id="6">It granted, the opening explanation of the YMCA in relation to the commission likewise inaccurately in the statement was, „it external examinations of the YMCA gave, in which the YMCA was recognized as foremost front with child safety”.</seg>
<seg id="7">Proofs before the commission show rather that the YMCA was informed about the fact that it received the secondarylowest evaluation from four possible in a quality audit the department of the OF Education and Communities (ministry of education) in the August of the year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Shed, which began with 21 with the YMCA, granted, the management „from me to downward” during the attitude of lord failed and did not guarantee that employees realized themselves their obligations to announce offences against the guidelines to child safety.</seg>
<seg id="9">Lord had been condemned at the beginning of the year because of sexual offences at twelve boys during his two-year activity for the YMCA.</seg>
<seg id="10">He was condemned to at least six years prison.</seg>
<seg id="11">It sheds denied however that the YMCA would have a cultural problem, which had held employees to announce lords of offences regarding the security from children to.</seg>
<seg id="12">The employees stated, they would have offences observed, among other things that lord was alone with children, her privately as baby sitters cared for, them on its lap to sit let, to one said the fact that he had it dear and to play let children with his mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="13">Danielle Ockwell, whose superior was lord and who had asked for a training to the child protection, because she was anxious because of its behavior, stated that the child service chief Jacqui Barnat, which was in the YMCA Caringbah the superior lord was very more unapproachable „much intimidating and most time”.</seg>
<seg id="14">The managing director explained, he statements of employees would not accept, according to which these would not have dared to refund its superior message.</seg>
<seg id="15">Instead, then he said, rather its friendship with lord its faculty of judgement impaired, why they would not have announced him.</seg>
<seg id="16">It sheds explained, it communicated its opinion to the executive committee of the YMCA NSW that the lesson, which has to draw the organization from „the Jonathan lord incident” „an announcing” by employees of references, and the executive committee does not have it agreed.</seg>

<seg id="2">On approximately 120 m is received to Cologne a sewer from the Roman time below.</seg>
<seg id="3">Who visits Cologne, does not go past at the cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="4">Approximately 157 meters rise up the two towers into the sky and make it the second highest church building of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="5">But only few visitors, who admire the two delicate steeples, suspect that there is a quantity to discover also under the cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="6">Rainer Schulze is expert in things Cologne underworld.</seg>
<seg id="7">Meeting place for its guidance is direct the service center of Cologne tourism at the cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="8">The tour begins completely more unspectacular: “We catch in the underground parking on”, say Schulze.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the seventies the city fathers wanted a auto+fair city, and therefore only that stopped from the remains of the old city wall, which was not too large.</seg>
<seg id="10">Most users of the multi-storey car park rush therefore today also at the Roman remnants and turn off only their car.</seg>
<seg id="11">But who looks more exactly, in the parking deck an archaeological place of discovery separated by metal lattice bars discovers D2.</seg>
<seg id="12">To see about five meters are high ruins from handplate-large stones.</seg>
<seg id="13">“There is remains of the Roman city wall, which was built in the second half of the first century after Christ”, tells Schulze.</seg>
<seg id="14">Before it goes again back to the daylight, Schulze the participants on the upper park level still another view lets deep pit throw into a dark, 15 meter.</seg>
<seg id="15">That is the well of the old cathedral, which is unfortunately also hardly noticed.</seg>
<seg id="16">Next station of the tour is the praetorium, and here the participants rise again down into the depth.</seg>
<seg id="17">We experience here the seat of the once most powerful man north the alps, the Prätors of the CCAA.</seg>
<seg id="18">Which means CCAA, a visitor would like to know.</seg>
<seg id="19">“The abbreviation stands for “Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium”, which” means” so much on well German like “city of Roman right and city of the Agrippinenser, based among emperors Claudius at the place of the altar for the emperor cult.</seg>
<seg id="20">And with the praetorium it concerns the former governor palace, the center of power of the Roman empire on the Rhine.</seg>
<seg id="21">From the lobby of the exhibition leads a tunnel entrance to the Roman sewer, which is received on approximately 120 m here.</seg>
<seg id="22">“You can go along calmly a piece along the so-called Cloaca maxima, if you want”, muntert Schulze the guests up.</seg>
<seg id="23">A surprise has Schulze still.</seg>
<seg id="24">After it got at the cashier the key, he leads the group to a 16 meters deep, accessible pit.</seg>
<seg id="25">“We are now in the Mikvah, a ritual Jewish bath”, explain it.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Jewish community built its bath deeply into the ground, in order to come to the groundwater, which was indispensable for ritual ablutions.</seg>
<seg id="27">Until today different water levels are readable by changing levels of the Rhine in the lower end the Mikvah, whose origins decrease in the respected century.</seg>

<seg id="1">George Kerevan: European decartelization gives the choice to the Scots</seg>
<seg id="2">A new day, a new fright history to independence.</seg>
<seg id="3">This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is necessary, in order to step the Schengen area as condition for the EU membership.</seg>
<seg id="4">That supplies the keyword for stories over passport checks to Berwick and a border secured with barbed wire along the Hadrian's Wall.</seg>
<seg id="5">Indeed in the Strathclyde template to the possible economic advantages, which would bring more freedom to travel in remaining Europe with itself, but played this – as expected – was referred in the headlines no role.</seg>
<seg id="6">Also nobody mentioned that the EU member states bend into shape frequently their strict rules, if it is more favorable for them.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since Scotland does not belong at present to the Schengen area, the continued neglect for Brussels would be only a small concession in response for what one wants really from the Scots.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thus actually no story.</seg>
<seg id="9">And one, which came already in such a way into the years that it already resembles a fossil: The first time has I „independence means passport checks” - duck before at least 40 years belongs.</seg>
<seg id="10">An interesting point is lost with constant repeating of this age-old history.</seg>
<seg id="11">Why should one expect from an independent Scotland that it dances after the European whistle?</seg>
<seg id="12">Why the London yoke against of Brussels exchanges, particularly now?</seg>
<seg id="13">Those are the real European news: The large plan for the combination of Europe, seized after the war, is guessed/advised in the stagnation.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the euro crisis the project Europe died officially.</seg>
<seg id="15">Everywhere in the European Union win parties at ground, which are European Union-hostile or which euros would like to throw as common currency over board.</seg>
<seg id="16">Even in Germany the euro-sceptical party alternative for Germany – only this year based – could get hold of scarcely five million voices with the election to the Bundestag in September for itself and drive out thus effectively the free democrats (the equivalent to the British liberally Democrats) from the Bundestag.</seg>
<seg id="17">There was always domestic resistance against the plan to create federalistic Europe.</seg>
<seg id="18">The current economic crisis turns out however as turning point.</seg>
<seg id="19">Because of Berlin and the European central bank strict austerity policy in connection with the straitjacket, into which the respective national economy is forced by adherence to the common currency, are many humans of the opinion, the project Europe imposed went too far.</seg>
<seg id="20">The crisis of the euro has to do a little with the fact that national governments cause excessive budgetary deficits – that was only in Greece the case.</seg>
<seg id="21">Instead the euro system its members festgenagelt on rates of exchange, which are favorable for German exporters – and German politicians would like to leave that gladly in such a way.</seg>
<seg id="22">Without the possibility of a devaluation of the local currency south Europe with an inserted productivity disadvantage appears opposite Germany.</seg>
<seg id="23">The only possibility consists of shortening wages and public expenditures – spurred from Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Behind the current budget and currency problems a more deeply going European productivity problem lies.</seg>
<seg id="25">As consequence of Brussels „become green” energy guidelines – a code for the subsidization of French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumers – ordered pay the European industry compared to the United States the double for electricity and the quadruple for gas.</seg>
<seg id="26">That is an immobilizing cost disadvantage, as we could already see in Grangemouth.</seg>
<seg id="27">All wage fixing of the world do not protect the European petrochemical industry by cheap American slate gas into the corner to be pushed.</seg>
<seg id="28">As consequence a revolt pulls, up particularly in France, to the former Cheerleader of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="29">After the war the political elite of France saw the European Union as a vehicle, with which one could hold Germany in chess and lift Paris eye level with Washington.</seg>
<seg id="30">But Berlin does not need Paris any longer than gate for political authentication and Europe its own economic policy pushed open, with which the fastened French economy has to fight.</seg>
<seg id="31">The result: Of Marine Le Pen's Front National oriented towards the right and European Union-hostile a straight crucial by-election won and thus the governing socialists to place three referred.</seg>
<seg id="32">Front National is now the popular party in France with 24 percent of the votes – a time-fair warning for the British labour party that it cannot assume that, a splitting in the right spectrum would mean advantages automatically for the left one.</seg>
<seg id="33">What makes again popularity among the white Frenchmen of the working class won for Le Pen with their?</seg>
<seg id="34">She would like to use the European Union-elections next year in addition, an anti-European Union, to forge anti-common currency block in the European parliament.</seg>
<seg id="35">If the anti EUROPEAN Union parties fare with these elections well – and that is very well possible –, then such a block could dominate the European parliament for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="36">This is the point, on which I want outside: In too furthermore future will not come together the increasing resentment against the European Union and the common currency for the abolishment of the euro.</seg>
<seg id="37">The European Union will not disappear, but it will become rather something like „Europe (sovereigns) of the nations”, which favored general de Gaulle.</seg>
<seg id="38">Perhaps Germany and a few its satellite managing hold to the euro, but France and south Europe will return to their own currencies.</seg>
<seg id="39">I expect that Great Britain dissociates itself from this project in hope to curry favor itself with the USA.</seg>
<seg id="40">However Washington's increasing interest in the Pacific area puts close that Great Britain will be located alone in the Atlantic rain.</seg>
<seg id="41">Where does Scotland remain with all that?</seg>
<seg id="42">We can decide to be a region from (in last consequence) small England to.</seg>
<seg id="43">Or we can defend our own economic interests – to which also belongs to say Berlin and Brussels what it where put itself can.</seg>
<seg id="44">I assume, Scotland could drive in a looser European group completely well, if we keep our own currency.</seg>
<seg id="45">Co-operation with other, similarly thinking countries is simpler in föderierten Europe of the nations.</seg>
<seg id="46">Otherwise we should consider to follow suit it to Norway and keep our economic independence.</seg>
<seg id="47">The SNP government in Scotland actual remarkably – most successful political movement against the austerity policy in Europe and has 2011 a spectacular majority due to the refusal of the suggested (and made) shortening won which, which the labour Minister of Finance Alistair Darling and the following Tory Lib the coalition had to answer for.</seg>
<seg id="48">It would be ridiculous for Scotland to decide now for an independence to only get in order then forced upon of Berlin and Brussels an austerity policy.</seg>

<seg id="1">FAA: Aircraft passengers can use however electronic devices in airplanes now (no mobile phone discussions to lead)</seg>
<seg id="2">Airline passengers can hear now from the takeoff to the landing their electronic devices for reading, work, plays, music and viewing films use, however with the mobile phone not telephone, so the new guidelines, which were published on Thursday by the federal aviation administration (FAA) in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="3">But the passengers should not expect that these changes are converted immediately.</seg>
<seg id="4">How quickly they were implemented, at a press conference on the respective airline, Michael Huerta would depend explained FAA employees.</seg>
<seg id="5">The airlines must prove the FAA that airplanes correspond to the new guidelines and that the training manuals of the flight crew as well as the regulations for stowing the devices away updated it according to the new regulations.</seg>
<seg id="6">The FAA explained, her from some airlines plans had already received, which would like to develop the employment of portable electronic devices in airplanes.</seg>
<seg id="7">Under these airlines were also delta and JetBlue.</seg>
<seg id="8">„Depending upon condition of the plan we could approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon”, announced the FAA in an announcement.</seg>
<seg id="9">At present passengers smartphones, Tablets and other devices must switch off, if the airplane doors are closed.</seg>
<seg id="10">They may start it only then again if the airplane reached a height of three kilometers and the captain gives green light.</seg>
<seg id="11">With the entering the approach flight the aircraft passengers must switch and not be allowed to do it off again them not again start, before the airplane landed.</seg>
<seg id="12">After the new guidelines airlines, whose airplanes were secured against electronic disturbances, could permit, the devices to their passengers also with start to use landing and on the runway explained the FAA.</seg>
<seg id="13">Most new airliners and other fliers, which were reequipped for the use of Wi-Fi in larger heights, should correspond to the criteria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Laura Glading, Präsidentin of the professional association of professional flight attendants, welcomed the changes.</seg>
<seg id="15">„If the new regulation surely converted actual and we co-operate in this connection closely with the airline –, both side will profit from it”, to commentated Glading.</seg>
<seg id="16">We are honestly said it suffering to have to feel us with this topic such as Aufpasser.</seg>
<seg id="17">Internet connections to surfing, exchange of emails, text news or downloading data under three kilometers nevertheless remained further forbidden, described the authority.</seg>
<seg id="18">Passengers are requested, smartphones, to shift Tablets and other devices into the flight mode.</seg>
<seg id="19">Thus still none „Words With Friends”, the Scrabble resembling online game, which the actor Alec Baldwin played 2011 on its smartphones, when he had to leave public-effectively a jet of American Airlines, because he refused itself switching the equipment off while the airplane at the gate was parked.</seg>
<seg id="20">And heavier devices such as laptops must be also further stowed away, since a danger of injury exists here, if it by the cab fly.</seg>
<seg id="21">Mobile phone discussions during the flight remain likewise further forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="22">The adjustment competence for telephone calls is with the federal Communications Commission (FCC), not with the FAA.</seg>
<seg id="23">FAA possibly waives prohibition for certain electronic devices with takeoff and landing</seg>
<seg id="24">Mark Rosenker said last month of the road safety authority national Transportation Safety board, security expert for national traffic questions on of CBS news, mobile phone as risk was still regarded.</seg>
<seg id="25">„Mobile phone are real a problem, only because they could not cause potential disturbances with navigation equipment, but because we know of the FCC that the transmission from air can disturb also transmitting poles”, so Rosenker.</seg>
<seg id="26">A consulting committee of the industry, which was brought of the FAA for the investigation of this topic into being, recommended last month that the government permits a broader employment of personal electronic devices.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the last years the pressure increased to the FAA to loosen restrictions for the use.</seg>
<seg id="28">Critics like the democratic senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri do not hold the opinion, it give valid safety reasons for the prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="29">The restrictions are also increasingly more difficult to implement, because the use of the devices became pervasive.</seg>
<seg id="30">In some studies of it the speech which up to a third of the passengers switching the equipment off forgets or ignores, is.</seg>
<seg id="31">The FAA began 1966 to limit the use of electronic devices by airline passengers after reports over disturbances of navigation and communications equipments through from passengers carried UKW radios admits had become, which represented the newest technology trend at that time.</seg>
<seg id="32">New airplanes depend by far on electrical systems than earlier generations of aircraft, but they are also in such a way designed and authorized of the FAA that them electronic interference do not constitute anything.</seg>
<seg id="33">Airlines offer for some years Wi-Fi already to passengers, if the flight altitude is reached.</seg>
<seg id="34">The fliers adapted to Wi-Fi-systems are also more insensitive in relation to interference.</seg>
<seg id="35">The vast majority of the passenger airlines should be suitable for the stronger use of electronic devices after the new guidelines, said Huerta.</seg>
<seg id="36">The today's electronic devices deliver generally substantially less radio radiation than earlier generations.</seg>
<seg id="37">He vein for example deliver only minimum radiation, if one turns over.</seg>
<seg id="38">But with downloading or sending data the transmission values are stronger.</seg>
<seg id="39">Among the advocates of a loosening of the restrictions for the equipment use by passengers Amazon.com ranks.</seg>
<seg id="40">2011 loaded company employees a passenger airline of full Kindle he vein and made a test flight, in order to determine problems, could however none determine.</seg>
<seg id="41">Members of the FAA Beratungskomitees expressed mixed feelings, what concerns the risk with the use of devices.</seg>
<seg id="42">Douglas Kidd of the passenger federation national Association OF airline Passengers said, it was the opinion, the disturbance by the devices was genuine, even if the risk is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="43">Other committee members said, it give only isolated reports of pilots, who would speak for a disturbance of equipment services by the devices, and which were most of it very old.</seg>
<seg id="44">The committee recommended the FAA however to permit it to pilots to arrange during instrument landing under bad visibility a switching of the devices off by the passengers.</seg>
<seg id="45">A grouping from the travel branch welcomed the changes and called it reasonable adjustment for travelers, who would be extensively equipped with technology today.</seg>
<seg id="46">„We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience contradicts to Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association not security”, said.</seg>

<seg id="1">GEC-hung: No absolute protection possible</seg>
<seg id="2">“We want the inhabitants promptly into planning to merge”, open mayors Jens Häußler the citizen information event to the flood protection concept in GEC-hang.</seg>
<seg id="3">Approximately 80 participants had come into the community hall to express in order to let the planned measures be explained to place questions doubts and bring in ideas.</seg>
<seg id="4">Häußler got straight: “The last-finite decisions fell the members of the local council”.</seg>
<seg id="5">The flood, the GEC-hung to 15. May 2009, unprepared met, a drastic event was, which raised the question about preventive measures for the future, so Häußler.</seg>
<seg id="6">A river basin investigation had been given with the neighbour community Aidlingen in order, which is now basis for the flood protection concept in GEC-hung.</seg>
<seg id="7">“The protection as much as possible cultivated properties is the goal”, like that Häußler.</seg>
<seg id="8">At the basis put planning the protection from a loud German weather service is statistically every 100 years floods which can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="9">By a 15-percent addition is considered to the climate change.</seg>
<seg id="10">Among experts this is marked with “HQ 100aKlima”.</seg>
<seg id="11">The masses of water, which had led 2009 in GEC-hung to considerable damage, corresponded to a 1000-year old flood.</seg>
<seg id="12">“There is not an absolute protection, but we can obtain a relative improvement”, so Häußler.</seg>
<seg id="13">In order to obtain the protection HQ 100aKlima, must in GEC-hung approximately four million euros be invested, whereby the community can count on national subsidies at a value of approximately 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="14">Häußler pointed out however that it gives the promotion only if a total concept is converted.</seg>
<seg id="15">In addition the community is dependent on the co-operation of the citizens.</seg>
<seg id="16">A complex planning and licensing procedure must be completed.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the best case 2016 can be begun with the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="18">Among other things sees the protection concept, that in the past week in the local council was already presented (we reported) local measures in the supply of the river Irm from the Stammheimer valley forwards.</seg>
<seg id="19">Following the presentation of the flood protection concept the participants used the opportunity to bring in their requests.</seg>
<seg id="20">Among other things it was questioned why no more dams and retention basins were planned for the protection of the place.</seg>
<seg id="21">Gregor Kühn, Fachplaner of the assigned engineer's office forest and Corbe from hill home, which presented the concept, that it needs the interaction of all presented measures stressed, in order in the sum the desired goal to reach.</seg>
<seg id="22">Beyond that one is to be found held the most economical solution, so to Joachim Wald von Wald and Corbe.</seg>
<seg id="23">Displeasure prevailed with adjoining owners of the old place, who have suffering even with normal thunderstorm rains again and again under an overloading of the duct system.</seg>
<seg id="24">The problem is with the administration and first measures was already seized.</seg>
<seg id="25">Häußler pointed out however that the guidelines for duct systems were others, than for the flood protection and this may not be mixed.</seg>
<seg id="26">The community is obligated to lay the duct system out in such a way that two to three-year rain events could be borne.</seg>

<seg id="5">In case of the visit of the café of the same name at the Opschlag in the district town Kleve in range of vision to the university Rhine irrigation channel it does not have to remain with the pure Déjà Vu-feeling.</seg>
<seg id="6">Finally the café with the beautiful name has exactly the goal: an actual stay not only mental to make strongly always recurring experiencable but.</seg>
<seg id="7">Because it just joke makes and is simply beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="8">A view in the inner feelings at the Opschlag 8 gives immediately a good feeling to the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="9">The ultramodern, but does not cool café ambience looks like a place for well-being feeling.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here the team spoils the guest with most diverse coffee or cocktail variants with the founders Mirjam van the Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the point.</seg>

<seg id="27">“Beautiful, successfully and funny”, found the two 33-year old.</seg>
<seg id="28">But especially not everyone thing.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perhaps Daniel Büttner is not also therefore an expressed fan of event evenings: “One can make it just for not all right”.</seg>
<seg id="30">And with an event I respond in each case, which are interested also in special event.</seg>
<seg id="31">Therefore event rather the exception with us will be.</seg>

<seg id="1">Jumbo jet manufacturers argue in the face of large orders about seat width</seg>
<seg id="2">Between prominent aircraft manufacturers it came to an argument over the width of seats in the tourist class with long-haul flights, which indicates the tone for a bitter collision on the Dubai air show this month.</seg>
<seg id="3">The controversy turns around the seat width, which is offered to passengers during long flights in the tourist class – not always those, for which airlines at most strive, but this proven area places the key for the efficiency statements with the newest airplanes of airbus SAS and Boeing Co. .</seg>
<seg id="4">Airbus demanded this week a branch standard, which a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 duty) in the tourist class prescribes, but the US-American archrival Boeing says, which the airlines should decide.</seg>
<seg id="5">The argument comes to one time, since the aircraft manufacturers compete to sell still larger versions of their twin-engine long haul fliers and with the event of 17. until 21 November orders for record expect.</seg>
<seg id="6">Like the rear part of the airplane decorated actual in particular whether it rows with nine or ten seats gives –, is crucial for the indicated economic results, which new „mini jumbo jet” - design to supply is.</seg>
<seg id="7">Boeing stated, its modernized „777X” seizes 406 people with seats in the tourist class, which are over 17 inch wide and permit in such a way ten per row.</seg>
<seg id="8">Airbus explained, the competitive version of the A350 carries 350 people in 18 inch wide seats in the tourist class, whereby there are nine per row.</seg>
<seg id="9">Airplane giants distribute frequently blows over technical details by means of advertisement in the technical literature.</seg>
<seg id="10">Now airbus appeals before the Dubai air show, where the 777X will also make a running over 100 orders presumably, directly to the public.</seg>
<seg id="11">Recently the enterprise presented an announcement, which is the beginning of a new indicator war could and backers a picture showed, in which three people together-squeezed in a restaurant sits, and in addition the title: „You would accept that?”</seg>
<seg id="12">„Boeing suggests long-haul flights in seats, which are closer than regional turbo Props”, says airbus distribution boss of John Leahy.</seg>
<seg id="13">In view of changed nutrition habits the people change more thickly, but airplane seats to have not radically.</seg>
<seg id="14">Between the early 1970ern, when the modern long haul travel defined Boeing 747, and the end of the century the weight of the male average American increased so the data of the US-Ministry of Health between 40 and 49 years by ten percent.</seg>
<seg id="15">The waist extent of the male average American in 21. Century amounts to according to US-American health statistics 100.8 cm.</seg>
<seg id="16">Airbus says, its rival adhere to a seat concept from the 1950ern, when the average body extent freshly baptized „jet set” was narrower.</seg>
<seg id="17">One accomplished, thus airbus, investigations, which proved that an additional duty (2.54 cm) per seat increases the sleep quality by 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="18">Boeing denies the numbers from airbus to the seat-measured and says, it does not stand not in the discretion of the manufacturers to decide, how the balance between flight tariffs and facility arranges airlines.</seg>
<seg id="19">The enterprise explains also, according to investigations the experience depends on the plane on more than the seat width.</seg>
<seg id="20">„It runs out really to give airlines flexibility so that they can do that, what it in her opinion must, to be over successful”, the flight cab expert describes Kent Craver von Boeing.</seg>
<seg id="21">They would not like that we dictate to them, which makes them for profitable.</seg>
<seg id="22">They know their business better than every different one.</seg>
<seg id="23">For aircraft passengers it concerns more elbow freedom, but for manufacturers it becomes increasingly a topic, which can affect the sales.</seg>
<seg id="24">Behind the argument running stands around airplane orders with an estimated volume from at least 700 billion US Dollar after list prices in the coming decades, which could affect effectively the export balance of the USA or Europe.</seg>
<seg id="25">As Reuters reported for the first time in July, the seat layout is the driving strength behind the argument around the new jets.</seg>
<seg id="26">Both airbus and Boeing maintain 20 percent more efficiency per seat with their newest twin-engine long haul designs as the market leader in this segment, the 365-sitzige Boeing 77-300ER.</seg>
<seg id="27">The statements of Boeing to the results depend partly on the fact that the 777X is compared with its ten seats per row with the original design by nine seats in the 777.</seg>
<seg id="28">The increased costs per unit are still smaller than with machines with ten seats per row, used at present.</seg>
<seg id="29">„Boeing squeezes therefore more seat into its airplane, around it our products to make more competitive”, says Kevin Keniston, Leiter for passenger comfort with the European airbus.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other hand say analysts, full cabs with ten seats per row with existing 777s pointed on it that many passengers decided for the closer arrangement, what with cheaper flight tariffs accompany could.</seg>
<seg id="31">„Eighteen duty seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic criterion the airbus offer of the threat steered by the 777”, says Mary Kirby, Expertin for cab facility, foundress and publisher of Runway Girl network.</seg>
<seg id="32">Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but a catalog of suppliers, from which the airlines can select.</seg>
<seg id="33">The world travelers jet salespersen carry even tape with itself, in order to check the facility with the competition.</seg>
<seg id="34">Even if they advertize the comfort, then nevertheless all manufacturers offer also to jets with highly compressed arrangement for cheap airlines and regional flights.</seg>
<seg id="35">Airbus offers a A350 with zehnsitzigen rows, however according to own statement still none sold.</seg>
<seg id="36">Until recently airbus stressed, like importantly more adaptability of the cabs is and offered for some jets broad seats at the courses.</seg>
<seg id="37">Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets experts say the fact that the call will probably deflagrate after a new branch standard but from the wave from 777X-Verkäufen to divert could.</seg>

<seg id="1">The veganism is subordinate to vegetarianism according to lexicons, differs from this however nevertheless in completely substantial way.</seg>
<seg id="2">Because during vegetarians this Schlemmereien takes the liberty, does not stand the consumption of layer cake, ice or a strong Edamer not on the menu of a vegan.</seg>
<seg id="3">Milk, cheese, egg, beside that renouncement of meat and fish leaves the vegan of the all consumption of animal products off also honey is answered in the negative.</seg>
<seg id="4">Which remains, one may ask oneself, but on closer inspection the vegane nutrition world is characterised by a considerable imaginativeness.</seg>
<seg id="5">“Spreads are much like”, explain Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the local reform house, who holds a variety ready of special products for vegans.</seg>
<seg id="6">Also Reuben Proctor visits the shop in the cathedral lane gladly.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since 13 years lives the native New Zealander vegan, in Lampertheim finds he (nearly) everything, which he needs to the life. “placed 1997 I mean nutrition over and became vegetarian”.</seg>
<seg id="8">Over the turn of the century took place then the next step and I became vegan.</seg>
<seg id="9">“The conviction did not however only come because of the nutrition, but due to the shoe choice”, says Proctor, which prefers imitation leather normal leather.</seg>
<seg id="10">It recognized that it goes also in other everyday interests without animal products.</seg>
<seg id="11">Primarily is vegan its an ethics.</seg>
<seg id="12">“I do not want that animals for me must die”, express Proctor the maxim of the vegans, who extend to the entire consumer behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="13">Instead of Burgern to afterwards-mourn scrambled eggs or rubber bears the vegan discovered fast completely new products, rose the enthusiasm.</seg>
<seg id="14">“It is not a double bonus”, says Proctor today, “actually represents vegan its renouncement, no asceticism, but it is an enrichment”. The acceptance that one reduces the selection of food options with the nutrition conversion, attributes Proctor rather to the power of the habit.</seg>
<seg id="15">And exactly these conditioning let some still so well meant attempt fail also.</seg>
<seg id="16">“The craze factor is a completely crucial factor, which lets many give up fast, similarly as when smoking”, sets up to Proctor a comparison.</seg>
<seg id="17">And objects: “Certain tastes are not at the animal to fasten”.</seg>
<seg id="18">Often there is the spices or the kind of the preparation, which constitute the taste.</seg>
<seg id="19">“One can produce in addition, in other way the same effect”, clarifies the vegan.</seg>
<seg id="20">To a barbecue Proctor bring along for example eggplants, mushrooms and also a few Veganwürste.</seg>
<seg id="21">It pays attention to a balanced, varied nutrition, with which it is to taste quite also once hearty.</seg>
<seg id="22">Naturally one would like to have something between the teeth, that is legitimate.</seg>
<seg id="23">“It is to taste, but that is not only to animal food to reduce”, like that Proctor.</seg>
<seg id="24">, He did not suffer health damage up to eating disorders, a further widespread acceptance.</seg>
<seg id="25">For me the conversion had a positive aspect.</seg>
<seg id="26">I do not take up strange cholesterol and have a increased vitamin portion.</seg>
<seg id="27">There are high speed athletes, which exclusively nourish themselves vegan.</seg>
<seg id="28">“My blood values are in the best way, I can often be checked”, betray Proctor.</seg>
<seg id="29">In particular before the lack of vitamin many Vegansimus critics warn B12.</seg>
<seg id="30">“There animals with animal feeds to be fed, instead of grazing on the pasture, it is questionable whether in the meat, which one buys in the cooling chest, which is high Vitamin-B12-Anteil”, finds Proctor.</seg>
<seg id="31">For vegans give it besides the possibility of taking the Coenzym in the form of tablets to itself.</seg>
<seg id="32">“My B12-Werte is correct”, explains it.</seg>
<seg id="33">Far ways does not have Proctor for the food procurement to go.</seg>
<seg id="34">Staple food gives it finally everywhere and to each supermarket has meanwhile soy milk and other products.</seg>
<seg id="35">I find everything that I need, locally.</seg>
<seg id="36">Only now and then I buy something special.</seg>
<seg id="37">“Many people surveyed that just only the finished products are expensive, but it in such a way behaves “usual” finished products well-known-measured also”.</seg>
<seg id="38">Anyway the preparation of veganer courts is by far more favorably and less time-consuming, than generally accepted.</seg>
<seg id="39">“In the house kitchen it gives to discover much, a few small tricks can one good, if not partly better results obtain”, say Proctor.</seg>
<seg id="40">Margarine instead of butter, somewhat more baking powder and carbonic acid instead of egg, with its veganen cheesecakes could bring also its parents-in-law to Proctor to being astonished.</seg>
<seg id="41">The vegan lends a new spice to family celebrations.</seg>
<seg id="42">That has dynamics, if one cooks together, has that a new value.</seg>
<seg id="43">“The situations, which can develop thereby, are as differently as humans themselves”, say Proctor.</seg>
<seg id="44">Naturally was already brought to it in addition, skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="45">Doesn't my meal taste to you any longer?</seg>
<seg id="46">“Target I now badly feel, because I drink milk?” - with such questions one must act as vegans with intuitive feeling.</seg>
<seg id="47">“I do not reject humans, I am part of this society”, would like Proctor no enclave existence to eke out.</seg>
<seg id="48">And the everyday life world appears more exactly regarded then not at all in such a way veganfremd as assumed - and the vegans not as in the everyday life reduced as generally accepted.</seg>
<seg id="49">Also nearly Food is permitted.</seg>
<seg id="50">There are French fries everywhere!</seg>
<seg id="51">“Many kebab shops offer falafel, or just, Proctor says a vegetarian Yufka”.</seg>
<seg id="52">In a pizzeria it changes over to pasta courts, or orders just a pizza without cheese, everything a question of the habit.</seg>
<seg id="53">The restaurants adjust themselves so slowly to it.</seg>
<seg id="54">“As I began before 13 years to nourish me vegan was still many more difficult all”, can the New Zealander a development make: “One must talk with the people, her on it draws attention”.</seg>
<seg id="55">“If sufficient demands come, are perhaps bent them to supplement the menu”, hope it.</seg>
<seg id="56">Vegane restaurants develop, like for example the galley in Mannheim or the café bird-freely.</seg>
<seg id="57">Proctor preserves the desire that also different restaurants stand at least a veganes court on the menu have.</seg>
<seg id="58">Strictly speaking are vegane courts for all there.</seg>
<seg id="59">Everyone can eat it, it is thus exactly the opposite of exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="60">“Meat dishes are exclusive against it, in the true sense of the word, because they close others out”, determine Proctor.</seg>
<seg id="61">“If one food scandals to avoid wants, then veganism is a safe way to make the all-largest part from the beginning impossible”, says Proctor.</seg>
<seg id="62">The purchase of veganer products can be somewhat difficult however at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="63">In particular if one learns to understand, which also into peanuts animal additives contain as color givers its can, one seems with the observance of the ethics with so many hurdles to leave and traps fast the courage.</seg>
<seg id="64">Therefore Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen did not only write a book: “Veganissimo - the many ingredients, which are buried food in addition, detergents, explain animal ingredients and their alternatives”.</seg>
<seg id="65">“Gradually one develops a scanner view and knows, to which indications and logos one has to pay attention “it is sometimes better small steps to do than stop or to trip”, white Proctor.</seg>
<seg id="66">The veganism, it is an important moral pointer, which strikes on consciousness.</seg>
<seg id="67">Perhaps it creates it not completely that one puts its habits down, but at least can it the consumer teach to analyze its habits critically.</seg>

<seg id="1">New anti-nicotine vaccine could make for the pleasure when smoking from</seg>
<seg id="2">Scientists developed an anti-nicotine vaccine, which joke at smoking spoil could.</seg>
<seg id="3">Only one dose of the vaccine could protect mice a life long against nicotine addiction.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before tests at humans still further attempts are needed, which can take still some years, but professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical college in New York said, the first results were good.</seg>
<seg id="5">„We are very hopeful the fact that this kind of inoculation strategy can help once millions of smokers, who tried to stop and, had to have tried but experience all methods out available on the market that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches”, so Cornell.</seg>
<seg id="6">The new vaccine contains a harmless virus, which was changed in such a way that it contains the genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="7">The virus infects selectively the liver cells, which produce then a constant river of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="8">The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them, before they reach the brain, whereby a smoker nicotine High does not experience.</seg>
<seg id="9">In attempts inoculated mice, to which nicotine was given, maintained their normal level of activity.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mice without vaccination against it would have taken, explained one „to time-out” the researchers, an indication for the fact that nicotine had reached its brain.</seg>
<seg id="11">The experiments are descriptive in the trade paper Science Translational Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="12">Earlier tobacco vaccines failed, because they contained antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="13">Vaccinations had to be so frequently given for the maintenance of the antibody level that they were expensive and unpractical.</seg>
<seg id="14">But the costs of the new vaccine are probably clearly lower, because it transforms liver cells into antibody factories.</seg>
<seg id="15">As professor Crystal said, in such a way a future vaccine for humans, if it were completely safe, could be given to children, before they came into temptation to try a cigarette and nicotine addiction to prevent.</seg>
<seg id="16">More probably however it is that smokers would use it, in order to stop.</seg>
<seg id="17">„You know then: If they begin again to smoke, feel them because of the nicotine vaccine no more pleasure thereby, and helps them, the habit to put down”, describes it.</seg>
<seg id="18">British scientists said, the results were interesting, warned however at the same time, is necessary still further research.</seg>

<seg id="7">„Today the Egyptian people put the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, a genuine democracy and stability”, said the 60-year old Mursi, an engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, to a fundamentalist group, trained in the USA, which had been taken since its establishment before 84 years usually as forbidden organization of the respective government sharply in its sights.</seg>

<seg id="1">Frontier Airlines raises fees for hand baggage</seg>
<seg id="2">Frontier Airlines plans to require up to 100 US Dollar from passengers to who would like to stow hand baggage away on their flight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Frontier Airlines intends to compute up to 100 US Dollar for a piece hand baggage and 2 dollar for coffee or lemonade even if in the announcement on Wednesday it were to be read that passengers might keep the whole box.</seg>
<seg id="4">The new fee is valid for hand baggage in the rack over the seat, small bags under the seat is further free.</seg>
<seg id="5">Frontier explained, one computes 25 US Dollar, if the fee is in advance paid, and 100 US Dollar with travelers, who paid only at the gate.</seg>
<seg id="6">Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said to worry the fee of 100 US Dollar aimed off to move travelers before over the payment.</seg>
<seg id="7">„We would like not to compute this sum”, explained them.</seg>
<seg id="8">Airlines began 2008 to require for the first and second given up luggage item fees.</seg>
<seg id="9">Passengers, who tried, to go around these plugged therefore as much as possible in the hand baggage, which has as a consequence that the racks over the seat are frequently overcrowded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Fees are a possibility of inducing passengers of taking less also on board.</seg>
<seg id="11">O'Malley said, with the new fee does not go it not really therefore, money earning.</seg>
<seg id="12">It concerns the most faithful customers from Frontier, which would have expressed clearly that it becomes ever heavier, to find place in the subject over the seat.</seg>
<seg id="13">Passengers, who buy your tickets on the website of the airline, do not have to pay.</seg>
<seg id="14">That means that perhaps a passenger at the gate of Frontier may carry a luggage item forward free of charge, which must pay next person however to 100 dollar for a comparable luggage item.</seg>
<seg id="15">O'Malley explained, the website of Frontier and the check in procedures was changed, so that the passengers were informed about the fee, before they would come to the gate.</seg>
<seg id="16">The new hand baggage fee of Frontier does not come into force only in the summer, an exact date gives it yet.</seg>
<seg id="17">Passengers grumble frequently about luggage additions and other fees, but airlines fall back gladly to it.</seg>
<seg id="18">They argue the fact that the transport of the luggage costs money and passengers should pay this service, if they wished it.</seg>
<seg id="19">Many at Wall Street regard the new luggage fees as indications for the fact that the airlines take enough money, in order to cover after years of the losses the costs from air passage to.</seg>
<seg id="20">Most leave so far however the fingers of fees for hand baggage.</seg>
<seg id="21">Spirit airlines Inc. required before three years as first fees for hand baggage and followed later Allegiant air, likewise a low cost airline.</seg>
<seg id="22">The only other airline with a such fee is Hungarian Wizz Air, explained the airline advisor Jay Sorensen, which pursues the extra charges attentively.</seg>
<seg id="23">He estimated in a report from December 2011 that the hand baggage fee Spirit brings in annually 50 million US Dollar.</seg>
<seg id="24">Sorensen, which held in former times a leading position at Midwest Airlines, flew recently with Spirit and was curious, which would expect him at the gate, if passengers were confronted with the unusual hand baggage fee of the enterprise.</seg>
<seg id="25">„The Boarding process belonged to the smoothest, which I had experienced, said in my career in aviation” he.</seg>
<seg id="26">I expected to see tooth crunching and palpable discussions at the gate.</seg>
<seg id="27">„The airplane was full”, explained it, „and the Boarding ran as lubricated.”</seg>
<seg id="28">Frontier follows Spirit also with the 2 dollar, which are required for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.</seg>
<seg id="29">The enterprise explained the fact that passengers, the lemonade or juice bought whom might keep whole box and coffee is free of charge refilled.</seg>
<seg id="30">Water is further free.</seg>
<seg id="31">US Airways had tried 2008 briefly to require for refreshment beverages money made this however seven months later again retrogressive, after passengers had weighted and no other large society were pulled tight.</seg>
<seg id="32">Frontiers step to raise fees for the hand baggage if passengers do not buy directly at the airline, is the recent initiative, with which customers are to be steered on the own website.</seg>
<seg id="33">Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz 10 to 25 US Dollar per sold ticket.</seg>
<seg id="34">That supplies an incentive to all societies with for inducing passengers to the direct purchase with them instead of over an online travel agency.</seg>
<seg id="35">Frontier went in this range however furthest.</seg>
<seg id="36">In September the enterprise began to assign when reservation over an online travel agency only half so many frequent flyer miles.</seg>
<seg id="37">On Wednesday the miles were shortened again on 25 percent of the air route.</seg>
<seg id="38">An air passage with Frontier over 1000 miles, booked with a third provider, brings in therefore only 250 miles for customers.</seg>
<seg id="39">Passengers can reserve also exclusively with the direct purchase on the website of Frontier places.</seg>
<seg id="40">Frontier has a faithful customer master at its seat in Denver, but the business shrinks and the enterprise loses money.</seg>
<seg id="41">Proceeds decreased by 9 percent and the flight capacity shrank scarcely 13 percent in the first quarter, as in the financial statement is to be read, that on Wednesday by the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc., were published.</seg>
<seg id="42">Republic tried to get in the context of sale of the society finances of Frontier into the grasp.</seg>

<seg id="7">Subsequently, it went over the financial center around Wall Street to the memorial place of the 11. September.</seg>
<seg id="8">On the third day the pupils of the 373-meter-high convenient observation platform of the Empire State Buildings could win an overview of the fascinatingly large city and enjoy the prospect.</seg>
<seg id="9">Afterwards it went through hectic driving of the New Yorker roads over the Rockefeller center to the Central Park, which offered an ideal opportunity for short staying in the autumn sun.</seg>
<seg id="10">After a short flight from New York to Boston the pupils arrived in the meantime in their host families and experience to the Weymouth High School the everyday school life.</seg>

<seg id="4">The investigation officials of the sheriff of Lowndes County came at the conclusion that Johnson died in a tragic accident, which doubts the family of the 17-year old however.</seg>
<seg id="5">„You are convinced of the fact that their son was murdered”, explained Benjamin Crump, the lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, opposite FoxNews.com.</seg>
<seg id="6">They would have never believed, it had died in such a way, as it concluded the sheriff.</seg>
<seg id="7">„You are the opinion that it lacks to each logic, against the laws of physics like also contrary to common sense offence”, so Crump.</seg>

<seg id="16">„I represent the view that a sufficient basis exists, said for a formal determination” it.</seg>
<seg id="17">Moorlands explained opposite reporters, the initial autopsy point on the fact that Johnson at the consequences of one position-caused „asphyxiation” had died.</seg>
<seg id="18">A second autopsy showed, so however another cause of death moorlands.</seg>
<seg id="19">„There is a set of questions, which must be answered or confirmed”, said he.</seg>

<seg id="1">John Kerry explained in an unprecedented confession, the US-espionage went „inadequately too far”</seg>
<seg id="2">John Kerry suggested macerating the repelling attitude of the USA with an unexpected confession regarding her monitor programs, by saying, the espionage in certain cases „inadequately too far went”.</seg>
<seg id="3">In addition the minister of foreign affairs admitted, it would carry together with Barack Obama the responsibility for the fact that one had switched to „autopilot”, when the explosive exposures of the Whistleblowers Edward Snowden became public over the espionage activities of the NSA.</seg>
<seg id="4">By the oozed information the US Government is guessed/advised into a diplomatic storm of indignation of sides of their allied ones.</seg>
<seg id="5">With a speech to the open Government conference in London, transferred by video connection, said Kerry: „Whole without question have the president and I as well as different one in the government of some things experienced, which ran off quasi by autopilot, simply because the ability in addition existed, which naturally decreases still to the Second World War and the difficult years of the cold war as well as to 11 September.”</seg>
<seg id="6">Subsequently, it confessed as a first high-ranking member of the US-American government that the US-espionage had exceeded a border, in addition, stressed that no rights had been abused.</seg>
<seg id="7">He said: „In some cases that could be done inadequately too far.”</seg>
<seg id="8">The president is decided to create clarity and accomplishes therefore a thorough investigation, so that nobody must have the feeling, here takes place abuse.</seg>
<seg id="9">I insure you that the rights of innocent people during this process are not impaired.</seg>
<seg id="10">Kerry insisted however on the fact that those was NSA a strength of the good one and had been saved by their monitoring procedures many lives.</seg>
<seg id="11">It added: „We have to do it with a new world, in which humans are ready, into air to blow up itself.”</seg>
<seg id="12">There is a radical extremism in the world, which is obsessed on it, to kill humans to air to blow up and governments attack.</seg>
<seg id="13">What would thus be, if one were able to intercept and stop, before it happens?</seg>
<seg id="14">We actually prevented aircraft crashes, attacks on buildings and the murder of humans, because we experienced before of such plans.</seg>
<seg id="15">Meanwhile US-American legislator to Europe will travel, in order to scatter the doubts against the alleged American espionage and to convince the Europeans from the necessity to co-operate with the anti-terror efforts further with the USA how the chairman of the senate sub-committee for European affairs explained on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="16">Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said, it had spoken and was anxious this week with representatives of the European parliament and other people because of their threats not to take part due to frustration over the monitoring by national the Security Agency any longer in anti-terrorist organizations.</seg>
<seg id="17">„It is very important for the national security interests of the USA the fact that the Europeans remain regarding our common efforts against the terrorism also on board”, explained Murphy, who sits for the first time as a democrat in the senate and as a chairman of the senate sub-committee for foreign relations and European affairs is active in an interview in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="18">In addition I go to Europe, in order to make clear there that we must co-operate in the fight against terror further, regardless of its annoyance over the NSA programs.</seg>
<seg id="19">Media reports, according to which those seized NSA millions of telephone data in Europe, have the relations to unite US-allying loaded, although the director/conductor of the secret service explained this week, the reports are unfounded and were based on a misunderstanding of the meta data, which were collected by NATO allying and exchanged with the United States.</seg>
<seg id="20">Other exposures quoted out from Snowden passed on documents, according to which those had world-wide supervised NSA the mobile phone of Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 further heads of state.</seg>
<seg id="21">The director/conductor of the national intelligences, James Clapper, defended the espionage with allied one as necessary and explained, this was usual on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="22">In all tumult Murphy, its authority the ready travel of the congress said forwards, which was to take place this year, and, the delegation hoped members from both parties and chambers will cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">The names of the other participating delegates are to be published in the coming days.</seg>
<seg id="24">He said, exact travel route is still prepared.</seg>
<seg id="25">While Murphy stressed, the purpose of the travel was the improvement of the relations, spoke it also of the fact that it would give some „serious words”.</seg>
<seg id="26">He said, the European governments would have to be opposite honest their population over the kind of espionage programs, which used them for years.</seg>
<seg id="27">„We can change our monitor programs and protect so the rights of the Europeans better, these must in addition, to the fact resign itself that we are not the only one, which spy”, so Murphy.</seg>
<seg id="28">Meanwhile on the weekend a travel lines up into the Near East and to Poland, in order to argue there with resentment over the US-American strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran as well as the US-American monitoring activities for John Kerry.</seg>

<seg id="1">Esa decides on large space missions: Missions for billions</seg>
<seg id="2">Far planet, gravitation waves or black holes - experts of the European space agency must agree now on two large-scale projects, which want to start them in the next years.</seg>
<seg id="3">30 proposals stood to the selection, five still are in running.</seg>
<seg id="4">Far one worlds.</seg>
<seg id="5">More than 1000 planets with other stars already found astronomers.</seg>
<seg id="6">Whether it gives at least on some of it lives, does not know.</seg>
<seg id="7">The selection falls heavily: Is one to look for gravitation waves?</seg>
<seg id="8">Or rather the origin of the cosmos investigate?</seg>
<seg id="9">Search or for earthsimilar planets and thus perhaps extraterrestial life discover?</seg>
<seg id="10">These questions arise the straight responsible persons of the European space agency Esa.</seg>
<seg id="11">For their program “Cosmic vision” look for it ideas for two large space projects, which are to make progress with the research crucially.</seg>
<seg id="12">The budget for such “L-missions” is approximately in each case with a billion euro.</seg>
<seg id="13">The start will be presumably 2028 and 2034.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the beginning of Septembers met into of Paris the elite of the European space research, in order to discuss proposals for such missions.</seg>
<seg id="15">30 ideas stood to the debate, five of it now into the closer choice came.</seg>
<seg id="16">Numerous committees examine the proposals, probe with the researchers.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the next days a final decision is to fall by the scientific program committee.</seg>
<seg id="18">Altogether the Esa selected four large questions, on which the missions the 2007 initiated program “Cosmic vision” answers to find are.</seg>
<seg id="19">What are the conditions for the emergence of planets and lives?</seg>
<seg id="20">The exact procedures with the emergence of stars from large gas clouds - and concomitantly the emergence of planets, which circle these stars - lie still in proverbial darkening.</seg>
<seg id="21">A large infrared telescope in the universe could penetrate this darkness.</seg>
<seg id="22">And if a star possesses planets, under which life can develop for circumstances there?</seg>
<seg id="23">In order to follow to this question, 2017 are to start the space telescope “Cheops”, with which 500 already well-known planetary systems in our closer environment are examined more exactly.</seg>
<seg id="24">The possibilities are however limited, Cheops are a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="25">With larger instruments the astronomers could illustrate earthsimilar planets and analyze and for “bio markers” look for even the composition of their atmospheres in such a way: Gases, which are considered as indication for biological activity.</seg>
<seg id="26">How does the solar system function?</seg>
<seg id="27">Also this question is to give final information on it, there are which conditions for the emergence of lives.</seg>
<seg id="28">An important role plays the magnetic activity of a star and the reciprocal effect of its magnetic field as well as particle radiation with the planetary system, outgoing from it.</seg>
<seg id="29">In our solar system these procedures can be examined exemplary.</seg>
<seg id="30">With “solarly the orbiter” the Esa already granted a mission of the M-class (the budget is there with approximately to a half billion euro) for this question.</seg>
<seg id="31">The probe is to start 2017 and to observe surface and activity of the sun exactly.</seg>
<seg id="32">Are of great interest to the researchers also Jupiter and its moons.</seg>
<seg id="33">They want to find out, which role the giant planet played with the development of the solar system.</seg>
<seg id="34">But the Esa plans first that altogether the three L-missions of the “Cosmic vision” - program.</seg>
<seg id="35">The probe “Juice” (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) presumably begins its travel 2022.</seg>
<seg id="36">Later it reaches and is eight years Jupiter the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy moons Europe, Callisto and Ganymed to examine.</seg>
<seg id="37">What are the basic physical laws of the universe?</seg>
<seg id="38">The universe offers many possibilities of studying and of examining subject under extreme conditions in such a way whether us admitted of laws of nature are there still valid.</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps are also deviations, which could point the way to a new theory to the physicists, under whose roof all well-known laws of nature be united can.</seg>
<seg id="40">How did the universe develop and what does it consist of?</seg>
<seg id="41">13.7 billion years ago our cosmos resulted from the Big Bang.</seg>
<seg id="42">Beside the common subject, of which stars, planets and organisms as we consist, there are us dark matter, whose gravity galaxies and galaxy cluster holds together, and dark energy, by whose working the expansion of the universe accelerates itself.</seg>
<seg id="43">So far the researchers know neither, who physical laws were valid in the first fractions of a second of the Big Bang, nor from which dark matter and exists dark energy.</seg>
<seg id="44">With “Euclid” the Esa also here already granted a M-mission, whose start is intended for 2020.</seg>
<seg id="45">With a special telescope the probe is to examine the distribution of the subject in the universe for the first time in the entire sky and to make in such a way conclusions possible on the condition of dark matter and dark energy.</seg>
<seg id="46">Who could make a running</seg>
<seg id="47">Of the 30 proposals in the end the selective procedure only two will remain remaining.</seg>
<seg id="48">“E-Lisa” has the best opportunities on a grant as L-mission, a demanding concept to the proof of gravitation waves according to opinion of many experts.</seg>
<seg id="49">Among them physicists understand changes in the structure of the space-time, which had forecast Albert Einstein before nearly 100 years.</seg>
<seg id="50">They were not proven until today.</seg>
<seg id="51">Elisa could create that, hopes the scientists behind the project.</seg>
<seg id="52">The mission plans a detector consisting of two or three probes, which is stationed in the universe.</seg>
<seg id="53">It could prove gravitation waves, which developed with the Big Bang contrary to plants on earth also, and so new realizations over the emergence of the cosmos to supply.</seg>
<seg id="54">Four further proposals still compete around the second L-mission: a large Roentgen telescope named “Athena”, which is to investigate among other things black holes, “Icy Planets”, a further mission to the outside planets of the solar system, “Prism”, a mission for the measurement of the cosmic background radiation, and the “exoplanet Finder”, which is to seek out and examine earthsimilar planets.</seg>
<seg id="55">Among other things proposals to the sample return motion of Mars, for the research of moon, Venus and asteroids as well as to sun physics were already ruled out.</seg>

<seg id="4">One of 20 children in the United States has in the meantime a food allergy.</seg>
<seg id="5">The spreading of food allergies among children increased 1997 and 2007 according to CDC between by 18 percent.</seg>
<seg id="6">The guidelines contain information for schools, which is to be supposed to wake a consciousness for food allergies with faculty and the employees and as with children be gone around, who show allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also recommended that schools have Epinephrin available – the autoinjection of the brand EpiPen is most frequently used –, in order to be able to meet a potentially deadly hypersensitivity reaction.</seg>
<seg id="8">The legislators in the Federal States changed recently the regulations, so that schools Epinephrin can keep more simply available.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the report also a list is contained of typical symptoms, which are called by children, who exhibit an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="6">“These trusts are stupidly, if they mean, them could under the radar away dig through itself”, said the prosecutor general of the US-district Southern California, Laura Duffy, at a press conference before a depot in San Diego, where an end of the tunnel had been discovered.</seg>
<seg id="7">To the drug gangs eloquently Duffy insured: “If your far such tunnels builds and tries to use she are we decided, an enormous wasting of your dirty money to make”.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both the US-authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a continuous fight against the drug trusts.</seg>

<seg id="15">The tunnel has a cross section of 1.20 meters height and 90 centimeters width.</seg>
<seg id="16">It would have been also suitable in order to promote the illegal immigration direction the USA.</seg>
<seg id="17">Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine find.</seg>
<seg id="18">Third, a Mexican, was seized because of the seized marijuana.</seg>
<seg id="19">Lifelong freedom withdrawal threatens all three as maximum penalty, as officials said.</seg>
<seg id="20">Since 2006 eight such tunnels were discovered, continued to be called it to the press conference in San Diego.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is however the first time that in such a tunnel construction cocaine was found.</seg>
<seg id="22">Normally cocaine in small amounts is smuggled and not by tunnels.</seg>
<seg id="23">This shows the “despair” of the drug gangs, whose traditional routes are cut off in the meantime, said Bill Sherman of the drug squad DEA in San Diego.</seg>
<seg id="24">They would do everything, in order to arrive into the USA.</seg>
<seg id="25">To the arresting no details were announced, at least one was Mexican, it was said.</seg>
<seg id="26">They must count on detentions up to ten years.</seg>

<seg id="1">Parents of inter+sexual children can select „sex indefinitely”</seg>
<seg id="2">Germany is the first European nation, in which a third sex for children is appreciative, who were born with not clear genital organs.</seg>
<seg id="3">Newborn children one does not assign any longer rigidly male or womanlike.</seg>
<seg id="4">After the new law parents must no more sex for such children explain, but can „indefinitely” or „fixed” on the birth certificate indicate.</seg>
<seg id="5">A goal of the law is it to take the pressure from parents to so that they do not have to make decisions over-hurried regarding operations for a sex assignment with newborn children to fight and discrimination from inter+sexual humans to.</seg>
<seg id="6">A inter+sexual person said years according to BBC later: „I am neither man nor woman.”</seg>
<seg id="7">I remain the patchwork, which became to create from physicians, mutilated and full scars.</seg>
<seg id="8">Roughly one of 2.000 children comes each year neither as a boy nor as a girl to the world.</seg>
<seg id="9">They belong to the inter+sexual, to a group, which fall under the diagnosis „sexual differentiation disturbance” (DSD), a comprehensive term for humans with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testicles) or unusually developed genital organs.</seg>
<seg id="10">Wallis Simpson was possibly inter+sexual.</seg>
<seg id="11">The understanding of the sex identification is not yet very fully-fledged, but guesses most experts in the USA to it, one is the best available information for sex assignment to use, if a regulation is not possible, and for psychological and physical child development not to wait, before one decides – if at all – for an operation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The New Yorker psychiatrists said Dr. Jack Drescher, who specialized in the problem of the sex identification, the new German law „sounded after a good thing”.</seg>
<seg id="13">Inter+sexual children represent an ethical dilemma.</seg>
<seg id="14">„Some humans have life-threatening illnesses, which make a surgical interference necessary, but for most children that is valid not”, said it.</seg>
<seg id="15">One can make and then await a sex assignment without operation, as the identity develops.</seg>
<seg id="16">The scientific data over it, how a child develops at all his sexual identity, are not very exact.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nobody knows, why it happens.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is like the secret, why humans are homosexual.</seg>
<seg id="19">In a report to the European commission from the year 2011 it, inter+sexual humans means are to be differentiated from transsexual or transgenic the people to, because its status is not sex-referred, but causes by its biological constitution, which is neither exclusively male nor female, but typically both at the same time or clearly as one of it does not define.</seg>
<seg id="20">These characteristics showed up in subordinate sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair coat, breasts and stature, priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genital organs or in chromosome structures and hormones.</seg>
<seg id="21">As well as the report gives also an overview of discrimination, to the inter+sexual and transgenic the people in the active life suspended sees itself over the extent of annoyance, force and prejudice crime.</seg>
<seg id="22">With the sex picture agreeing boy does not have now a special Camp.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the meantime it in Australia and Nepal for adults are possible to indicate on official documents male, womanlike or „third sex”.</seg>
<seg id="24">In June Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as world-wide first „a genderless” person, after a court the lifelong retention one had been entitled „to fixed” sex status.</seg>
<seg id="25">German documents of identification have a third assignment, X for inter+sexual, so the ministry of the Interior apart from M and W in the future.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the neighbouring France sex topics are still controversial, so a message on France 24.</seg>
<seg id="27">2011 signed dozens French delegates of the strictly catholic country a petition that „the sex theory was to be removed” from school books.</seg>
<seg id="28">The US-American website Catholic of online likewise expressed itself against the German law, with the reason: „If the world into a new condition is however not pulled, where the sex represents a decision, sexual activity, then we rotate two further columns of the civilization.”</seg>
<seg id="29">The mother of a newborn child from Maryland explained zone, her opposite baby it would find better, if babies with the birth a sex is assigned.</seg>
<seg id="30">„The parents existence is even without further restrictions already stressfully enough, particularly if one does not know, said the sex of the own child” her the parents website.</seg>
<seg id="31">Children need stability and security.</seg>
<seg id="32">Historically were seen to children, who were born both with male and female sex parts, when Hermaphroditen designates, after the attractive Greek God, which had both sexes.</seg>
<seg id="33">Still before ten years the medicine regarded the sex as something, which one could extinguish and then again develop.</seg>
<seg id="34">But in the meantime the ethical bases of an operation are doubted, after now it admits is how complex the sexual identity is, and that physicians can lie also wrongly, because they do not know, how the child feels when growing up with the sex assigned by them.</seg>
<seg id="35">„In the middle the 20. Century called one the one, psychiatric emergency `”, said Drescher.</seg>
<seg id="36">If such a child were born, then one called not the psychiatrist, but the surgeon.</seg>
<seg id="37">The dominant theory about the treatment of children with not clear genital organs decreases on Dr. John Money of John Hopkins University, which held the opinion, the sex is ductile.</seg>
<seg id="38">It coined the term „sexual identity” and, social and impacts due to environmental factors argued – as parents a child educate – interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and coined in such a way whether a person regards itself as male or womanlike.</seg>
<seg id="39">But in one under the title „” become case from the year 1966 became controversial its theories admit John/Joan.</seg>
<seg id="40">It guessed/advised to parents of a boy, whose penis had been separated with a cutting bungled, to castrate the child completely and to remove also its testicles and to then bring up it as girls.</seg>
<seg id="41">„Money presented this case as successful example of a transformation, which it was however not”, so Dre.</seg>
<seg id="42">When the boy was about 15, it changed back to the male sex and married a woman.</seg>
<seg id="43">With 38 however he committed suicide.</seg>
<seg id="44">Loud Dre there are still physicians, who would practice this model.</seg>
<seg id="45">But into the 1990er years, with which introduction the Internet, are survivors of these sex operations to the public stepped, which are not happy „with the result”.</seg>
<seg id="46">So for instance with Jim Bruce, a 36 years old author from Montana, who was born with XY-male chromosomes, but ambiguous genital organs.</seg>
<seg id="47">The physicians were not clear itself over it, whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and was convinced, it can never „a satisfying life” as a man lead.</seg>
<seg id="48">Thus its external organ and the testicles were removed shortly after the birth 1976 and it as girls were brought up by surgery.</seg>
<seg id="49">At the age of 12 it received female hormones.</seg>
<seg id="50">„I knew that I am not a girl”, explained he opposite ABCNews.com</seg>
<seg id="51">I was unfortunate, but it was really heavy to place questions.</seg>
<seg id="52">At the age of 18 it should receive a Vaginalplastik.</seg>
<seg id="53">But since it was depressive and knew that somewhat it was not correct, required he its medical documents.</seg>
<seg id="54">Which it found out, was shocking.</seg>
<seg id="55">I was sterilized with my birth – and none ever said that to me.</seg>
<seg id="56">Bruce was born with a DSD, by which its body could not produce enough testosterone for the development of the genital organs.</seg>
<seg id="57">After it had experienced the truth, he changed his breasts again to the male identity, received testosterone injections and let themselves remove.</seg>
<seg id="58">By the operation it became infertily.</seg>
<seg id="59">Today it fights for others in an organization named interface Project for the fact that inter+sexual humans are noticed as normal.</seg>
<seg id="60">But Anne Tamar-Mattis, Geschäftsführerin in California of the residents right group of Advocates for Informed Choice, worries herself that the German law „for stamping and stigmatizing encourage” can.</seg>
<seg id="61">„Many activists are to be met anxiously that the German decision could encourage parents, fast decisions and the child, fixed ` not to assign”, explained them.</seg>
<seg id="62">We are afraid, favour interventions.</seg>
<seg id="63">We think, it would be better to assign and then await the male or female sex.</seg>
<seg id="64">Still we do not know, how the law will affect itself, therefore can we only speculate.</seg>
<seg id="65">Tamar Mattis said, their organization supports the Australian law, because „it makes the acknowledgment for adults possible as the third sex”.</seg>
<seg id="66">„Adults should be able to make own decisions over their legal sex”, explained them.</seg>
<seg id="67">With the German law it goes around the assignment with the birth.</seg>
<seg id="68">That is not a fight, to which one should force small children at this time.</seg>
<seg id="69">If they arose, they can decide on their body.</seg>
<seg id="70">But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a chest radiologist from Pittsburg, which has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disturbance and other one supports hundreds in a self-help group, says, the German law „authorizes” both parents and children.</seg>
<seg id="71">Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, has however a DSD on behalf of complete androgen resistance.</seg>
<seg id="72">Because of the receptor defect of the goal cells for testosterone Katie developed female characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="73">It has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.</seg>
<seg id="74">Today Katie 29 is married and; she works on the University OF Pennsylvania as an employee in the child psychiatry.</seg>
<seg id="75">It is infertily, hopes however, to be able to get by adoption or a surrogate mother a child.</seg>
<seg id="76">„The law gives parents to area, whereby it does not rush into decisions meet must”, said Baratz.</seg>
<seg id="77">It provides the time for them to make and things clarify different tests and gives them time in such a way, before they write womanlike „male” or „”.</seg>
<seg id="78">In this way everything is correct – one pulls the child largely and loves it.</seg>
<seg id="79">One has a marvelous baby and enjoys the parents luck.</seg>
<seg id="80">And one does not have over-hurries an operation to make, which cannot be cancelled any longer.</seg>
<seg id="81">„Into the decision also and eliminates the fear, which plagues parents, because they the opinion are, includes the children, them the correct would not do”, described it.</seg>
<seg id="82">Finally the child decides on the sex, which fits better it – and that is marvelous.</seg>
<seg id="83">Thus children are put into the position to make the decision.</seg>

<seg id="1">Desire on ice cream, which shines in the dark?</seg>
<seg id="2">A British entrepreneur developed the first in the dark bright ice – assistance of jellyfishes.</seg>
<seg id="3">Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent characteristics of the sea animals and created from it a bright treat.</seg>
<seg id="4">The idea in addition came it after it had read a research work over jellyfishes and Chinese scientists convince could to manufacture the bright protein artificially.</seg>
<seg id="5">The ice cream reacts with the consumption with the tongue, whereby the pH value in the protein is raised and shining is caused.</seg>
<seg id="6">Chris explained, the ice-cream reacts to the warmth in the mouth and shines – the more one thus licks, the more brightly becomes it.</seg>
<seg id="7">Charlie, founder of the ice cream company „Lick ME I'm Delicious”, says: „The product is unbelievable, but still in a very early production phase, and so one receives two gram of it for 200 pound.”</seg>
<seg id="8">The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH value.</seg>
<seg id="9">If the mouth warms up the protein, the pH value rises and the ice shines.</seg>
<seg id="10">We tested it in the last months and appeared it to us ideally to bring it at Halloween on the market because it has this marvelous shining effect.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is probably the most expensive ice cream, which I manufactured ever, because the jellyfish phosphor is four times more expensive than gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Each ball costs me to about 140 pound.</seg>

<seg id="16">He says: „I would like to develop gladly an invisible ice cream.”</seg>
<seg id="17">That is impossible to and for itself due to the refraction of light, which is caused by the ice crystals, of which ice cream consists; but I assume, we find a possibility of creating it.</seg>

<seg id="1">The waste-oriented society does not think</seg>
<seg id="2">The night was long, the music loud and the tendency good, but it goes sometime home.</seg>
<seg id="3">Only: In the bellies of the people on the front seat passenger and rear seat hunger becomes apparent.</seg>
<seg id="4">Clearly, but or other cocktail or sparkling wine may be responsible!</seg>
<seg id="5">What lies there more near to drive as chilled to the next drive in order to grant itself a little thing?</seg>
<seg id="6">I admit, I participate gladly also, if it goes lateat night and/or early in the morning to the fast food getting.</seg>
<seg id="7">A few French fries, a cola drink, a Burger - and then nothing like off home and in the bed!</seg>
<seg id="8">But on the way home the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco Gängern become apparent.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because which must be missing to one that one throws its fast food bags from the autowindow with constant regularity?!</seg>
<seg id="10">Above all on weekends thrown away paper bags lie at edges of road and on parking lots.</seg>
<seg id="11">“Why? ”, I ask myself.</seg>
<seg id="12">Are the people too stupid, in order to take the bags with home respectively up to the next garbage pail?</seg>
<seg id="13">It is not only like that that of paper things ruins the landscape.</seg>
<seg id="14">Bags already covered transportation facilities such as guard rails and released thus accidents.</seg>

<seg id="2">Vegane nutrition requires vegetable alternatives to eggs, milk and milk products.</seg>
<seg id="3">Puréeed Tofu with plant cream is for example a quark replacement.</seg>
<seg id="4">Further one calls the vegetarian federation to the Weltvegantag on 1 November.</seg>
<seg id="5">The vegetarian federation Germany suggests a set of veganen alternatives on the occasion of the Weltvegantags on 1 November:</seg>
<seg id="6">Pure plant margarine is a good alternative to butter, yogurt lets by soy yogurt replace.</seg>
<seg id="7">Instead of milk can be used soy, oats, almond or rice milk.</seg>
<seg id="8">Impact-cash plant cream replaces conventional whipped cream.</seg>
<seg id="9">Also to eggs there are vegetable alternatives.</seg>
<seg id="10">A half crushed, ripe banana for example can replace an egg as bonding agents in a cake.</seg>
<seg id="11">Also 50 gram of apple mash or a tablespoon ground flax seeds plus three tablespoons water are suitable for it.</seg>
<seg id="12">Pastes become loose instead of with egg for example with a mixture from a teaspoonful baking powder, a tablespoon food strength and three tablespoons mineral waters.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, 50 gram soy yogurt or Seidentofu can serve this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="14">According to the Vebu at present approximately 800,000 humans nourish themselves vegan, thus purely vegetable in Germany.</seg>

<seg id="1">A black box in the car?</seg>
<seg id="2">US-American road planner are in the search for financial resources in order to repair the purging highway system, and believe the solution in a small black box to have found which finds in the instrument panel of each car place.</seg>
<seg id="3">The devices, which note each driven kilometer and which information announces to the authorities, are quintessential point controversies of an attempt of Washington and the planning offices of the Federal States to revise the outdated system for the financing of US-American roads.</seg>
<seg id="4">The normally rather boring area of the road planning suddenly kindled an intensive debate with multicolored alliances.</seg>
<seg id="5">Libertarian with environmental groups it allied itself and to suggest itself out that the government the small boxes for noting the driven kilometers – and possibly also, where they were driven – to use and the information then for the calculation of tax assessments to use knows.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Tea party is frightened.</seg>
<seg id="7">The American civil right combination (ACLU) is likewise deeply anxious and expresses a set of privacy doubts.</seg>
<seg id="8">But while one cannot agree in the congress on an action, several Federal States do not wait longer.</seg>
<seg id="9">They check at present, how they can change in the course of the next ten years to a system, with the driver per driven mile pay.</seg>
<seg id="10">Thousands of drivers tested the tachographs, by which some are equipped with GPS monitoring, already.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is real must for our country.</seg>
<seg id="12">„It is not anything, which we will only possibly use”, said Hasan Ikhrata, Geschäftsführer of the Southern California Assn. OF Governments, which plans a recording of the driven miles with all California drivers in the Federal State starting from 2025.</seg>
<seg id="13">The way, how we pay these taxes, will change.</seg>
<seg id="14">There the technology for it is.</seg>
<seg id="15">The initiative comes to one time, since the highway Trust the Americans at the gasoline pump pay find, which is financed from the taxes, broke is.</seg>
<seg id="16">But one refuels no longer so much in America like in former times.</seg>
<seg id="17">Cars use fewer gasolines.</seg>
<seg id="18">The national oil tax of 18,4 cent per gallon (less than 4 eurocent per litre) did not rise for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="19">Politicians do not dare with high petrol prices to raise the tax only around a cent.</seg>
<seg id="20">„The gasoline tax is simply not sustainably”, like that Lee Munnich, an expert for traffic legislation at the university of Minnesota.</seg>
<seg id="21">Its Federal State equipped recently 500 cars with tachographs, with which a mile-based payment system is to be tested.</seg>
<seg id="22">„The on a long-term basis most meaningful alternative represents”, said it.</seg>
<seg id="23">Bureaucrats call it mile-based user fee.</seg>
<seg id="24">It does not surprise that the idea finds with urban liberal resemblance, because the tax would let itself begin for example to affect the handling in such a way that back-up and climaticharmful exhaust gases are reduced.</seg>
<seg id="25">The California planners set on the system during the elaboration of strategies, with which the ambitious anchored, legally goals of the Federal State to the climate change to be achieved are.</seg>
<seg id="26">But the republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, likewise explained that he therein see the most passable long-term alternative.</seg>
<seg id="27">Also free marking out of the Reason Foundation are done of the idea to let pay drivers after put back distance.</seg>
<seg id="28">„That is not a tax, which disappears to Adrian Moore, Vizepräsident for guidelines in a black hole”, explains with Reason.</seg>
<seg id="29">The people pay directly for what they get.</seg>
<seg id="30">The movement is supported also by two former American transport ministers, who had requested the congress in a report in the year 2011 to move toward mile-based account.</seg>
<seg id="31">The U.S. Senate approved last year 90 million a dollar expensive pilot project, which would have covered 10,000 cars.</seg>
<seg id="32">But the majority in the house of representatives prevented the raid and reacted with it to the doubts of delegates from rural areas, which represent humans, who must often put many miles back on the way to work or into the city in the everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several Federal States and large cities move nevertheless on own fist in this direction.</seg>
<seg id="34">Oregon, who enlists 5,000 drivers at present for the largest experiment of the country, is most committed.</seg>
<seg id="35">These drivers will pay soon the mile fees instead of the oil tax to the Federal State.</seg>
<seg id="36">Nevada already concluded a pilot project.</seg>
<seg id="37">New York town center considers likewise such.</seg>
<seg id="38">Illinois tests it in reduced measure with trucks.</seg>
<seg id="39">And the I-95-Koalition, to which the Ministries of Transport of 17 Federal States at the east coast belong (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), examined at present, as one would bring the change in could.</seg>
<seg id="40">The concept is not a universal hit.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Nevada, where recently 50 volunteer was equipped with the devices, drivers were sceptical with the thought, the government could each of their movements pursue.</seg>
<seg id="42">„Doubts against Big Brother and such things were a large problem”, explain Alauddin Khan, director/conductor of the strategy and result management in the Ministry of Transport of Nevada.</seg>
<seg id="43">The people did not want it.</seg>
<seg id="44">When the test started, the ACLU of Nevada on its website warned: „It would be relatively simple to transform the tachographs into full-grown control instruments.”</seg>
<seg id="45">There is not a necessity to develop a gigantic, bulky technological infrastructure which would be used inevitably for it, data over the daily movements from individuals to seize.</seg>
<seg id="46">Nevada belonged to a set of Federal States, which hold now after affordable technology look out, with which the state the driven kilometers seize can, but not exactly when and where.</seg>
<seg id="47">Thus, so Khan, would be also the public more reassuring.</seg>
<seg id="48">The hunt for this technology led some authorities to a small Startup enterprise named True Mileage in California.</seg>
<seg id="49">The company originally did not begin, in order to help Federal States with the taxation from drivers to.</seg>
<seg id="50">Rather it was their goal of seizing in a rising market for car insurances foot with which drivers on basis of the driven miles are to pay.</seg>
<seg id="51">But devices tested of their are interesting also for the road planners, because they work not with GPS and supply only limited information, which is uploaded regularly by modem.</seg>
<seg id="52">„The people are rather ready to take part in if their speed and locations are not noted”, explained Ryan Morrison, Geschäftsführer von True Mileage.</seg>
<seg id="53">In some these public pilot programs large errors were made.</seg>
<seg id="54">There are substantially cheaper and less intrusive possibilities of converting this.</seg>
<seg id="55">In Oregon the planners experiment to give to drivers a set from options to.</seg>
<seg id="56">They can decide for equipment with or without GPS.</seg>
<seg id="57">Or they select at all no equipment and pay instead a lump sum charge on basis on the average of the miles driven from all inhabitants of the Federal State.</seg>
<seg id="58">Other places hope to be able to sell the concept of a distrustful public by equipping the devices with more functions than with few.</seg>
<seg id="59">In New York traffic officials equipment for taxation to develop, with which also parking fees can be paid, an insurance only for driven kilometers be paid, want to be able to evade to town center must and speed data are raised from other vehicles in real time, owing to those drivers of back-up.</seg>
<seg id="60">„Drivers were motivated by the increase in value of the advantages, which the system offers, to the participation”, are called it in a planning document of the city.</seg>
<seg id="61">Some traffic planners ask themselves however whether the whole gossip is over paying per mile not only an enormous diverting manoeuvre.</seg>
<seg id="62">With the metropolitan Transportation Commission for the area of the San Francisco Bay officials, the congress explained could solve the problem bankrupt highway Trust find simply by increase of the fuel tax.</seg>
<seg id="63">An additional unique fee or an annual delivery could be imposed upon to drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles, which use little gasoline, so that also these paid a fair portion.</seg>
<seg id="64">„There is no reason for an operation, even if an Aspirin is sufficient, describes” Randy Rentschler, the leader for legislation and public affairs of the commission.</seg>
<seg id="65">If we do that, hundreds make themselves millions of drivers ensure over its privacy and numerous other things.</seg>

<seg id="3">On past Saturday all had probably desired a more pleasant ceremony, but Petrus did not want to play thereby.</seg>
<seg id="4">So all those had a checking, which came without umbrella or could not for such one from possibly a reason not hold.</seg>

<seg id="9">The sprightly pensioners moved 400 square meters of paving-stones for the new ways.</seg>

<seg id="11">Further greetings spoke for the urban sport committee Hubert Baier, the district chairman of the football federation, Kuno Kayan southof Baden, and Friedrich Knorr of the planning office, which announced a donation for the youth department of the club.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mayor Klumpp brought in memory that always recurring weather-related influences added to the original lawn in such a way in the spring and autumn that he could not be taped.</seg>
<seg id="13">Already before 15 years there were the first considerations for the solution of the problem, when the building of a third place with the area of the football club or at the six-form high school at the saltworks lake one thought.</seg>
<seg id="14">Both was again rejected.</seg>
<seg id="15">Before six years thoughts on the application of an artificial turf sports field arose, which was generally viewed as the ultimative solution.</seg>
<seg id="16">Concrete planning was taken up before two years, when the FC transferred the Schabelstube to hereditary lease, assured a cost sharing of 100,000 euros for the building of the place and conveyance of 104,000 euros approved of the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">The local council decided the assumption of the remaining 356,000 euros at the total costs of 560,000 euros in October 2012, summarized Klumpp.</seg>
<seg id="18">The commencement of construction of the 68 times 108 meters large artificial turf place took place on 4 June.</seg>
<seg id="19">During over three months the persisting construction phase 3000 cubic meters of earth were cleared away, about which half for the application of a Dirt Bike distance was used.</seg>

<seg id="3">The German delegate Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where these asylums received, in order to discuss with him the statement in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="4">In a letter of Snowden, which was presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by Ströbele, this writes: „Even if the result of my efforts were as can be prove positive, treats my government a deviating opinion further as loyalty break and tried to criminalize political expression of opinion with penalty clause with defense is not possible.”</seg>

<seg id="1">Security doubts in Mozambique grow in view of collisions between influential figures</seg>
<seg id="2">Thousands of humans met in the center Maputos under the watchful eyes of the Statue of Samora Machel, the founder of the state and first president Mosambiks, in order to intone with a rare public demonstration of peace calls.</seg>
<seg id="3">„We want again peace, we want stability”, said Vanessa de Sousa, Geschäftsführerin of an investment enterprise.</seg>
<seg id="4">From fear around the future of the country it exchanged its business clothes against a T-shirt with the label „we to demand security” on Portuguese and on Thursday of the quantity at the independence place of the capital followed.</seg>
<seg id="5">For two weeks there is almost daily report over collisions between government forces and Renamo, which rank among the worst engagements since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="6">Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, by Rhodesia governed by white ones and later the Apartheitsregierung South Africa was initially supported in the effort to destabilize the independent government of the country.</seg>
<seg id="7">After the peace treaty from 1992 it became an opposition party.</seg>
<seg id="8">Analysts hold it for improbable that the country drops back again into an full-grown conflict, but the recent events foreign investors and native ones worried.</seg>
<seg id="9">For the fast growing economy stands much on the play, because the discovery of enormous gas reserves before the coast and coal camps in the northwest could bring in the next years investments from over 50 billion US Dollar of companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the USA in the country.</seg>
<seg id="10">The governing Frelimo party, since 1975 the dominating strength, and Renamo give themselves mutually the debt for the tensions.</seg>
<seg id="11">Renamo states, which government has the recent collisions provoked, by having attacked its members in the province Sofala, a traditional center Renamos on 17 October.</seg>
<seg id="12">The encroachments on the former rebels escalated, than government troops attacked and tried Renamo bases to kill Afonso Dhlakama the leader of the group, explained Renamos spokesman opposite Financial Times.</seg>
<seg id="13">The government gives the debt for the collisions to Renamo and accuses the organization of soldiers to have attacked.</seg>
<seg id="14">President Armando Guebuza tried to play doubts down over an instability.</seg>
<seg id="15">Opposite AFP, he said French press agency to which on Wednesday that Dhlakama regards itself as „a loser”, who wants to use „all its still remaining forces, in order to prove that it can force upon its decisions to the government”.</seg>
<seg id="16">Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they would like to avoid a war.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the doubts have increased, since Mazanga with the words was quoted, Renamo give up the peace agreement of 1992.</seg>
<seg id="18">Opposite the FT explained he, thus he had meant that Frelimo does not respect the agreement any longer.</seg>
<seg id="19">„Our vision is it to take up again negotiations seriously”, said Mazanga.</seg>
<seg id="20">Earlier discussions between the parties contributed only few to the settlement of the tensions, which were beaconed by a set of collisions in this year.</seg>
<seg id="21">„We have here two adults of men (Guebuza and Dhlakama), who collide, mean the heads” Joseph Hanlon, Dozent at the open University and Mozambique expert.</seg>
<seg id="22">None of them is well in negotiating and none is ready to make the necessary concessions.</seg>
<seg id="23">Renamo, which pushes on choice elections, explained, it the local elections in November will already boycott.</seg>
<seg id="24">Presidency and parliamentary elections are planned for next year.</seg>
<seg id="25">Some commentators interpreted the employment of force as the attempt of an ailing movement to obtain concessions and financial privileges from the government to.</seg>
<seg id="26">Renamos of electoral successes shrink since 1992, while a newer party, those from a former Renamo member created Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM) will probably improve, with the elections.</seg>
<seg id="27">Mazanga states that Guebuza – whose resignation lines up, if its second term of office ends in the next year – which democracy of the country wants to destroy.</seg>
<seg id="28">„It does not want multi-party democracy, it wants no transparent elections, it wants no peace, because he does not want to give the presidential office”, so to Mazanga up.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is unclear, which Renamo has capacities, but she undertook unrest pin end of attacks on police stations and vehicles on important north south connections.</seg>
<seg id="30">Most engagements took place in the province Sofala, which lies some hundred kilometers north of Maputo, in which however Beira is, the port, which mining industry companies use such as Rio Tinto and Vale to the export of coal.</seg>
<seg id="31">In June Rio interrupted one month long the use of the railway, after Renamo had announced an attack on the distance.</seg>
<seg id="32">Mazanga answered reservedly to the question whether Renamo will repeat this threat.</seg>
<seg id="33">Renamo wanted to warn „the international community that the things are located to Mazanga in Mozambique not well”, said.</seg>
<seg id="34">The instability increased frustration over the government still, says Fernando Lima, Leiter von Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many humans worried themselves already because of the corruption, the sluggish progress with the development and a recent kidnapping wave.</seg>
<seg id="35">„Humans think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and it should be that, which finds, explains solutions for the problems” it.</seg>
<seg id="36">Omar Sultane, a demonstrator, said, humans wanted simply only to stability.</seg>
<seg id="37">„Renamo and Frelimo, them do not interest want simply only again peace and usable roads”, explained it.</seg>

<seg id="3">The exposure is the noteworthy Estonian surprise of the long expected work of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann over the election campaign 2012, „doubles down: Game CHANGE 2012”.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Times is present a copy of the shortly appearing book and it reported on Thursday evening that the Topberater of the president would have accomplished „extensive group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011”, in order to find out whether it looks better for Obama's shrinking hope for re-election, if it fall let Biden.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to Jonathan Martin, nationalpolitical correspondent of the Times, retraces the book thoroughly the history of the efforts of prominent employees of the campaign and the white house, namely the earlier White House Chief OF Staff Bill Daley to measure it has which effect on the poll ratings to exchange the former Foreign Minister Clinton for the vice-president.</seg>
<seg id="6">The potential changes was a strictly guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and in the oval Office.</seg>
<seg id="7">Only a half dozen of the closest advisors of the president – including Daley, the former campaign leader Obamas, Jim Messina, and the former leading white house counsels, David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew about started thinking the change answer.</seg>
<seg id="8">In „doubles down” it is maintained, Daley at the point of the efforts, Biden confessed despite their „to close to exchange personal relationship” before one finally decided against such a chess move, after the data showed that Clintons do not improve the candidacy „the opportunities of Obama considerably” became.</seg>
<seg id="9">In an interview with Martin Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered to replace Biden by Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="10">„I expressed a whole set of things, which one should consider, and which was one of it”, explained Daley the magazine.</seg>
<seg id="11">One must call oneself in memory that the president had at that time terrible poll ratings, therefore thought we: „Over God will, which we make?”</seg>
<seg id="12">While Daley called the investigations „due care”, Martin said opposite Anderson Cooper one of CNN that during the campaign for the re-election substantial expenditure had been operated, in order to find out whether such a course pays off regarding the ballot boxes.</seg>
<seg id="13">„In campaigns so much money is not spent on surveys and focus groups, if one does not think seriously about somewhat”, explained Martin on AC360.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is not clear however whether Obama knew that its team thought about an exchange.</seg>
<seg id="15">Martin said opposite CNN, it had asked Daley whether its boss at that time would have known about the potential change.</seg>
<seg id="16">Although Daley explained, he did not believe that the president of the possible change was conscious „”, admitted the former chief of staff, it is „” been possible that Obama of it had known.</seg>
<seg id="17">Martin added that „double does not supply down” a definite answer to the question, whether the political soundings of Obama would have reached desk.</seg>

<seg id="3">The Gemeindesäckl in stove cheek beautiful oh is filled well and debts knows the administration already since 2005 no more.</seg>
<seg id="4">Also the financial year 2012 can be booked in this sense as full success.</seg>
<seg id="5">This became clear with the conception of the annual account for 2012.</seg>
<seg id="6">How Andrea Rothmund described, the operating budget with approximately 7.6 million euros over millions a euro had more highly failed than planned.</seg>
<seg id="7">Also the surplus of the operating budget lies with approximately 1.8 million euro approximately millions euros over the approach.</seg>
<seg id="8">To owe the surplus is above all higher business tax revenues and the community portion of the income tax.</seg>
<seg id="9">Also the fortune budget lay again clearly over the planned values.</seg>
<seg id="10">Instead of the intended 1.5 million euros it amounted to last year 2.5 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="11">“This is essentially because of the higher supply from the operating budget”, thus to Rothmund.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since in the financial year 2012 fewer investments than were planned transacted, also the reserves supply failed more highly.</seg>
<seg id="13">Altogether the general reserve could be increased by approximately 2.1 million euros on now altogether 4.9 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked you Rothmund and their team for the good work.</seg>
<seg id="15">“One vibrates, praised such a work not simply from the sleeve” Gerster with view of the annual account.</seg>
<seg id="16">It and the local councils were pleased obviously about the good numbers.</seg>
<seg id="17">It may sound paradoxically, but exactly these good numbers could stand the citizens soon expensively to come.</seg>
<seg id="18">By the good financial situation the community could do in the past without high rates of assessment.</seg>
<seg id="19">Thus again however according to Gerster already repeatedly subsidies were shortened by the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">For these subsidies from various balance sticks there are conditions.</seg>
<seg id="21">Among other things the cities and communities, which request subsidies, must show certain rates of assessment.</seg>
<seg id="22">“The topic of rates of assessment we must look at, since in the coming years investments line up, for which we gladly subsidies would have”, announced ourselves Gerster in this context.</seg>

<seg id="1">Despair cry of an Obama voter</seg>
<seg id="2">I have president Obama twice selected in hope on the fact that change is possible</seg>
<seg id="3">He says, Obama undertook praise-worth efforts, which were defeated by the blockade tactics of the republicans</seg>
<seg id="4">The blockade politics does not excuse the website problems of Obamacare, the drone attacks</seg>
<seg id="5">Obama's memoirs over the election campaign 2008 are a sad memory of what would have been possible</seg>
<seg id="6">Nathaniel P. Morris is a student in the second year to the Harvard Medical School.</seg>
<seg id="7">I read at present a terribly sad book.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is a book, from which I believed, it me during the doleful second year of my medical studies would cheer up and to me again hope would give.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is called „The Audacity ton Win” to win (courage) and describes the memoirs Barack Obamas to the presidential election 2008.</seg>
<seg id="10">If I am finished with my patient minute in the evening and go to bed, then the book leads me back into a time, when the policy millions inspired could rob and from talking the breath.</seg>
<seg id="11">The choice became a landslide victory and a newscaster stopped, in order to lead the historical meaning of this hour before eyes.</seg>
<seg id="12">My school fellows cried before joy and my parents collected all newspapers, which could find them.</seg>
<seg id="13">A young team from visionaries was on the way in the white house and the nation was ready for change.</seg>
<seg id="14">When 2008 Obama changed at that time in the office, he had agreement values of 82%.</seg>
<seg id="15">And then I close the book.</seg>
<seg id="16">Again to switch to the present is bad awaking, as if one is torn from a dream.</seg>
<seg id="17">It falls heavily to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder to missed possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the years, since I delivered my voting for the first time, actually somewhat changed.</seg>
<seg id="19">But it is simply nothing that I could myself have presented.</seg>
<seg id="20">I recognize the great and versatile things on, which Obama reached, of concealing of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden, forced by the adoption of the Affordable Care act for health insurance up to the military departure from Iraq, the end.</seg>
<seg id="21">Also I am the opinion that party-political blockade tactics tilted too many efforts, with which our nation forward be brought should: Immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closing of Guantanamo Bay, in order to call only some.</seg>
<seg id="22">But after I defended countless marks the Obama government opposite colleagues and acquaintance, I arrived with my attempts at explanation in the end.</seg>
<seg id="23">I reached one point of political despair.</seg>
<seg id="24">The republican blockade politics cannot explain, why one permits a hearing of foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas.</seg>
<seg id="25">It cannot explain, why those collects national Security Agency data over the private life of Americans and why Whistleblower are punished, which reveal national failure.</seg>
<seg id="26">It cannot explain, why Anwar al-Awlaki, an US-American citizen, was murdered without procedures, still why the public financing and edition borders during the presidential elections is gone around.</seg>
<seg id="27">It does not justify the results of a report, in which it means, the efforts of the white house toward the immobilization of the media is „aggressivsten… since the nixon administration”.</seg>
<seg id="28">And jüngstens it cannot excuse the inability to sketch in more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care act a simple website.</seg>
<seg id="29">I do not know whether it is that, which I should have expected.</seg>
<seg id="30">Whether I should have understood with 18 that the government work could contradict her preceding political campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="31">The office for delegate a foreseeable course is not obvious, since an opposition party and fortuitous events coin like the Newtown massacre the public discussion.</seg>
<seg id="32">But if I view myself the examples specified above, then they seem to a large extent from the government selected to be.</seg>
<seg id="33">And disturbs me at most.</seg>
<seg id="34">I selected 2012 again Obama, not because I was enthusiastic over its candidacy.</seg>
<seg id="35">Mitt Romney represented a confusing and ill-considered alternative, he seemed his direction and positions not to specify not to be able.</seg>
<seg id="36">I had the impression, a second term of office for Obama, freely from the pressure of future elections, the hope would fulfill, of which we had for such a long time heard.</seg>
<seg id="37">But with the sinking of the agreement values for Obama on under 45% this week the return became all the harder in the year 2008 by this book.</seg>
<seg id="38">It wakes the longing in me after the many promises, which dissolved in air.</seg>
<seg id="39">This week read I a section in the book, which describes, how Obama had to put a heavy loss against Clinton with the primaries into Pennsylvania.</seg>
<seg id="40">In a meeting with the election helpers after the decision he said to its employees, her would have to come back after course and follow the purpose of their thing.</seg>
<seg id="41">„I would like that we regain, said our charm” it.</seg>
<seg id="42">We must remember, who we are.</seg>
<seg id="43">There is five years later, Mr. President, and I could not agree you more strongly.</seg>
<seg id="44">In this comment expressed opinions are excluding from Nathaniel Morris.</seg>

<seg id="4">Substantial reason of the lining up price increase is the rise of the so-called EEG allocation of 5,277 to 6,3 cent per kilowatt-hour.</seg>
