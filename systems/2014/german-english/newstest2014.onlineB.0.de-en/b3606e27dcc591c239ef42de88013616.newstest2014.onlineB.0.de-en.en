The Foreign Minister also admitted he wore in common with Barack Obama's responsibility to ensure that you have switched on "autopilot", as the explosive revelations of the whistleblower Edward Snowden about the espionage activities of the NSA were publicly.
With the leaked information, the U.S. government is caught in a diplomatic storm of indignation on the part of its allies.
When a transmitted by video link address to the Open Government Conference in London Kerry said: "There is no question the President and I and others in the government have learned of some things that have expired almost on autopilot, simply because the ability to do so was, what is still to the Second World war and the difficult years of the Cold War and of course on the 11th September back. "
Then he admitted to be the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government that the U.S. spy've crossed a line, but also stressed that no rights have been abused.

I assure you that the rights of innocent persons are not affected in this process.

What would be if you would be able to intercept that and to stop before it happened?
We actually have plane crashes, attacks on buildings and murdering people prevented because we have learned in advance of such plans.

He said the exact itinerary will still be worked out.
While Murphy emphasized that the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, he also assumed that there would be some "serious words."
He said European governments need to be honest about the kind of spying programs that they themselves inserting years their population against.
"While we can change our monitoring programs and thus better protect the rights of Europeans, but they must come to terms with the fact that we are not the only ones who spy," said Murphy.
