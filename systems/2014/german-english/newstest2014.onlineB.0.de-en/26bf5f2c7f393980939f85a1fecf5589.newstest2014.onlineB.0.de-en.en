Supreme Court confirms Obama's health care law
It is a great victory for the Obama administration: The U.S. Supreme Court ruled today that the closely linked with Barack Obama health law is constitutional.
With five votes to four the judges that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act - it forces American citizens obtain health insurance by 2014 or pay a penalty - under the tax authority of the state is constitutional.
The Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the more liberal side of the four members of the Chamber, while Justice Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy decided against it.
The court also upheld the remaining sections of the extensive 2700 pages Law and was also of the view that the requirement of the Health Act, which would expand states either the entrance requirements for Medicaid or otherwise, all state Medicaid funding would be cut, was not unconstitutionally restrictive.
The proceedings of the law was brought by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was strongly opposed by all the leading Republican presidential candidates, including the eventual challenger Mitt Romney, in the pre-election campaign in 2012.
