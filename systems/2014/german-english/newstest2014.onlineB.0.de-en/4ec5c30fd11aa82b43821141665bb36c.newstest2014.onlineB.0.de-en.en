Profits at Bombardier after decline in numbers and delivery orders
The Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc. said Thursday a 15 percent decrease in net income, after he was advised by a decline in aircraft orders and deliveries in the third quarter and contract problems in the railway sector under pressure.
Bombardier, based in Montreal published no flight test data for its brand-new CSeries aircraft and gave no new information about whether the plane could go into commercial use in accordance with the ambitious timetable, next September.
On the maiden flight of test aircraft and a half months ago, so far followed only three more starts, which makes it appear doubtful whether the test phase proceeds as planned.
The results fell short of forecasts, leading to a sharp fall of over eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered on Thursday its rating from "outperform" to "sector perform" in view of the fact that the stock has limited upside potential in the next one to two quarters.
"While weaker delivery numbers for aircraft were largely expected, but by the margin development in the transport sector, we are clearly disappointed," Doerksen said in a client letter.
We believe that Bombardier new orders for the CSeries is obtained when the test program for the aircraft progresses.
However, if in the coming months, no new orders will be announced, we expect the market against the program is more skeptical.
Bombardier hopes that the plane number of the CSeries can catapult the company into the lower market segment that is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March, the public, and flew after months of delays for the first time in September.
But so far, firm orders for the CSeries 177 are moderate, as potential buyers want to wait for the results of flight tests and see if the allegations of the company in terms of fuel efficiency and cost savings of the new commercial jet aircraft are accurate.
Currently there are a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
CEO Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will reach its target of 300 firm orders at the beginning of the commercialization of the jet.
The management assured on Thursday with analysts and the media also, the program lies in the schedule.
"The test aircraft is no longer remained on the ground as expected," Beaudoin said during a conference call, adding that during the life of the aircraft were ground testing and software updates have been applied.
Each manufacturer is planning differently.
We have decided to do a first flight and then to append a revision period, what we have done.
This happens throughout the entire flight program.
The second of five test aircraft was expected to start in the next few weeks, the rest shortly thereafter, it was said by the companies.
However, analysts remain skeptical that twelve months after the maiden flight of the first customer a CSeries aircraft can operate.
Bombardier said it will check the planning for the commissioning (EIS) and will update in the next few months.
"The slow progress of the flight test - even if they obviously correspond to Bombardier's internal planning - reinforces our view that the commissioning of the first quarter of 2015 shifts," Doerksen said.
In the third quarter ended 30 September fell Bombardier's net profit to $ 147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $ 172 million, or 9 cents per share a year earlier.
The adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.

The net orders fell by 83 aircraft to 26
The order backlog in the air and space division was on 30 September $ 32.9 billion and was compared with 31 December unchanged.
"In the field of aerospace, the results were in line with our requirements, but the low order intake and market conditions overall were disappointing," Beaudoin said.
Sales in the air and space division fell 13 percent to two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, has announced that revenue has increased in this division by almost eleven per cent to 2.1 billion dollars.
The order backlog in the transport sector was 30 September $ 32.6 billion and was compared with 31 December increased slightly.
The profit margin in the area of ​​transport was affected by processing problems in some large contracts.
