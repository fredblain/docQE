Painted the fence on the Bechtle plot
A group of citizens initiative "Swiss meadow" has embellished the fence on the Bechtle land at the spa gardens in Bad Herrenalb.
Also, cleaned and widened it to walk, according to a press release.
The planned covering the decaying house in the rear portion of the property had not been permitted for safety reasons, because the terrain is threatening to slip.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, had denied the beautification action with his colleague Reinhard Domke of the BI.
Before the action of the BI was a banner with the message "We are for it," been installed.
This annoyed the approximately 20 members of the citizens' initiative but little in their action.
Their motto on the large poster was called "We are against building ruins."
So she wanted to draw attention to the danger of even larger ruins on the Swiss meadow - should fail the huge project one day.
In speaking with many passers-by in front of the "building site", it became clear that some citizens believe that it will go better with many of the realization of the project of the city, although not a few of the dimension of the proposed project have the same questions as the BI.
But they begin to give up, because the city further delaying these answers, it means the part of BI.
As we heard, also the public statements made by the Mayor affect.
May had said in the council meeting that he feared the end for the thermal bath, the population should vote at referendum against the plans for a spa and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow.
Some appear so downright scared, others they perceive as "clumsy attempt at extortion" of the population, it said in the press release of the BI.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all the helpers.
