George Kerevan: European unbundling gives the Scots a choice
A new day, a new horror story to independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland would be necessary to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the cue for stories about passport checks in Berwick and secured with barbed wire border along Hadrian's Wall.
In fact it has been on the potential economic benefits noted in the Strathclyde template that would bring more freedom to travel the rest of Europe with it, but played it - as expected - in the headlines not matter.
Also no one has mentioned that the EU Member States often rightly turn their strict rules when it is convenient for them.
As Scotland is currently not part of the Schengen area, the continued non-compliance for Brussels would only be a small concession in return for what you really want from the Scots.
So really no story.
And one that is already so come in the years that it already resembles a fossil: The first time I used the "independence means passport control" Duck heard years ago at least 40.
Here an interesting point when constantly repeating this ancient history is lost.
Why should one expect from an independent Scotland that it dances to the European pipe?
Why swap the yoke against the London from Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: The big, ducted after the war plan for the unification of Europe has stalled.
With the euro crisis, the European project is officially dead.
Throughout the EU, parties gain ground, which are EU-hostile or want to have the euro as their common currency overboard.
Even in Germany was the euro-skeptic party alternative for Germany - founded only this year - nearly five million votes snag in the general election in September for themselves and thus effectively distribute the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There have always been local opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
The current economic crisis, however, turns out to be a turning point.
Because of the restrictions imposed by Berlin and the European Central strict austerity policy in conjunction with the straitjacket into which the respective national economy is constrained by adherence to the single currency, many people believe, the European project has gone too far.
The crisis of the euro has little to do with the fact that national governments cause excessive budget deficits - this was only the case in Greece.
Instead, the euro system has its members nailed on exchange rates, which are advantageous for German exporters - and want German politicians like to be so.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the local currency, Southern Europe is with a built-in productivity disadvantage compared to Germany again.
The only way is to cut wages and public spending - inspired by Berlin.
Behind the current budget and monetary problems lies a deeper European productivity problem.
As a result of the prescribed from Brussels 'green' energy policy - a code for subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers - pay to European industry compared with the United States twice for electricity and four times for gas.
This is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we could see in Grangemouth.
All wage commits the world to protect the European petrochemical industry is not about to be pushed by cheap American shale gas in the corner.
As a result, draws up a revolt, especially in France, the EU's former cheerleader.
After the war saw the French political elite, the EU as a vehicle with which to keep Germany in check and could lift Paris on par with Washington.
But Berlin Paris needs no more than the gateway to political legitimacy and Europe has pushed its own economic policy, which the ailing French economy is struggling.
The result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, anti-EU National Front has just won a crucial by-election and thus the ruling Socialists referenced third place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote - a timely warning to the British Labour Party that they can not assume a split in the right spectrum would automatically mean advantages for the left.
What makes Le Pen with her newly gained popularity among the white French the working class?
You want to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti-single currency bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties do well in this election - and this is very possible - then could the first time such a block, the European Parliament dominate.
This is the point at which I'm getting at: In the not too distant future, the growing resentment against the EU and the single currency will come together to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will be more like the "Europe of (sovereign) nations," the General de Gaulle favored.
Germany and a few of its satellite economies might keep the euro firm, but France and Southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect that Britain distances from this project in hopes to curry favor with the United States.
However, suggests Washington's growing interest in the Pacific that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where is Scotland in all this?
We can decide to be a region of (ultimately) Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests - which also involves Berlin and Brussels to say what they can stick it where.
I suspect Scotland could go quite well in a looser European alliance, if we keep our own currency.
The cooperation with other like-minded countries is easier in a non-federated Europe of Nations.
Otherwise, we should consider to emulate Norway and retain our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is - remarkably - the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and has a spectacular majority due to the rejection of the proposed (and made​​) won in 2011 cuts that the Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib were responsible for the coalition.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland, now to decide for independence to get forced austerity only to Berlin and Brussels.
