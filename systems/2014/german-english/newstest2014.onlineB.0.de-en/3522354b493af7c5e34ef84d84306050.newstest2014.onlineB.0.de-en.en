Kindergarten has a private buyer found
"The building is in good hands," says Winter Lingens Mayor Michael Maier.
The former kindergarten in the Garden Street sold to a private individual the municipality.
The sale of the council agreed to in its latest meeting in the private part.
The building changed hands at a "fair" price.
"The community is happy," says Maier.
In household 100 000 euros were recognized.
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former nursery.
The mayor is right that winter Lingen has handed over the responsibility for the building before winter to someone else and no longer has to pay for the upkeep of the house, such as to heat, to look after the garden and to clear the sidewalk.
"This effort is now gone," Maier says.
