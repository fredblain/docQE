Rangnick scolding for refs: Mane no Schwalbenkönig
So happy Ralf Rangnick with the current high form of Bundesliga leaders Red Bull Salzburg is also so disappointed, there was the sports director of the "bulls" of the referees.
"There is currently a dangerous trend that Mane and Alan are pushed into the category swallow Kings", he took the two Offensivwirbler on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg in protection.
The most recent occasion for Rangnick's criticism was yellow for Mane 3-0 against Grödig last Sunday, in which the Senegalese alleged acting was undoing - which was certainly not, as the TV pictures showed.
"A blatant wrong decision," said Rangnick, the referee Harkam "completely overwhelmed" referred to as.
Harkam would also "his part" contributed to the escalation between Salzburg coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig coach Adi Hütter after the game.
His German compatriot he defended decidedly: "I would have behaved the same as Roger Schmidt in each situation."
Schmidt himself claims to have had no contact with his colleague after the skirmish with Hütter.
I do not know why.
"For I am the one who was offended," said the 46-year-old.
Given the success run certain Rangnick but a hymn of praise.
"There are only two words: Really good," he stated.
There is not much to criticize.
Especially the way how the team plays, is impressive.
This should go on so quietly.
Squad changes in the winter transfer period, there will be little.
There are no great reasons to make a change.
"Except for a player steps approach with the desire that he wants to leave the club," said Rangnick clear.
