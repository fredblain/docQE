Oil prices are further up to 96 USD per barrel
The oil price has also continued to fall on Friday after concerns about high supply overshadowed a report that the energy-hungry China's manufacturing sector is growing.
The reference crude oil for delivery in December fell to $ 96.24 a barrel at late morning in Europe in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange up 14 cents.
The contract fell 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a price decline of 5.8 percent in October.
The large crude oil supply has impacted prices in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said on Wednesday the U.S. offer has increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over the course of five weeks, the offer was increased by 25 million barrels.
But on Friday there was evidence of stronger demand by two reports of a growing activity in the Chinese manufacturing.
This points to a continued recovery in China's economy, whose growth had risen to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after it had reached its lowest level in the previous quarter for the past two decades.
Crude oil from the Brent, a benchmark of international crude oil, which is also used by U.S. refineries, fell on the ICE Exchange in London by 26 cents to $ 108.58 per barrel.
