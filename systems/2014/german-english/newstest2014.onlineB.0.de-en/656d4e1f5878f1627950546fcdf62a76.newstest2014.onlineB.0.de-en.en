UN announces new goals for poverty reduction
The United Nations begin immediately with the development of a new set of goals with which the announced twelve years ago, the Millennium Development Goals are to be replaced to reduce poverty.
In advance of the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio de Janeiro at night, Australian diplomats played a key role in the push for "sustainable development goals", to replace the expiring 2015 Millennium Development Goals.
They were included in the final draft of the document will be adopted by world leaders, including Ms Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in the evening at the summit, the time has come to "think outside of the national interests."
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to adopt a process in attack, to be agreed with the universal, sustainable development goals," he said.
"These objectives will build on our progress in the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the framework for development after 2015.
I will spare no effort to implement the mandate given to me by the Member States in order to realize our vision of sustainable development goals that build on the success of the Millennium Development Goals. "
