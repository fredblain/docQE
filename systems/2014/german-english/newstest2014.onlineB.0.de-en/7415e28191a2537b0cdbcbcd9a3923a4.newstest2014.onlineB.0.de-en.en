The TSV Morsum after six games still without a point in the Handball Association league.
Just now it is for the team of Ingo Ehlers tomorrow for the derby against TSV Daverden, who celebrated his first victory last weekend.
With this game, the season starts again for us.
"I hope that we finally have time to clear head," said Ehlers are cautiously optimistic.
He has finally, with the exception of the duration injured Hendrik Blohme, his full squad available.
Also Daverden is how we respond to tempo game.
Therefore, we must keep our error rate low.
It is primarily, however, in the cover to increase, which has recently left anything but a safe impression.
Significantly more relaxed Dave Rdens Coach Thomas Panitz is after the first win of the season against North Horn.
The game was obviously a house number.
But that's why we are still far from the favorite, because in Derby can happen again and everything.
Nevertheless Panitz now wants reloading in Morsum to start a series.
Absence is Jan-Malte iodate.
For celebrating the A-teens Joost Windßuß which is active with double game right at the A-youth-Bundesliga HC Bremen, his season debut.
Who is not hot in a game like this, is to stay at home.
