Schools are encouraged to a greater focus on math, spelling and grammar
In courses on English literature students have to continue at least a Shakespeare play, a novel of the 19th Century, treat romantic poetry and contemporary British novels from 1914.
In the test, see also "unseen texts" input, in order to stimulate wider reading.
The combined course of English Language and Literature will be abolished.
As of 2015, students must have a separate GCSE exam for language store, where there are strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will publish the new curricula for English and mathematics tomorrow - the first subjects that have been radically transformed.
Other core courses be changed next year.
In a separate initiative is Ofqual, announce the supervisory authority for inspections, a reorganization of the GCSE structures, including a new grading system and less coursework.
In a speech in the summer said Education Secretary Michael Gove, that "there is broad consensus that we need to reform our checkout system to restore public confidence" one, in which he stressed the GCSEs would be "challenging, ambitious and rigorous".
Studies show that in English schools less time for mathematics is spent - 116 hours per year or three hours per week per school year - as in most other countries.
In contrast, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours per year and students in Singapore will receive 138 hours.
While there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the timetable, but from coalition sources say the comprehensive math exam - combined with a stronger weighting of the compartment in rankings - will probably encourage schools to be recognized more hours.
The curriculum more attention is paid to "real-life problems," including financial mathematics.
