Parents of intersex children can choose "Sex undetermined"
Germany is the first European nation where a third gender is recognized for children who were born with ambiguous genitalia.
Newborn is assigned no longer rigid male or female.
Under the new law parents have to explain no more sex for such children, but can "undefined" or "not set" on the birth certificate specify.
Objective of the Act is to take the pressure off parents so they have to make any hasty decisions regarding surgery for sex reassignment in the newborn, and to combat discrimination against intersex people.
An intersex person said according to the BBC years later: "I am neither male nor female."
I remain the patchwork that was created by doctors, maimed and scarred.
It is estimated that comes one of 2,000 children each year either as a boy or as a girl.
They belong to the intersex, a group that fall under the diagnosis of "sexual differentiation disorder" (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testes) or abnormally developed genitalia.
Wallis Simpson was possibly intersexual.
Understanding the gender identification is still not very well developed, but guess most experts in the United States, and thus you should use the best information available to gender assignment, if a determination is not possible, and not wait for the psychological and physical development of the child before you look at - if at all - decide for surgery.
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who has focused on the problem of gender identification, said the new German law "sounds like a good thing."
Intersexed children represent an ethical dilemma
"Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgical intervention is required, but for most children is not that," he said.
One could make a gender assignment without surgery and then wait to see how developing the identity.
The scientific data about how a child ever develops his gender identity are not very accurate.
No one knows why it happens.
It's like the secret why people are gay.
In a report to the European Commission from 2011 states that intersex people are to be distinguished from transsexual or transgender people, because their status is not related to sex, but because of their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively male nor female, but typically both simultaneously defined or not clearly identified as one of them.
These characteristics were evident in subordinated sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also gives an overview of the discrimination, which intersex and transgender people see exposed in the workplace and the extent of harassment, violence and bias crimes.
Not with the gender image matching boys now have a special camp.
It is now possible in Australia and Nepal for adults to state on official documents male, female or "third gender".
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the world's first "genderless" person after a court lifelong maintenance of an "unspecified" had conceded gender status.
German ID cards have next to M and W in the future a third assignment, X for intersexual, the Ministry of Interior.
In neighboring France Gender issues are still controversial, as a news story on France 24
2011 signed dozens of French MEP strict Catholic country, a petition that the "gender theory" should be removed from textbooks.
The U.S. website Catholic Online has also spoken out against the German law, on the grounds: "If the world is dragged into a new state, where sex is a choice, but not sexual activity, then we rotate two other pillars of civilization. "
The mother of a newborn from Maryland told Baby Zone, they think it would be better if babies will be assigned a gender at birth.
"The parenting is stressful enough without further restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of one's child," she told the parents website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically children who were both born with male and female sexual organs, referred to as hermaphrodites, after the attractive Greek god who had both sexes.
Ten years ago, looked at the medical gender as something you could wipe out and then rebuild.
But now the ethical foundations of an operation be challenged after it is now known how complex gender identity, and that physicians also may be wrong, because they do not know how the child feels when growing with that of their assigned gender.
"Middle of the 20th Century it was called a psychiatric emergency, '"Drescher said.
If such a child was born, then you did not call the psychiatrist, but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory about the treatment of children with ambiguous genitalia goes back to Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who took the view that gender is malleable.
He coined the term "gender identity" and argued that social and environmental stimuli - such as parents raising a child - interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and shaped as to whether a person consider to be male or female.
But in one, known under the title "John / Joan" case from 1966 his theories were controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis was severed in a botched circumcision, to castrate the child completely and remove his testicles and then raise him as a girl.
"Money presented this case as a successful example of a conversion, but what he was not," said Drescher.
When the boy was about 15, he moved back to the male sex and married a woman.
At 38, however, he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of gender operations have replaced the public, "not happy with the result" are.
For example, Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous genitalia.
The doctors were not sure whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced he could never lead a "satisfying life" as a man.
So its external organ and testes were surgically removed shortly after birth in 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12 he received female hormones.
"I knew that I'm not a girl," he told ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he should get a vaginoplasty.
But because he was depressed and knew that something was wrong, he asked for his medical records.
What he found was shocking.
I was sterilized at birth - and no one has ever told me.
Bruce was born with a DSD, by which his body could not produce enough testosterone to the development of the genitals.
After learning the truth, he transferred back to the male identity, received testosterone injections and had his breasts removed himself.
He has become infertile due to the operation.
Today he fights for others in an organization called Interface Project that intersex individuals are perceived as normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, executive director of the California-based rights group Advocates for Informed Choice, worries that the German law "encourage stamping and stigmatize" could.
"Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and the child with a not fixed 'results," she explained.
We fear that favors interventions.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex, and then to be seen.
But still we do not know how the law will affect, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supported the Australian law, because "it allows adult recognition as a third sex."
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex," she explained.
In German law it comes to the assignment at birth.
This is not a battle, to which one should force young children at this time.
When they grow, they can decide on their own body.
However, Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast radiologist from Pittsburg, who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and hundreds of other supports in a support group, says the German law "authorize" both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes but has a DSD called complete androgen insensitivity.
Because of the receptor defect in the target cells for testosterone Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina but no uterus and no ovaries.
Today Katie is 29 and married, she works at the University of Pennsylvania as an assistant in child psychiatry.
Although she is infertile, hopes, however, to be able to have a child through adoption or a surrogate mother.
"The law gives parents room, so they have to make decisions should not be rushed," Baratz said.
It gives them the time to do various tests and to clarify things, giving them time before they "male" or "female" writing.
In this way everything is in order - you pull the child tall and loves it.
It has a wonderful baby and enjoys the parents happiness.
And one must not rush to make an operation that can not be undone.
"That includes the children in the decision and eliminate the fear that haunts parents, because they think they would not do the right thing," she said.
Ultimately decides the child's sex, the better suits him - and that is wonderful.
Thus children are able to make the decision themselves.
