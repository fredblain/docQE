Mick Jagger stated that he had never turned on Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said she had worked as a background singer on Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" from 2004.
Perry stated that she had eaten the old rocker in the evening, and that "he has hit on me when I was 18."
She added: "That's a long time ago and he was very nice to me."
In a statement, a representative Jaggers, 70, said Thursday that he "categorically denied that he had ever made ​​overtures with Katy Perry."
The representative added: "Maybe she confused him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance at the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Their new album "Prism" immediately landed at No. 1 this week.
