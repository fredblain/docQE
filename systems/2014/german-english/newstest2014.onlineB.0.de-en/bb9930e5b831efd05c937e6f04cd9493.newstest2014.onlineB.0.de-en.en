Esa decides on major space missions: Missions for Everyone
Distant planets, black holes or gravitational waves - experts from the European Space Agency to agree on two major projects that they want to start in the next few years now.
30 proposals were available, five are still in the race.
Worlds.
More than 1000 planets around other stars, astronomers have found.
Whether there is at least on some of them life, no one knows.
The choice is difficult: If you search for gravitational waves?
Or rather probe the origin of the cosmos?
Or search for Earth-like planets and perhaps discover extraterrestrial life?
The questions were just the leaders of the European Space Agency ESA.
For their program "Cosmic Vision" they are looking for ideas for two major space projects to advance research critical.
The budget for such an "L" missions is about one billion euros each.
The launch is expected in 2028 and 2034.
Early September, met in Paris the elite of European space research, to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas were discussed, five of which have now come into the shortlist.
Numerous committees examine the proposals, hook at the researchers after.
In the next few days, a final decision will be made by the scientific program committee.
A total of four big questions has selected the ESA, to which the missions of the program initiated in 2007 "Cosmic Vision" to find answers.
What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life?
The exact processes involved in the formation of stars of large gas clouds - and thus the formation of planets orbiting these stars - are still in the proverbial dark.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness.
And when a star has planets, under what circumstances can there life arise?
To answer this question is to start the 2017 Space Telescope "Cheops", with the 500 previously known planetary systems are examined in more detail in our vicinity.
The possibilities are limited, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, the astronomers could depict Earth-like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres and so search for "biomarkers": gases which are considered as evidence for biological activity.
How does the solar system?
This question will ultimately shed light on what are the requirements for the emergence of life.
An important role is played by the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field and the particle radiation emanating from it with the planetary system.
In our solar system, these processes examine an example.
With the "Solar Orbiter" Esa has been a mission of M-class (where the budget is around half a billion euros) approved for this question.
The probe is to start in 2017 and observe surface area and activity of the sun exactly.
Of great interest to the researchers are also Jupiter and its moons.
You want to find out what role the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system.
For the ESA provides for the first of the three L-missions of the "Cosmic Vision" program.
The probe "Juice" (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) starts her journey is expected in 2022.
Eight years later they reached Jupiter and is the planet's atmosphere as well as the icy moons Europa, Callisto and Ganymede investigate.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The universe offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and to investigate as to whether our known laws of nature are there still valid.
Maybe you will also find deviations that could physicists point the way to a new theory that can unite under whose umbrella all known laws of nature.
How did the universe come and what is it made?
13.7 billion years ago our universe was created by the Big Bang.
Besides we are familiar matter from which stars, planets and living beings as we exist, there is dark matter, whose gravity holds galaxies and clusters of galaxies, and dark energy, through whose work is accelerating the expansion of the universe.
So far, the researchers know neither what physical laws were valid in the first fraction of a second of the Big Bang, nor from which there are dark matter and dark energy.
With "Euclid" the Esa has also been granted an M-mission, whose launch is scheduled for 2020.
With a special telescope the probe is to examine the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the entire sky and thus allow conclusions about the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could make the race
Of the 30 proposals will be left at the end of the selection process only two.
Has the best chance of a license as L-Mission, according to many experts, "E-Lisa", a challenging concept for the detection of gravitational waves.
Among physicists understand changes in the structure of space-time that Albert Einstein had predicted almost 100 years ago.
Proved they were not until today.
Elisa could do that, the scientists hope behind the project.
The mission provides a two or three probes detector which is stationed in space.
He could, in contrast to plants on Earth also demonstrate gravitational waves that have arisen during the Big Bang, and thus provide new insights into the origin of the cosmos.
Four other proposals still compete at the second L-Mission: a large X-ray telescope named "Athena", which will explore, among other black holes, "Icy Planets", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism", a mission to measurement of the cosmic background radiation, and the "exoplanet Finder", which is to detect and investigate Earth-like planets.
Already excreted include suggestions for sample return transport from Mars, the exploration of the Moon, Venus and asteroids as well as for solar physics.
