The Times is a copy of the forthcoming book before and they reported on Thursday night that the Topberater the President had "large group meetings and surveys the end of 2011" was carried out to find out whether it look better waning for Obama's hopes for re-election if he fall Biden leave.

The potential change was a closely guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and in the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the closest advisers of the President - including Daley, former Obama Campaign Manager Jim Messina, and the former senior White House adviser, David Axelrod, David Plouffe and - knew about the envisaged change it.
In "Double Down" is said Daley had been at the forefront of efforts to replace Biden, despite their "close personal relationship" before you finally decided against such a move, after data showed that the candidacy of Clinton's "chances Obama "would not significantly improve.
In an interview with Martin Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered to replace Biden with Clinton.
"I expressed a number of things that you should consider, and that was one of them," Daley told the magazine.

Martin told CNN that he had Daley asked if his former boss would have known about the potential change it.
Although Daley said he did not believe that the President of the possible change "was aware" admitted the former chief of staff, said it was "possible" that Obama was aware of it.
Martin added that "double down" no definitive answer deliver to the question whether the political soundings Obama had reached desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously think Obama was not aware of the investigations about whether you should let Biden fall in the elections.
"Possibly," replied Martin.
