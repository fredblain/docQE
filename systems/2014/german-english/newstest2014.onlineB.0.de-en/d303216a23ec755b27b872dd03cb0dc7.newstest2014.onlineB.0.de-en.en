Bad Durrheim-: A dream come true for the FC
On the importance for the city and the football club's official opening ceremony for the artificial turf sports field lost despite the cold weather and the rain of anything.
A pleasant ceremony had probably all wanted last Saturday, but Peter did not want to play here.
So all those out in the cold that came without an umbrella or such a could not hold for some reason.
That was the musicians who framed the ceremony, just as so many speakers.
Therefore wet was also the FC chairman Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream.
He thanked especially Mayor Walter Klumpp, who had been heavily involved for the implementation of the project, the local council, the parties and club members, who brought up.
Here especially Lothar hero, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The sprightly pensioner laid 400 square paving stones of the new routes.
This remarkable volunteer work also paid tribute to the member of parliament Charles Rombach.
More Greetings were for urban sports committee Hubert Baier, the district chairman of the South Baden Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Frederick Knorr from the planning office, which announced a donation for the youth section of the club.
Mayor Klumpp brought to mind that recurring effects of weather in spring and autumn the original pitch so afflict that he could not be recorded.
15 years ago there were the first considerations to solve the problem, as has been thought of to build a third place at the site of the football clubs or at the Realschule at Salinensee.
Both were rejected.
Six years ago, thoughts came to the application of an artificial turf sports field, which was generally considered as the ultimate solution.
Concrete plans were taken two years ago when the FC took over the Schabel exchange at long lease, promised a cost share of EUR 100 000 for the construction of the place and the country approved funding of 104 000 euros.
The council decided in October 2012, the acquisition of the remaining 356 000 EUR in the total cost of 560 000 euros, Klumpp concluded.
Construction of 68 times 108 meter artificial turf took place on 4 June.
During the three-month-long construction phase, 3000 cubic meters of earth were removed, half of which was used for the application of a dirt bike track.
