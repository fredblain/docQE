Cry of despair a Obama voter
I have President Obama elected twice in the hope that change is possible
He says that Obama has made ​​commendable efforts have been thwarted by the blockade tactics of the Republicans
The blockade policy apologize not the site problems of Obamacare, the drone attacks
Obama's memoirs about the 2008 elections were a sad reminder of what could have been
Nathaniel P. Morris is a sophomore at Harvard Medical School.
I am currently reading a terribly sad book.
It is a book of which I have thought it would cheer me up during the gloomy second year of my medical studies and give me hope.
It is said (to win courage) "The Audacity to Win" and describes the memoirs Barack Obama's 2008 presidential election.
When I am finished the evening with my patients transcripts and go to bed, then takes me the book back into a time when the policy inspired millions and could talk a take your breath away.
The election was a landslide victory and newscaster paused to lead the historic significance of this moment in mind.
My classmates wept with joy and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on his way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
As time 2008 Obama moved into office, he had approval ratings of 82%.
And then I close the book.
Again, switch to the present is a rude awakening, as if one is torn from a dream.
It is hard to remember these optimistic times - they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I made the first time my voice has actually changed something.
But it's just not anything I could have imagined.
I acknowledge the great and versatile things that Obama has reached, by the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for health insurance to military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of forced concealment of homosexuality in the Army and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I am also of the view that the party political blockade tactics have tilted too many aspirations, with which our nation should be brought forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closing of Guantanamo Bay, just to name a few.
But after the Obama administration I defended towards colleagues and acquaintances countless times, I have arrived with my attempts at explanation at the end.
I have reached a point of political desperation.
The Republican blockade policy can not explain why one allows listening to foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas.
It can not explain why the National Security Agency collects data about the private lives of Americans and why whistleblowers are punished who disclose government wrongdoing.
It can not explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, was murdered without trial, or why public financing and spending limits are bypassed during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report in which it says that the efforts of the White House for the immobilization of the media are "the most aggressive ... since the Nixon administration."
And jüngstens it can not excuse the inability in the more than three years since the passage of the Affordable Care Act to design a simple website.
I do not know if it is what I should have expected.
Had I 18 should understand that the government's work would run counter to their previous political campaigns.
Obviously, the deputies Office is not a predictable rate, as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre influence the public debate.
But when I look at the examples above, then they seem to be largely chosen by the government itself.
And that bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and half-baked alternative, he did not seem to be able to set its direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections would fulfill the hope of which we had heard so long.
However, with the decline in the approval ratings for Obama to below 45% this week to return to the year 2008, this book has become the harder.
It awakens in me the longing for the many promises that have vanished into thin air.
This week I read a passage in the book describes how Obama had to put in the primaries in Pennsylvania a heavy loss against Clinton.
In a meeting with the election workers after deciding he told his employees that they have to come back on track and follow the purpose of their cause.
"I want us to find our magic," he said.
We need to remind ourselves who we are.
There are five years later, Mr. President, and I could not agree more.
The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nathaniel Morris.
