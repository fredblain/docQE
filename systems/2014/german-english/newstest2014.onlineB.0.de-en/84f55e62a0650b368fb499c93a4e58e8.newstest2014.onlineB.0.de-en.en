Coulson put a phone hacking for checking a tip
The former News of the Word editor Andy Coulson allegedly put a "phone-hacking, surveillance and confrontation" when trying to confirm a false tip about an affair of the then Home Secretary Charles Clarke.
Andrew Edis QC prosecutor told the court at the Old Bailey, News of the World had in May 2005, a false rumor to the effect heard that Clarke was having an affair with his "attractive special advisor" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper commissioned the private detective Glenn Mulcaire hacking away at Pawlbys voicemails, and pursued them, but they Coulson also called and left messages, as the court was told.
"After the prosecutor believes Coulson, who is now editor of the NotW, the one that stays and hopes to catch them in the act, but one that people like to face a story to see her reaction before the tabernacle of people is "said Edis.
He said NotW use three methods to investigative researching stories: Phone-hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows from the second, monitoring, otherwise it can not be.
What about the first?
Does he know about the phone-hacking decision?
He argues that from, but we say. "And if he knew about it"
Rumors of an affair Clarkes were first taken up by the feature editors of NotW, were told as a source that was sexually interested in Pawlby: "Do not waste your time, it is with Charles together."
A band with voice mail on your phone at least three occasions was secured in August 2006 Mulcaires apartment.
The investigators also found entries on the computer of the detective, on the Pawlby and her sister were saved as "Projects".
In the time when the research led, the grandparents of Pawlby received anonymous phone calls in which they were asked for information about them, said Edis.
Meanwhile, supervised the former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup monitoring the movements of Pawlby.
On 18 June 2005 Coulson left her a voice mail with the following content: "I have a story that we want to bring out tomorrow, I would like to talk to Charles."
Edis said Coulson's activities in this story followed the same pattern as with other important figures, such as the former Home Secretary David Blunkett.
The jury heard Thursday that Coulson Blunkett've faced because of an affair with a married woman, as he himself was romantically involved with co-accused Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at that time.
Coulson and Brooks deny to have conspired with others, between the 3rd October 2000 and 9 August 2006 to hack phones.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have the phone-hacking added.
