Around 14:15 clock on Wednesday saw a walker, who walked his dog, the Ruby stranded on the 15-meter-high heel quarry.
The technical rescue team from Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the spot and roped off to save Ruby's, which was then transported in a dog cage upward.
Andy Clayton, specialist technical rescue team, said: "She was in a dangerous situation.
She was in the middle of the rock wall - 15 meters from the top and the bottom removed.
She did not move a muscle during her rescue - she was like frozen stiff.
But now she's fine.
She has subsequently eaten a few dog biscuits.
This was a rather unusual use.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, specialist technical rescue team, said: "Ruby was very lucky."
There was the possibility that she was very seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was brought to the vet for examination, but except exhaustion and dehydration nothing found.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "In watching the rescue was scary."
I could not believe that she was really up there.
It was wonderful to hold them back in the arms.
The vet said that if the fatigue has gotten too big and it would have collapsed, they would probably have crashed.
The firefighters have done a great job.
It was really brave what they have done.
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added: "We were afraid that they would fall off, but it stayed up."
The firefighters were great.
I can not believe where she was.
