In a New Zealand town Burt Muro is regarded as lovable codger because he has undertaken to participate with his motorcycle, built in 1920, in a race in America.
Burt is not to dissuade despite a heart defect from his dream.
With his savings, donations and single pair of a mortgage on his old workshop shed he sits by ship to Los Angeles.
After the film, there is coffee, tea and cakes.
