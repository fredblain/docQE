Egypt's first president sworn in freely chosen
Mohammed Mursi sets from the oath of office, but his day of triumph should not mean the end of political disputes in Egypt.
The Islamist Mohammed Mursi promised a "new Egypt," as he was sworn in as the first elected president of the country and thus the successor of Hosni Mubarak took, which had been 16 months previously expelled from office.
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamist President of the Arab world and Egypt's fifth head of state since the fall of the monarchy, about 60 years ago.
He swore the oath before the 18 dressed in black robes judges of the court, which has its headquarters on the Nile, and is modeled on an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We strive for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," Mursi said at the ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.
"Today, the Egyptian people has laid the foundation for a new life - absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability," said the 60-year-old Mursi, a trained in the U.S. engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group since its inception was usually taken 84 years ago as a proscribed organization by the government sharply targeted.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarding the building, as Mursi shortly after eleven clock local time, arrived in a small car convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered outside the court to cheer the new president, and in contrast to the presidential pomp of the Mubarak-time traffic was only briefly halted so that the convoy could cross the usually busy street, with the city center connects the southern suburbs.
Derided as uncharismatisches "spare" the Brotherhood has his personal prestige increased since his victory and a Friday khutbah in which he presented himself not only as a candidate of the Islamists, but of all those who ans the aspirations of the uprising from the year 2011 against the authoritarian Mubarak wanted to bring destination.
"Egypt is now a civilian, national, constitutional and modern state", in a blue suit with red tie dressed Mursi told the judges in the wood-paneled chamber in which he took the oath of office.
Later Mursi went to the University of Cairo, where he was to give his inaugural speech.
He was officially welcomed by an army band playing the national anthem, to which he listened at attention.
The military leader Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
Upon his arrival, he was greeted by hundreds present in the largest auditorium at the University with chants of "The army and the people are one hand."
Erected as a bastion of secular education in 1908 from Cairo University has evolved in the 1970s into a stronghold of Islamist student groups.
Mursi presented on Friday a symbolic oath in Tahrir Square from, the birthplace of the uprising that led to the end of the authoritarian Mubarak's rule last year, and he vowed presidential powers to reclaim that took over from the hunted out of office President of the Military Council.
However, with the drop of the official oath before the Court and not as usual in front of the Parliament he obeys the will of the military, indicating that the power struggle will continue.
Mursi's speech at Tahrir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
