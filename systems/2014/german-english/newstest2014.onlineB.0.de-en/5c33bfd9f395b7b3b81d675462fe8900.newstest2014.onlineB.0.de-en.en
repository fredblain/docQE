Scientists were able to throw more light on the context in which the wagging tail of a dog stands with his mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dog with his tail wagged more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while it was the left side in nervous dogs.
But now scientists say that other dogs perceive these subtle differences and to respond.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: "In humans, it is well known that the left and right brain react differently to stimuli that cause positive or negative emotions."
Here we have tried to take this for us in other species.
He also noted that the right brain is in dogs just like in humans responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings.
To learn more about how dogs react to the lateral tail wagging their species, the researchers monitored the animals, while looked at these films from other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of quadrupeds and analyzed the behavior.
Probably we will soon understand why the tail moved in the times a times in the other direction
Professor Vallortigara said: "We have the dogs movies with dogs shown - either a lifelike version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, and we were able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or right."
When the animals saw an otherwise emotionless dog moves the tail to the right (as viewed from the perspective of wagging the dog out), they remained completely relaxed.
But it was the tail inclination mainly to the left (again, from the perspective of the dog that wags), so increased their heart rate and they looked uneasy.
According to Professor Vallortigara the dogs do not communicate with each other intentionally by these movements.
Rather, he is convinced that the dogs have learned from experience, in which movements they should be worried and when not.
He said: "If you have several encounters with other dogs and wag his tail in one direction is rather linked with friendly behavior and the right side rather produces a less friendly behavior, then you respond based on these experiences."
The researchers say that the findings of dog owners, veterinarians and trainers could help to a better understanding of the emotions of their animal.
John Bradshaw, an expert on dog behavior and a visiting fellow at the Faculty of Veterinary Science of the University of Bristol said that this was not the first study in which it was investigated whether the left and right is important for dogs.
Last year a team from the University of Lincoln found out that dogs turn your head to the left when they see an aggressive dog, and to the right if there is a contented dog.
In another research project at the University of Victoria in Canada, the following was written: "Dogs tend to go on a robot dog, if its, tail 'wags left and not the right place to be restless - the other way around as in the Italian study."
According to his testimony, the differences could be because the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the movies or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help, he said.
"While there is considerable evidence for many different mammals, that the two halves of the brain are used for different purposes, but many of the details have yet to be determined - and dogs are no exception," said Bradshaw.
Since their behavior but leave simply record it will probably not be long before we understand why the tail sometimes, sometimes moved to the one in the other direction.
