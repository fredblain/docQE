FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices on airplanes (but no cell phone conversations)
Air travelers can hear from departure to landing their electronic devices for reading, working, games, music and use the watching movies, but not on a call with the phone now, the new Directives on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) were issued in the United States.
However, the passengers should not expect that these changes are implemented immediately.
How quickly they would be implemented, would depend on the airline, FAA employee Michael Huerta told a press conference.
The airlines need the FAA to demonstrate that airplanes meet the new guidelines and that they have updated the training manuals of the flight personnel as well as the arrangements for the storage of the device according to the new regulations.
The FAA stated that it had already received from some airlines plans that want to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Under these airlines were also Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the condition of the plan, we could expand the use of electronic devices very soon approve," the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers must turn off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
It may not start up if the airplane has reached a height of three kilometers and is the captain of the green light.
Upon entering the landing, passengers must switch it off again and may not restart them before the plane landed.
Under the new guidelines could airlines whose planes were protected against electronic interference, allow their passengers to use the equipment even when off, landing and on the runway, the FAA said.
Most new aircraft and other airmen who were converted for the use of Wi-Fi at higher altitudes, should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the professional association of professional flight attendants, welcomed the changes.
"If the new regime is implemented safely - and we are therefore cooperating closely with the airline -, the two sides will benefit," said Glading.
It is we honestly sorry to feel on this issue as watchdogs.
Never-theless Internet connections for surfing, exchange of emails, text messages or downloading data under three kilometers still prohibited, explained the authority.
Passengers are asked to put smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.
So no still "Words With Friends" which Scrabble similar online game, in 2011, played the actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone when he had publicity leave a jet of American Airlines, because he refused to turn off the power while the the aircraft was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices such as laptops must continue to be stored, since the possibility of injury if they fly through the cabin.
Cell phone conversations during the flight also remain still prohibited.
The regulatory authority for telephone calls is the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not the FAA.
FAA lifts ban possibly for certain electronic devices during takeoff and landing on
Last month, said Mark Rosenker of the Highway Traffic Safety Administration National Transportation Safety Board, a security expert for national transport issues at CBS News, cellphones would still be considered a risk.
"Mobile is really a problem, not only because it could potentially cause interference with navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that the transfer from the air can interfere with transmission towers," said Rosenker.
An advisory committee of industry, which was launched to study this topic by the FAA, recommended last month that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, the pressure on the FAA has increased to relax restrictions on the use.
Critics such as the Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri argued that there was no valid security reasons for the ban.
The restrictions are also more difficult to enforce, because the use of the devices has become ubiquitous.
In some studies, it is mentioned that forgets or ignores the shutdown of the device up to a third of the passengers.
The FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic devices by passengers after reports of disturbance of navigation and communication devices carried by passengers FM radios had become known at that time represented the latest technology trend.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA that they make electronic interference nothing.
Airlines offer passengers for a few years Wi-Fi if the altitude has been reached.
The adapted to Wi-Fi systems flyers are also less susceptible to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the greater use of electronic devices according to the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices emit radio in general much less radiation than previous generations.
E-reader, for example, emit minimal radiation when page is turned.
But when downloading or sending of data transmission values ​​are stronger.
Among the advocates of a relaxation of the limitations of the instruments use by passengers counts Amazon.com.
2011 invited company employees a passenger plane full of Kindle e-readers and made ​​a test flight, to identify problems, but could not find.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk involved in the use of equipment.
Douglas Kidd from the passenger National Association of Airline Passengers said he was of the view that failure by the device was real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other committee members said there were only scattered reports of pilots who speak for a failure of aircraft systems by the device, and most of them are very old.
The committee recommended that the FAA, however, to allow pilots to order the shutdown of the equipment by the passengers during instrument landing under poor visibility conditions.
A grouping of the travel industry welcomed the changes, described it as a reasonable accommodation for travelers who would now be extensively equipped with technology.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not contrary to safety," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
