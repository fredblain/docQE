Living the Future Perspective
Actually Waltraud Ries lives fantastic.
Your house is situated in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with greenery, old trees, friendly neighbors and not too much traffic.
In the city there are only a few minutes by public transport.
"I hope you have no fear of spiders?" Asks Waltraud Ries and points to a fat spider on the door frame.
I've been looking for some time for a new apartment for my husband and me.
But you know how difficult that is in Stuttgart.
However, the reason is not a spider phobia, but the worry that many stairs not being able to cope with the age of the home and in the apartment, she explains.
In addition: since a meniscus operation the Mittfünfzigerin had to experience firsthand what it means to move from floor to floor with handicap.
Most recently, a book of hers has appeared on 'Happy to live in old age? - What type of housing is the best for me'.
'Our apartment is the best example of what does not go at the age', she begins to talk.
When she and her husband moved into the apartment on more than 20 years ago, it was just a nice apartment surrounded by greenery.
Today, with the middle fifty Waltraud Ries thinks differently.
But she also knows that she is one of the few people to ever deal with the theme 'Living for the Elderly'.
Most displace it as long as possible.
Old are always the others, 'she says with a smile.
Only when the suffering is really great should you start thinking.
'Then it may already be too late,' says Ries.
In her book, the interior designer before 17 residential models for independent living in old age.
'But what type of accommodation you choose, is always an individual decision' she explains.
T h e solution does not exist for the age.
Even those who could not afford the retirement home in Tuscany or Brittany, should always consider that he could also be ill.
And: 'Without good knowledge of the language is simplistic common in Dolce Vita,' is the textbook author resettlement willing to consider.
In their models, there are classical models of care, alternative living arrangements or the often quoted Retiree WG.
At the age of each has their ticks and quirks
'For me, as a residential community would be nothing,' she says with a wink.
Certainly not., As in a student apartment with a shared bathroom and a kitchen
'At the age you just need his retreats', as Ries.
That a senior living community can still work, do not want to exclude the author yet.
This must then have been different but as in the classical student apartment.
And sometimes you just want to even his rest ', she believes.
With this view she is not alone, at least in the state capital.
'Most of the old people in Stuttgart want as long as possible remain in their own home', is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, head of the civil service life in old age the state capital.
Your department advises people around the theme 'Getting Older'.
Therefore, especially older people would often take inconveniences and restrictions in buying, just to stay in their familiar surroundings to be able to, which is also the experience of the Stiftung Warentest.
There are now many ways to make the house or apartment accessible.
Ries recommends that all who deal with the age-appropriate remodeling their house or apartment, first of all to inform themselves thoroughly and not to instruct the first best craftsmen.
Today, there are specialists for the age-based reconstruction.
Even in the apartment to let one or other implement, and if it's just the toilet seat, clears the interior designer on.
But it is not always possible to the existing dwelling age appropriate and thus remodel accessible, even if it is still so beautiful.
This experience had Waltraud Ries make.
Although you could install a stair lift inside the home, which also paved the way with stairs up to the apartment door but that would be far greater obstacle.
It will continue to search until they found the ideal property for herself and her husband.
Before the move it is a horror to her more than before the spider on her apartment door.
