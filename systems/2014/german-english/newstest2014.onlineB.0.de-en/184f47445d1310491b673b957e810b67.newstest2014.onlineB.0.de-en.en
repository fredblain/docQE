Is Europe's elite willing to make with the UK shops?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention to bring the economy to a table and to define what those who care in the UK for wealth and job, want to change our relationship with the EU.
To this end, we have given under British business leaders in order and asked them what they think about the UK, the economy and the EU's largest and most comprehensive survey.
YouGov surveyed over 1,000 business leaders that represent the British company sizes, sectors and regions about.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies now exported outside Europe, focusing on countries that modernize and grow, while the Member States are languishing in the EU.
You want that from the government new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil are favored, rather than on a long and tiring process to reform the obscure EU institutions.
When asked about her view on specific statutory issues - from antitrust law to product legislation - the majority of business leaders believed that the control of these key competences should be sent back to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the internal market, since according to a statement the company the cost of the rules from Brussels would now outweigh the advantages of being part of Europe's trade area - even 40 percent of large companies agreed to the to which are traditionally the most Europhile.
Finally, and most will probably say, our survey of business leaders found that a clear majority wishes of the UK a course in the direction of change of the Agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not on politics.
This finding, which is found in companies of all sizes and leading groups, shows that the economy is on a "meaningful change" urges that brings the issue of action back to the UK.
The stakes are high - an amendment to the Agreement, and better conditions for the UK would result in 16 percent to a change of opinion in favor of remaining in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt about it: This survey shows that the UK economy stands behind his plan for the renegotiation of British conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that firms expect a significant shift in the balance of power back to the UK from a retrial.
A better deal for the UK economy is possible and increasingly necessary after the euro zone is now moving towards closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK as the result of our survey shows, which means an increased focus on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to business regulations.
