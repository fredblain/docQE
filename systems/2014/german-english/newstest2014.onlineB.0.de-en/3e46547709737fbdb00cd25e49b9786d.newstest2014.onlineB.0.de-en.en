Experienced a fun afternoon with music
Since 15 years the family Kaul loads the Dietinger seniors to coffee, cake and afterwards to a Vesper.
Earlier, the senior citizens were entertained in the service area.
Meanwhile, place this afternoon at the nursing home St. Joseph.
The residents looked forward to the delicious cakes and pies.
Later there was sausage salad.
With catchy melodies are talking Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich.
