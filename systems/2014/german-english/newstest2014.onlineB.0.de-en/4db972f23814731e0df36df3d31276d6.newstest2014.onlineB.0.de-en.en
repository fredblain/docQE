Traffic lights on constant red: Pay attention to waiting time
Sometimes a traffic light is simply not green.
The contact loop in the road is not responding, or the light signal is faulty.
What is one to do - running a red?
If an interested party waiting at a red light long enough and the crossing is free, he can drive, says the Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorrad".
The waiting time must but be "appropriate", which should be interpreted differently from case to case.
Becker advises to endure at least five minutes before is to start from a malfunction of the traffic lights.
Who continues the journey despite the red light, but would have to be aware that he bears full guilt for an accident caused thereby.
Those who tolerated less than five minutes, waiting may not be long enough, warns Becker and refers to a decision of the Higher Regional Court of Hamm.
In the treated case a driver had after about three minutes continuous red ignored the traffic lights and had to answer for a red light violation negligent.
The traffic light was in fact not defective, but jumped a little later to green.
But not the fine - A ban was spared because of the particular situation.
