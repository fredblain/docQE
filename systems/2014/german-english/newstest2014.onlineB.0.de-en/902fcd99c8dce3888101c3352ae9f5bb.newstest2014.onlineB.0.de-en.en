Land Rover Rally Series angek√ºndigt
In the interior you will find racing seats and six-point harnesses, and a speakerphone.
Options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with care by bowler Works mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, managing director of Bowler Motorsport, said: "The rally customers who come to bowlers have changed."
They are not all experienced racers, but people who are looking for excitement and adventure as well as an accessible way to world-class events.
We are pleased to open this way, in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens up new ways to experience the various rally events in the UK and abroad and newcomers to the rigors and reality of Rally Raid prepare.
We really had fun working to develop the Defender Challenge cars - this is a fun championship.
Moreover, there is at the Defender Challenge a training and test day in February as well as the option to take part in desert race in North Africa and the Middle East.
