Pawn shops booming in Singapore, as the crisis has arrived in the middle layer
In a pawn shop in the shopping center in Bendemeer Singapore Janani Amir Thal Inga will exchange a gold bracelet, a ring and a pair of earrings to pay the school fees of their daughters can.
"My husband and I have just bought a house because all my money is tied up in it," says Amir Thal Inga.
Although 3,000 Singapore dollars earn every month (about 1,730 euros) as an administrative assistant and her husband also work, the monthly family income was not enough, she says.
In fact, the demand in parts of Southeast Asia - where the household debt increases - so large that valuemax, where she has made ​​her exchange, this week was the third pawnshop, which is listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
The mortgaging of jewelry is not only a quick way to get money - 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amir Thal Inga - but also almost as low as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically require pawn shops in Singapore an APR of 17 percent, which is only slightly above the 15.4 percent that requires the United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping center.
Pawn shops offer but the advantage that there is no credit checks or proof of income is required, which is why loans are faster than with banks possible.
For this reason, millions of people contact in the region at pawn shops after families are feeling the pressure of rising living costs and an increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis, and cheap credit due to loose fiscal policy in developed economies look to families with lower and middle incomes pawn shops, so as to compensate the difference in stuttering economy.
This week marked the rating agency Standard & Poor's rising household debt burden, mainly by rising mortgage as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore in the opinion of the Agency, the highest household debt in Asia in relation to gross domestic product.
Malaysia is 80 percent of GDP at the top of the list, an increase of 60 percent in the year 2008.
Economists worry also because of the high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which is just come out this week from a technical recession.
On Thursday, the data showed a persistence of weak exports and a decline in consumer demand.
"In effect, this means that with the rising cost of the people in the middle to lower segment (the income scale) are trying to supplement their income, wherever that is possible," said Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historic highs in gold prices over the last two years, the trend to pledge personal property exacerbated, as people take the opportunity to turn the jewelry of the family in cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the pledged goods in the 200 pawnshops in the city state gold.
People say: "The price of gold looks good, let's grandmother's pledge gold chain and bring back next month."
The largest Thai pawnshop operator, Easy Money, has experienced in its stores a 20 percent increase in customers in recent months.
The growth in the mortgage business is so strong that wishes to expand valuemax, operator of the store in Bendemeer and 15 further in Singapore, not only in the neighboring Malaysia - where the company operates four houses - but also outside of Asia, so Yeah Lee Ching, Executive Director of valuemax.
The Company financed the 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollars, which it occupied this week with the IPO in Singapore.
While some lenders are caught in the crossfire because of high interest rates, explains Yeah, that pawn shops not only more favorable interest rates than other lenders would offer, but also not directly increased the debt.
"Customer borrow items they already own, and the liquefaction of personal property does not increase the Haushaltsverschulung," she explained.
The mortgage lending is socially increasingly accepted as a short-term secured financing.
Also, not all people who use pawn shop in financial trouble.
Rich people from Singapore are also in the branches of valuemax to pledge gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
To us, clients come from every social class.
"This includes Wealthy in the short term borrow something for a business or investment, or have small businesses that are bottlenecks in the cash flow bridge," said Yeah.
Sometimes they also need just very fast money.
