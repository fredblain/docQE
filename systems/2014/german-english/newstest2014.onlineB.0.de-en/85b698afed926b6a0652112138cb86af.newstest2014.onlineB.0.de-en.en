Before the derby against Schalke mitgereiste BVB supporters had taken care of with flares for ugly scenes at the Veltins-Arena.
Borussia Dortmund subsequently announced to severe consequences.
Before Friday's game in the Bundesliga with VfB Stuttgart Ultras responded with a silence - at first.
It was an unusual, almost ghostly acoustics, which the viewer to park offered shortly before the kick-off of the Bundesliga match between German vice-champion Borussia Dortmund and VfB Stuttgart at Signal Iduna.
To hear the guests were mostly fans with their songs.
The South Stand, however, where the most loyal of the loyal - and loudest - BVB fans are first presented itself exceptionally quiet: No chants, no battle cries.
The pedestal of the Capo, who usually coordinates the common accentuation remained unoccupied.
And the very front in the stands blew lonely a big flag with inscription "section stadium ban".
Just as goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller as always became the first BVB players the place, surged on short-term jubilation.
When his teammates followed, there were loud singing and waving scarves - but not universally.
In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the South Stand nothing stirred.
The fact that the stadium announcer Norbert Dickel again the positive experiences of the last few days - Derby victory, victory over Arsenal, contract renewal of coach JÃ¼rgen Klopp - enumerated, did not care for celebratory mood.
It was not until five minutes before the kickoff of crested Capo his podium - and the hitherto almost tangible with hands tension erupted into a loud cry, as Dickel as usual queried the atmosphere in the stands at the stadium.
The last was, as always, the South Stand on the series - and was finally here again as usual the loudest place in the stadium.
And as with the latest kick-off of the south stand the loud call "Derby winner will be on" came, everything was as usual again.
The silence before was probably a reaction to the events of the past days.
Immediately before derby against FC Schalke 04 some of the terraces BVB fans flares were fired into the stands and on the court - and almost hit goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller.
The game was later kicked off because of the chaotic scenes.
BVB boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received in his office the tops of Dortmund Ultras then - and is believed Watzkes words, this was a rather uncomfortable for the fan representatives appointment.
"There will be massive cuts for the entire Ultra movement," the BVB boss announced on Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate measure under Watzke said the ultras a choreography for the home match against VfB Stuttgart.
"I have forbidden," he explained.
The zero tolerance policy when it comes to pyrotechnics, we can not give up.
In addition, the Ultras different ways of punishment were demonstrated - until Tuesday they have now time to choose one.
Otherwise, Watzke, BVB will determine a sanction until the end of next week.
"This is drastic," assured Watzke.
It will be interesting how the responses to the South Stand fail then.
