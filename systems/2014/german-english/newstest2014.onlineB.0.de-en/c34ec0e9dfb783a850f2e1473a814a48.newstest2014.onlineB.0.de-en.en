Johanna Rahner wants to pursue in the forum of the question of how to classify the people today the "last things" after death.
If people had known in the past centuries it too much and then set to those images of Heaven and Hell, "which to this day dominate our ideas," says the contemporary prophetic teachings draw from the hopes of completion rather by a certain embarrassment or even from speechlessness.
"The greater hope is Christians being duly exorcised by the criticism of religion," says the officer.
She had "provided us with so many question marks that we seem to have lost the exclamation mark".
Johanna Rahner goes on to say: "However, the key challenge remains the stumbling block of death".
This was connected with the question of that longing, "the dreams of that in the end everything should be good."
