Seriously injured after collision
Early Friday afternoon, two motorists were seriously injured in a head-on collision on State Road 44 near Revensdorf.
The police blocked the road completely immediately, but could say little of what happened at first.
However, there are different testimonies that should be evaluated only.
It is clear that the 19-year old charioteer of a VW Golf drove towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf came to meet her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles collided, the woman was so badly jammed that firefighters took almost half an hour to free them from the car wreck.
The actual cause of the accident remained at first unclear.
Both were injured to nearby hospitals.
The route was about two hours fully locked.
