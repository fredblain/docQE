Union and SPD have continued their coalition negotiations with the themes of the Interior and Justice.
For this purpose, the relevant group came together in Berlin in the morning.
Among other things, it comes to direct democracy, MPs bribery and the federal police.
In the morning, the Working Group on Migration and Integration wanted to continue their deliberations.
They would go, among other things on the subject of dual citizenship, in which both sides have opposing views.
The SPD wants the compulsion for immigrant children born in Germany to opt for one end - the Union rejects a one-two.
When it comes to traffic that is not on this Friday on the agenda, underpinned the SPD her no to a required by the CSU car toll.
A vignette is a "flat rate for frequent driving and thus ecologically counterproductive," said the SPD negotiator on the issue of transport, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his group.
It threatened Ausweichverkehre on rural roads, which are already black spots.
The introduction of a toll for all passenger cars would be from the perspective Pronolds also only a first step.
"There is a danger that at a later date, the compensation for German is deleted," he said.
