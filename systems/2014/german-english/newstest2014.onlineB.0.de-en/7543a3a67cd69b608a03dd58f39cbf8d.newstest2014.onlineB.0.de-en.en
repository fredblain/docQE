To date, the police station Kempten can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
The officers were only called twice to egg-throwing children, who threw them against building facades.
The house owners realized this in time and the eggs remains the same remote, is also likely to be incurred no damage.
Furthermore, in the urban area and some New Year's Eve firecrackers were probably fired, but again no damage has occurred.
A resident in the Bishop-Freundorfer-way reported that his car wrapped with toilet paper and his wheel covers were stolen.
Until the arrival of the police, the man has his wheel covers, however, all found again in the immediate vicinity, which is why the police did not have to take further action.
