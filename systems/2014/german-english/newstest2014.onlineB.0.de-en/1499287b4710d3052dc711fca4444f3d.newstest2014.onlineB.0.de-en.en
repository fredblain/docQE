For 21 years saw Georges Bwelle with how his sick father repeatedly lost consciousness and went to hospitals that do not have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle in 1981 in a car accident near Yaounde, the capital of Cameroon, injured.
At first he only had a broken arm, but then made ​​an inflammation that spread to his brain and caused a hematoma, which should affect him for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
We would have released him from Cameroon, if we had had the money.
Instead Bwelle spent years to accompany his father into overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get treatment there, they had to offer.
"It's not easy," commented Bwelle.
It is five clock in the morning to leave the house and run to the hospital to be first, and is not yet first.
There are very many patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has not changed much since Bwelles father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
In contrast, the ratio in the United States is a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there was a doctor for it, most Cameroonians could not afford the visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three-quarters of health care spending in the state are private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
His father and to see so many of his compatriots did suffer in Bwelle the decision ripe to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers have carried out 700 free surgeries in the last year.
He was himself a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaounde.
In addition, he established a nonprofit organization called ASCOVIME traveling on weekends in rural areas and there offering free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday he squeeze and up to 30 people in minibus and take the tied medical equipment on the roof over unpaved terrain in the villages who need help.
Not always everything goes smoothly.
More than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they are welcomed as heroes: a feast, singing and dancing and the best accommodation, the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a cause for celebration and Bwelle - with his big smile and boundless energy - is happy at this joyous celebration.
The next morning the team begins with the analysis of hundreds of patient.
"Per trip we treat 500 people," said Bwelle.
They come from a radius of 60 kilometers around the village - and on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics provides medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are being treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crutches donated eyeglasses or free birth certificates - a document that is required for school, but many poor families simply can not afford.
Evenings, the team performs simple operations with local anesthesia.
The operations normally find in a school, town hall or an apartment instead, after the procedure the patient get up and go into the recovery area to make room for the next one.
The lighting for the OP and the disinfection equipment is supplied by the generator of the group and so work Bwelle and his volunteers into the early morning hours on Sunday.
It is a tough task, but the village musicians normally help to keep the team motivated.
"You drums all night to keep us awake and able to continue our work," says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team then travels back to the city, tired but proud of the work done.
The group - a mixture of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students - has in recent years carried out 700 free surgeries and knows that she whose work has an enormous difference for the people they help.
A man explained that the free operation of a hernia, which he had received, it now enables to work again.
"It changed my family's future," said the man.
In addition to weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon at the hospital Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaounde.
With this second job he Financiers 60% of its charitable activities, as Bwelle, the rest come from private donations.
"I really do not know when he sleeps," says Katie O'Malley, who is studying medicine in the second year at Drexel University in Philadelphia and voluntarily cooperates in Bwelles group.
He is always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization, so he can go to these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students as O'Malley, who come from the U.S. and Europe and support Bwelle, this is an opportunity to gain practical experience, they would never get at home.
"We can be there, where we help to dab blood or the instruments for Dr. Bwelle keep in operations," said O'Malley.
That would be in America as a medical student in the second year never possible.
The students pay for their trip to Cameroon normally even and often bring donated medical supplies with.
Are they but once in Yaoundé, Bwelle will cover accommodation, transport and guide.
"He is without a doubt a hero," says O'Malley.
He dedicated his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people, knows no boundaries.
For Bwelle the almost constant work is not a burden.
To help others to a happier life and to fulfill a promise he made ​​to his father, gives him great pleasure.
"I'm so happy when I'm doing this work," says Bwelle.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to make people laugh again, to relieve the pain.
