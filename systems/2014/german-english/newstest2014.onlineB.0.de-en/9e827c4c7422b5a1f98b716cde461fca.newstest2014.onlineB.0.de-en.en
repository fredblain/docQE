Veganism is subordinated to the vegetarianism, according to dictionaries, differs from this but in a very significant way.
Because while vegetarians eating cream cake, ice cream or a strong Edam allow these delicacies are not on the menu of a vegan.
Milk, cheese, egg, in addition to not eating meat and fish can be from the vegans from all consumption of animal products - honey is denied.
What remains, one might ask, but upon closer inspection, the vegan diet world characterized by a considerable ingenuity from.
"Spreads are very popular," says Ute Henkel man, the owner of the local health food store that holds a variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also visited the store in Domgasse like.
For 13 years, the New Zealand-born vegan, in Lampert home he finds (almost) everything on what he needs to live. "In 1997, I introduced to my diet and became a vegetarian."
Around the turn of the century was the next step and I became a vegan.
"The conviction came not only because of the food but because of the choice of shoes," says Proctor, who prefers leatherette normal leather.
He realized that it's also in other everyday matters without animal products.
First and foremost, be a vegan ethics.
"I do not need that animals die for me," Proctor says of the maxim of vegans, who covers the entire consumer behavior.
Instead of burgers, scrambled eggs or gummy bears hinterherzutrauern, the vegans have quickly discovered completely new products, the enthusiasm increased.
"It's a double bonus," Proctor says today, "actually puts his vegan any waiver, no asceticism, but also it is an asset." The assumption that reducing the variety of dining options with the change in diet, Proctor rather leads back to the force of habit.
And these conditionings could also fail no matter how many well-intentioned attempt.
"The addiction factor is a crucial factor that makes many give up quickly, similar to smoking," says Proctor on a comparison.
And a used: "Certain tastes are not moor at the beast."
Often it's the spices or the type of preparation that make up the flavor.
"But you can produce the same effect in other ways," says the vegans.
At a barbecue brings Proctor example, eggplant, mushrooms and a few Veganwürste.
He shall ensure a balanced and varied diet, which is quite well once should taste savory.
Of course you want to have something between the teeth, which is legitimate.
"It is supposed to taste, but this is to reduce not only on animal food," says Proctor.
Harmful effects to eating disorders, a more widespread acceptance that he had not suffered.
For me, the change has had a positive aspect.
I take no strange cholesterol and have a higher vitamin content.
There are high-performance athletes who feed exclusively vegan.
"My blood values ​​are well, I'll often check," says Proctor.
Especially against the lack of vitamin B12 warn Vegansimus many critics.
"Because animals are fed with feed, instead of grazing in the pasture, it is questionable whether the meat you buy in the freezer, the vitamin B12 content is high," says Proctor.
For vegans, it also give you the opportunity to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets to be.
"My B12 levels are fine," he explains.
Long distances must not go Proctor for food procurement.
Staple food, there is finally everywhere and every supermarket now has soy milk and other products.
Everything I need, I find locally.
Only now and then I buy something special.
"Many people overlook that just only the finished products are expensive, but so is the case with" ordinary "finished products are also known to".
In any case, the preparation vegetarian dishes is much cheaper and less time consuming than generally believed.
"In the home kitchen, there is much to discover, with a few minor tweaks can be good, if not in some cases better results," says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking soda and carbonated instead of egg, with its vegan cheesecake was able to bring his parents to marvel Proctor.
Family celebrations gives the vegans a new spice.
This has momentum when you cook together, which has a new significance.
"The situations which may thereby arise are as varied as the people themselves," says Proctor.
Of course skepticism but it has also been met with.
No longer tastes good my food?
"Should I now feel bad because I drink milk?" - For of these questions one must act as a vegan with tact.
"I do not reject people from yes, I am part of this society," Proctor would eke no Enklavendasein.
And a closer look at the everyday world then did not appear so veganfremd as suspected - and the vegans not as restricted as is commonly assumed in everyday life.
Fast food is also allowed.
Fries are everywhere!
"Many kebab shops sell falafel, or even a vegetarian Yufka," says Proctor.
In a pizzeria he will fallback to pasta dishes, or just order a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit.
The restaurants provide so slowly respond.
"When I started 13 years ago to feed me vegan, everything was much more difficult," the New Zealanders can make a development track down: "You have to talk to people, make them aware of it."
"If enough requests come, they may be inclined to add to the menu," he hopes.
Vegan Restaurants evolve, such as the galley in Mannheim or the café Vogelfrei.
Proctor who desires that other restaurants have at least stand a vegan dish on the menu.
Basically are vegan dishes for everyone.
Everyone can eat, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive.
"Meat dishes, however, are exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others," says Proctor.
"If you want to avoid food scares, then veganism is a sure way to make the most part impossible from the outset," says Proctor.
However, the shopping vegan products can be a little difficult at the beginning.
Especially when you learn to understand the animal additives contained in peanuts as colorants his can, it seems to leave quickly to compliance with the ethics of so many hurdles and pitfalls of courage.
Not only, therefore, Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book: "Veganissimo - Animal Ingredients and their Alternatives" explains the many ingredients that are buried food but also detergents.
"Gradually, you develop a scanner look and know what signs and logos you have to look out for" It's sometimes better to do small steps than stand still or to stumble, "says Proctor.
The veganism, it is an important moral clue who beats on consciousness.
Perhaps he did not make it all that it stores its habits, but at least he can teach consumers to question their habits critical.
