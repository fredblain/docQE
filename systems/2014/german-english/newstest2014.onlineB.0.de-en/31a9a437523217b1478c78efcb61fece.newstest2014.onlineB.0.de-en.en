Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to "authenticity test"
The government is thinking in the context of advanced actions through a "test of authenticity" for foreign workers with 457 visa.
Should the test be introduced, he came across a criterion used to prevent that the 457 to fill unskilled jobs or as a back door for the influx of family and friends to Australia will be used.
Today, a discussion of the government's proposal was published after the former deputy of the Labor Party, Maxine McKew, had condemned the comments of the Government in regard to foreign workers because they could be perceived by the neighbors of Australia as an insult.
"Loud explanations like, foreigners should get in line behind 'and' Set first Australians' are a very unpleasant throwback to a time when trade unions called for a protected labor market," she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white workers should be protected - and if some discernment in an echo of this historical artifact in the region, would not surprise me that.
The discussion proposal outlines twelve measures that were once planned by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was to discuss human trafficking in Sri Lanka yesterday, has implemented five of the recommended changes, the others are still under consideration.
If the "criterion of authenticity" is accepted, then could someone who applied for a visa to be checked as to whether "the Application in the cases is real, in which the applicant is related to the owner or a relevant person of the supporting company or person connected . "
Companies may also be required to account for the number of 457 visa holders after, have finally set hundreds in the past, companies who wanted to initially support only a small number of workers.
Meanwhile, died a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker probably of a heart attack after he arrived this week with a refugee boat on Christmas Island.
The troubled nine year old son of the man who had come with him to Australia, is served since his father's death on Wednesday by an adult cousin who was on the boat also.
Australian authorities brought the man in the Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
