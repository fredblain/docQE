Post empties barely Sundays
"Many citizens have not noticed, the red dots for the Sunday collection are still several boxes of core city and the suburbs, but to read the fine print on the yellow containers of the Post, you find out quickly that the emptying of Sundays and public holidays no longer takes place, "shares the FDP.
A request of the FDP have confirmed this.
On Sundays and public holidays will only emptied before the post office in the Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and the Jacob-Müller-Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld.
Whether in Hofheim rose garden, even Sunday is cleared, will not be answered in the response to the request of the FDP.
The social and youth policy spokesman of the FDP, Fritz tube Beck wants to dig deeper, here.
The Sunday collection is an important postal service just on forward mail.
"This thinned these things despite the price increase for letters on January 2013 radical and unacceptable due".
Thomas Bittner, group and Stadtverband Chairman of the Liberals, supported his party colleagues: "What annoys me is the fact that here are secretly changed the collection times or even canceled."
From public, the Post is miles away.
"At least the mailboxes in the districts Neuschloß and rose garden must be emptied again on Sunday," said Bittner and tube Beck unison.
Also applies to the urban core, particularly non-mobile citizens would have a mailbox with Sunday emptying can also within walking distance.
Tube Beck asked the City Council if the City Council is planning talks with the post about this.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post did not communicate with Lampert home.
His knowledge admit it but in Hofheim also a Sunday emptying.
Your party has indeed argued for privatization.
"Then decisions are made elsewhere," Maier said.
