Court decision blocked for Stop-and-Frisk policy of the NYPD
A federal appeals court in the U.S. on Thursday blocked the arrangement of a judge, the changes to the Stop-and-Frisk program ( "stop and search") had called for the New York Police Department, and gave birth to the judge from the case.
The second U.S. Court of Appeals stated that the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin would be exposed, was until a decision on an appeal of the city.
The judge had ruled in August that the city violated the Constitution with the way how the program was being implemented for the arrest and questioning of persons.
The city filed an appeal against their assessment and the remedies ordered, including the decision to establish a monitoring body, which should assist the police in changing their policy and the related training program.
The Court of Appeal heard arguments on Tuesday to the required suspension.
The appellate report stated that the judge should be relieved from the case because they had violated the Code of Conduct for U.S. judges by it is determined that a judge should avoid even the appearance of partiality, which was partially covered with a series of media interviews and public statements founded, in which they had responded publicly to the criticism of the court.
The judge had ruled, police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they targeted black and Latino men would take in an inappropriate manner with the Stop-and-Frisk program targeted.
They appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of significant changes, including reforms in policies, training and supervision, and ordered a pilot program with body worn cameras in neighborhoods where the majority of controls were performed.
In August, the City of New York agreed to end the practice of storing names and addresses of persons who have been released after a check by the police.
A hearing on the appeal of the city is after the 14th March 2014 planned.
The Stop-and-Frisk tactic has been criticized by a number of civil rights advocates.
Checks of this kind have been around for decades in various forms, but increased the number of recorded inspections during the tenure of the non-partisan mayor Michael Bloomberg at an all time high of 684 330 in 2011, most of them black and Latino men.
2004 action was by four men, who belonged to all minorities filed, which evolved into a class action.
Proponents of changes to the NYPD Stop-and-Frisk program say the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and more effective police force and influence the way how other police departments the control.
Opponents are of the view that changes would dampen the morale of the police, but not the crime, nor would money wasted and the broader problem of police not resolved, over the past decade stand after the loss of thousands of jobs under pressure.
The judge pointed out that they did not finish the Stop-and-Frisk Practice, which was constitutional, but only the method of implementation of controls by the NYPD is reforming.
