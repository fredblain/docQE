Chinese newspaper is after calling be "reformed"
A Chinese newspaper, which had called on the title page the release of a reporter who had been accused of defamation should be reformed, said a press regulator.
The Guangzhou-based New Express had printed a rare public call for release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
However, Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to falsify reports of a partly state-owned company.
Now become the New Express a "comprehensive rectification" subjected, said the regulatory authority.
The "Rektifizierunganordnung" was issued by the Department of Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in Guangdong.
Preliminary investigations revealed that the New Express, which belongs to the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several incorrect reports of the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The editorial management of the New Express was disorganized," admitted the regulator in a statement.
She said it had decided "to impose an administrative penalty for Chen Yongzhou and to deprive him of his license reporter".
In addition, we have "the Yangcheng Evening News Group instructed to carry out a complete rectification of the new Express and recommended to determine the relevant person in charge at the new Express and immediately to check the leadership team of the new Express."
Chen had several articles for the new Express written, in which he reported on alleged financial irregularities at a manufacturer of construction equipment named Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and stood behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports against payment.
"In this case I Zoomlion damaged as well as the entire news industry and its ability to win the confidence of the public," he told the state news channel CCTV.
I did it mainly because I was out of money and fame.
I realized that I had acted wrongly.
Following Chen's apology from the New Express published an apology on the front page and declared that they had failed to review the reports correctly.
Various known suspects have passed recently televised confessions.
Experts say that confessions are still routinely enforced, despite a change in the law earlier this year in which the authorities were forbidden to force anyone to blame themselves.
