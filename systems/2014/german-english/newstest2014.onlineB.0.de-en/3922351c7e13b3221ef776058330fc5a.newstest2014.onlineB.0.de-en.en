Halloween 2013: In numbers
When I was little, Halloween was something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, staying up late and dress up for the neighborhood.
Today I'm more become a Halloween muffle.
In the last two years I have declared not ready to distribute sweets from my apartment, and probably will not do it again this year.
But according to statistics, I'm a black sheep when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans - 158 million to be exact - celebrate Halloween this year, indicating a total of 6.9 billion U.S. dollars for candy, costumes and decorations, the American Association of Retailers (NRF).
One thing which I am every Halloween but then look again, the trend values​​.
The costumes will account for about 1.2 billion of the 6.9 billion U.S. dollar spent, the NRF.
This year, provocative inanimate objects all the rage.
Women no longer have cases in sexy clothes, she can now also embody tempting food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daft Punk Space Men'll make it this year in the Instagram feeds.
According to Google, are the most searched costumes zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I suspect there is nothing wrong with tradition.
Last year we dressed our dogs and were, to my surprise not alone.
In fact, Americans spend $ 330 million this year for costumes of their pets, so the NRF.
These are a lot of "hot dogs".
As for sweets, we are not squeamish.
Americans this year will be $ 1.9 billion to spend on it, according to The Nielsen Company.
That is about 270 million kilograms of candy bars, lollipops, candies and gummy bears.
So good news for according to the U.S. Department of Commerce 41 million people who move with the saying "Trick or Treat" by the district.
In fact, we will be buying more than 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and - make no mistake about anything - eat.
The only thing we do not want to consume the sugar-sweet candy corn, yet 15 million kilograms thereof are sold around Halloween, the National Federation of the confectionery manufacturer.
That's about nine billion grains of corn.
It is a mystery I could not solve.
Nothing belongs more to Halloween than houses where it is haunted.
They have great names like "Terror Behind the Walls" (which by the way is in a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
There are actually 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States achieve the $ 500 million proceeds, so America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photos that you pee straight in the pants and make friends then on Facebook, where you they do not get rid of again, and then the type to which you are located is a comment leaves like "cute face".
But we finally get to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pumpkin familiar, when we were kids, and carving a jack o lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree - something that we have done from an early age.
Fortunately, the "Baby in Pumpkin" trend started only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up with it, zurechtzuschnitzen the pumpkin and not to sit in it.
This year, Americans spend about 106 million dollars for pumpkins, as the U.S. Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lantern that rots slowly in the front yard, probably comes from Illinois, where this year 245 million kilograms pumpkins were harvested.
If you want to score correctly, then call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and carve something nice out of her 921-pound pumpkin.
