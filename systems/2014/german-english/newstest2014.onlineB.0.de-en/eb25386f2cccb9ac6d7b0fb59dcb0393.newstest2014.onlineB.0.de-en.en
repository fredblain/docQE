Tax for foreign property owners against London's bubble
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally costed the CGT-measure, but still waiting for the final decision by Chancellor George Osborne, who had imposed a stamp tax of 7% on apartments in the 2012 budget that cost more than two million pounds as well as annual fees for buyers keep the apartments as a company and not as individuals.
Already exceed the revenue from stamp duty for residential property in the districts of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, which lay in the tax year 2012/13 at 708 million pounds, the proceeds for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North East, North West, Yorkshire and the Humber Region taken together.
Cook said: "After the increases in stamp duty on high-priced apartments and the introduction of related legislation against bypassing one can hardly claim quality real estate are taxed too low, regardless of the impact of outdated municipal tax system."
"However, this move could make some foreign investors more cautious when it comes to buying real estate in London, or hold ownership of it to sell," he added.
Prime Real Estate - the top five to ten percent of the housing market by price - in the affluent London West Belt, which extends from Fulham to Wimbledon, have risen by a record high of 11.8% last year.
The prices in Central London reported on a uniform annual growth of 5.6%, but were overshadowed by a distinguished "domestic market", where the south-western part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the East (6.5 %) experienced an upward trend, according to a study by Savills.
