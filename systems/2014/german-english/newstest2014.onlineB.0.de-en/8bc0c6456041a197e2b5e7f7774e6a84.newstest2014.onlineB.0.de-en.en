Germany's largest regional church has started a campaign to promote the profession of the pastor.
Background is a potential priest shortage: The Evangelical Lutheran Church of Hanover expects that the number of its currently about 1,800 pastors will halve According to our current location in 2030.
For young people of today the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future, Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) said in an interview with the Evangelical Press.
It is attractive to be able to determine the work and daily routine itself.
With Burfien the national church for the first time appointed a pastor on a full-time job to inspire young people to study theology.
Currently, young people choose less and less after high school to study theology.
Burfien attributes this to the process of secularisation back: "God's voice is low, the world is loud."
Here, the profession is characterized by great freedom and diversity.
I am the master of my schedule and can there my priorities set, where it is important to me.
Pastors could be as a pastor very close to the people.
They earned so much as a teacher and could live well.
Certainly get paid more in the private sector, but theologians have a safe employer.
The'll meet the young people of today, where there was not only a career, but a meaning to what we work.
According to the National Church, which comprises three-quarters of Lower Saxony, currently per year are around 60 pastors to retire.
At the same time begin about 40 graduates of theological studies her Vicariate.
In sparsely populated peripheral areas such as the resin, the Emsland or Wendland future it could be hard to fill positions.
Burfien plans to organize among other study days for young people and to invite celebrities who have studied theology.
The study of theology offer a broad education.
One can thus even be President.
