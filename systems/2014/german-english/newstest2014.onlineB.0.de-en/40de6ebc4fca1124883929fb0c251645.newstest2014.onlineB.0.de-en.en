Bailout over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian Healthcare
The Australian government insists on the harsh conditions that are associated with the bailout over 325 million Australian dollars for the Tasmanian health services to ensure that the government of the state of the money can not waste it.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth would take "immediate action" to avert a crisis that was caused by an aging population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic diseases and system limitations.
Funding for a period of four years was decided by government consultations with the independent MPs Andrew Wilkie Tasmania.
"The government has put together an emergency rescue package that affects our view of the unique challenges that the state faces," Plibersek said today.
The 325-million-dollar package includes $ 31 million emergency aid for optional services.
By 2600 more operations, including orthopedic surgery and treatments for cataracts, residues should be removed.
In addition, there is money for clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better follow-up care after hospitalizations, specialist training, provide mental health and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.
"These investments correspond to the ideas of which I affected hospital staff have said that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system," Tanya Plibersek said.
The Minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability of the Tasmanian government.
The state must maintain the current level of funding in order to receive money from the Commonwealth can, and report monthly on where the extra money was spent.
A three-member commission will be set up and to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie said today that $ 325 million would be of little use when "they are not accompanied by real reforms that bring the Tasmanian public health system on a more sustainable course."
Nevertheless, he praised the government that they had responded to its request for urgent help, which he had expressed at first against the Prime Minister in early May.
"I am confident that the federal aid will make a major contribution to use of the public health system of the state of the list of concerns," Wilkie said.
According to the government of the state of these optional benefits are largely offset the recent cuts.
However, the health spokesman of the opposition at the federal level, Peter Dutton, believes today's announcement was merely a "patch" solution.
"We are, therefore, in the present situation, because the laboratory state government has withdrawn $ 430 million from the health care system," he told ABC TV.
It can not be that a state government nearly half a billion dollars tears from the system and the Commonwealth put into it 300 million and then pretend to be the good news.
Dutton Plibersek urged to ensure that not a single dollar of the rescue package would be spent for extra paperwork.
