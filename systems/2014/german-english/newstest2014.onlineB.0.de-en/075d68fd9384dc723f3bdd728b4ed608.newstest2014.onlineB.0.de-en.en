The benefits to society from these lessons learned is increasingly clear, the intended purchase of the same risks were clearly reduced.
Although the result of my efforts was proven to have positive, my government dissent treated still as a breach of faith and seeks to criminalize political expression and be prosecuted.
Nevertheless: Speaking the truth is not a crime.
