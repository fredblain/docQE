Council takes trackage targeted
If the level crossing be "at the Hirschen" comprehensively renovated to improve road safety?
Yes, the councilors have decided.
Schiltach must for take in hand 220 000 EUR.
The German railway intends next year to improve the Kinzig Valley railway line.
Particular emphasis has been improving security at railway crossings - regularly occur nationwide to collisions of trains with other vehicles.
If the communities rebuilding measures, they must participate with one third of the costs, share the rest rail and bottom hem.
Schiltach city architect Roland Grießhaber explained to the council the special features of Bahübergangs "at the Hirschen".
But then there is the city, west to build the level of the local tunnel entrance of the train tracks a bulge.
There are also larger vehicles, for example, those long timber could carry, stand in oncoming traffic without having to block the tracks.
Grießhaber therefore suggested a retaining wall required to construct such a way that the city could widen due course the subsequent road to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This has been hotly debated in the council, as some councils the need for road circulation in doubt attracted Thomas Kipp brought his statement the mood of the critics to the point: "Do we have to take as much money because so few vehicles in the hand"
Mayor Thomas Haas disagreed: The railroad crossing "deer" was being used regularly for long timber transports.
Even wood from the "Kuhbach" will partially transported via this route, because up to 20 meter long vehicles could not use the track at the Haeberle bridge because they could not then turn into the main road.
In addition, the route serves as Umleitungfür those vehicles that can not use the tunnel when the main road is closed, argued Haas.
Since it was anticipated that Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnel would have to be rebuilt and restored, as is currently the case in Wolfach, could play an important traffic importance also for a longer period the railroad crossing "on" deer ".
The councils agreed to be examined, which costs would cause the angedachte widening of the road.
Notwithstanding this was the reconstruction of the railway crossing majority agreed with the proviso that the required retaining wall is built so that the city's subsequent direction of "Bahnhofstrasse" could, where appropriate, expand for oncoming traffic to around 5.5 meters.
The reconstruction of the railroad crossing at the tannery Trautwein could, however, draw a very different problem by itself, which affects the access to the rapidly rising "Geroltzhäuser way."
The administration had let examine the reconstruction plans of the railway by the engineering firm Breinlinger because they had doubts whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser path is still easily possible.
The investigation came to the conclusion that it is not inconceivable that the slope ratios of the road could lead to longer vehicles sit.
The responsibility for this, in turn, carry the city as road construction wearer.
The conversion is therefore likely to attract liability disputes by themselves.
Since both timber removal and the turn in the current state of development worked, one should not agree to the restructuring of the railway crossing, argued Haas.
Also, at this point the risk of collision of the train with a subject on the transfer vehicle significantly lower than at the other crossings, because right next to the breakpoint center located, to which there is a good line of sight.
Even trains from Central Station forth would have to be slowed down at this point already so far that no collision threatens.
The majority of the reconstruction of this railway crossing has been denied approval, as the town of Schiltach, "would have to pay for" the problem with ride-on vehicles, the councils, as the train could withdraw from responsibility after completion of construction.
As unproblematic, the Panel considers the modifications of the level crossings "Before Heubach" and "Before Kuhbach" were made for the already crossing agreements with the railway.
