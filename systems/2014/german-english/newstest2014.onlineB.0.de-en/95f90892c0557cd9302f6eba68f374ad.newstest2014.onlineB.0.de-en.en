Gechingen: No absolute protection possible
"We want to involve the population at an early stage in the planning," Mayor Jens Haussler opened the public information event for flood protection concept in Gechingen.
About 80 participants came to the church hall to be explained the measures envisaged to ask questions, voice concerns and suggest ideas.
Haussler clarified: "The final decisions make the members of the council."
The floods, the Gechingen on 15 May 2009, unprepared met, was a decisive event was, that raised the question of safeguards for the future, said Haussler.
A river basin study had been given with the neighboring community Aidlingen in order, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
"The protection of as many of developed land is the goal," said Haussler.
Is presumed to be the planning of protection against a loud German Weather Service statistically every 100 years to the expected flood.
The climate change is supported by a 15 percent surcharge invoice.
In professional circles, this is referred to as "HQ 100aKlima".
The water masses that had led to considerable damage Gechingen 2009, corresponded to a 1000-year flood.
"There is no absolute protection, but a relative improvement we can achieve," said Haussler.
In order to achieve the protection HQ 100aKlima, around four million euros to be invested in Gechingen, the community can expect to land grants in the amount of about 70 percent.
Haussler pointed out, however, that it only give the promotion, if an overall concept would be implemented.
For this, the community is dependent on the participation of citizens.
An elaborate planning and approval process must be completed.

There was resentment among local residents of Altorts who have to suffer even in normal thunderstorms repeatedly to overloading of the sewerage network.
The problem is known in the management and first steps have already been taken.
Haussler noted, however, that the guidelines for duct systems are other than for flood protection and this should not be mixed.
The municipality has an obligation, the sewer system be designed so that two-to three-year rain events could be coped with.
The sewers to be dimensioned larger, millions would swallow.
