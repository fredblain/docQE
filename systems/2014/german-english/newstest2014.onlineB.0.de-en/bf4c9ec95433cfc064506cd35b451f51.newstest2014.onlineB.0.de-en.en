Obama's back down in health policy
After heavy criticism President Obama made yesterday backtracked on his often repeated unambiguous promise: "If you like your health insurance, then you can keep it."
After hundreds of thousands from their insurer have received a letter of termination, the Republicans accused the President before the last few days that he had deceived the American public.
Yesterday Obama qualified his original promise.
"The vast majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance can keep it," he said in a speech in Boston.
In response to numerous media reports on the dismissal Obama urged those Americans who have received such notices, on, look around on the open market for a new insurance policy.
Most citizens could obtain a better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than predicted.
"You get a better deal," he said.
The government said it is not surprising that the five percent of the population having completed an insurance policy would have to look for another deal, since its contract did not meet the new standards by the Affordable Care Act.
"I want to tell these Americans very directly: You deserve better," Sebelius said at a hearing before the House Energy and Commerce Committee of the House of Representatives in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said that the launch of the online platform had gone "miserable" since October.
"I'm as frustrated and angry as everyone else," she said.
I am determined to regain your trust.
This saying of an applied Sebelius to a seated behind her adviser at yesterday's hearing in the House of Representatives was taken after a debate with Republican Deputies Billy Long of Missouri. It was about whether they should be required to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours hearing Long Sebelius pressed repeatedly with the question of why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act have voluntarily waived a government-sponsored insurance to themselves enter into a collective at HealthCare.gov, which they now sell millions of Americans wanted.
