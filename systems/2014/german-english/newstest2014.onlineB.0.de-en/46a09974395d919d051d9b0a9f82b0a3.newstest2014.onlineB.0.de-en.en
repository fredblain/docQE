Anger at sentence for Bali bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who had come in 2002 in the bombing in Bali killed responded, angry about the verdict for the last of the instigators, who was put on trial, because Umar Patek should be in their view shot summarily.
Patek, who was almost ten years as one of the most wanted persons of Southeast Asia on the run, was sentenced yesterday for his role in the construction of explosive devices for the bombing to a prison term of 20 years.
With parole he could be released after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of ​​Kuta, in which 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many more were injured.
A guilty verdict was also in a number of terrorism-related charges, including a wave of bomb attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000 included.
The prosecution had demanded a life sentence, even if the death penalty could have asked for the man who is referred because of his reputation as a masterful bomb-maker as "Demolition Man".
The decision has painful memories awakened in June Corteen, a mother from Perth, who lost her 39 years old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the damage done by Patek and his co-conspirators almost ten years ago desolation.
Fighting With tears she said, Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I mean really, he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
"You should bring him to a firing squad," Corteen told AAP.
I have to live every day so that I will not get another grandson and I will never see my daughters.
The Sari Club was razed to the ground, as on 12 October 2002, a massive bomb exploded in a pickup truck shortly after 23 clock, which was parked outside the nightclub.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar, where just 20 seconds earlier, a suicide bomber could detonate a backpack filled with explosives.
He fell after the attack for a month in a coma and "died" three times while he was on a life support system.
Hughes said, Patek have the same fate as deserved the three other members of the Jemaah Islamiah terrorist cell - Amrozi, Imam Samudra and Mukhlas - who were responsible for the massacre and were executed four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty before everyone else.
To keep him alive - no, there is no reason to keep him alive.
To get 20 years after he has killed 202 people and injured many hundreds, is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers, who was on trial.
He withdrew from almost a decade of arrest, but was eventually taken up in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. forces nearly four months later, the former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden killing.
During the trial, an FBI agent testified that intelligence reports had provided the information that Patek was in Pakistan to bin Laden to meet up with the aim to establish the connection between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda again.
"He has not asked," Corteen said.
Until recently, he has shown no remorse for how much suffering he has inflicted on others.
The judgment was delivered before the ten year anniversary of the attack this year, which is celebrated with commemorative ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"There will be many tears this year," Corteen said.
Patek can still appeal against his sentence.
