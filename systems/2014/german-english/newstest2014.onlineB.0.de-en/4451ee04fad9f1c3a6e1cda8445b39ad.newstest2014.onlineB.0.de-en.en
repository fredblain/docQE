One could call him the Dostoevsky of the USA.
Philip K. Dick was a seeker of God, a metaphysician, his novels and short stories also have some serial.
Amazingly, the relationship in the exterior: the piercing eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And so, as Fyodor M. Dostoevsky with his massive oeuvre as Ergr√ºnder and apologist of the Russian soul to understand, to read Philip K. Dick as an American prophet, who is quite a bit in their own country.
Some titles are published by Heyne Verlag, Haffmans the cassette with the 118 stories sells Zweitausendeins.
Dick explains America - the realm of breathtaking technological advances, coupled with paranoia, obsession with security and faith, to be chosen.
Dick had experiences of God, his later books read like a mixture of the Book of Revelation and a computer keyboard.
