Tourism: descent to the Romans
At around 120 meters in length, a sewer from the Roman period has been preserved beneath Cologne.
If you visit Cologne, can not ignore the cathedral.
Around 157 meters the two towers in the sky, making it the second tallest church building in Europe.
But few visitors who marvel at the two filigree spiers, knowing that it is also under the cathedral to discover a lot.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in Cologne underworld.
Meeting point for its tours is the service center of Cologne tourism next to the cathedral.
The tour begins at the very unspectacular: "We start in the garage," says Schulze.
In the seventies, the city fathers wanted a car-friendly city, and therefore remained of the ruins of the ancient city walls, only the stand, which was not too great.
Most users of the car park therefore now rushing past also to the Roman remains and turn off only her car.
But if you look twice, discovered a severed by metal bars archaeological site in the parking deck D2.
On display are about five feet high ruins of palm-sized stones.
"There are remains of the Roman city wall, which was built in the second half of the first century after Christ," says Schulze.
Before it goes back to light, can Schulze participants on the upper parking level another look into a dark, 15-meter shaft throw.
This is the well of the old cathedral, which is, unfortunately, hardly noticed.
The next stop of the tour is the Praetorium, and here the participants again descend into the depths.
We see here the official seat of the once powerful man north of the Alps, the praetor of the CCAA.
What does CCAA would like to know a visitor.
"The acronym stands for" Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium "what good German as much as" city of Roman law and the city Agrippinenser, founded by Emperor Claudius in the place of the altar for the imperial cult "means".
And the judgment hall is the former governor's palace, the center of power of the Roman Empire at the Rhine.
From the entrance hall of the exhibition, a tunnel entrance leads to the Roman sewer that is available here at around 120 meters in length.
"You can calm a piece along the so-called Cloaca Maxima go along if you want," Schulze cheers for the guests.
A surprise has Schulze yet.
After he has brought the key to the box office, he leads the group to a 16-meter-deep, walk-in bay.
"We are now in a mikvah, a Jewish ritual bath," he explains.
The Jewish community built their bath deep into the ground to get to the groundwater, which was essential for the ritual ablutions.
To date, in the lower end of the mikvah, whose origins go back to the eighth century, different water levels can be read by changing level of the Rhine.
The mikvah is part of an archaeological zone in the town square, for which construction is scheduled to begin shortly.
Until the completion but still will take some years.
