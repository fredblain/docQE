Fancy ice cream that glows in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first glowing in the dark ice - with the help of jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of marine animals exploited and transformed it into a brilliant treat.
The idea came to him after he had read a research paper on jellyfish and was able to convince Chinese scientists to produce the glowing protein artificially.
The ice cream reacts when eating with the tongue, whereby the pH is raised in the protein and the lights will be triggered.
Chris explains, the ice cream react to the heat and light in the mouth - so the more you lick, the brighter it gets.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I'm Delicious", says: "The product is incredible, but still in a very early production phase, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds."
The protein used in the ice cream responsive to the tongue at a neutral pH.
When the mouth is heated, the protein, the pH rises and the ice glows.
We have tested it in the last few months and it seemed ideal to bring it to Halloween on the market because it has this wonderful glow effect.
It is probably the most expensive ice cream that I have ever made​​, because of the jellyfish fluorescent is four times more expensive than gold.
Each ball cost me about 140 pounds.
But for that it tastes delicious.
Charlie's experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavors, including beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf belong.
But his latest creation to be even more ambitious.
He says: "I ​​would like to develop an invisible ice cream."
That in and of itself impossible due to the refraction of light, which is caused by the ice crystals from which ice cream is, but I suspect we will find a way to do it.
The ice cream utilizes the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish, which are manufactured by Chinese scientists artificially
