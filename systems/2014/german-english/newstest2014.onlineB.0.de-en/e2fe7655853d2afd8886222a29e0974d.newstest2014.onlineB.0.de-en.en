Children should get taught as "role models for life" myths and legends, says one author.
The stories of Thor showed that "brute force has no chance against clever tricks," and the Arthurian legend demonstrate how important it is to have a dream.
However, many of the myths were "far too wild, too offensive and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools", which is why Crossley-Holland for a "careful selection" age-appropriate works pleaded.
"I think it's wonderful that in America myths and folklore already part of education," he said.
I have suggested as a plan for twenty years.
He added, with authors and teachers who "overly didactic" were, children would "completely shut down" because in entertaining stories would the messages "subliminal" conveys.
Crossley-Holland, who has translated Beowulf from the Anglo-Saxon and author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales is stated: "One can trace certain intentions, but you should keep them as possible in the background."
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author who writes for adults, and an author who writes for children, is the need to convey hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or lead to a happy ending, but there is an inherent sense of good and evil.
This must be presented subliminally, are revealed through the story and not explained.
This is the old story of the show instead of telling.
