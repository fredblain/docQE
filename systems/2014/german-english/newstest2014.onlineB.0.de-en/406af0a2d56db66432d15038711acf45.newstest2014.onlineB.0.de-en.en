Iran satisfied with the process of nuclear negotiations
Iran shows up a week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN veto powers and Germany satisfied with the negotiating process.
"After years we have now reached an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency to address the differences of the past few years," Foreign Minister Mohammed Jawad Sharif wrote on his Facebook page.
While it would still be a long way, but the nuclear chief negotiator was satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that in the end both sides come to a solution.
