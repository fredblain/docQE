Although the SG Achim / Baden has four games without a win, there is handball-Oberliga continued good mood.
It can coach Tomasz Malmon no doubt.
All are still fully motivated in the matter.
Nevertheless, I hope that we can finally win again.
"For I know already do not know how such victory tastes" Malmon expected a sense of achievement from his team VfL Fred Beck II
Even if the third division reserve currently has yet escaped from Fred Beck no trees, Malmon lifts in advance warning finger.
Many players I myself have been trained in the A-youth.
As such, they will certainly be extra motivated against their former coach.
"In addition, it remains to be seen whether still gain from the First here is," says the SG coach.
To return finally back on track, the team must Malmon increase compared to the past performances in any case.
Above all, in the cover work and the Umschaltspiel just problems last but formidable.
The Opportunities and needs to be better definitely.
Therefore, I hope that my players have finally got free during the short break the head.
