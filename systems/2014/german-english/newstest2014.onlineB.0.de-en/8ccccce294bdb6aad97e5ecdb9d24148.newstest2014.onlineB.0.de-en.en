Two charged with YMCA staff before accusations against Jonathan Lord for sexual offenses: hearing before the Royal Commission
Two YMCA Leaders of New South Wales (NSW) had been charged with sexual offenses relating to children before 2011 allegations against the nannies Jonathan Lord were collected from Caringbah, such as the Royal Commission learned of sexual abuse of children.
But at the opening statement to the Commission of the YMCA had declared that they had "never had to do in the organization with an incident of child sexual abuse".
Managing Director Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which a YMCA employee was accused of misdemeanor child pornography, and another was convicted at which a physical education instructor of Caringbah YMCA Hall in 1991 for the abuse of entrusted him children.
Hare said Gail Furness, a Commission assistive lawyer that he was aware of the first case, the second but have not known.
He conceded the opening statement of the YMCA to the Commission should also have been inaccurate in the assertion that "there had been external audits of the YMCA, where the YMCA was recognized as at the forefront of child safety."
Evidence before the Commission to show rather that the YMCA was informed that he has received the second-lowest rating of the four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities (Ministry of Education) in August of this year.
Hare, who started with 21 at the YMCA, acknowledged that management had failed "from me on down" in the setting of Lord and failed to ensure that staff had been out of their obligations clear to violations of the Guidelines for child safety Report.
Lord was sentenced earlier this year for sexual offenses against twelve boys during his two years with the YMCA.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
Hare denied, however, that the YMCA would have a cultural problem, the employee had held them to report violations Lords in relation to the safety of children.
The employees testified that they had observed violations, among other things, that the Lord was alone with children, she worked privately as a babysitter, let her sit on his lap, to a said that he had to love it, and let children play with his cell phone .
Danielle Ockwell whose superior lord was and had asked for a training course on child protection, because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that the children's ministry director Jacqui Barnat that the supervisor was Lords in YMCA Caringbah, "very intimidating and most of the time very unapproachable war ".
The manager stated that he would not accept statements from employees, which they had not dared to report to their superiors message.
Instead, he said, had rather affected her friendship with Lord their judgment, which is why they had not reported it.
Hare said he had the board of the YMCA NSW communicated its view that the lesson had to be learned from the "Jonathan Lord incident" the organization, "not the answer" concerns by employees, and the Board have agreed to it.
Hare said the decision to urge the employees to sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the appearance of the allegations, had been hit by the managing director of children services of the YMCA, Liam Whitley.
He said they were designed to prevent contamination of the evidence, which had been implemented but "overzealous" and bad.
The YMCA NSW was in the time when Jonathan Lord was employed between 2009 and 2011 there was no safe for children's organization, said Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, an expert on child sexual abuse, the Commission.
He explained that there were "serious problems" in hiring, review, training, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing was to 20 December was postponed.
