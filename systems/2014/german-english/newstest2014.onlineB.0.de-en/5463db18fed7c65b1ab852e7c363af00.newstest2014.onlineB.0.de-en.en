Rules for electronic devices on airplanes remain provisionally in force in Australia
Australian airline passengers must continue off tablets and smartphones during takeoff and landing, despite efforts in the U.S. to relax the rules for such devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows U.S. airlines to change their rules so that passengers see on their devices during critical phases of flight e-books, watch videos or play, provided they are in "flight mode".
During most of the flight passengers, this is already allowed, but find it a lot of people angry that they e-books are not read at startup and landing.
Australian companies observe the decision to implement the U.S. airlines have to do tons of work, but follow no immediate plans to change its rules.
The air traffic control authority CASA also stated that they would look at the announcement, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical phases of flight in Australia are still valid.
"The CASA currently has no specific regulations regarding the use of electronic devices in aircraft," was announced.
The topic is subject to provisions allowing the airlines to maintain safety at all times and passengers must follow the safety instructions given by the cabin crew.
Virgin has already led to the CASA talks over a useful expansion of its Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights and explains that one is open to change, but this would have to be initiated by the legislature.
"We would welcome a review of the authorization of electronic devices by the CASA, because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience, after we offer now (wireless entertainment) during the flight," said a spokesman.
Qantas stated that they would remain until further with the current regulations.
"Our current policy stipulates that electronic devices during takeoff and landing may not be used, and we currently have no plans to change that," the company said.
The FAA regulations apply to U.S. airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations, of which passengers can benefit, and we will certainly look at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it exactly.
The decision affects at U.S. companies, depending on the age of the fleet varies from.
You must prove that their aircraft can tolerate interference from mobile devices, and change manuals, training materials, carry-on programs and customer training.
"When an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, lightweight electronic devices, such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any height," the FAA announced.
In rare cases, in poor visibility, the crew will instruct the passengers, while the landing switch off the device.
The group also recommended to safely stow heavier devices during takeoff and landing under the seat or in the compartments above the seats.
