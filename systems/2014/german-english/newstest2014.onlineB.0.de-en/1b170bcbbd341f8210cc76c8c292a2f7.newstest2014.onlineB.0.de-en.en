Learning takes unemployed: Pilot project for unskilled workers in tourism
At the Mecklenburg Lake District today launched a pilot project for the tourism industry.
Under the leadership of the Federal Employment Agency are 49 men and women who are already working as unskilled workers in the industry, be swept qualified through three winters to professionals for hotels and restaurants.
"What is new is the fact that the six-month courses end with degrees," said Carmen Wiechert by the Employment Agency Neubrandenburg.
The benefit is diverse: Participants would thus not unemployed, the company would get trained professionals that were missing more and more in hotels and restaurants, and the agency must not unemployment fund.
The project also the Commerce and Industry Chamber in Neubrandenburg and the German Hotel and Restaurant Association (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern are involved.
