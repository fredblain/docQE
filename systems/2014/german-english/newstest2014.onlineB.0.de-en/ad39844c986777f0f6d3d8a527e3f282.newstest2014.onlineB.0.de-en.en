Frontier Airlines charges fees for carry-on luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to 100 dollars of passengers who want to stow carry-on baggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to up to 100 dollars for one piece of hand luggage and $ 2 for coffee or soda to calculate, even if one could read in the announcement on Wednesday that passengers could keep the whole tin.
The new fee applies to carry-on luggage in the overhead compartment above the seat, small bags under the seat are still free.
Frontier said, compute 25 U.S. dollars if the charge is paid in advance, and $ 100 in travelers who had paid at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said that the fee of U.S. $ 100 Aim, travelers to move to take care of in advance of the payment.
"We do not want to calculate this sum," she explained.
Airlines began in 2008 in order to charge a fee for the first and second checked bag.
Passengers who tried to circumvent these have, therefore, as much as possible crammed into hand luggage, which has the consequence that the overhead bins are often crowded on the seat.
Fees are one way to move passengers to be less to take on board.
O'Malley said at the new fee, it had not actually about making money.
This is about the most loyal customers of Frontier, which would have made ​​clear that there would always be difficult to find space in the compartment above the seat.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline's website, do not pay.
This means that a passenger must be present at the boarding gate of Frontier may take one piece of luggage free, but the next person has to pay $ 100 for a comparable piece of luggage.
O'Malley stated that the site of Frontier and the check-in procedure would be changed so that passengers are informed of the fee before they came to the gate.
The new baggage fee of Frontier occurs only in the summer in force an exact date, there are not.
Passengers complain frequently about Baggage fees and other charges, but airlines like to grab it back.
They argue that the transport of luggage and passengers should cost money to pay for this service if they wanted him.
Many on Wall Street consider the new baggage fees as a sign that the airlines make enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Most have so far, however, the finger of fees for carry-on luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded three years before the first penalty for hand luggage and later, Allegiant Air, also a low cost airline.
The only other airline with such a fee was the Hungarian Wizz Air, said the airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who pursues the additional fees carefully.
He estimated in a report in December 2011 that the hand baggage fee Spirit transferring 50 million U.S. dollars annually.
Sorensen, who formerly held a leadership position at Midwest Airlines, has recently flown with Spirit and was curious what to expect him at the gate when passengers would be faced with the unusual hand baggage charge of the company.
"The boarding process was one of the smoothest I've experienced in my career in aviation," he said.
I expected to see gnashing of teeth and palpable discussions at the gate.
"The plane was full," he explained, "and the boarding went well."
Frontier Spirit also follows for the 2 dollars that are required for coffee, tea, soda or juice.
The company said that passengers who bought lemonade or juice, could keep the whole tin and coffee is refilled for free.
Water remains free of charge.
U.S. Airways 2008 had briefly tried to demand money for soft drinks, but this made ​​seven months later reversed after passengers complained and no other large company had followed.
Frontiers step to charge fees for carry-on luggage when passengers do not buy directly from the airline, is the latest initiative should be directed to the customers on your own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz 10 to 25 U.S. dollars per ticket sold.
This provides all the companies an incentive to passengers to move to the direct purchase from them instead of using an online travel agency.
Frontier, however, is gone furthest in this area.
In September, the company began to forgive when booking through an online travel agency only half the number of frequent flyer miles.
On Wednesday, the miles were further reduced to 25 percent of the route.
Booked at a third-party flight with Frontier over 1000 miles brings customers therefore a still only 250 miles.
Passengers can book on the website of Frontier courts exclusively for direct purchase.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in Denver, but the business is shrinking and the company loses money.
The proceeds declined by 9 percent and the flight capacity shrank nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, as we read in the financial report, which was released on Wednesday by the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.,.
Republic has been trying to get in connection with the sale of the company's finances by Frontier under control.
