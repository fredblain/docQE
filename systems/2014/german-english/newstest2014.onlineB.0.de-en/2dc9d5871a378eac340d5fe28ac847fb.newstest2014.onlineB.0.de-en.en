Released again by air ambulance service from North Sea oil rig rescued bird
One flown to the coast by air ambulance service bird, which had been exhausted found on a North Sea oil platform, was released back into nature.
The Water Rail was last month flown by helicopter to Aberdeen, where she was nursed by the Scottish SPCA animal protection organization in the rescue center in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, manager of the center, said: "This water rail was probably a winter migratory birds from Northern Europe, which was held up by the strong winds over the North Sea."
Apparently sought the exhausted bird refuge on the rig.
He added: "He could not continue to fly, which is why we have been contacted with a request for help."
When they were released, the Water Rail was fit and healthy.
