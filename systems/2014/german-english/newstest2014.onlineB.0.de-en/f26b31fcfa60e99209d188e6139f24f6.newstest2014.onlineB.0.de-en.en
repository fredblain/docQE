U.S. wants to pursue criminal Snowden
The U.S. has not changed its attitude to former U.S. intelligence officials Edward Snowden.
He'll still accused of having illegally passed secret information.
Therefore, he had to make a criminal case in the U.S., said the spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of State, Jennifer Psaki, in Washington.
The recent statements by Snowden would not change that.
Earlier, the German Green Party politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had appealed after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow to the United States, not to threaten him with punishment.
Psaki stressed that it is the one parliamentarian RELATES at Ströbele statements and not to a German member of the Government.
