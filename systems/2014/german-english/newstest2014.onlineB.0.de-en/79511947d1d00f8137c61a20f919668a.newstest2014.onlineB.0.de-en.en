Ben Greenman: Zehn Jahre New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
You could say that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: years ago, nearly one hundred began the vaudeville artist Frank Fay, who worked on Broadway as master of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre, so at that amount directly jokes in the form of a conversation to tell.
Over the years Fays innovation was expanded, as most recently at the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and directed by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the stand-up institution Carolines into being, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters this year.
"Most of these headliners began at Carolines and were then always successful until they were eventually to be known to occur in a club," Hirsch said.
We have designed this festival so that we can continue to work with them.
At this year's event, there are appearances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher as well as of "Stand Up for Heroes", an annual music and comedy benefit for Army Veterans at Madison Square Garden where, among other things, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart , Roger Waters and Bill Cosby occur.
With the festival also the world of comedy has grown.
A number of comedians who participate this year at the Festival, have become known through rather unconventional means, such as shipments to smaller television channels like Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll was a sitcom in cable television known (the ironically-raunchy fantasy football series "The League" on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was both "Saturday Night Live" as well as "Parks and Recreation" part of the cast, although she is best known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On."
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with distinctive voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, focused on racial issues Kaumau W. Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest attractions for visitors of the festival heard an interview: David Steinberg speaks with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but has developed into a respected television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a television program entitled "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" in TV Land.
The meeting will take place in midtown Manhattan in the Town Hall.
"The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry's entire work," Steinberg said.
He told me when he is here, he sometimes go through the alley between two buildings and think: Hey, if I lose all my money, then I might live here.
