Norway: Norwegian place making out with giant mirrors light
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village of light have brought in their gloomy valley.
Because of the low sunlight level, located at the vestfjord Valley Rjukan sinks from autumn to spring usually in the shade of the surrounding mountains.
With three giant reflectors in 45 meters of a century dream came true on Wednesday.
"Finally!" Enthused Mayor Steinar Bergland at the starting ceremony at TV2.
Some inhabitants of the valley marched their way sun chairs, others put sunglasses on the safe side.
Until now had to drive in the winter with a cable car to a nearby summit sun worshipers.
Ten years ago, the local artist Martin Andersen had presented the proposal to focus the rays with mirrors to the valley.
This basic idea since 1913, but there was already in place.
After several years of debate, the city council finally had the 5 million crowns (approximately 615 000 EUR) adopted expensive project.
A similar construction gives for some years the Italian alpine village Viganella wintry sunshine.
