Freudenstadt: Fast actions by surprise host
With a small squad, the men had to TSV I Freudenstadt start of the Schiller-school gymnasium in Reutlingen against the TG Gönningen of the Swabian Alb.
Although the Älbler were associated with an experienced team on the other line side.
Soon, however, showed that they also age-related, could keep up with the fast actions of the Freudenstädter not quite.
With the hard and placed premiums on the Gönninger did extremely difficult.
They repeatedly missed the clean on the network center leaked by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz passes and attacks and were not in the block defense on the spot.
Two high first sentence profits expressed clearly from the superiority of Freudenstadt in all respects.
Faced with this overwhelming and decisive game performance then the third set was a bit lax and lethargic for 3-0 (25:13, 25:14, 25:22) won.
Since the second November communicate with the TV Baiersbronn, who was able to prevail in clear Nagold, a much more powerful opponent on the field.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannick Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-Class, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt faced each other in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They gave off a hard-fought two-hour match.
Nervousness on both sides caused primarily when receiving a pass error and points gifts, even when the passes, the precision was sometimes in short supply and in some critical scenes prevented the excessive zeal of the view point of potential profits.
In terms of performance this very balanced encounter in the TSV team of Marcus Blasutto agreed but throughout the great physical effort and a welcome commitment by both teams.
