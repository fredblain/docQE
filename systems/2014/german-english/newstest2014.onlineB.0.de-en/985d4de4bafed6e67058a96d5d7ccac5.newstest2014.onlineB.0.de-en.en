The redesigned Opschlag shines with a new cafe.
One that invites you to linger and return.
One that would make the name of the program.
As Déjà Vu is referred to according to the dictionary a psychological phenomenon that manifests itself in the feeling that you have ever experienced or seen a new situation.
In the case of the visit of the eponymous cafes on Opschlag in the county town of Kleve in sight of the Rhine-Waal University it does not stick to the pure déjà vu feeling.
Finally, the cafe is with the beautiful name exactly the goal: to make actual stay not only mental, but always by hand repeatedly experienced.
Because it's just fun and simply beautiful.
A look inside the Opschlag 8 gives the viewer an instant good feeling.
The ultra-modern, but not cool café ambience, looks like a place to relax.
Here the team spoils with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Buettner at the top of the guest with a variety of coffee or cocktail variations.
In addition there is delicious cake or individually occupied fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old have made ​​a name as a restaurateur before the opening of this lovely cafes on Opschlag, In Kranenburg they brought the "Art Lounge".
From moving to Kleve on the Opschlag the sympathetic café lovers hope more audience.
Not least by the university.
"Where we have no particular target group," says Daniel Buettner.
Rather, the two would like to appeal to young students as well as seniors and all ages in between.
Apropos coffee-Liebhaber.
The friendly owner couple is standing behind the coffee enjoyment.
Enjoy the fragrant hot brew in different variations itself
Expressofan
Daniel Buettner is more the Expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the cappuccino drinker.
"For this, a baguette - that's my thing," she says of the NRZ.
Two events gave it even in the bright café.
Better said one.
Because the harbor festival became incarnate rather be outdoors - the Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also the Ringelnatz evening.
"Beautiful, successful and funny," found the two 33-year-olds.
But not everyone's thing.
Maybe Daniel Buettner is therefore not a huge fan of event evenings: "Man's can now times not please everyone".
And with an event I always speak to only those who are also interested in the special event.
That's why events are more likely to be the exception for us.
"We want to disrupt the normal operation as little as possible".
Should read: Déjà Vu also stands for reliability.
In terms of the quality of the products that are offered here, as well as on the team and the beautiful surroundings at Opschlag in Kleve.
The road, which more and more is becoming a restaurant mile.
To the delight of many Klever, the guests from near and far and the students discover the Gastro mile and thus the Café Déjà Vu for themselves.
