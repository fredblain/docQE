Gutach: even more safety for pedestrians
They are less than 100 meters away from each other: On Tuesday, the new B-33 pedestrian crossing is in Gutach been put into operation at the village car park - within sight of the old town hall lights.
Two plants so close together: intention or SchildbÃ¼rger prank?
This question has been clearly answered yesterday Gutachs mayor.
"The town hall traffic light has been installed at that time, because this ensures the school," Eckert explained yesterday.
The Kluser-traffic secure both cyclists and bus passengers and the Bergle residents.
The yesterday officially commissioned system is important for the crossing area Sulzbachweg / Church Street.
We have the museum, two churches, park, bus stop, a doctor and a bank, as well as the flow of traffic from the residential area> Grub. "
"With the high traffic and pedestrian traffic had to their safety another traffic light here," said Eckert.
This is confirmed by Peter Arnold of the District Office Offenburg.
"According to recent measurements on the B 33 daily about 12 000 vehicles Gutach the community, of which about ten percent of heavy traffic," says Arnold.
Therefore, is the construction of an additional traffic light more than necessary: "Safety here just before," said Arnold.
A total of four traffic shows had been carried out, a roundabout was being considered, but rejected because of the tightness in the crossover region Sulzbachweg / Church Street.
It has previously been tested according to Arnold when choosing the location of the traffic light poles all: "By means of an extra long logs loaded especially for us Transporter, we tested whether these vehicles can move out of the Sulzbachweg on the B 33 without looking fold the traffic light poles."
The approximately 15 000 euros expensive traffic light system itself is the "state of the art, what it currently on the market are," said Arnold.
The system is equipped with colored LEDs that shine so strongly that the lights are clearly visible by drivers, for example, even when the sun is low.
And it is also economical: The older lighting systems consume about 100 watts, the new just eight watts.
Per direction of travel, there are three lighting systems.
Arnold explained the technology of the new system: This is equipped with two radar sensors.
Does the pedestrian traffic lights the button tests the upper radar sensor, the traffic situation.
Is the road free, immediately comes green for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrians can be terminated.
"If a group or handicapped people walk across the street, the green phase is extended, so it comes everyone safe on the road," said Arnold.
Of course, the driver must think for themselves here as a partner and watch the road.
This was not the case yesterday: hardly showed the green traffic light for pedestrians, rustled a luxury-class vehicle through - in bright red
