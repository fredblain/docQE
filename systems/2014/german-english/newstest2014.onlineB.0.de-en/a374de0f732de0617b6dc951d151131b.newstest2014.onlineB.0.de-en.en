New anti-nicotine vaccine could make the pleasure of smoking put an end
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine, which could spoil the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice against a lifetime of nicotine addiction.
Before testing in humans, further experiments are needed, which may still take some years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results look good.
"We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination once can help millions of smokers who tried to quit and have tried doing all the methods available on the market, but had to experience that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches," says Cornell.
The new vaccine contains an innocuous virus that has been modified so that it contains the genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a steady stream of antibodies.
The antibodies chase the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, causing a smoker experiences nicotine high.
In experiments retained vaccinated mice which nicotine was administered at their normal level of activity.
Mice without vaccination against it would have taken a "time-out" the researchers a sign declared that the nicotine had reached her brain.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Former tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The vaccinations needed to maintain the antibody level are so often given that they were expensive and impractical.
However the cost of the new vaccine are probably much lower, because it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, could be a future human vaccine when he was quite sure children are administered before they were tempted to try a cigarette, thus preventing nicotine addiction.
More likely is that smokers would use him to quit.
"You know then: When they start to smoke again, they feel because of the nicotine vaccine no more pleasure here, and that helps them to take the habit," he explained.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but warned at the same time, it is still more research is needed.
