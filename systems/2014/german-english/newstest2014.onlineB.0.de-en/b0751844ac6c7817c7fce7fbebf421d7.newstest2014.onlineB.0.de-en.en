Parents of a teenager from Georgia who died in a tragic accident, believe in murder
The parents of the teenager whose body was found in a rolled up wrestling mat in the gym in high school, are convinced that their son was murdered, the family's attorney said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta in the U.S. state of Georgia was born on 11 January found in an upright erected mat that stood behind the bleachers in the school gym.
The investigating officer of the Sheriff of Lowndes County came to the conclusion that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but this questions the family of the 17-year-olds.
"They are convinced that their son was murdered," said Benjamin Crump, the lawyer from Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, opposite FoxNews.com.
You would never have thought he was died as it had concluded the sheriff.
"They are of the view that it was devoid of any logic, against the laws of physics as well as against the common sense contrary," said Crump.
Rather, they were convinced that the truth may be covered up to protect the person or persons who were responsible for the death of her son.
"My son went to study in the school and came back in the body bag," he commented.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday that there would be a formal investigation in death Johnson, as a number of important questions remained unsolved.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
The Moore said at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts, the direction in which they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I am of the opinion that a reasonable basis for a formal determination is made," he said.
Moore told reporters that initial autopsy value implies that Johnson had died from the effects of a "position-related suffocation".
A second autopsy have, however, found a different cause of death, Moore said.
"There are a number of questions answered or need to be confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if there was sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation into the death of Johnson, he would instruct the FBI to conduct the investigation.
A representative of the authority of the County Sheriff was at our request on Thursday ready to go immediately to a comment.
A court in southern Georgia ruled on Wednesday that the authorities must release all surveillance videos that have analyzed the investigators.
The parents of the teens said they hoped that the video records contained evidence how he had died.
