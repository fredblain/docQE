The throwaway society does not think
The night was long, the music loud and the mood well, but at some point it goes home.
Only: In the bellies of the people on the front passenger and rear seat, the hunger becomes noticeable.
Sure, for one or the other cocktail or champagne may be responsible!
What could be better than chilling the next Drive-In to go to treat yourself to a little something?
I admit, I'm happy with it, if it late at night or very early in the morning goes to fast food overtaking.
A few fries, a coke, a burger - and then off you go home and go to bed!
But on the way home to make the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco-goers felt.
For what must be one missing that one throws his fast food bags out of the car window with constant regularity?
Lie mainly on the weekends discarded paper bags on roadsides and in parking lots.
"Why?", I wonder.
Are people too stupid to take the bags with, respectively, home to the nearest trash?
It's not just that the paper stuff littered the landscape.
Bags have already covered transport facilities such as guard rails and triggered accidents.
About something thinks said "throwaway society" but not after, probably do not even know what this word means actually.
If you are often on the road at night, especially with several people in the car, you know how a back seat after they partied through the night might look like: clothes, bottles and other trash piled since.
There were a few bags but also account for more or less nothing - as opposed to the street, where no one wants to trample on the leftovers of others.
I see already come the day on which the cities and towns, the clearing away is too stupid - and must demand the fast-food chains for their bags pledge.
