Alexei Miller of Gazprom pipeline in Bulgaria denotes the beginning of a new Gas√§ra
Construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria constituted the start of one of Europe's largest energy projects of Gazprom's Board of Directors declared.
"Today's event is a milestone: Construction on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, have begun," said the CEO of Gazprom, Alexei Miller, said Thursday in a statement.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is to provide for more variety in Russia export routes through Europe.
A contract dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, where the majority of the Russian gas is stored for Europe, tend to have an increased risk of conventional routes, as can be heard by officials.
Miller said the direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries "forever" are turned off.
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream at discounted rates if the entire 2015 project goes into operation.
According to Gazprom, the construction is scheduled to begin in other downstream countries on the planned route of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
