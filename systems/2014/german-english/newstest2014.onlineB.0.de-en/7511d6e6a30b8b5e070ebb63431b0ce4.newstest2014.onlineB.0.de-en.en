The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction could come to light
He was sentenced by the Liverpool Crown Court to three years in prison
A well-known criminal lawyer who warned a drug lord in front of a large police investigation because he was afraid his secret drug addiction could be uncovered, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, took care of the underworld size Neil Scarborough containing sensitive information about investigations into its activities in the drug trade, after he had been compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The by criminologists as "first class" touted lawyer nicknamed "Bash" 2011 was arrested at his home after police had monitored Scarborough, whom he had represented in a previous drug method.
Officials observed how Scarborough (32) three bags of cocaine at the house of the lawyer in Blackburn, Lancashire, handed in while he was with colleagues at a dinner of the Bar Association.
The investigation revealed that, Ditta regular Class A drugs consumed after traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and credit cards were found in tests.
Over a period of eight months from January to August 2011, he tried to illegally obtain information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of its partners.
All four suspects were then monitored by the police as part of a major investigation for heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other people were later arrested after police ensured in a number of house searches heroin and cocaine worth £ 1.5 million and £ 200,000 in cash.
Ditta, 42, gave information to the criminals, because he feared that his drug addiction would become public.
Today Ditta, who works for the law firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found at Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week process in two counts of obstruction of justice and sentenced.
He admitted cocaine possession in an earlier survey.
The lawyer was convicted after police found out against Scarborough in their investigation that he had been in February 2011 in regular telephone contact with Ditta.
Two investigators followed the suspects and saw how he went to Dittas house and there the drug with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf glove put under the dustbin of the lawyer.
Shortly after he had delivered the drugs, Scarborough telephoned regularly with Ditta, who was at dinner in the football stadium of Blackburn Rovers Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, picked up the drugs and then nine notifications were exchanged between the two.
Was announced in court that Ditta was a "regular customer" of cocaine, after Class A drugs were discovered in his hair, his wallet and to his credit in tests.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied taking cocaine and said he had spoken with the alleged dealer, because this was his client, claiming that their discussion is subject to the "attorney-client privilege."
During his arrest Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were seized and he was a hair sample taken.
When police interrogation, he stated that he operate both under his home address as well as the workplace an office and clients would call him at home because of legal matters.
Was announced in court that he had called major players in the drug trade, of which he had previously represented by some significant arrests and informed about what the investigators knew about it.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: "A criminal lawyer should know better than everyone else that you're not breaking the law."
Ditta is accused of abusing its position as a trial lawyer, he has become very involved with certain clients.
The relation in question is not simply that of a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who supplied his lawyer with drugs.
Part of his messages was undoubtedly legitimate, because he was the attorney of such persons.
But that went far beyond the bounds of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He was the police investigation as far as possible meet, so that they could continue their criminal activities.
Mr Ditta thus brought his profession into disrepute.
He stood too close to certain clients, particularly Scarborough, and he admitted it, that its independence has been compromised.
Ditta had any wrongdoing by himself, claiming: "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, then I would not wait 15 hours, but do it now."
But after the hearing, said Superintendent Lee Halstead by police in Lancashire: "Mr. Ditta has the step of a criminal defense lawyer to a criminal at the moment did when he began to acquire drugs by organized criminals."
His cocaine addiction led to a hopeless compromise and made him receptive to the motives leading members of organized crime, which commissioned him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Attorneys must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure the public trust and confidence.
Ditta has betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind the facade of his profession.
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigation against Ditta, which also led to a conviction in three cases for possession of cocaine and obstruction of justice, which underlines our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We find you and take you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he had explained the conspiracy to heroin, cocaine and cannabis trafficking guilty.
Thirty-five more beteiligte'Personen in drug trafficking were sentenced to cumulative sentences of 153 years for drug offenses.
On his website Ditta published a range of questions and answers about yourself, in which he stated his dream job was to represent as an attorney client on death row in America, his ultimate dinner guest was Muhammad Ali and inequality was the motivation for his working.
