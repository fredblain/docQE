Council is pleased with sound fiscal
Whenever it comes to the budget in council meetings, Mayor Ralph Gerster has a good laugh.
The Gemeindesäckl in Herdwangen-Schoenach is well stocked and debt since 2005, knows the administration already no longer.
Also the financial year 2012 can be accounted for in this sense a complete success.
This became clear during the presentation of the financial statements for 2012.
How Rothmund Andrea explained that the operating budget is approximately 7.6 million euro failed over a million euros higher than planned.
The surplus of the administrative budget lies with approximately 1.8 million euros, some one million euros over the neck.
Due to the excess is especially the higher business taxes and the community share of the income tax.
Also the capital budget was significantly higher than the planned values​​.
Instead of the expected 1.5 million euros it was 2.5 million euros last year.
"This is mainly due to the higher supply from the administrative budget," Roth mouth.
Since less investment has been made as planned in the 2012 budget year, the reserve supply is higher.
Overall, the general reserve was increased by 2.1 million euros to a total of 4.9 million euros.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for their good work.
"Such a work can not shake easy to come by," Gerster praised in view of the financial statements.
He and the local councils were visibly pleased with the excellent figures.
It may sound paradoxical, but exactly these good numbers could citizens soon dearly.
Due to the good financial position, the municipality in the past did not require high collection rates.
This in turn grants but had been reduced by the state, according to Gerster has often.
For these grants from various balancing sticks, there are conditions.
Under this, the cities and municipalities applying for grants, met certain assessment rates.
"The issue of assessment rates, we need to look at, because in the coming years investments are pending, for which we would like to grants," Gerster announced in this context.
