<seg id="1">Schools are kept from bigger focus on mathematics, spelling and grammar</seg>
<seg id="2">In courses to English literature pupils must handle at least a piece of Shakespeare, a novel of the 19th century, romantic lyric poetry and contemporary British novels from 1914 in the future.</seg>
<seg id="3">Into the examination find also „unseen texts" Entry in order to stimulate to wider reading.</seg>
<seg id="4">The combined course from English literature and language is abolished.</seg>

<seg id="10">Studies show that in English schools less time is spent for mathematics - 116 hours per annum or three hours weekly per school year – than in most other countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">On the other hand Australian schools teach on the average 143 hours annually and pupils in Singapore receive 138 hours.</seg>
<seg id="12">Indeed no formal requirement will give to plan more time in the schedule for mathematics, however, from coalition circles it is said the comprehensive maths examination – combined with a stronger weighting of the compartment in ranking lists – will presumably encourage Schulen to scheduling more giving time to pay.</seg>

<seg id="14">The benefit for the society from these gained findings becomes increasingly clearer; simultaneously the accepted risks were reduced visibly.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the result of my efforts was nachweislich positive, my government dissent still handles as a faith break and strives for that, political opinion comment to kriminalisieren and to charge.</seg>
<seg id="16">Nevertheless: To express the truth is not a crime.</seg>
<seg id="17">I am confident, that the government of the United States with support of the international community will put aside this detrimental attitude.</seg>

<seg id="1">On the way through sludge rivers and jungle for free medical care</seg>
<seg id="2">Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical help into faraway villages in Cameroon</seg>
<seg id="3">Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend with treating hundreds of patients</seg>
<seg id="4">In the west-African country there are not many doctors, only one, for 5,000 people</seg>
<seg id="5">You vote here or with your mobile from</seg>
<seg id="6">Dr. Georges Bwelle belongs too the top 10 of the „CNN Heroes of 2013".</seg>
<seg id="7">They can agree for it or one of the other heroes in the top 10, to choose around it to the „CNN hero of the Year".</seg>
<seg id="8">The winner receives 250,000 dollars for the continuation of his extraordinary work</seg>
<seg id="9">For 21 years Georges Bwelle saw how his sick father lost the consciousness again and again and traveled to hospitals which did not have the means in order to help him.</seg>
<seg id="10">Jamef Bwelle was hurt by Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon, in 1981 at a car accident near.</seg>
<seg id="11">First he had only a broken arm, however, then an inflammation which expanded onto his brain and a Hämatom which should influence it for the rest of his life caused there formed itself.</seg>
<seg id="12">„There were not any neurosurgeons in Cameroon", according to Georges Bwelle.</seg>
<seg id="13">We would have brought it out from Cameroon if we had had the money.</seg>
<seg id="14">Instead of this Bwelle spent years with accompanying his father in full clinics and hospitals in order to get the treatment which they had to offer there.</seg>
<seg id="15">Bwelle comments, „It is not simple</seg>
<seg id="16">One can leave at five o'clock the house in the morning and run that to the hospital in order to be the First and nevertheless First is not.</seg>
<seg id="17">There are many patients.</seg>
<seg id="18">Some people even die because they must wait.</seg>
<seg id="19">The situation hardly changed since Bwelles father died in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Cameroon there is only a doctor for each 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the other hand the relation is in the United States near a doctor for 413 persons.</seg>
<seg id="22">However, even if there was a doctor for them, most Cameroonians could not afford the visit.</seg>
<seg id="23">Live two of five people in the country below the poverty border and are almost three quarters of the health editions in the country private.</seg>
<seg id="24">„The only problem which they have is the poverty", says Bwelle.</seg>
<seg id="25">And the poverty makes it impossible to enjoy the life.</seg>
<seg id="26">To see his father and so many of his compatriots suffering let mature in Bwelle the decision to undertake something against that.</seg>
<seg id="27">Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team carried out in the last year 700 free operations.</seg>
<seg id="28">He became even doctor and works as a vessel surgeon in the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.</seg>
<seg id="29">In addition he based a non-profit organization by the name of ASCOVIME who travels to rural areas at weekends and offers there free medical care.</seg>
<seg id="30">Since 2008 it and his volunteer group have helped just 32,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="31">Almost every Friday it and up to 30 people squeeze themselves into minibuses and go the verschnürten medical outfit on the roof about unfortified terrain into the villages that require help</seg>
<seg id="32">Not always everything goes by smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="33">Already more than once they had to shift the vehicles through rivers and sludge</seg>
<seg id="34">However, if they arrive, they are received as heroes: a feast, song and dance and the best accommodation which the place has to offer.</seg>
<seg id="35">In these villages free medical care is really a reason for the celebrating and Bwelle – with his wide smile and his boundless energy – is there gladly during the cheerful celebration.</seg>
<seg id="36">At the next morning the team begins then with the investigation of hundreds of patients.</seg>
<seg id="37">„Per journey we treat 500 persons", according to Bwelle.</seg>
<seg id="38">You come from a vicinity round the village from 60 kilometers – and that on foot.</seg>
<seg id="39">Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a series of fields</seg>
<seg id="40">Many people are treated because of malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transferable illnesses.</seg>
<seg id="41">Others receive crutches, donated glasses or free birth certificates – not simply be able to afford a document that is necessary for the school, however, many poor families.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the evening the team carries out simple operations with local anesthesia.</seg>
<seg id="43">The operations occur usually in a school, the city hall or an apartment; according to the intervention the patients get up and go into the recovery field in order to do place for the next one.</seg>
<seg id="44">The light for the OP and the disinfection equipment is fed by the generator of the group and so Bwelle and his volunteers until the early morning hours on Sunday work.</seg>
<seg id="45">It is a hard workload but the village musicians help usually with holding the team in a motivated way.</seg>
<seg id="46">„You drum the whole night so that we remain awake and can continue our work says Bwelle.</seg>
<seg id="47">On Sunday the team drives back then into the city, tired, but proud of the achieved work</seg>
<seg id="48">The group – a mixture of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – carried out in the last year 700 free operations and knows that it causes an enormous difference with their work for the people who it helps.</seg>
<seg id="49">A man declared that the free operation of an inguinal hernia which he received makes to work again for him possible now.</seg>
<seg id="50">„That changes the future of my family", thought the man.</seg>
<seg id="51">Next to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital Bwelle works also at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.</seg>
<seg id="52">With this second job he finances 60 % of his non-profit activity, according to Bwelle; the rest comes from private donations.</seg>
<seg id="53">„I do really not know when he sleeps", says Katie O'Malley, who studies in the second year at the Drexel University in Philadelphia medicine and cooperates voluntarily in Bwelles group.</seg>
<seg id="54">It is always in the hospital either or attempts to raise money for the organization so that it can go onto these campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="55">For medicine and nursing students as O'Malley, who come from the USA and Europe and support Bwelle, this is a chance to gain practical experiences which they would never get at home.</seg>
<seg id="56">„We can be in the case of operations in this case, where we help, to dab blood or hold the instruments for Dr. Bwelle", declaredly O'Malley.</seg>
<seg id="57">That would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.</seg>
<seg id="58">The students usually pay their journey to Cameroon themselves and bring along frequently donated Sanitätsmaterial.</seg>
<seg id="59">If they are, however, first once in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over the accommodation, the transportation and the instructions.</seg>
<seg id="60">„He is completely a hero without doubts", says O'Malley.</seg>
<seg id="61">It dedicates his life of this organization and his wish, to help the Cameroonian nation, does not know any borders</seg>
<seg id="62">For Bwelle the almost constant work is not a load.</seg>
<seg id="63">Helping to others to a happier life and giving that to a promise which it gave to his father prepares great joy for him.</seg>
<seg id="64">„I am so happy if I do this work thinks Bwelle.</seg>
<seg id="65">And I think of my father.</seg>
<seg id="66">I hope, he sees what I do.</seg>
<seg id="67">I do it in order to make people laugh again and in order to ease the pains.</seg>
<seg id="68">Go to the web site of ASCOVIME and find out how you can help.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pope Franziskus appoints in February first cardinals</seg>
<seg id="2">Pope Franziskus will call on 22nd February for the first time new cardinals of the Catholic church as the Vatican announced on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Cardinals are the rank-highest clergymen in the Catholic church after the Pope and they that elect a Pope so that Franziskus in this way will appoint the first group of men that finally will participate during the choice of his successor are it also.</seg>
<seg id="4">Currently there are 201 cardinals.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, a cardinal that an old man of 80 years reached cannot participate anymore in the pope election – that falls to a group from 120 „elective cardinals".</seg>
<seg id="6">In a declaration in which the information was announced padre Federico Lombardi, a speaker of the Vatican, said a meeting of all cardinals will occur before the ceremony for the appointment of the new cardinals is kept off which is known also as a Konsistorium.</seg>
<seg id="7">„Papst Franziskus decided on announcing his decision for the calling of the Konsistoriums in February in advance in this way other meetings, that" the participation of cardinals from all world require", be able to be planned, Lombardi said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of the elective cardinals until February will probably have sunk.</seg>
<seg id="9">It declared the number of the elective cardinals again in this way a Pope appoints usually as many cardinals as necessarily in 120 is, and as many cardinals above 80 as it would like.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Konsistorium in the next year is important, because it is the First since the choice of Franziskus in March this year's, so Valero.</seg>
<seg id="11">Currently there is a certain overhang of aufseiten Europe and in particular Italy.</seg>
<seg id="12">„It will be interesting" he said „to see whether the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world in order to reconstruct the balance".</seg>
<seg id="13">Forty percent of the Catholics live in South America, however, they have only a tiny number of cardinals.</seg>
<seg id="14">The cardinals will be also the First ones to be called since the education of the council of the cardinals based by Franziskus for finding a group of eight cardinals from the whole world that has the task possibilities for the reformation of the church.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the past the Pope decided on everything alone.</seg>
<seg id="16">„Now Franziskus selected these eight cardinals who are supposed to help him", said Valero.</seg>
<seg id="17">It declared it is „well possible" that Franziskus the cardinals around council please.</seg>
<seg id="18">However up to now we were not in this situation – that is everything very again.</seg>
<seg id="19">Valero said that the bishops would appoint as cardinal typically from big places, nevertheless Franziskus of „full surprises" puts „– we do not know therefore who he appoints".</seg>

<seg id="1">Is it ready to Europe's elite to do businesses with Great Britain?</seg>
<seg id="2">Business for Britain was started in April with the intention to bring the economy onto a table and to define, which those ones that provide prosperity and work in Great Britain would like to change at our relationships to the EU.</seg>
<seg id="3">Too we commissioned the greatest and most comprehensive inquiry to this purpose among British economic leaders and they asked what they think about Great Britain, the economy and the EU.</seg>
<seg id="4">YouGov consulted more than 1,000 managers from the economy, that into about instance the British enterprise sizes, -sectors and show regions</seg>
<seg id="5">The results of the inquiry will surprise many.</seg>
<seg id="6">We found out that meanwhile the predominant majority of the enterprises exports outside of Europe and concentrates on countries that modernize and increase while the states are stagnating in the EU.</seg>
<seg id="7">You want that from government page new commercial connections with countries as China, India and Brazil are favored instead of stopping oneself with the long and hard process to reform the obscure EU institutions.</seg>
<seg id="8">The majority of the economic leaders of the opinion the control of these key competences should be fetched back according to Westminster is asked for their opinion on certain by law controlled topics – of the restrictive trade practices act up to the product legislation.</seg>
<seg id="9">There was it general dissatisfaction with the home market since meanwhile according to the enterprises the costs of the Brussels rules would outweigh the advantages to be part of Europe's commercial zone – even 40 percent of the large-scale enterprises that are traditional at the Europe-friendliest agreed to that.</seg>
<seg id="10">Finally, and that says presumably the most, our questioning of economic leaders made, that a clear majority change of the agreement is wished from Great Britain a course in the direction and a relationship to the EU that is based on trade not on politics</seg>
<seg id="11">This discovery which finds itself with the case of enterprises of all sizes and leading company groups shows that the economy is urgent onto a „reasonable change" which brings the notebook of the action again to Great Britain.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is a question of a lot – a change of the agreement and better conditions for Great Britain would lead at 16 percent to an opinion change for the benefit of the whereabouts in the EU in a plebiscite.</seg>
<seg id="13">The prime minister should not have any doubts: This inquiry shows that the British economy stands behind his plan for the new negotiations of the British conditions for the EU membership</seg>
<seg id="14">It also shows that the enterprises expect a clear shift of the power relations of some new negotiations back to Great Britain.</seg>
<seg id="15">A better deal for the British economy is possible and necessary in increasing measure, after the euro zone moves now in the direction a narrower economic and fiscal agent union.</seg>
<seg id="16">Jobs and growth must be the priority in Great Britain, as the result of our inquiry it shows which enterprises an increasing attention to trade and a basic change in the Brussels approach for rules means.</seg>

<seg id="15">The about 15 000 euros expensive traffic lights installation itself is that most "modern, what currently there is on the market", Arnold explained.</seg>
<seg id="16">The installation is endowed with colored LEDs which shine so strongly that the lights are to be recognized by the motorists for example also at inferior sun well.</seg>
<seg id="17">And it is economical also: The older lighting systems use about 100 watts, that new just once eight watts.</seg>
<seg id="18">Per driving direction there are three lighting systems.</seg>
<seg id="19">Arnold explained the technique of the new installation This is equipped with two radar sensors.</seg>
<seg id="20">The pedestrian presses the traffic lights button, tests the upper radar sensor the traffic situation.</seg>
<seg id="21">The street is free, green comes immediately for the pedestrian, if not, it lasts about 15 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another radar sensor checks, whether the green phase can be ended for the pedestrian.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Should a group or gehbehinderte people about the street go, the green phase is prolonged, it comes therefore every secure above the road", Arnold declared.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of course the motorist must show initiative here as a partner and observe the road.</seg>
<seg id="25">This was not yesterday the case: Hardly the traffic lights did not show for pedestrians green, a superclass vehicle roared through - with the case of radiant red.</seg>

<seg id="7">The discussion proposal outlines twelve measures which once were thought by the former immigration minister Chris Bowen.</seg>
<seg id="8">Immigration minister Brendan O'Connor who yesterday stayed to conversations about human being smuggling in Sri Lanka transformed five of the recommended changes, the others are still considered.</seg>
<seg id="9">If the „genuineness criterion" is taken over, somebody that applies for a visa could be checked then in such a way, whether „the request is really in the cases, in those of the proposers in a related way or personally united with the holder or a relevant person of the supporting enterprise is."</seg>

<seg id="1">Halloween 2013: In numbers</seg>
<seg id="2">When I was small, Halloween had something magic.</seg>
<seg id="3">My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, stay up late and dress ourselves up for the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="4">Today I rather became the Halloween-sourpuss.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the last two years I did not declare myself readily to distribute sweets from my apartment, and will not do it presumably also this year.</seg>
<seg id="6">But according to statistics I am a black sheep, which concerns to Halloween.</seg>
<seg id="7">The majority of the Americans - 158 million, in order to be exactly – this year of Halloween celebrate and in total 6.9 billion United States dollars for sweets, costumes and decorations distribute in this case, according to the US American association of the retailers (NRF).</seg>
<seg id="8">A thing, onto which I me every Halloween then nevertheless again pleases, the trend values are.</seg>
<seg id="9">The costumes will form about 1.2 billion of the 6.9 billion of spent United States dollar, according to the NRF.</seg>
<seg id="10">This year seductive inanimate objects are the last scream.</seg>
<seg id="11">Women must wrap no more in sexy clothing, they can embody now pizza, hamburger or carrots also seductive food as about instance.</seg>
<seg id="12">I every amount expect what concerns to men zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bets, the Daft punk space men will get it this year into the Instagram-Feeds.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to Google zombies, Batman, pirates and witches are the meistgesuchten costumes.</seg>
<seg id="14">I presume, it nothing is turned at tradition.</seg>
<seg id="15">We covered last year our dogs and were not in this way alone for my astonishment.</seg>
<seg id="16">In fact Americans spend 330 million dollars this year for costumes of their domestic animals, according to the NRF.</seg>
<seg id="17">Those ones are an amount „Hot Dogs".</seg>
<seg id="18">We are not what concerns to sweets oversensitive.</seg>
<seg id="19">Americans will spend this year 1.9 billion dollars for that, according to The Nielsen Company.</seg>
<seg id="20">Those ones are about 270 million kilograms at chocolate bars, lollipops, candies and rubber bears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Therefore good news for those according to US Board of Trade of Commerce of Commerce 41 million people that pull „Sweet or Acid" through the quarters with the saying.</seg>
<seg id="22">In fact we will buy more than 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – we do not show anything to ourselves – eat.</seg>
<seg id="23">The only thing which we would not like to consume is the sugar-sweet Candy Corn; nevertheless 15 million kilograms of that are sold around Halloween, according to the National association of the sweets manufacturers.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those ones are about instance nine billion maize kernels.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is a puzzle which I could not solve yet.</seg>
<seg id="26">Nothing belongs anymore to Halloween as houses which it haunts.</seg>
<seg id="27">You have splendid names as „Terror Behind the Walls" (what after all the way stands in a real prison), „Howl-O-Scream" and „The House of Shock".</seg>
<seg id="28">There are in fact 1,200 officially acknowledged spook houses to America Haunts so in the United States that 500 million dollars achieve proceeds, and that includes the wonderful photos on which one pees just into the trousers and that friends put then on Facebook, where one does not rid oneself of it again, and the type onto which one stands leaves a comment to one then as „nice facial expression".</seg>
<seg id="29">But let's come at last to the pumpkins.</seg>
<seg id="30">Charlie Brown machte vertraut us with the Large Pumpkin when we were children, and the carving of a pumpkin lantern is as the adorning of the Christmas tree – something, that we have done of small on.</seg>
<seg id="31">Fortunately that one began „Baby in the pumpkin" trend only last year thanks to pint rest, so that most of us grew up with carving the pumpkin, and not, to be in that.</seg>
<seg id="32">This year Americans will spend about 106 million dollars for pumpkins, so the US Census office.</seg>
<seg id="33">The pumpkin lantern which rots slowly in the front garden comes presumably from Illinois, where this year 245 million kilograms of pumpkins were harvested.</seg>
<seg id="34">If you liked to score correctly, you Tim and Susan Mathisdon call then into Napa, californiums at and you carve something pretty from their 921 kilos heavy pumpkin.</seg>

<seg id="2">Against the former minister of the lab-party Joe Tripodi from New South Wales a determination is initiated through the state corruption supervision.</seg>
<seg id="3">The former NSW-minister denies having changed the regulations for the maritime lease on request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid which had covered participations in three plots on from a government viewpoint controlled country.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC ­ independent commission against corruption) expanded on Friday their investigations for the question whether Obeid influenced different Ministers of State in such a way to extend leases at the Circular Quay, where the Obeids practiced two restaurants and a café, without announcement after their outgoing in August 2005.</seg>
<seg id="5">Now the accusation is investigated, Tripodi knew about Obeids concealed interest at the plots, after Tripodis former deputy stick leader Lynne Ashpole on Thursday had testified corresponding.</seg>
<seg id="6">In conversations lasting for years which began in 2005 the government had insisted on public announcements for the leases.</seg>
<seg id="7">On the other hand the tenants were and wanted furthermore longer terms.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2009 the leases were extended for the enterprises at the Circular Quay that were the Obeids worth annually 2.5 million dollars without public announcement.</seg>
<seg id="9">Tripodi, that was of February 2006 until November 2009 harbor minister, had spoken out initially for public announcements.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, he denied to have made the changes at the request of Obeid who as Tripodi confirmed had insisted on a conversion of the lease regulations of the government.</seg>

<seg id="2">On a mild day at the end of August a German police helicopter flew deeply over the US consulate in Frankfurt on the Main, the finance capital of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="3">On the instructions of the federal velvet for intelligence service and terrorism abatement (BVT), the German inside secret service, he should photograph the roof of the US Außenpostens that there is little as 5 km of the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to German media the BVT wanted to prove the existence of supervision antennae and the action led for an argument into Berlin between the USA and the German foreign ministry of State.</seg>
<seg id="5">James Clapper, US American Director of National Intelligence, insisted in September once again on the USA not using any possibilities of the foreign espionage „in order to steal the companies confidential secrets of foreign enterprises on behalf of US American companies in this way these their international competitive capacity or their profit could extend."</seg>
<seg id="6">However since Edward Snowden, the former employee become to the Whistleblower, began with the publication of his horn of plenty at US American supervision secrets, European governments and enterprise leaders are not more sure, whether they can take the director with the case of the word.</seg>
<seg id="7">Reports according to which the American National Security Agency ausspioniert the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and got herself for data of American Cloud providers including Google and Yahoo brought the company paranoia onto a new highest level because of state supervision.</seg>
<seg id="8">The barrel for the overrun brought the disclosure, that chancellor Angela Merkels was a telephone verwanzt, possibly already for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="9">If the most powerful person can get into the visor in Europe, also managements are potential objectives then with security</seg>
<seg id="10">Snowden made the intense cooperation between US secret services and enterprises transparent.</seg>
<seg id="11">I believe, it is conceivable that these data are used to the mutual benefit.</seg>
<seg id="12">„Germany must wake up", declares Oliver Grün, president of the BITMi who represents small and middle IT companies in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="13">German enterprises believe, the USA represented now an almost just as great risk as China did if it is a question of industrial espionage and data theft, such an inquiry that was published by the consultant company EY in July.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the documents seeped from Snowden it, however, up to now did not give any proof that the USA passed on the companies confidential secrets of foreign enterprises to own companies.</seg>
<seg id="15">Politicians expressed their worry over the EU lacking certain IT and internet possibilities and her should reduce their dependence on the USA.</seg>
<seg id="16">The enterprises are sceptical concerning that.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the Bundestag Federal Parliament it was suggested we should build up a German Google.</seg>
<seg id="18">I can close only my eyes and open it slowly again...</seg>
<seg id="19">„So that does not function, Hasso Plattner, chairperson of the German SAP software manufacturer, says.</seg>
<seg id="20">If one had wanted a strong European IT industry, one should not have made her become extinct 20 years ago then.</seg>
<seg id="21">All in Germany is subsidized, of the coal above cars up to the agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="22">All, up to the IT branch.</seg>
<seg id="23">Nevertheless companies that before had seen the greatest espionage risk in China shocked range and technical smartness of the US espionage authorities uncovered from the Snowden-disclosures.</seg>
<seg id="24">With the Cloud Computing a great change occurs because European enterprise conductors are now more conscious that in the USA stored data of the nonlocal jurisdiction are defeated and therefore potentially endangered are.</seg>
<seg id="25">According to an inquiry carried out by the Cloud Security Alliance, a commercial institution, rejected after the disclosures about the US American data Mining activities with Prism for instance ten percent the not in the USA resident members plans, to be useful an American provider.</seg>
<seg id="26">Jim Snabe, deputy manager of SAP, says: „We see a new question of customers that a year ago there was not yet – it says: Where my data are stored and you can guarantee that these stay physically in this right room</seg>
<seg id="27">Many German enterprise conductors represent the opinion the recent reports only simply confirm that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore these must be guarded at all costs what they in any case already knew indeed.</seg>
<seg id="28">That industrial espionage occurs is not a surprise.</seg>
<seg id="29">That was always like this.</seg>
<seg id="30">„A topic was for many years and did not change itself through the current discussion in a basic way", says Kurt Bock, chairperson of the chemistry enterprise BASF.</seg>

<seg id="3">The little fellow that is not even in the kindergarten yet and only a few months ago did his first steps, and his Shetland pony toffee trotted loosely through the three rounds and got the first price – at which 30 grown-up opponents let it behind themselves.</seg>

<seg id="6">Fenton was praised by the Juroren for his natural abilities with the case of the contact with the pony who would lie far about his age.</seg>
<seg id="7">And Toffee received best notes for his appearance and his personality.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fenton had gotten toffee last March as a present to his third birthday and practiced since then every day with the Shetland-pony.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother, Donna, 30, said: „Fenton and toffee are a splendid team."</seg>
<seg id="10">You had to compete with the entire participant field and went with gold cup and rosette from the place.</seg>

<seg id="16">Fenton is mad on animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens which he takes care of.</seg>
<seg id="17">So as it started, it will long not last, to it on that one „Horse of the year" show is – and I am sure, that he will come off well.</seg>

<seg id="19">Together they are a fabulous team.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Juroren measured Fenton and toffee according to how they would have beaten themselves well and presented themselves in the demonstrating-ring.</seg>
<seg id="21">You pay attention to good cooperation between Pony and leader – and there Fenton and toffee were the best in the ring.</seg>

<seg id="1">Rescue parcel more than 325 millions Australian dollar for Tasmanian health service</seg>
<seg id="2">The Australian government insists on the hard conditions, that are tied together with the rescue parcel more than 325 millions Australian dollar for the Tasmanian health service, in order to guarantee that the government of the Federal state cannot waste the money.</seg>
<seg id="3">Federal minister of Health Tanya Plibersek announced, that Commonwealth will take „immediate measures" in order to avert a crisis that through an aging population of the developing island country, a higher rate at chronic illnesses and system restrictions has been caused.</seg>
<seg id="4">The financing for a period of four years was concluded after government consultations with the independent Tasmanian representative Andrew Wilkie.</seg>
<seg id="5">„The government tied up an emergency rescue parcel that concerns to the unique challenges to which the Federal state sees itself opposite according to our opinion declared Plibersek today.</seg>
<seg id="6">The 325-million-dollar-parcel contains 31 million dollars Soforthilfe for choice services.</seg>
<seg id="7">Remains are supposed to be removed by further 2600 operations, including orthopaedic interventions and treatments because of gray star.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition there is money to services for day clinics into Hobart and Launceston, better aftercare after stationary stays, the specialist training, in the field psychological health and the introduction of a system for the electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="9">„These investments correspond" to the ideas from which affected clinic employees said to me they are the best possibility to correct the Tasmanian health system", said Tanya Plibersek.</seg>
<seg id="10">The minister insisted on a severe report and account duty of the Tasmanian government.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Federal state must retain the current financing level in order to be able to receive money from the Commonwealth, and report monthly about where the additional money was spent.</seg>
<seg id="12">A three-headed commission is established and is supposed to guarantee, that the Federal state provides National Health Service so effectively and efficiently as possibly.</seg>
<seg id="13">As Wilkie declared today, the 325 million dollars would be useful only little if „they are not accompanied from real reforms which bring the public Tasmanian health system onto a more lasting course."</seg>
<seg id="14">Nevertheless he praised the government for her reacting to his request around urgent help which it expressed first opposite the prime minister at the beginning of May.</seg>
<seg id="15">„I am confident, that the federal aids will perform" „a great contribution to taking the public health system of the Federal state of the worry list", Wilkie said.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to the government of the Federal state these choice services will wettmachen the recent incisions to a large extent.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless the health-political speaker of the opposition on Bundesebene, Peter Dutton, thinks the present announcement is only a „plaster solution".</seg>
<seg id="18">„We are therefore in the present situation because the lab state government deducted 430 million dollars from the health system", he said opposite ABC TV.</seg>
<seg id="19">It cannot be, that a state government tears almost half a billion of dollars from the system and sticks in the Commonwealth 300 million and then so do as if were the good straightening.</seg>
<seg id="20">Dutton asked Plibersek to guarantee that a single dollar of the rescue parcel is not spent for additional bureaucracy.</seg>

<seg id="7">The one declared to appointment report, the judge must be released from the case since it hurt the behavior codex for US American judges when it is certain that a judge is supposed to avoid the appearance of the partiality; this was justified in part by media interviews and public statements in which it had reacted to the criticism of the court in public with a row</seg>

<seg id="2">Survivors and relatives of the 202 people that had died in 2002 during the bomb attack in Bali reacted annoyed about the judgment for the last one of the instigators that was put in court court since Umar Patek should be shot to death according to their opinion state-legally.</seg>
<seg id="3">Patek that was just ten years as one of the meistgesuchten persons of Southeast Asia on the run was condemned yesterday to a prison sentence of 20 years for his role near the construction of exploding-bodies for the bomb attack.</seg>
<seg id="4">With punishment suspension he could be released after 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="5">The 45-year long one was been the mass murder for guilty because of the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist quarter from Kuta at which 202 people died under that 88 Australians, and a lot more were hurt.</seg>
<seg id="6">A fault saying in addition occurred in a series of terrorism-related charges which churches belonged a wave to from explosive agent assaults in Indonesia at Christmas Eve in the year 2000.</seg>
<seg id="7">The prosecution had demanded a lifelong prison sentence even if she could have applied for the death penalty punishment for the man who is called brilliant bomb farmer because of his call also as „Demolition Man".</seg>
<seg id="8">The decision woke painful memories with June Corteen, a mother from Perth that lost their 39 years old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the devastation prepared by Patek and his Mitverschwörern almost ten years ago.</seg>
<seg id="9">With tears fighting they said, Patek should have been condemned to the death.</seg>
<seg id="10">I really think it should follow into the footprint of the other fellows.</seg>
<seg id="11">„One should put it before a shooting command said Corteen opposite AAP.</seg>
<seg id="12">I must live every day with my not getting any further grandsons and never again seeing my daughters.</seg>
<seg id="13">The sari club was leveled with the earth when on the 12th October 2002 shortly to 23 o'clock a tremendous bomb in a small vice exploded which was parked before the night club.</seg>
<seg id="14">Peter Hughes was in Paddy's bars, where only 20 seconds formerly a suicide assassin made a rucksack filled with explosive agent explode.</seg>
<seg id="15">It fell after the assault into the coma for a month and „died" three times while he was loving a life preservation system.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hughes said, Patek earned the same fate as the three other members of the terror cell Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi, Mukhlas and imam Samudra – that was responsible for the bloodbath and four years ago was executed.</seg>
<seg id="17">Real, this type should get the death penalty punishment before all others.</seg>
<seg id="18">To let it at the life – no, there is not any reason to let it at the life.</seg>
<seg id="19">20 year is not to be gotten after it killed 202 people and hurt many hundreds a lot.</seg>
<seg id="20">Patek is the last one of the Bali-bombers which stood in court court.</seg>
<seg id="21">It took away almost a decade of the arrest from itself was picked up, however, finally in January 2011 in the Pakistan city of Abbottabad, where US armed forces killed the former al-Qaida-leader Osama bin Laden later just four months.</seg>
<seg id="22">During the negotiations a FBI-agent stated that there was Patek in Pakistan in order to affect bin Laden with the aim of reconstructing the connection between south-east-Asiatic terror groups and al-Qaida that secret service reports would have produced the tip</seg>
<seg id="23">„He did not surrender", said Corteen.</seg>
<seg id="24">Until recently it did not show any remorse for how much sorrow it caused to other people.</seg>
<seg id="25">The judgment passed before the decennial anniversary of the assault this year which is inspected with commemorations in Bali and Australia.</seg>
<seg id="26">„There will be this year many tears", said Corteen.</seg>
<seg id="27">Patek can still appeal against his judgment.</seg>

<seg id="1">Profit losses at Bombardier according to drop with the case of delivering-numbers and tasks</seg>
<seg id="2">The Canadian airplane and railroad manufacturer Bombardier Inc announced on Thursday a 15 per cent drop of the clear profit after he had gotten under pressure through regressive orders and deliveries over at airplanes in the third quarter as well as contract problems in the railroad section.</seg>
<seg id="3">Bomb published with seat in Montreal also no flight test data for his brand-new airplane of the CSeries and did not give any new information about that, whether the airplane according to the ambitious schedule in next September into the commercial use can go.</seg>
<seg id="4">Onto the old maid flight of the test flight stuff before one months up to now only three more starts followed, what makes him appear questionable, whether the test phase on schedule proceeds.</seg>
<seg id="5">The results remained behind the predictions and led to a sharp fall in prices from more than eight percent at the stock exchange from Toronto.</seg>
<seg id="6">Cameron Doerksen, analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered on Thursday his evaluation of „outperform" on „sector perform" in the regard on a restricted course potential having the stock in the next one to two quarters.</seg>
<seg id="7">„Indeed weaker delivering-numbers were largely expected at airplanes, however, from the margin development in the transportation field we are very clearly disappointed", said Doerksen into one to customer writings.</seg>
<seg id="8">We think that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries if the check programme strides for the airplane.</seg>
<seg id="9">If, however, in the coming months no new orders are announced, we expect then that the market becomes more sceptical opposite the program.</seg>
<seg id="10">Bomb hopes, that the airplane row of the CSeries can catapult the enterprise into the lower market segment that currently is dominated by Boeing and airbus.</seg>
<seg id="11">The first test flight stuff was introduced in March to the public and flew after delays lasting for months for the first time in September.</seg>
<seg id="12">However up to now obligatory orders are for the CSeries with 177 moderat since potential buyers would like to wait for the results of the flight tests and see whether the claims of the enterprise with regard to fuel efficiency and cost saving-potential of the new nozzle airliner are appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="13">Currently there are in total 403 orders and promises of 15 customers and societies.</seg>
<seg id="14">Executive board chairperson Pierre Beaudoin gives himself confidently, that Bombardier will reach his objective of 300 obligatory orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the jet.</seg>
<seg id="15">The management in addition assured on Thursday opposite analysts and media the program lies in the aging schedule.</seg>
<seg id="16">„The test flight stuff did not stay longer at the ground than expects", „Beaudoin would say at a telephone conference" and would add during the endurance life of the airplane ground tests and software updates were scheduled.</seg>
<seg id="17">Every manufacturer plans differently.</seg>
<seg id="18">We decided on undertaking a first flight and attaching a reworking period then which we also did.</seg>
<seg id="19">That happens during the entire flight program.</seg>
<seg id="20">The second of five test airplanes will start probable in the next weeks, the remaining ones shortly after that, it was called from enterprise page</seg>
<seg id="21">Nevertheless analysts remain sceptical whether twelve months after the old maid flight the first customer can take an airplane of the CSeries in operation.</seg>
<seg id="22">Bomb declared, it checks the planning for the initiation (ICE) and will update these in the next months.</seg>
<seg id="23">„The slow striding the flight test – also when they correspond to Bombardiers of internal planning obviously – confirms" Doerksen said „our opinion that the initiation postpones onto the first quarter in 2015".</seg>
<seg id="24">In the third quarter with end on 30th September Bombardiers clear profit fell on 147 million dollars and/or 8 cents per stock from 172 million dollars and/or 9 cents per stock per year before.</seg>
<seg id="25">The adapted profit per stock is as before 9 cents.</seg>
<seg id="26">The turnover gave insignificantly and sank from 4.2 onto 4.1 billion dollars.</seg>
<seg id="27">Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per stock and a turnover of 4.56 billion dollars, according to Thomson of Reuters I/B/E/S.</seg>
<seg id="28">The worldwide fourth-tallest airplane manufacturer declares he handed over in this quarter 45 airplanes a drop of 57 in the last year.</seg>
<seg id="29">The net orders fell from 83 airplanes on 26.</seg>
<seg id="30">The order backlog in the air and space travel section was on 30th September 32.9 billion dollars and was in this way unchanged opposite the 31st December.</seg>
<seg id="31">„In the field air and room journey the results lay within the framework of our handicaps however the low incoming orders and the market conditions in total were disappointing", Beaudoin said.</seg>
<seg id="32">The turnover in the air and space travel section fell about 13 percent onto two billion dollars.</seg>
<seg id="33">Bomb, the worldwide tallest railroad manufacturer, announced that the turnover increased in this section around just eleven percent on 2.1 billion dollars.</seg>
<seg id="34">The order backlog in the transportation section was on 30th September 32.6 billion dollars and was in this way slightly increased opposite the 31st December.</seg>
<seg id="35">The profit margin in the field transportation was influenced at some major contracts by handling problems.</seg>
<seg id="36">According to management there will be for the fourth quarter new handicaps</seg>
<seg id="37">The bombing-stock gave in the nachmittäglichen trade on Thursday about 8.5 percent and was enclosed 4.83 Canadian dollar, after it was also announced that the Google finance executive board Patrick Pichette will change into the executive board.</seg>

<seg id="1">Scientists could fling more light on in which connection the tail wag of a dog with his atmosphere stands</seg>
<seg id="2">Former investigations had shown that happy dogs waved more to the right with the tail (from view of the dog) while it was being the left page at nervous dogs.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, now scientists say that other dogs can perceive these subtle differences and react to that.</seg>
<seg id="4">Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a Neurowissenschaftler of the Trient university, said: „With the human being is well known, that the left and react right hemisphere differently on Stimuli that cause positive or negative emotions."</seg>
<seg id="5">Here we attempted to notice this about us with the case of other species.</seg>
<seg id="6">He in addition noticed, that at dogs as with the human being the right hemisphere is responsible exactly for the movement of the left page and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles with the case of the feelings.</seg>
<seg id="7">In order to find out more about that, reacting to the lateral tail wag of their fellows, the researchers controlled the animals, as dog while these films of other dogs were looking at themselves.</seg>
<seg id="8">You measured the heart frequency of the Vierbeiner and analyzed the behavior.</seg>
<seg id="9">Probably we will soon understand, why the tail once into one, once in motion into the other direction</seg>
<seg id="10">Professor Vallortigara said: „We showed films with dogs to the dogs – either a nature-true version or a silhouette, in order to eliminate other aspects turning away, and we could control in this way more towards to the left or to the right the movement of the tail."</seg>
<seg id="11">If the animals saw, how one otherwise blank dog has moved the tail to the right (seen from the perspective of the waving dog), they remained completely loose</seg>
<seg id="12">The tail inclination was, however, above all to the left (again from perspective of the dog that waves), so their heart frequency increased and they looked restless.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the view of professor Vallortigara the dogs do not communicate on purpose with each other through these movements.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is rather convinced, that the dogs would have learned from experience, at which movements they should do themselves to worries and when not.</seg>
<seg id="15">He said: „If one has different meetings with other dogs and the wag is linked with the tail into a direction rather with friendly behavior and produces the right page rather one less friendly behavior, then one reacts to basis of these experiences."</seg>
<seg id="16">The researchers say that the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians and coaches to a better sense of the emotions of their animal.</seg>
<seg id="17">John Bradshaw, Experte for dog behaviors and guest scholarship holder at the department of animal medicine of the university of Bristol declared this was not the first study at the was examined, whether to the left and to the right important for dogs is.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year a team of the university found out that dogs turn the head to the left if they look at an aggressive dog from Lincoln and to the right, if it is a question of a satisfied dog.</seg>
<seg id="19">In another study work at the university of Victoria in Canada following stood „Dogs rather go towards a robot dog, if his ,Schwanz‘ waves to the left and not to the right, instead of becoming restless – exactly the other way round than in the Italian study.</seg>
<seg id="20">According to his statement the differences could originate therefore from the dogs not interpreting as dogs the animals in the films and/or the robot dogs in the different studies.</seg>
<seg id="21">A study, to react to real dogs as dogs, could help, it declared.</seg>
<seg id="22">„Indeed it gives considerable proofs of many different mammals that the two hemispheres are used for different purposes, nevertheless many of the details must still be determined – and dogs do not form any exception there", so Bradshaw".</seg>
<seg id="23">Since their behavior, however, can simply be recorded, it will long presumably not last until we understand why the tail sometimes into one, sometimes in motion into the other direction.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pawnshops boomen in Singapore, since the crisis arrived in the middle class</seg>
<seg id="2">In a pawnshop in the shopping center Bendemeer in Singapore Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a golden bracelet, a ring and a few earrings in order to be able to pay the school fees of their daughters.</seg>
<seg id="3">„My husband and I bought just a house, there my whole money is „in that", Amirthalinga says.</seg>
<seg id="4">Although they every month 3,000 Singapore dollars (ca 1,730 euros) than administration employee deserves and their husband also works, the monthly family income does not suffice, it explains.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact the demand is so great in parts of Southeast Asia – where the indebtedness of the budgets increases – that ValueMax, where she carried out their exchange, became the third pawnshop to be listed at the Singaporean stock exchange this week.</seg>
<seg id="6">The pawning of jewelry is not only a fast way in order to get money – 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as favorable as an unsaved bank loan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Typically pawnshops require in Singapore an effective year interest of 17 percent that lies only just over the 15.4 percent that the United Overseas demands Bank a local credit grantor with a branch in the same shopping center.</seg>
<seg id="8">Pawnshops offer, however, the advantage that no inspection of the creditworthiness or income proofs are necessary here, for which loans are more fast than possible near banks</seg>
<seg id="9">For this reason millions of people turn in the region to pawnshops after families sense the pressure through increasing costs of living as well as an increasing budget and consumer indebtedness.</seg>
<seg id="10">After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credits due to a loose financial policy in the developed markets families with smaller and middle incomes consult pawnshops in order to balance so the difference with the case of stuttering economy.</seg>
<seg id="11">This week the rating agency described standard & Poor's wachsende budget indebtedness, main through increasing mortgages, as a factor of risk for the creditworthiness of Asiatic banks</seg>
<seg id="12">Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have according to assessment of the agency the highest budget indebtedness in Asia in relation to the gross domestic product.</seg>
<seg id="13">Malaysia stands with 80 percent of the BIP at the top of the list, a rise of 60 percent still in the year 2008.</seg>
<seg id="14">Nation business persons worry also because of the high consumer indebtedness in Thailand, which came out this week just from a technical recession.</seg>
<seg id="15">On Thursday the data showed an export weakness keeping on existing and a remission of the consumer demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">„In the final effect that means, that faced with increasing costs the people in the middle one will attempt to lower segment (the income scale), their to complement" „incomes where that is always possible," says song Seng Wun, economist, at CIMB, a Malaysian bank</seg>
<seg id="17">Historical highest levels with the case of the gold prices of gold in the last two years still intensified the trend towards the pledge of personal objects since the people take the opportunity for changing the jewelry of the family into cash.</seg>
<seg id="18">In Singapore about 70 percent of the pawned objects are gold in the 200 pawnshops of the city state.</seg>
<seg id="19">The people tell: „The gold price of gold looks good, let us grandmother's Goldkette pawn and fetch back next month."</seg>
<seg id="20">The tallest Thai pawnshop operator, EasyMoney, experienced a 20 per cent customer increase in his branches in the last months.</seg>
<seg id="21">The growth in the pledge business is so strong, that ValueMax would like to expand, operator of the branch in Bendemeer and 15 more in Singapore, not only into the adjacent Malaysia – where the enterprise practices four houses –, but also outside of Asia, so Yeah Lee Ching, manageress of ValueMax.</seg>
<seg id="22">The enterprise finances that with 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore-dollars which it took this week with the initial public offering in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="23">While some credit grantors were getting into the cross fire because of high interest rates, Yeah declares that pawnshops would not offer only more favorable interests than other lenders, but did not increase the debts directly either.</seg>
<seg id="24">„Customers grant a loan on objects which they already own and the liquefaction of personal articles of value does not extend the Haushaltsverschulung", it explains.</seg>
<seg id="25">The pawnbroking business is accepted socially increasingly as a short-term, protected financing.</seg>
<seg id="26">Also all people are not, use the pawnbroking, in financial difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="27">Rich people from Singapore come also into the branches of ValueMax in order to pawn gold bars and Rolex-clocks for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price cash.</seg>
<seg id="28">To us customers come from every social shift</seg>
<seg id="29">„Prosperous ones who lend something at short notice for a business or an investment, or small enterprises which must bridge bottlenecks in the Cash Flow belong to that", says Yeah.</seg>
<seg id="30">Sometimes they also simply need money only very much quickly.</seg>

<seg id="3">"There is currently a dangerous tendency that Mane and Alan into the category are pushed swallow kings", he defended the two Offensivwirbler on Thursday on a press conference in Salzburg.</seg>
<seg id="4">Recent reason for Rangnicks criticism was yellow for Mane at the 3:0 against Grödig on the last Sunday at which an alleged acting for the doom became to the Senegalese - that certainly was not a how the TV pictures showed.</seg>

<seg id="1">A study which is supposed to increase the advantages of the HS2 railroad project for Scotland was announced by the British government.</seg>
<seg id="2">In the work of HS2 Ltd it is suggested to realize already with beginning of phase 1 per year 2026 high-speed links between Scotland and the north of England.</seg>
<seg id="3">Traffic minister Baroness Kramer said, the project will bring together Great Britain nearer.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Scotch Minister of Transport Keith Brown declared it is very delighted with the British government at this plan to work.</seg>
<seg id="5">Phase 1 consists of a new high speed railroad connection between London and the west Midlands.</seg>
<seg id="6">On completion of phase 2 there will be according to connections Manchester and Leeds.</seg>
<seg id="7">In June the government corrected the estimated costs for the construction of the high speed trasses between London and north England of 32.7 billion pounds on 42.6 billion pounds.</seg>
<seg id="8">The British government which stands in conversations with transportation Scotland charged HS2 Ltd to search for further stretch capacities and travel time improvements for north England and Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="9">The possibility of a travel time of finally three hours or little belongs to that from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.</seg>
<seg id="10">Baron's daughter Kramer said: „Our objective for HS2 is a really national railway network, the Great Britain and his cities nearer brings together."</seg>
<seg id="11">We precede with HS2 because it brings enormous advantages with themselves.</seg>
<seg id="12">Without it we stand before a capacity crisis in our traction network.</seg>
<seg id="13">However it is a question also of the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, that is improved thanks to HS2.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Scotch undersecretary Alistair Carmichael commented: „The present announcement is a good information for Scotland."</seg>
<seg id="15">On behalf of the Scotch government Keith Brown Carmichael asked to support the Scotch integration „unmistakably" into the HS2-network.</seg>
<seg id="16">Brown said: „The high speed railroad connection contains the potential of enormous economical advantages for Scotland, simultaneously also the economic strength of Scotland supplies, however, an argument for fast railroad connections in whole Great Britain."</seg>
<seg id="17">Therefore we are delighted to work as a partner of the British government and to examine the options for a high speed railroad connection in Scotland that creates advantages for all and the connection Glasgow-Edinburgh complements that the Scotch government already plans.</seg>
<seg id="18">I look forward to examining the research report with the British ministers in the next year and deciding on the next steps together.</seg>

<seg id="1">Living with future perspective</seg>
<seg id="2">Actually Waltraud Ries lives marvellously.</seg>
<seg id="3">Your house lies in one quiet residential area's of Stuttgart with a lot green, an old tree stock, nice neighbors and neither too much traffic.</seg>
<seg id="4">Into the city it is only few minutes with public means of transportation.</seg>
<seg id="5">"You are not afraid it is to be hoped of spiders"? Waltraud Ries asks and points at a fat spider at the door frame.</seg>
<seg id="6">I search already for some time a new apartment for my husband and me.</seg>
<seg id="7">But you know how difficult that is in Stuttgart.</seg>
<seg id="8">The reason is, however, no spider phobia, but the worry, it declares not to be able to overcome the many stairs anymore in the age to the house and in the apartment.</seg>
<seg id="9">Furthermore: For a meniscus-operation the Mittfünfzigerin has had to find out at the own body what means to move from storey with Handicap to storey.</seg>
<seg id="10">Recently first a book was published from it on the topic 'Live happily in the age - Which Living-Form the best is for me?'.</seg>
<seg id="11">'Our apartment is the best example of what' does not 'work' in the age at all begins to tell it</seg>
<seg id="12">When it more than 20 years ago with their husband moved into the May sonnet apartment, it was only simple a beautiful apartment right in the Green Party member</seg>
<seg id="13">Today with middle fifty Waltraud Ries thinks different about that.</seg>
<seg id="14">She also knows, however, that she belongs to the few people who deal with the topic 'Live in the age' anyway.</seg>
<seg id="15">Most replace it as long as it works.</seg>
<seg id="16">Only the others get old always', she says smiling.</seg>
<seg id="17">Only if the suffering pressure is really big one is concerned.</seg>
<seg id="18">'Then it' can 'be', however', already too late', according to Ries.</seg>
<seg id="19">In their book the interior designer presents 17 living-models for an even specific living in the age.</seg>
<seg id="20">'Which living-form one, however, chooses is always an Individualentscheidung', it declares.</seg>
<seg id="21">There is not D i e solution for the age.</seg>
<seg id="22">Even who can afford the age transition fit in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that he can become also sick.</seg>
<seg id="23">And: 'Without good knowledge of the national language vereinsame one also in the Dolce Vita', the specialized book book authoress Aussiedlungswilligen gives to consider.</seg>
<seg id="24">Under their models classical care models, alternative living-forms or the often quoted Rentner-WG, are found.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the age everyone has so his tics and flaws</seg>
<seg id="26">'For me such a flat-sharing community would not be, however, anything' she thinks with a wink.</seg>
<seg id="27">Already not at all as in a Studenten-WG with a common bath and a kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="28">'In the age one simply needs also his withdrawal rooms', according to Ries.</seg>
<seg id="29">That nevertheless a senior flat-sharing community can function nevertheless does not want to exclude the book authoress.</seg>
<seg id="30">That must go by then differently, however, than in the classical Studenten-WG.</seg>
<seg id="31">And sometimes one simply wants also only his rest', she believes.</seg>
<seg id="32">With this opinion it does not stand at least in the capital only there.</seg>
<seg id="33">Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay 'as long as it works in their own apartment', also the experience of Theresa Rütten is, the head of the civil service life in the age of the capital.</seg>
<seg id="34">Your office advises people around the topic 'Get older'.</seg>
<seg id="35">Therefore older people would just accept also inconveniences and restrictions frequently only in order to be able to stay in their usual surroundings that is also the experience of the foundation product test.</seg>
<seg id="36">In this case there are today many possibilities to design the house or the apartment barrier-freely.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ream is recommended to all that deal with the age-just reconstruction of their house or their apartment first once thoroughly to inform and not to charge the first-best craftsman.</seg>
<seg id="38">Today there are specialists also for the age-just reconstruction.</seg>
<seg id="39">Even in the flat let for rent one or the other can be realized, and if it is only the toilet seat increase, the interior designer clears up.</seg>
<seg id="40">But not always the existing apartment is let age-raked and reshape in this way barrier-freely even if it is still so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="41">This experience had to make Waltraud Ries.</seg>
<seg id="42">Indeed one could install a stairs lift within the apartment, the way paved also with stairs to to the apartment door would be, however, the by far greater obstacle.</seg>
<seg id="43">It will weitersuchen until she found the ideal object for itself and their husband.</seg>
<seg id="44">She is terrified by the move more by it than by the spider at their apartment door.</seg>

<seg id="1">Cocaine-Dependent Attorney, the drug boss in front of police determination warned, must into the prison</seg>
<seg id="2">Basharat Ditta, 42, passed on information to underworld size Neil Scarborough</seg>
<seg id="3">The attorney was afraid, his secret drug addiction could come onto the light</seg>
<seg id="4">He was condemned by the Liverpooler Crown Court to three years of prison</seg>
<seg id="5">A known punishment defender that warned a drug baron against a great police determination because he was afraid his secret drug addiction could be uncovered, three years of custody was condemned to.</seg>
<seg id="6">Basharat Ditta, 42, supplied underworld size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about investigations to his activities in the drug traffic after he had been compromised by his own cocainism.</seg>
<seg id="7">The attorney considered as „first-class" by criminalists with the nickname „Bash" was arrested in 2011 in his house after the police had controlled Scarborough which he had represented in a former drug procedure.</seg>
<seg id="8">Officials observed, as Scarborough (32) three bags cocaine at the house of the attorney in Blackburn, Lancashire, delivered, while this with colleagues was being to the Bar Association during a food.</seg>
<seg id="9">The investigations revealed, that Ditta consumed regular drugs of the class A, after in the case of tests tracks of cocaine in his hairs, on his wallet and at credit cards had been found.</seg>
<seg id="10">Over a period of eight months between January and he attempted August 2011, without authorization information about the arrest of two men in the task of Scarborough and one of his partners to get.</seg>
<seg id="11">All four suspects were controlled then by the police within the framework of a great preliminary inquiry for the heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and west Yorkshire.</seg>
<seg id="12">Together with 32 other persons they were arrested later after the police guaranteed heroin and cocaine to the value of 1.5 million pounds as well as 200,000 pounds at cash with the case of a series of house searches.</seg>
<seg id="13">Ditta, 42, passed on information to the criminals because he feared his drug addiction can become public.</seg>
<seg id="14">Today Ditta became that for the office Forbes Solicitors works in Blackburn, been at the Liverpooler Crown Court according to a three week long procedure in two charges because of hindrance of the justice for guilty and condemned.</seg>
<seg id="15">He admitted with the case of a former questioning the cocaine possession</seg>
<seg id="16">The attorney was transferred after the police found out at their investigations against Scarborough that this had stood in February 2011 in regular telephonic contact with Ditta.</seg>
<seg id="17">Two investigation officials followed the suspect and saw how it went to Dittas house and laid the drugs with a purity of 60 percent there under the garbage can of the attorney in a black golf glove.</seg>
<seg id="18">In a word after he had delivered the drugs, Scarborough phoned regularly Ditta who was during the supper in the football stadium of the Blackburn Rovers in Ewood Park.</seg>
<seg id="19">The attorney returned home, got the drugs and then nine communications were exchanged between the two.</seg>
<seg id="20">In court court it became known that Ditta was a „regular consumer" of cocaine after with the case of tests drugs of the class A in his hairs, his wallet and on his credit cards had been discovered.</seg>
<seg id="21">Ditta was arrested later, denied, however, to take cocaine and said it spoke with the supposed dealer, because this his mandator is, and said their discussion is subjected to the „attorney secret".</seg>
<seg id="22">During his arrest Ditta took his wallet and attempted to remove a row from credit cards, nevertheless they were guaranteed and a hair test was taken from it</seg>
<seg id="23">During the police interrogation he served, he practices an office both under his private address and at the job and mandators would call him at home because of juridical matters.</seg>
<seg id="24">In court court it became known that he had called and informed important protagonists of the drug traffic from whom he had represented some before after important arrests of what the observers about them knew.</seg>
<seg id="25">State attorney Anne Whyte said: „A criminal law law attorney should know better that one does not break the law than all others should."</seg>
<seg id="26">Ditta is accused of the abuse of his position as a punishment defender since he went along with certain mandators too very much.</seg>
<seg id="27">The relationship in question is simply not that of a drug trader, but a drug trader's that supplies his attorney with drugs.</seg>
<seg id="28">A part of his communications was beyond doubt legitimate, because he was the attorney of these persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">However, that exceeded far the borders of a normal relationship between attorney and mandator.</seg>
<seg id="30">It counteracted the police investigations so far as possibly so that they kept on being able to follow their criminal activities.</seg>
<seg id="31">Mr Ditta brought his profession into disrepute in this way.</seg>
<seg id="32">It suited certain mandators too near, in particular Scarborough, and it permitted that his independence was compromised.</seg>
<seg id="33">Ditta expelled every error behavior from himself and claimed: „If I was a corrupt attorney, which I am not, and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, I would not wait then any 15 hours, but would do that immediately."</seg>
<seg id="34">However after the hearing superintendent Lee Halstead of the police in Lancashire said: „Herr Ditta added the step to a criminal from a punishment defender in the moment when he started acquiring drugs of organized criminals."</seg>
<seg id="35">His cocaine dependence led to a hopeless Kompromittierung and did it pronely to the motives of leading members of the organized criminality that charged him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.</seg>
<seg id="36">Attorneys must maintain the highest standards at integrity and guarantee in public for confidence and confidence.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ditta cheated this confidence and attempted to entrench oneself behind the facade of his profession.</seg>
<seg id="38">The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigations against Ditta that led also to a condemnation in three cases because of the possession from cocaine and justice hindrance, which underlines our determination to bring criminals in court court.</seg>
<seg id="39">This case should be criminals a warning and it shows that no one can escape from the arm of the law.</seg>
<seg id="40">We find you and bring you in court court.</seg>
<seg id="41">Prison was condemned to Scarborough itself to 14 years after it had declared itself to the conspiracy for the heroin, cocaine and cannabis trade for guilty.</seg>
<seg id="42">Thirty-five more at the drug traffic beteiligte'Personen were condemned to total punishments of 153 years because of drug offenses.</seg>
<seg id="43">On his web site Ditta published a field with questions and answers above themselves in which he served, it is his dream job to represent as an attorney mandator in the death cell in America, his ultimativer guest during the supper is Mohammed Ali and chance inequality is the motivation for his work</seg>

<seg id="1">Rat takes railway constructions siding tracks into the visor</seg>
<seg id="2">Is the level crossing "Am deer" supposed to be rebuilt extensively in order to increase the road safety?</seg>
<seg id="3">The district councils decided.</seg>
<seg id="4">Schiltach must take 220 000 euros for that into the hand.</seg>
<seg id="5">The German Railways want to improve in the coming year the Kinzigtal bus route.</seg>
<seg id="6">Especially the security is supposed to be increased in this case at level crossings - regularly it keeps up in a nationwide way to collisions of trains other vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="7">If the municipalities agree to the structural alteration measures, they must participate with a third in the costs, railways and Federal Government divide themselves the rest.</seg>
<seg id="8">Schiltachs city master builder Roland Grießhaber explained the special features of the Bahübergangs "Am deer" to the district council.</seg>
<seg id="9">There the city plans, in to build height of the nonlocal tunnel mouth west of the railway tracks a deflection.</seg>
<seg id="10">There can also bigger vehicles, for example such that transport long-cut wood with the case of oncoming traffic traffic stand without having to block the rails</seg>
<seg id="11">Grießhaber suggested therefore to construct a necessary retaining wall so.</seg>
<seg id="12">This was discussed in the district council controversially since some councils questioned the necessity of a street circulation: Thomas Kipp brought the atmosphere of the critics with his comment onto the point: "We must take so much money because of so few vehicles into the hand"?</seg>
<seg id="13">Mayor Thomas Haas contradicted: The level crossing "deer" is used regularly for long-cut wood transportations.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even wood from the field "cow creek is transported in part over this stretch because the up to 20 meters long vehicles could not use the stretch at the Häberlesbrücke because they could not turn there into the main road.</seg>
<seg id="15">In addition the stretch is used as Umleitungfür the vehicles that must not use the tunnel if the main road is spaced, argued Haas.</seg>
<seg id="16">Since it is to be foreseen that Kirchberg- and castle mountain tunnels would have to be rebuilt and renovated as this is currently the case in Wolfach, "Am "deer" also for a longer period can be to the level crossing "of an important traffic importance</seg>
<seg id="17">The councils agreed on making examine which costs the thought broadening of the street would cause.</seg>
<seg id="18">Despite that was agreed the reconstruction of the level crossing mainly with the possible specification, that the necessary retaining wall is built so that the city can extend the subsequent street where appropriate direction "Railway station trasses" for meeting traffic on about 5.5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the other hand the reconstruction of the level crossing near the tannery familiar wine could involve a very different problem which affects the access into the "Geroltzhäuser Weg" going up strongly.</seg>
<seg id="20">The administration had made examine the reconstruction plans of the railways of the engineering office Breinlinger since she had doubts about whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser way is still possible without further one.</seg>
<seg id="21">The investigation came for the result, that it is not to be excluded that the inclination relations of the street could result in longer vehicles sitting up.</seg>
<seg id="22">The responsibility for that supports in turn the city as a road construction load carrier.</seg>
<seg id="23">The reconstruction can involve accordingly liability quarrels.</seg>
<seg id="24">Since both the wood removal and the turning in the current capacity stage functioned, one is not supposed to agree to the reconstruction of the level crossing, argued Haas.</seg>
<seg id="25">Also the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle standing on the crossing is clearly smaller at this place than at the other level crossings because the breakpoint middle to which a good line of sight connection exists is directly next to that.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even trains of the central station would have to be here at this place already so far slowed down that no collision threatens.</seg>
<seg id="27">Mainly the approval was refused the reconstruction of this level crossing since the city of Schiltach "would have to pay" for the problem with vehicles sitting up, according to the councils since the railways can withdraw from the responsibility on completion of the construction works.</seg>
<seg id="28">The committee considers the reconstructions as unproblematic at the level crossings "Before hay creek and "Before cow creek for which already crossing agreements with the railways were reached.</seg>

<seg id="2">Syria destroyed important facilities for the production from chemistry arms and Gitftgasmunition, declared for chemistry arms on Thursday the global supervision group while it was resulting in the north of the country in hard collisions near one of the locations at which probably poisonous substances are stored.</seg>
<seg id="3">Also on Thursday a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people have been killed since beginning of the civil war now already soon three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="4">The announcement of the organization for the prohibition of chemical arms (OPCW) came a day before the appointment at the</seg>
<seg id="5">1st November which the Damascus organization resident in The Hague had put from ammunition in order to destroy all facilities for the production of chemistry arms or to make „inoperable" including all machines for the mixing of chemicals to poisonous gas and the filling.</seg>
<seg id="6">The end of this process which represents the first stage of the destruction basically is an important milestone of an ambitious schedule which is aimed at the destruction of all chemistry arms of Syria until middle 2014.</seg>
<seg id="7">The destruction of the facilities means that Syria cannot produce any new chemistry arms anymore.</seg>
<seg id="8">Damascus must still begin, however, with destroying the available arms and inventory</seg>
<seg id="9">According to assumptions there are in the country about 1,000 tons at chemicals and arms which also mustard gas and the nerve gas Sarin number among.</seg>
<seg id="10">The announcement came at a time when on Thursday fights occurred in the city of Safira of the experts say that there is here a production equipment for chemistry arms as well as deposits as the Syrian observation place resident in Great Britain for human rights informed.</seg>
<seg id="11">The activist group which follows the number of the dead about a network of activists in Syria declared on Thursday 120,296 people died.</seg>

<seg id="19">The observation place said there were on Thursday losses on both pages did not name, however, any details.</seg>
<seg id="20">The fights underline the danger that the chemistry arm inspectors are misfired, because their mission for the liberation of Syria of his poisonous arm arsenal is a race against the time among a raging civil war.</seg>
<seg id="21">According to statement of the OPCW that cooperates with the United Nations closely the team is „now convinces, that it all named by Syria important Production- and seen Misch-/Befüllungseinrichtungen and has lived their destruction."</seg>

<seg id="23">At the beginning of the week the inspectors had declared they would have finished the first round of the inspections and visited 21 of 23 of the places declared by Damascus.</seg>
<seg id="24">Because of security objections the visit of two facilities was not possible, said the inspectors.</seg>
<seg id="25">On Thursday the OPWC declared, the two locations were „given up according to Syrian statement and the there available objects of the chemistry arm program were moved onto other mentioned facilities that were inspected."</seg>
<seg id="26">It was not immediately clear whether the place was one of the two facilities which the OPCW-inspectors could not visit in Safira.</seg>

<seg id="1">Coulson used Telefon-Hacking for the checking of a tip</seg>
<seg id="2">The former news of the Word-Herausgeber Andy Coulson employed supposedly „Telefon-Hacking, supervision and confrontation" during the attempt to confirm a wrong tip about an affair of the former Minister of the Interior Charles Clarke.</seg>
<seg id="3">Public prosecutor Andrew Edis QC declared the court in the Old Bailey a wrong rumor that Clarke would have a relation with his „attractive special adviser" Hannah Pawlby belonged to news of the World in such a way in May 2005.</seg>
<seg id="4">The newspaper charged the private detective Glenn Mulcaire to chop Pawlbys voice mail, and hunted, however Coulson also called her and left behind news as the court found out.</seg>
<seg id="5">„According to opinion of the prosecution Coulson that now Herausgeber is the NotW is not to catch anybody that stands before the apartment of people and hopes it on fresh action but one, the people's confronted with a history gladly in order to see their reaction" declared Edis.</seg>
<seg id="6">He said NotW uses three procedures in order to investigate histories investigativ: Telefon-Hacking, supervision and confrontation.</seg>
<seg id="7">The editor is participated in the third method personally.</seg>
<seg id="8">Obviously he knows about the second, the supervision, it cannot be different.</seg>
<seg id="9">How does it look with the first?</seg>
<seg id="10">He knows above the Telefon-Hacking Bescheid?</seg>
<seg id="11">He denies that, but we say: „And whether he knew about that."</seg>
<seg id="12">Rumors about an affair Clarkes were picked up first by the feature editorial staff from NotW when a source that was sexually interested at Pawlby was said to: „You" do not „waste your time, she is with Charles together."</seg>
<seg id="13">A volume with voice mail of their telephone of at least three reasons apartment was guaranteed in August 2006 in Mulcaires.</seg>
<seg id="14">The observers in addition found entries on the computer of the detective on whom Pawlby and their sister as „projects" were stored.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the time, when the investigations ran, the grandparents of Pawlby received anonymous calls in which they were asked for information about them, declared Edis.</seg>
<seg id="16">Meanwhile the former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and the former reporter James Weatherup supervised the supervision of the movements of Pawlby.</seg>

<seg id="1">Early puberty: Being arisen more quickly</seg>
<seg id="2">Afro-American and hispanische girls tendentially rather achieve the puberty as their white contemporaries as investigations show.</seg>
<seg id="3">Physical changes do not mean the puberty immediately yet</seg>
<seg id="4">There is not any proof of hormones or other chemicals being responsible</seg>
<seg id="5">Experts believe, the epidemic corpulence is a trigger of the early puberty</seg>
<seg id="6">The trend towards the early puberty is less marked with boys</seg>
<seg id="7">The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is one journalist, that specialized on child health and family topics.</seg>
<seg id="8">Should a mother be worried if from seven or eight years breasts and shame hairs increase to their daughter already in the age?</seg>
<seg id="9">Declared during the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics child specialist association this week in Orlando, Florida, the pediatric Endokrinologe Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, that these early physical changes are relatively normal among American girls and represented a new norm</seg>
<seg id="10">„I spend a lot of time with calming parents – usually is that no sign for the puberty setting in now quickly" explained Kaplowitz.</seg>
<seg id="11">Obvious advertisements of the development as for example wachsende breasts, shame and armpit hairs as well as body odor, are proved with girls formerly.</seg>
<seg id="12">Nevertheless it gave only a slight shift with the case of the age of the Menarche (Appearance of the first rule bleeding in the last 40 years.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the United States the average age at 12.5 years, a little little, lies as 12.75 in the year 1970.</seg>
<seg id="14">„If the development of the breasts begins, it lasts still at least two to three years up to the Menarche", said Kaplowitz, also author of the book „Morning puberty with girls: The essential mentor for the contact with this problem occurring frequently".</seg>
<seg id="15">During the most exact test is, as the puberty strides.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is controversial what in fact represents the beginning of the puberty, nevertheless it is valid „precociously" if the breast enlargement is accompanied from a growth push before an age of eight years.</seg>
<seg id="17">In most cases the process slows itself down or stagnates – something, that a child specialist can control exactly.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the case of faster striding tests could be indicated by an Endikronologen so that serious problems as tumors or cysts can be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="19">There are treatment methods to the delaying of an early menstruation and the defense of another consequence: to the early aging of the bones that can lead ultimativ to growth inhibition and in this way small body growth with adults.</seg>
<seg id="20">The recommendations for a medikamentöse or hormonal therapy base themselves on the age of the child, the development speed, the growth rate and the emotional maturity</seg>
<seg id="21">Psychosocial aspects are also important.</seg>
<seg id="22">Kaplowitz what concerns, but grants medicines is reserved: „The suppression of the puberty can moderate behavior problems to be different than their contemporaries and the feelings of girls."</seg>
<seg id="23">The other great problem is understandable: Parents would simply not like, that their very young daughters have the period.</seg>
<seg id="24">„You worry because of the pregnancy risk or about that as they handle the hygienic page said Kaplowitz.</seg>
<seg id="25">„A shock was", a woman whose daughter got their days with ten remembers.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even if there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation, it was not emotionally prepared.</seg>
<seg id="27">It came verängstigt and annoyed by the school home because she was the first in their circle of friends.</seg>
<seg id="28">There are many comprehensively published theories about the causes of early puberty.</seg>
<seg id="29">However, there are not any conclusive proofs of hormones in milk or other food, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media being causal.</seg>
<seg id="30">Boys come similar to girls into the puberty formerly.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kaplowitz thinks the most convincing premise is the epidemic of the corpulence.</seg>
<seg id="32">It supported the realization of a study in the age of six to nine years that makes a connection between body fat and the entry into the puberty per year in 2001 above girls.</seg>
<seg id="33">Other investigations support this conclusion, but there are many other factors which played a role.</seg>
<seg id="34">In this country Afro-American and hispanische girls tendentially rather achieve the puberty as their white contemporaries.</seg>
<seg id="35">There are for that different declarations</seg>
<seg id="36">Globally an early puberty seems from all possible things to be influenced, of economic conditions about the climate up to the genes.</seg>
<seg id="37">A further puzzle: Although the face and shame hairiness increases to boys already formerly, the trend towards a vollumfänglichen former puberty is not as marked as with girls.</seg>
<seg id="38">Other doctors on the AAP-conference underlined the complexity of the topic.</seg>
<seg id="39">The emergence of acne and shame hair is spread even with babies and small children.</seg>
<seg id="40">„We must be cautious as we identify the true beginning of the puberty", said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric Endokrinologe, at the Goryeb Children's hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.</seg>
<seg id="41">Parents should not hesitate with making oneself from their child specialist be advised as they should speak with their child.</seg>
<seg id="42">„That can mean, that one formerly than expected a conversation must lead, Kaplowitz guessed.</seg>
<seg id="43">If one remains quiet the child reacts usually well.</seg>
<seg id="44">Girls that early blossom need the insurance, that the process is a normal part of the life, self when it formerly than thought kicks in.</seg>

<seg id="3">For young people of today the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects, said pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in the conversation with the Evangelic News Service.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is attractive to be able to determine the work and day course itself.</seg>
<seg id="5">With Burfien the national church charged for the first time a pastor to inspire young people for the theology study on a full place.</seg>
<seg id="6">At the time of decide always less young people after the school-leaving examination, to study theology.</seg>
<seg id="7">Burfien puts this down to the process of the Entkirchlichung: "Gottes Stimme is quiet the world is loud".</seg>
<seg id="8">In this case the profession is shaped from great freedom and variety.</seg>
<seg id="9">I am a gentleman of my diary and can put my emphases, where it is important to me, there.</seg>

<seg id="2">Two YMCA-employees from New South Wales (NSW) were accused of Sexualdelikten in connection with children before 2011 reproaches were raised against the child nurse Jonathan Lord from Caringbah as the Royal commission heard from children for sexual abuse</seg>
<seg id="3">However with the case of the opening declaration in front of the commission the YMCA had declared one had never had to put in the organization from sexual child abuse with an incident.</seg>
<seg id="4">Manager Phillip Hare was questioned about a case in which a YMCA employee had been accused of offenses with child pornography and another, at which a sport teacher of the YMCA Caringbah Hall 1991 because of the abuse had been condemned it children's entrusted with.</seg>
<seg id="5">Hare said to Gail Furness, an attorney assisting the commission, that he knew about the first case, did not know the second, however.</seg>
<seg id="6">He added the opening declaration of the YMCA opposite the commission was also inaccurate in the claim „there were external inspections of the YMCA, in which the YMCA than at most front front with the case of the child security was acknowledged</seg>
<seg id="7">Proofs in front of the commission rather show that the YMCA was informed about that.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hare that began with 21 at the YMCA granted, the management failed „from me" of Lord „downwards" during the attitude and not guaranteed that employees realized their obligations to be reported violations of the guidelines for the child security</seg>
<seg id="9">Lord had been condemned at the beginning of the year because of Sexualvergehen at twelve boys during his two-year activity for the YMCA.</seg>
<seg id="10">He was condemned to at least six years of prison.</seg>
<seg id="11">Hare denied, however, that the YMCA would have a cultural problem which kept employees from that to announce lords violations with respect to the security of children.</seg>
<seg id="12">The employees stated they would have observed violations among other things, that Lord was alone with children, was in charge of it privately as sitters, made her be on his lap it told with regard to one that he has it dearly, and made play children with his mobile.</seg>
<seg id="13">Danielle Ockwell testified, that superior Lord was and that had asked for a training to the child protection because it was gotten because of his behavior, that the child service head Jacqui Barnat that in the YMCA Caringbah the superior was to lords „very intimidating and most time was very unapproachable".</seg>
<seg id="14">The manager declared their superiors it would not accept statements of employees according to which these would not have dared announcement refund.</seg>
<seg id="15">Instead of this, so he said, their friendship with lord rather influenced their discernment, for which they would not have announced it</seg>
<seg id="16">Hare declared it informed the executive board of the YMCA NSW of his opinion that the lesson that has to draw the organization from the „Jonathan lord incident not the reporting" through employees affects, and the executive board agreed to it</seg>
<seg id="17">Hare said the decision to push the employees from secrecy obligations for the signature shortly after appearance of the accusations was made by the manager of the child services of the YMCA, Liam Whitley.</seg>
<seg id="18">He said a Kontaminierung of the proofs should be prevented in this way, which, however, „übereifrig" and badly was transplanted.</seg>

<seg id="13">"There are residues of the roman city wall which was built in the second half of the first century according to Christ", tells Schulze.</seg>
<seg id="14">Before it goes again back onto the daylight, Schulze makes the participants on the upper park level fling another look into a shaft dark, 15 meters deep.</seg>
<seg id="15">That is the well of the old cathedral which is also hardly perceived unfortunately.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Prätorium is next station of the round, and here the participants climb again down into the depth.</seg>
<seg id="17">We experience the seat of the once most powerful man here north of the alps, the pregate of the CCAA.</seg>
<seg id="18">A visitor would like to know what means CCAA.</seg>
<seg id="19">"The abbreviation stands" for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium", what on good German" so much as "City of roman right and city the Agrippinenser, founded under emperors of Claudius at the place of the altar for the emperor cult means".</seg>
<seg id="20">And near the Prätorium it is a question of the former governor palace, the power center of the roman empire at the Rhine.</seg>
<seg id="21">From the vestibule of the exhibition a tunnel access leads to the roman sewer which is to receive length here on about 120 meters.</seg>
<seg id="22">"You can go along a piece quiet along the so-called Cloaca maximums if you want" Schulze muntert the guests on.</seg>
<seg id="23">Schulze still has a surprise.</seg>
<seg id="24">After his getting the key at the cash box, it leads the group to a shaft 16 meters deep, accessible.</seg>
<seg id="25">"We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath", it declares.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Jewish municipality built their bath deeply into the ground in order to come onto the groundwater that was indispensable for the ritual ablutions.</seg>
<seg id="27">Until today different water levels are ablesbar in the lower end of the Mikwe that origins decrease until the eighth century through changing turn-off levels of the Rhine.</seg>
<seg id="28">The Mikwe becomes part of an archeological zone on the city hall place for which the construction works shortly are supposed to begin.</seg>
<seg id="29">Up to the finishing still some years will go by, however.</seg>

<seg id="1">George Kerevan: The choice gives the Scots European deconcentration</seg>
<seg id="2">A new day, a new terror history for the independence.</seg>
<seg id="3">This time we are warned against an independent Scotland being necessary in order to join the Schengen-room as a condition for the EU membership</seg>
<seg id="4">That supplies the keyword for histories about passport checks into Berwick and a border safeguarded with barbed wire along the Hadrianswalls.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact the possible economical advantages which more travel freedom would bring in the remaining Europe with themselves were referred in the Strathclyde-presentation nevertheless this did not play any role – as expected – in the headlines.</seg>
<seg id="6">Also nobody mentioned that the EU member states bend their strict rules to themselves frequently if it is more favorable to them.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since Scotland does currently not belong to the Schengen-room the consecutive nonobservance would be only a small concession for Brussels in the corresponding train for what one really wants from the bulkheads.</seg>
<seg id="8">Therefore actually no story.</seg>
<seg id="9">And one, the already so in the years has come, that it resembles already a fossil: The first time I meant the „independence passport check" duck at least 40 years ago belongs.</seg>
<seg id="10">In this case an interesting point disappears during the constant repetition of this ancient history</seg>
<seg id="11">Why should one expect of an independent Scotland that it dances to the European whistle</seg>
<seg id="12">Why exchange the London yoke for that of Brussels, especially now?</seg>
<seg id="13">Those ones are the real European news: The plan great, understood after the war to the union of Europe came to a standstill.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the euro crisis the project Europe died officially.</seg>
<seg id="15">Everywhere in the EU parties at ground win which are EU enemy or would like to fling the euro overboard as community currency.</seg>
<seg id="16">Even in Germany the euro-sceptical party alternative could get just five million voices for Germany – set up only this year – during the Bundestag Federal Parliament choice in September for themselves and drive out in this way the Free democrats (the equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats) effectively of the Bundestag Federal Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="17">There was always domestic resistance to the plan to create a federalistic Europe.</seg>
<seg id="18">The current depression turns out, however, as a turning point point.</seg>
<seg id="19">Because of the severe saving-politics imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the straitjacket into which the respective national economy is forced by the adherence at the common currency many people think, the project Europe went too far.</seg>
<seg id="20">Little has to do the crisis of the euro with national governments causing excessive budget deficits – that was the case only in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="21">Instead of this the euro system tied down his members to exchange rates that are useful for German exporters – and German politicians would like to let that so gladly.</seg>
<seg id="22">Without the possibility of a devaluation of the local currency Southern Europe with a built-in productivity disadvantage opposite Germany recovers itself.</seg>
<seg id="23">The only possibility consists in abbreviating wages and public editions – encouraged by Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Behind the current budget and currency problems a deep lies going European productivity problem.</seg>
<seg id="25">As a consequence of the „green" energy guidelines prescribed by Brussels – a code for the subsidization of French and German energy enterprises at the expense of the consumers – the European industry pays compared with the United States the Double for electricity and the fourfold thing for gas.</seg>
<seg id="26">That is a paralyzing cost disadvantage how we could already look into Grangemouth.</seg>
<seg id="27">All wage celebration spellings of the world do not protect the European petrochemical industry against that, of cheap American slate gas to be pushed into the corner.</seg>
<seg id="28">When consequence works up a revolt, especially in France, the former Cheerleader of the EU.</seg>
<seg id="29">After the war the political elite of France saw the EU as a vehicle with which one could hold Germany in chess and lift that to Paris onto eye level with Washington.</seg>
<seg id="30">Nevertheless Berlin does not need Paris more than gate for the political legitimization and Europe pressed his own economic policy which the changed French economy has to fight with.</seg>
<seg id="31">The result: Marine Le Pens rightly directed, EU enemy front National won just a decisive by-election and referred in this way the ruling socialists to place three.</seg>
<seg id="32">The most popular party is to the front National now in France with 24 percent of the votes – a first-in first-out warning for the British Labour party, that it cannot come from that, a split in the right spectrum would mean advantages automatic for the left winger.</seg>
<seg id="33">What makes Le Pen with theirs for popularity wonly again among the white French of the working class?</seg>
<seg id="34">It would like to use the EU choices for that next year, one Anti-EU-, to forge anti-community currency block in the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="35">If the Anti-EU-Parteien come off at these choices well – and that is very well possible –, such a block could dominate the European Parliament for the first time then.</seg>
<seg id="36">This is the point onto which I want out: In future not far too far the wachsende resentment against the EU and the common currency will find itself for the abolition of the euro.</seg>
<seg id="37">The EU will not disappear, but she will rather become something as the „Europe of the (sovereign) nations" which favored general de Gaulle.</seg>
<seg id="38">Maybe Germany and a few of his satellite-economies hold on to the euro, but France and Southern Europe will return to their own currencies.</seg>
<seg id="39">I expect that Great Britain distanziert of this project in the hope to ingratiate oneself with the USA.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, Washington's increasing interest in the Pacific room advises that Great Britain will only stand in the Atlantic rain.</seg>
<seg id="41">Where does that have Scotland at all of them?</seg>
<seg id="42">We can decide, a region of to be (in last consequence) small England.</seg>
<seg id="43">Or we can defend our own economical interests – to which also it belongs to say Berlin and Brussels what they where can put.</seg>
<seg id="44">I presume Scotland could go in a looser European compound very well provided that we keep our own currency.</seg>
<seg id="45">The cooperation with countries other, thinking similarly is simpler in a Europe of the nations not föderierten.</seg>
<seg id="46">Otherwise we should consider, to match it to Norway and our economical independence kept.</seg>
<seg id="47">The SNP-government in Scotland is – bemerkenswerterweise – the most successful political movement against the saving-politics in Europe and gained in 2011 a spectacular majority due to the refusal of the shortenings suggested (and carried out) which the Labour Minister of Finance Alistair Darling and the following Tory-Lib Dem-Koalition had to account for.</seg>
<seg id="48">It would be ridiculous for Scotland to decide for an independence now only in order to get a saving-politics forcedly then from Berlin and Brussels.</seg>

<seg id="1">FAA: Passengers can use now electronic devices in airplanes (but no mobile conversations lead)</seg>
<seg id="2">Flight travellers can hear now of the takeoff up to the landing their electronic devices for the reading, works playing, music and the renown of films use, not phone, however, with the mobile, so the new guidelines that were handed over by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Thursday in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="3">Nevertheless the passengers should not expect that these changes are transformed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="4">How they were implemented quickly would depend on the respective airline, declared FAA-employee Michael Huerta on a press conference.</seg>
<seg id="5">The airlines must prove the FAA that airplanes correspond to the new guidelines and that they updated the training manuals of the flight personnel as well as the regulations for the stowage of the devices according to the new rules.</seg>
<seg id="6">The FAA declared, she received already from some airlines plans that would like to build up the use of portable electronic devices in airplanes.</seg>
<seg id="7">Also delta and JetBlue were among these airlines.</seg>
<seg id="8">„According to state of the plan we could very soon approve the extended use of electronic devices", announced the FAA in an announcement.</seg>
<seg id="9">Currently passengers must switch off smartphones, Tablets and other devices if the airplane doors are closed.</seg>
<seg id="10">You may not start it before then again if the airplane has reached a height of three kilometers and the captain gives green light.</seg>
<seg id="11">With the case of the entry into the landing the passengers must switch it off again and they must not start again before the airplane landed.</seg>
<seg id="12">To the new guidelines airlines whose airplanes are protected against electronic troubles could allow their passengers, the devices also at start, landing and the FAA declared to use on the landing field.</seg>
<seg id="13">Most new airliners and other airmen which were adapted by Wi-Fi for the use in bigger heights should fulfill the criteria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Laura Glading, president of the professional association of professional flight attendants, welcomed the changes.</seg>
<seg id="15">„If the new regulation is secure moved – and we cooperate concerning that with the airline closely –, both page of that, Glading commented on," profit.</seg>
<seg id="16">We are it honestly said, to have to feel us with the case of this topic as overseers.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless internet connections to the surf remained, the authority explained exchange of E-Mails, kept on being forbidden to plaintext messages or to download of data under three kilometers.</seg>
<seg id="18">Passengers are asked to move smartphones, Tablets and other devices into the flight mode.</seg>
<seg id="19">Therefore still no „Words With Friends", the online game resembling Scrabble that played the actor Alec Baldwin 2011 on his smartphone, than he public-effectively had to leave a jet of American Airlines because he refused to switch off the device while the airplane was being parked at the gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">And heavier devices as laptops must be packed also furthermore since an injury danger exists here if they fly through the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="21">Mobile conversations during the flight keep on being forbidden also furthermore.</seg>
<seg id="22">The regulation competence for telephone conversations is near the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not at the FAA.</seg>
<seg id="23">FAA cancels possibly prohibition for certain electronic devices with the case of start and landing</seg>
<seg id="24">Last month mark of Rosenker of the road safety authority National Transportation Safety Board said, security expert for national traffic questions on CBS news, mobiles would still be considered as a risk.</seg>
<seg id="25">„To Handy are real a problem, not only because they could cause troubles potentially near navigation devices, but because we of the FCC know that the transfer from the air can interrupt also transmission fattenings", according to Rosenker.</seg>
<seg id="26">A consultation committee of the branch which was started up by the FAA for the investigation of this topic recommended last month that the government allows a wider use of personal electronic devices.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the last years the pressure increased itself to the FAA, to loosen restrictions on the use.</seg>
<seg id="28">Critics as the democratic senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri represent the opinion there are not any valid safety reasons for the prohibition</seg>
<seg id="29">The restrictions are to be put through also increasingly more heavily because the use of the devices became omnipresent.</seg>
<seg id="30">In some studies it is talked about that, that forgets up to a third of the passengers the shutdown of the device or ignores.</seg>
<seg id="31">The FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic devices through flight travellers after reports about troubles of navigation and communication devices through VHF-radios carried along by passengers which then represented the newest technique trend had become known.</seg>
<seg id="32">New airplanes are by far more dependent on electric systems as former generations of aircraft, but they are also so constructed and approved by the FAA, that them electronic interferences nothing form.</seg>
<seg id="33">Airlines are offering passengers Wi-Fi already for some years if the altitude is reached.</seg>
<seg id="34">The airmen adapted onto Wi-Fi-systems are also more immune opposite interferences.</seg>
<seg id="35">The predominant majority of the passenger planes should be suitable for the stronger use of electronic devices to the new guidelines, said Huerta.</seg>
<seg id="36">The present electronic devices give in general considerably less radio radiation than former generations.</seg>
<seg id="37">E-Reader give for example only minimum radiation if one umblättert.</seg>
<seg id="38">However, in the case of the download or sending of data the transmission parameters are stronger.</seg>
<seg id="39">Amazon.com numbers among the advocates of a loosening of the restrictions on the device use through passengers.</seg>
<seg id="40">In 2011 company employees loaded a passenger plane fuller Kindle E-Reader and did a test flight in order to determine problems, could not arrest, however, any.</seg>
<seg id="41">Members of the FAA consultation committee expressed mixed feelings, which concerns to the risk during the use of devices.</seg>
<seg id="42">Douglas Kidd of the passenger association National Association of Airline Passengers said he thinks, the trouble through the devices is really even if the risk is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="43">Other committee members said there are only occasional reports by pilots who would speak for a trouble from airplane systems through the devices, and most of them are very old.</seg>
<seg id="44">The committee recommended the FAA, however, to allow pilots to order the shutdown of the devices in the case of instrument landing under bad view relations through the passengers.</seg>
<seg id="45">A grouping from the travel branch welcomed the changes and referred as a reasonable adaptation for travellers who would be endowed with technique today extensively.</seg>
<seg id="46">„We are pleased with the FAA recognizing that a pleasant passenger experience does not stand contrary to the security said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.</seg>

<seg id="1">Gechingen: No absolute protection possible</seg>
<seg id="2">"We want to bind the inhabitants early into the planning", mayor Jens Häußler started the civil information event for the flood control draft in Gechingen.</seg>
<seg id="3">About 80 participants had come into the municipality hall in order to make oneself explain the planned measures, to ask questions, to express objections and to bring in ideas.</seg>
<seg id="4">Häußler explained: The members of the district council make the final decisions.</seg>
<seg id="5">The high tide water, the Gechingen on 15th May 2009, in an unprepared way struck, a drastic event that raised the question about protective measures for the future was, according to Häußler.</seg>
<seg id="6">A river field investigation had been commissioned with the neighbor municipality Aidlingen which now is basis for the flood control draft in Gechingen.</seg>
<seg id="7">"The protection most possible many plots' built on is the objective so Häußler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Taken as a basis is the planning the protection from an aloud German meteorological service statistical all high tides waters to be expected 100 years.</seg>
<seg id="9">The climate change is taken to into account through a 15 per cent surcharge.</seg>
<seg id="10">In experts this with "HQ 100aKlima" is described.</seg>
<seg id="11">The water masses, that had led 2009 in Gechingen to considerable damages, corresponded to a 1000-year long high tide water.</seg>
<seg id="12">"There is not an absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement", so Häußler.</seg>
<seg id="13">In order to achieve the protection HQ 100aKlima, about four million euros at which the municipality can reckon country subsidies at the level of about 70 percent must be invested in Gechingen.</seg>
<seg id="14">Häußler referred, however, to there being only the promotion if an overall concept is transformed.</seg>
<seg id="15">For this purpose the municipality is dependent onto the collaboration of the citizens.</seg>
<seg id="16">An extensive planning and permission procedure must be completed.</seg>
<seg id="17">Most at best the conversion can be begun with in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="18">Among other things the protection concept sees, which was presented already in the last week in the district council (we told) local measures in the influx of the rivulet Irm from the Stammheimer valley in front of</seg>
<seg id="19">After the presentation of the flood control draft the participants took the opportunity for bringing in their requests.</seg>
<seg id="20">Among other things was questioned, why more dams and moving hold basins are not planned to the protection of the place.</seg>
<seg id="21">Gregory Kühn, compartment planner of the charged engineering office forest and Corbe from hill home that presented the draft stressed that it requires the co-ordination of all presented measures in order to reach the wanted objective in the sum.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition one is held to find the most economical solution, according to Joachim Wald of forest and Corbe.</seg>
<seg id="23">There was annoyance with adjoining owners of the old place who have to suffer from an overloading of the sewer network again and again even in the case of normal thunderstorm rain.</seg>
<seg id="24">The problem is known during the administration and first measures were already taken.</seg>
<seg id="25">Häußler referred, however, to the guidelines being others for channel systems than for the flood control and this must not be mixed.</seg>
<seg id="26">The municipality is obliged to lay out the sewer network so that rain events two to three year long could be verkraftet.</seg>

<seg id="1">The again designed Opschlag shines with a new Cafe.</seg>
<seg id="2">One that invites to the staying and returning.</seg>
<seg id="3">One which would like to turn the name into the program.</seg>
<seg id="4">One refers as Déjà Vu according to lexicon to a psychological phenomenon that the feeling is shown in by having experienced a new situation already once or seen.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the case of the visit of the café of the same name at the Opschlag in the district town Kleve within sight to the college Rhein-Waal it does not have to remain with the pure Déjà Vu-Gefühl.</seg>
<seg id="6">Finally the café with the beautiful name has exactly that to the objective to make an actual stay not only intellectual but solidly always recurringly erlebbar.</seg>
<seg id="7">Because it does now fun and simply beautiful is.</seg>
<seg id="8">A look into the inner life at the Opschlag 8 gives the observer immediately a good feeling.</seg>
<seg id="9">The café-ambience state-of-the-art, but not cool looks like a place for the feeling well.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here the team with the founders Mirjam van of the Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top spoils the guest with most different coffee or cocktail variants.</seg>
<seg id="11">For this purpose there are delicious cake or individually busy fresh French loaves.</seg>
<seg id="12">The holders both 33 years old, made already before the opening of the neat café at the Opschlag as gastronomes a name: In Kranenburg they led the "Art Lounge".</seg>
<seg id="13">The agreeable café-lovers expect more public from the move after Kleve onto the Opschlag.</seg>
<seg id="14">Last but not least also through the college</seg>
<seg id="15">"At what we do not have any certain target group" stress Daniel Büttner.</seg>
<seg id="16">Rather here young students would like to speak to the two just the same as seniors and all age groups between that.</seg>
<seg id="17">Apropos café-lover.</seg>
<seg id="18">The agreeable holder pair stands behind the coffee-pleasure</seg>
<seg id="19">Enjoy the smelling hot brew in the most different variations themselves.</seg>
<seg id="20">Expressofan</seg>
<seg id="21">The Expresso fan and Mirjam van of the Stelt is Daniel Büttner rather the cappuccino alcoholic.</seg>
<seg id="22">"For this purpose a French loaf - that is my thing, the NRZ betrays it".</seg>
<seg id="23">There were already two events in the bright café.</seg>
<seg id="24">Better said one.</seg>
<seg id="25">Because the harbor celebration occurred really rather outside - the café Déjà Vu did not profit by that.</seg>
<seg id="26">But there was also the Ringelnatzabend.</seg>
<seg id="27">The two 33-year long ones found, "beautiful, successful and witty".</seg>
<seg id="28">But now not Everyone's thing.</seg>
<seg id="29">Maybe Daniel Büttner is not also therefore an expressed fan of event-evenings: "One can do it really now not all right".</seg>
<seg id="30">And with an event I always speak only to the ones who are interested also in the specific event.</seg>
<seg id="31">Therefore events will rather be the exception with us.</seg>
<seg id="32">"We would like to interrupt the very normal company so little as possibly".</seg>

<seg id="1">Jumbo jet manufacturers argue in view of great orders about seat width</seg>
<seg id="2">Between leading airplane manufacturers it resulted in a quarrel over the width of seats in the tourist class with the case of long-distance flights what gives the clay to Dubai Airshow for a bitter collision on that one this month.</seg>
<seg id="3">The quarrel turns around the seat width that is offered to passengers in the case of long flights in the tourist class – not always those ones, airlines make an effort for those ones the most, however, this shown room puts SAS and Boeing Co the key from airbus for the efficiency claims at the newest airplanes. dar.</seg>
<seg id="4">Airbus required this week a branch standard, one seat-wide of at least 46 cm (18 customs) in the tourist class specifies, however, the US American ore rival Boeing says the airlines should decide on that.</seg>
<seg id="5">The quarrel comes to a time since the airplane cages compete for selling even greater versions of their zweimotorigen long stretch airmen and expect record tasks of the 17th to 21st November during the event.</seg>
<seg id="6">How the rear part of the airplane is built up – in particular whether there are rows with nine or ten seats – is decisive for the indicated economical results which the new „mini-jumbo jet design „is supposed to supply.</seg>
<seg id="7">Boeing says his modernized „777X" grabs 406 persons near seats in the tourist class that more than 17 customs are wide and allow so ten per row</seg>
<seg id="8">Airbus declares, the concurrent version of the A350 carries 350 persons in 18 customs wide seats in the tourist class with the case of which there are nine per row</seg>
<seg id="9">Airplane giants distribute frequently blows about technical details by means of advertising in the trade press.</seg>
<seg id="10">Now airbus appeals directly to the public before the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X with more than 100 orders will probably do the race.</seg>
<seg id="11">Recently the enterprise presented an advertisement which are the beginning of a new advertisement war can and financiers a picture showed, in which three persons are squashed in a restaurant, and for this purpose the title: „You would accept that"?</seg>
<seg id="12">„Boeing suggests long-distance flights in seats which are narrower than regional Turbo-Props", says airbus marketing leader John Leahy.</seg>
<seg id="13">Faced with changed feeding habits the people become fatter, however, airplane seats did not change radically.</seg>
<seg id="14">Between the early 1970ern, than the Boeing defined the modern long stretch journey in 747, and to the at the end of the century the weight of the masculine average American between 40 and 49 years increased around ten percent, so the data of the US Department of Health, Education and Welfare.</seg>
<seg id="15">The waist extent of the masculine average American in the 21st century is according to US American health statistics 100.8 cm.</seg>
<seg id="16">Airbus says his rival sticks to a seat draft from the 1950ern when the average body extent of the freshly christened „jet set" was narrower.</seg>
<seg id="17">One has carried on, so airbus, investigations, the busy ones, that one additional customs (2.54 cm) per seat increases the sleep quality around 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="18">Boeing denies the numbers of airbus to the seat measures and says, to decide in the discretion of the manufacturers how airlines arrange the balance between flight rates and equipment it does not stand.</seg>
<seg id="19">The enterprise also declares according to investigations the experience hangs in the airplane from more than the seat width.</seg>
<seg id="20">„It really comes to giving airlines flexibility so that they can do that what they according to their opinion must in order to be successful" the flight cabin expert Kent Craver of Boeing explains.</seg>
<seg id="21">You would not like, that we dictate to them what makes it profitable.</seg>
<seg id="22">You know their business better than anyone else does.</seg>
<seg id="23">For passengers it is a question of more elbow-room, but for manufacturers it becomes in increasing measure a topic which can affect the turnovers</seg>
<seg id="24">Behind the quarrel a race stands around airplane orders with an estimated volume of at least 700 billion United States dollars according to list prices in the coming decades, which could affect the export balance of the USA or Europe lastingly</seg>
<seg id="25">As Reuters in July for the first time reported, the seat layout is the floating strength behind the quarrel around the new jets.</seg>
<seg id="26">Both airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat with the case of their newest zweimotorigen long stretch designs as the market leader in this segment, the 365-sitzige of Boeing 77-300ER.</seg>
<seg id="27">The statements of Boeings for the results depend in part on the 777X being compared with their ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in that one in 777.</seg>
<seg id="28">The climbed costs per unit are still smaller than at currently used machines with ten seats per row</seg>
<seg id="29">„Boeing squashes therefore more seats into his airplane in order to turn it into our product more competitively", says Kevin Keniston, conductor for passenger comfort at the European airbus.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other hand analysts say full cabins with ten seats per row at available 777s indicated that many passengers decided for the narrower order, what could be accompanied by cheaper flight rates.</seg>
<seg id="31">„Eighteen customs seat width would be fabulous for passengers, however the reality is: from an economical point of view the airbus-offer headed" from the threat" "through the 777 of them", says Mary Kirby, expert for cabin equipment Gründerin and editor of Runway Girl Network.</seg>
<seg id="32">Airbus and Boeing do not offer any seats, but a catalog of subcontractors which the airlines can select from.</seg>
<seg id="33">The world-traveling jet sales assistants bear even measuring tape with themselves in order to measure the equipment with the case of the competition</seg>
<seg id="34">Even if they recommend the comfort nevertheless all manufacturers offer also jets with highly condensed arranging for cheap airlines and regional flights so.</seg>
<seg id="35">Airbus offers a A350 with zehnsitzigen rows did not sell, however, yet any according to own statement</seg>
<seg id="36">Until recently airbus showed how more adaptability of the cabins is importantly and wide seats demanded for some jets at the walks</seg>
<seg id="37">Without the support of the only other manufacturer of big modern jets experts say that the call after a new branch standard will presumably blow up, but could turn away from the wave from 777X-Verkäufen.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Veganismus is subordinated to the vegetarianism according to lexicons, distinguishes from this, however, nevertheless in very considerable way</seg>
<seg id="2">Because while vegetarians are allowing themselves the consumption of cream cake, ice or a strong Edam cheese, these Schlemmereien do not stand on the menu of a Veganers.</seg>
<seg id="3">Milk, the Veganer lets cheeses, egg, in addition to the renunciation of meat and fish of the all consumption of animal products off - also honey is denied.</seg>
<seg id="4">One likes to wonder what remains, however, in the case of nearer consideration the vegane feeding world is characterized by a considerable imaginativeness.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Spreads are very popular", declares Ute Henkelmann, the holder of the local health food store who prepares a great number of specific products for Veganer.</seg>
<seg id="6">Also Reuben Proctor goes to the shop in the cathedral lane gladly.</seg>
<seg id="7">For 13 years the native New Zealander is living vegan, in Lampertheim he finds (almost) all which he needs to the life. "In 1997 I changed my feeding and Vegetarier became".</seg>
<seg id="8">Around the turn of the century then the next step occurred and I became Veganer.</seg>
<seg id="9">"The conviction came, however, not only because of the feeding but due to the shoe choice", says Proctor who prefers imitation leathers to normal leather.</seg>
<seg id="10">He recognized that it works also in other everyday interests without animal products.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the first place is vegan be an ethic.</seg>
<seg id="12">"I do not want animals to have to die for me" expresses the maxim of the Veganer which applies to the entire consumer behavior Proctor.</seg>
<seg id="13">To mourn instead of Burgern, Rühreiern or rubber bears, the Veganer discovered quickly very new products that enthusiasm increased at.</seg>
<seg id="14">"It is a double bonus", says Proctor today, "in fact sets vegan be no renunciation no asceticism dar, but it is an enrichment". Proctor rather puts down the assumption that one reduces the selection with the feeding adaptation at food options to the power of the habit.</seg>
<seg id="15">And exactly these conditionings let also some still so well-meant attempt fail.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The addiction factor is a very decisive factor, which makes many be given up quickly, similarly as while smoking", Proctor sets up a comparison.</seg>
<seg id="17">And objects: "Certain tastes are not to be identified with the animal".</seg>
<seg id="18">Often it is the spices or the kind of the dressing which define the taste.</seg>
<seg id="19">"One can produce, however, the same effect also in another manner", the Veganer clarifies.</seg>
<seg id="20">For a barbecue Proctor brings along for example aubergines, champignons and also a few Veganwürste.</seg>
<seg id="21">It pays attention to a balanced, varied feeding with the case of which it is absolutely supposed to taste also once solid.</seg>
<seg id="22">Of course one would like to have something between the teeth, that is legitimate.</seg>
<seg id="23">"It is supposed to taste good, but that is not to reduce" only to animal food", according to Proctor.</seg>
<seg id="24">He did not suffer sanitary damages up to Essstörungen, a further widespread assumption</seg>
<seg id="25">For me the adaptation had a positive aspect.</seg>
<seg id="26">I do not incorporate any foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin part.</seg>
<seg id="27">There are high performance athletes who eat exclusively vegan.</seg>
<seg id="28">"My blood values are at best, I make myself be often checked", Proctor betrays.</seg>
<seg id="29">Many Vegansimus-critics warn in particular against the lack of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Since animals are fed with fodders instead of grazing on the pasture it is questionable whether in the meat which one buys in the freezer the vitamin-B12-part is high", thinks Proctor.</seg>
<seg id="31">For Veganer there is furthermore the possibility to take the co-enzyme in shape of trays to himself</seg>
<seg id="32">"My B12-values are in order", it declares.</seg>
<seg id="33">Widens ways must go Proctor for the food procurement not.</seg>
<seg id="34">Finally there are basic foods everywhere and every supermarket has in the meantime soya milk and other products.</seg>
<seg id="35">I find all which I need on site.</seg>
<seg id="36">Only now and then I buy something specific.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Many people overlook that only the finished products are expensive now, but so it also behaves near usual finished products as is generally known".</seg>
<seg id="38">Anyhow the dressing of veganer courts is by far more favorable and less time-consuming than gemeinhin accepted.</seg>
<seg id="39">"In the house kitchen it gives to discover a lot, with a few small tricks can one good if results not in part better achieve" Proctor says.</seg>
<seg id="40">Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbonic acid instead of egg, with his veganen cheesecakes could bring also his parents-in-law to Proctor to the astonishment.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Veganer gives a new spice to family celebrations.</seg>
<seg id="42">That has dynamics, if one cooks together, that has a new significance.</seg>
<seg id="43">"The situations which in this case can arise are as different as the people themselves" are, says Proctor.</seg>
<seg id="44">Of course skepticism was already evinced for it however.</seg>
<seg id="45">Does my food not like to you anymore?</seg>
<seg id="46">"I am supposed to feel now bad because I drink milk"? - with the case of such kinds of questions one must act as Veganer with intuition.</seg>
<seg id="47">"I do not refuse the people, I am a part of this society Proctor would not like to survive any enclave existence.</seg>
<seg id="48">And the everyday life world does not appear in a more exact way considered then at all as veganfremd as presumed - and the Veganer not restricted so in the everyday life as gemeinhin accepted.</seg>
<seg id="49">Also Fast Food is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="50">There are chips everywhere!</seg>
<seg id="51">"Many Dönerläden offer Falafel, or now a vegetarian Yufka", Proctor says.</seg>
<seg id="52">In a pizzeria he switches to paste courts or orders now a pizza without cheeses, everything a question of the habit.</seg>
<seg id="53">The restaurants appear so slowly on that.</seg>
<seg id="54">"When I 13 years ago started eating vegan, everything was still much more difficult", the New Zealander can make a development ausfindig: "One must talk to the people, make it attentive on that".</seg>
<seg id="55">"If sufficient demands come, they are inclined maybe in order to complement the menu" it hopes.</seg>
<seg id="56">Vegane restaurants develop, as for example the galley into Mannheim or the café Vogelfrei.</seg>
<seg id="57">Proctor cherishes the wish, that also other restaurants have stood at least a veganes court on the menu.</seg>
<seg id="58">Basically vegane courts are for all of them there.</seg>
<seg id="59">Everyone can eat it, they are therefore exactly the opposite of excluding.</seg>
<seg id="60">"On the other hand meat dishes are excluding, and indeed in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others" Proctor finds.</seg>
<seg id="61">"If one wants to avoid food scandals, Veganismus is then a secure way to make the biggest part from the beginning impossible", says Proctor.</seg>
<seg id="62">The purchase of veganer products can be, however, at the beginning a little difficult.</seg>
<seg id="63">Contain that also into peanuts, in particular when one learns to understand, animal additives as color donors his can, one seems the courage to leave with the compliance of the ethic near so many hurdles and traps quickly.</seg>
<seg id="64">Not only therefore Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen wrote a book: "Veganissimo - Animal contents materials and their alternatives" explains the many contents materials that Food- however also detergents are buried.</seg>
<seg id="65">"Little by little one develops a scanner look and white, to which signs and logos one has to pay attention It is" Proctor "to do small steps sometimes better than to conk out or to stumble," white.</seg>
<seg id="66">The Veganismus, he is an important moral hint that beats onto the consciousness.</seg>
<seg id="67">Maybe it does completely not manage that one puts aside his habits, however, at least it can teach the consumer to question his habits critically</seg>

<seg id="1">New anti-nicotine-vaccine could do the Garaus to the pleasure with the case of the smoking</seg>
<seg id="2">Scientists developed an anti-nicotine-vaccine which could spoil the fun at the smoking.</seg>
<seg id="3">A single dose of the vaccine could long protect mice against nicotine addiction a life.</seg>
<seg id="4">For tests at the human being even further attempts are needed which can last still some years, however, professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results are good.</seg>
<seg id="5">„We are very hopeful, that this kind can help millions of smokers that attempted to stop and in this case all methods available on the market tried out, but that had to experience that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches from vaccinating-strategy once", so Cornell.</seg>
<seg id="6">The new vaccine contains a harmless virus which was changed so that it contains the genetic information on the production of nicotine-antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="7">The virus infects selectively the liver cells which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="8">The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize it before they reach the brain through which a smoker does not find out any Nikotin-High.</seg>
<seg id="9">In attempts vaccinated mice to which nicotine was given retained their normal activity level.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mice without inoculation on the other hand would have taken a „time-out", declared the researchers, a sign, for the nicotine reaching their brain.</seg>
<seg id="11">The experiments are described in the technical journal Science Translational Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="12">Former tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="13">The inoculations had to be given for the maintaining of the antibody turn-off level so frequently that they were expensive and impractical.</seg>
<seg id="14">Nevertheless the costs of the new vaccine are probably clearly lower, because it changes liver cells into antibody factories.</seg>
<seg id="15">As professor Crystal said, a future vaccine could be given to children for people if it is sure before they were tempted to try a cigarette, and prevent so nicotine addiction</seg>
<seg id="16">It is more probable, however, that smokers would use it in order to stop.</seg>
<seg id="17">„You know then: If they resume smoke, they do not feel any pleasure anymore in this case because of the nicotine vaccine, and that helps them with putting aside the habit" it explains.</seg>
<seg id="18">British scientists said, the results are interesting, they warned, however, simultaneously, it even further research is necessary.</seg>

<seg id="4">With his inauguration in front of the uppermost constitution court Mursi became fifth head of state also to the first freely elected Islamic president of the Arabian world and Egypt since the fall of the monarchy about 60 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="5">He took the oath before the 18 judges of the court dressed in black robes, which has his seat at the Nile and an antiquated Egyptian nachempfunden temple is.</seg>
<seg id="6">„We move to a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic", said Mursi during the solemn ceremony which was transferred live in the state television.</seg>
<seg id="7">„Heute put the Egyptian nation the foundation for a new life –" the 60-year old Mursi, an engineer trained in the USA and member of the Muslim brotherhood, of a fundamentalist group that had been taken into the visor by the respective government since their foundation 84 years ago mostly as prohibited organization sharply said „absolute freedom, a real democracy and stability".</seg>

<seg id="9">Only a few hundreds of supporters had met before the court in order to cheer to the new president, and unlike the presidential splendor from the Mubarak-time the traffic was stopped only on a short-term basis so that the car convoy could cross the usually animated street that connects the city center with the southern suburbs.</seg>

<seg id="1">Statute labor animal Airlines raises fees for Handgepäck</seg>
<seg id="2">Statute labor animal Airlines intends to demand up to 100 United States dollars from passengers who would like to pack hand luggage on their flight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Statute labor animal Airlines intends, to charge hand luggage and 2 dollars a piece for up to 100 United States dollars for coffee or lemonade even if in the announcement on Wednesday was to read that passengers might keep the whole can.</seg>
<seg id="4">The new fee is valid for hand luggage in the luggage locker above the seat, small bags under the seat keep on being free.</seg>
<seg id="5">Statute labor animal declared one calculates 25 United States dollars if the fee in advance is paid and 100 United States dollars with travellers that paid first at the gate.</seg>
<seg id="6">Statute labor animal speaker cottage O'Malley said, the fee of 100 United States dollars is aimed at persuading travellers to see to the payment previously.</seg>
<seg id="7">„We would not like to calculate this sum", it declared.</seg>
<seg id="8">Airlines began in 2008 with demanding fees for the first and second piece of luggage given up.</seg>
<seg id="9">Passengers that attempted to go around these stuffed therefore so much as possibly into the hand luggage, which results in the consequence that the luggage lockers are frequently full above the seat.</seg>
<seg id="10">Fees are a possibility to convince passengers of that less to take Bord.</seg>
<seg id="11">O'Malley said with the case of the new fee it is really not a question of earning money.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is a question of the most loyal customers of statute labor animal to have expressed clearly that it becomes increasingly heavier to find place in the compartment above the seat.</seg>
<seg id="13">Passengers do not have to pay that buy your tickets on the web site of the airline.</seg>
<seg id="14">That means that a passenger may take along a piece of luggage freely from statute labor animal possibly at the gate, the next person, however, must pay 100 dollars for a comparable piece of luggage.</seg>
<seg id="15">O'Malley declared the web site of statute labor animal and the Check-in-Verfahren would be changed so that the passengers are informed of the fee before they would come to the gate.</seg>
<seg id="16">The new hand luggage fee of statute labor animal does not come into force before in the summer, there is not an exact date yet.</seg>
<seg id="17">Passengers swear frequently about baggage surcharges and other fees however, airlines fall back gladly to that.</seg>
<seg id="18">You argue, that the transportation of the baggage costs money and passengers should pay this service if they wanted it</seg>
<seg id="19">Many at the rampart Street consider the new baggage fees as signs for the airlines taking enough money in order to cover the costs of air trips after years of the losses.</seg>
<seg id="20">Most let up to now the fingers of fees however, for Handgepäck.</seg>
<seg id="21">Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded three years ago as First Fees for hand luggage and later Allegiant Air, also a cheap airman followed.</seg>
<seg id="22">The single other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, declared the Airline-Berater Jay Sorensen who pursues the addition fees attentively.</seg>
<seg id="23">He reckoned in a report by December 2011 that the hand luggage fee Spirit is 50 million United States dollars worth annually.</seg>
<seg id="24">Sorensen that formerly held a leadership position with Midwest Airlines flew recent with Spirit and was curious, what it at the gate would expect, if passengers were confronted with the unusual hand luggage fee of the enterprise.</seg>
<seg id="25">„The Boarding-process belonged to the smoothest which I experienced in my career in the aviation", he said.</seg>
<seg id="26">I expected to see tooth crunching and obvious discussions at the gate.</seg>
<seg id="27">„The airplane was full", it declared, „and the Boarding ran as lubricated."</seg>
<seg id="28">Statute labor animal follows Spirit also at the 2 dollars which are demanded for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.</seg>
<seg id="29">The enterprise declared that passengers who bought lemonade or juice might keep the whole can and coffee is refilled gratis.</seg>
<seg id="30">Water keeps on being free.</seg>
<seg id="31">US Airways had attempted in 2008 on a short-term basis to demand money for soft drinks, this made however, seven months later again declining, after passengers had complained and had tightened no other large society</seg>
<seg id="32">Statute labor animal's step, to raise fees for the hand luggage if passengers do not buy directly near the airline is the recent initiative with which customers are supposed to be directed to the own web site.</seg>
<seg id="33">Airlines pay online travel agencies as Orbitz 10 to 25 United States dollar per sold ticket.</seg>
<seg id="34">That provides all societies with a stimulus, to convince passengers of the direct purchase with them instead of above an online travel agency.</seg>
<seg id="35">Statute labor animal is widest in this field however, gone.</seg>
<seg id="36">In September the enterprise began with assigning so much Vielfliegermeilen in the case of booking about an online travel agency only still half.</seg>
<seg id="37">On Wednesday the miles were shortened once again on 25 percent of the flight stretch</seg>
<seg id="38">An air trip booked with a third provider with statute labor animal above 1000 miles is only another 250 miles to customers worth therefore.</seg>
<seg id="39">Passengers can reserve also exclusively places during the direct purchase on the web site of statute labor animal.</seg>
<seg id="40">Statute labor animal has a loyal clientele at his seat in Denver, nevertheless the business shrinks and the enterprise loses money.</seg>
<seg id="41">The proceeds decreased about 9 percent and the flight capacity shrank just 13 percent in the first quarter as in the financial statement is to read that on Wednesday of the mother company group, Republic Airways holding companies Inc was published..</seg>
<seg id="42">Republic attempted to get the finances of statute labor animal into the grip within the framework of the sale of the society</seg>

<seg id="1">John Kerry declares in an unprecedented admission the US espionage went inappropriately too far</seg>
<seg id="2">A softening of the defensive attitude of the USA with respect to their monitoring programs programs pointed out to John Kerry with an unexpected admission when he said, the espionage went in certain cases inappropriately too far.</seg>
<seg id="3">The foreign minister of State in addition admitted it would bear together with Barack Obama the responsibility for one switching to „autopilot" when the explosive disclosures of the Whistleblowers Edward Snowden became public about the espionage activities of the NSA.</seg>
<seg id="4">Through the seeped information the US government is into a diplomatic storm of the indignation vonseiten their ally guessed.</seg>
<seg id="5">With the case of a speech transmitted by video connection on the Open Government-Konferenz in London Kerry said: „Completely without question the president and I as well as others in the government heard about some things that ran as it were by autopilot simple because the ability for this purpose existed, what still onto the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War as well as natural on the 11th September goes back."</seg>
<seg id="6">Afterwards he admitted as a first hochrangiges member of the US American government that the US espionage crossed a border it also stressed, however, that no rights were misused.</seg>
<seg id="7">He said: „In some cases that went inappropriately too far."</seg>
<seg id="8">The president is decided to create clearness and carries out therefore a thorough investigation so that nobody has to have the feeling here abuse occurs.</seg>
<seg id="9">I assure you that the rights of innocent persons are not influenced in this process</seg>
<seg id="10">Kerry insisted, however, on the NSA being a strength of the good one and many lives being saved by their monitoring processes.</seg>
<seg id="11">He added: „We have to do it with a new world in which people are ready to blow oneself up."</seg>
<seg id="12">It gives blowing up a radical extremism in the world to which on that it is crazy to kill people and attacking governments.</seg>
<seg id="13">What would that be to be caught therefore if one was in the situation and stopped before it happens?</seg>
<seg id="14">We prevented in fact aircraft crashes assaults on buildings and the assassination from people because we heard about such plans previously.</seg>
<seg id="15">Meanwhile US American legislators around which objection declared against the alleged American espionage to scatter and to convince the Europeans of the necessity to keep on cooperating with the USA at the anti-terror efforts as the chairperson of the senate sub-committee for European matters on Thursday will travel to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="16">Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut did not tell about the supervision anymore it spoke this week with representatives of the European Parliament and other persons and is worried because of their threats due to the frustration through the National Security Agency at anti-terror organizations involve.</seg>
<seg id="17">„It is very important for the national security interests of the USA, that the Europeans with regard to our common efforts against the terrorism with stay on board", declared Murphy that is as a democrat for the first time in the senate and is active for non-resident relationships and European matters as a chairperson of the senate sub-committee in an interview in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="18">In addition I go to Europe in order to explain there that we keep on having to cooperate in the terror abatement despite their trouble at the NSA-programs.</seg>
<seg id="19">Media reports according to which the NSA entered millions of telephone data in Europe have to unite the relationships US allies loads, although the conductor of the secret service declared this week, the reports are incorrect and were based on a misunderstanding of the metadatas that were collected by Nato allies and exchanged with the United States.</seg>
<seg id="20">Other disclosures summoned from documents passed on by Snowden after which the NSA controlled the mobile worldwide of Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 more heads of state.</seg>
<seg id="21">The conductor of the national secret services, James Clapper, defended the espionage with allies as necessary and declared this is usual on both pages</seg>
<seg id="22">In all the tumult Murphy said his authority prepares the journey of the congress which is supposed to occur this year, and hoped, the delegation will contain members from both parties and chambers.</seg>
<seg id="23">The names of the other participating representatives are supposed to be published in the coming days.</seg>
<seg id="24">He said, that exact itinerary is still elaborated.</seg>
<seg id="25">While Murphy was stressing the purpose of the journey is the improvement of the relationships, it spoke also of there being some „serious words".</seg>
<seg id="26">He said the European governments would have to be honest opposite their population about the kind of espionage programs which they used even for years.</seg>
<seg id="27">„Indeed we can change our monitoring programs programs and so the rights of the Europeans protect better, these must come also with the fact that we are not the only ones that spies to terms, however," so Murphy.</seg>
<seg id="28">Meanwhile a journey into the Near East and to poles waits for John Kerry at the weekend in order to deal with the grudge there about the US American strategy into Syria, Egypt and Iran as well as the US American supervision activities.</seg>

<seg id="2">The billionaire and representative Clive Palmer says prime minister Tony Abbott would stand in an interest conflict with the case of his plans to the parent vacation because his daughters become pregnant and could profit by that therefore.</seg>
<seg id="3">The mining industry tycoon who is in a judicial quarrel about the payment of 6 million dollars onto CO2 steering wheels made the claim when he wanted to wipe questions whether it would be in a conflict from the table.</seg>

<seg id="1">Esa decides on great space missions: Missions for billions</seg>
<seg id="2">Far planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts of the European space travel agency must agree now on two large projects which want to start it in the next years.</seg>
<seg id="3">30 proposals were selectable, five are still in the running.</seg>
<seg id="4">Far worlds.</seg>
<seg id="5">Astronomers already found more than 1000 planets at other stars.</seg>
<seg id="6">No one knows whether at least there are lives on some of them.</seg>
<seg id="7">The selection is difficult: Is one supposed to search for gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="8">Or investigating the origin of the cosmos more gladly?</seg>
<seg id="9">Or searching for earth-similar planets and discovering maybe extraterrestrial life in this way?</seg>
<seg id="10">These questions are just asked to the European space travel agency Esa the persons responsible in charge.</seg>
<seg id="11">For their program "Cosmic Vision" they search ideas for two great space travel projects which are supposed to voranbringen the research decisively.</seg>
<seg id="12">The budget for such "l-missions" is in each case about instance near a billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="13">The start will be 2028 and 2034 probable.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the beginning of September the elite of the European astrionics met in Paris, around proposals for such missions to discuss.</seg>
<seg id="15">30 ideas were under discussion, five of them were short-listed now.</seg>
<seg id="16">Numerous committees examine the proposals haken with the researchers after.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the next days a final decision is supposed to fall through the scientific program committee.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Esa onto which the missions of the program "Cosmic Vision" initiated in 2007 are supposed to find Answers selected in total four great questions.</seg>
<seg id="19">What are the conditions for the origin of planets and lives?</seg>
<seg id="20">The exact processes during the formation of stars from big gas clouds - and in this way also the origin of planets that circle these stars - lie still in the proverbial darkening.</seg>
<seg id="21">A big infrared telescope in the space could penetrate this darkness.</seg>
<seg id="22">And if a star has planets, under which circumstances life can arise there?</seg>
<seg id="23">In order to follow this question, the space telescope "Cheops" with which 500 already known planetary systems are examined in our nearer surroundings in a more exact way is supposed to start in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="24">The possibilities are, however, restricted, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="25">With bigger instruments the astronomers could show earth-similar planets and analyze them even the composition of their atmospheres and search them so according to "Biomarkern": To gases which are valid as an index for biological activity.</seg>
<seg id="26">How does the solar system function?</seg>
<seg id="27">Also this question is supposed to give ultimately information about which conditions there are for the origin of lives.</seg>
<seg id="28">An important role plays the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of his magnetic field as well as the particle radiation going out of it with the planetary system.</seg>
<seg id="29">In our solar system these processes can be examined exemplarily.</seg>
<seg id="30">With the "Solar Orbiter" the Esa granted already a mission of the M-class (there the budget is near about instance half a billion of euros) for this question.</seg>
<seg id="31">The probe is supposed to start in 2017 and observe surface and activity of the sun exactly.</seg>
<seg id="32">From great interest in the researchers also Jupiter and his moons are.</seg>
<seg id="33">You want to find out which role the giant planet played during the development of the solar system.</seg>
<seg id="34">For that the Esa plans the first of the in total three L-missions of the "Cosmic vision"-program.</seg>
<seg id="35">The probe "Juice" (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) probably begins their journey in 2022.</seg>
<seg id="36">Eight years later it reaches Jupiter and is supposed to examine the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy moons Europe, Kallisto and Ganymed.</seg>
<seg id="37">What are the basic physical laws of the universe?</seg>
<seg id="38">The cosmos offers many possibilities, matter to study under extreme conditions and to examine so, whether the natural laws, known to us, are still valid there.</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe also deviations which could show the way for a new theory under whose roof all known natural laws can be united to the physicists are found.</seg>
<seg id="40">How did the universe arise and of what does it consist</seg>
<seg id="41">Before 13.7 billion years our cosmos arose through the Urknall.</seg>
<seg id="42">Next to the matter, us common, from the stars, planets and living beings how we withstand, there are Dark matter whose force of gravity galaxies and galaxy heaps hold together, and Dark Energy, the expansion of the cosmos at an accelerated rate through their work.</seg>
<seg id="43">Neither up to now the researchers do not know yet which physical laws were valid in the first fractions of a second of the Urknalls from which withstand Dark Matter and Dark Energy.</seg>
<seg id="44">With "Euclid" the Esa granted also here already a M-mission whose start is planned for 2020.</seg>
<seg id="45">With a specific telescope the distribution of the matter is supposed to examine the probe for the first time in the universe at the entire sky and facilitate so inferences onto the state of Dark Matter and Dark Energy.</seg>
<seg id="46">Who could do the race</seg>
<seg id="47">From the 30 proposals only two will remain at the end of the selection method.</seg>
<seg id="48">"E-Lisa", a pretentious draft has the best chances on an approval as a L-mission in opinion of many experts as proof of gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="49">Physicists mean changes in the structure of the room time by that, the Albert Einstein almost 100 years ago had predicted.</seg>
<seg id="50">They were not proved until today.</seg>
<seg id="51">Elisa could create that, the scientists hope behind the project.</seg>
<seg id="52">The mission plans a detector consisting of two or three probes which is stationed in the space.</seg>
<seg id="53">It could prove unlike installations on the earth also gravitational waves which arose with the case of the Urknall, and supply so new findings about the origin of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="54">Four more proposals still compete for the second L-mission: a big X-ray telescope by the name of "Athena" that is supposed to explore among other things black holes, "Icy Planets", a further mission to the external planets of the solar system, "Prism", a mission for the measurement of the cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder" that earth-similar planets trace and that is supposed to examine.</seg>
<seg id="55">Already proposals for the test return transport of the Mars, for the exploration, dropped out among other things of moon, Venus and asteroids as well as for the sun physics.</seg>

<seg id="5">The tunnel had not been taken according to the information in use yet.</seg>
<seg id="6">"These cartels are stupid if they think they could "durchgraben" under the radar" the general state attorney of the US district Southern California, Laura Duffy said, at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego, where the one end of the tunnel had been discovered.</seg>
<seg id="7">Turned onto the drug gangs Duffy insured: "If your wide builds such tunnels and attempts to use it, we are decided to turn that into a gigantic waste of your dirty money".</seg>
<seg id="8">Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a continuous-fight against the drug cartels.</seg>

<seg id="5">„They can keep the predominant majority of the citizens who have a functioning health insurance", he said with the case of a speech in Boston.</seg>
<seg id="6">As reaction to the numerous media reports for the notices Obama asked those Americans who received such communications to look for a new insurance on the free market.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most citizens can such a better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or more favorably than predicts receive.</seg>
<seg id="8">„You come a better offer", he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government referred to it as little surprising, that the five percent of the population that finished even an insurance according to another rate would have to look around, since their contract does not correspond to the new standards to the Affordable Care Act.</seg>

<seg id="1">Parents of intersexual children can choose „Sex indefinitely"</seg>
<seg id="2">Germany is the first European nation in which a third sex is acknowledged for children who were born with genitals not unequivocal</seg>
<seg id="3">More is not assigned to newborns inflexibly manly or in a feminine way.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to the new law parents do not have to explain any sex more for such children, but can indicate „indefinite" or „not defined" on the birth certificate.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is an objective of the law to take the pressure of parents so that they do not have to make any rash decisions with respect to operations for a sex assignment with newborns, and to combat the discrimination of intersexual people.</seg>
<seg id="6">An intersexual person said years later according to BBC: „I am not either Mann or woman."</seg>
<seg id="7">I remain the patchwork which was created by doctors, mutilated and full scars.</seg>
<seg id="8">Approximately one thing does not come from 2,000 children to the world every year either as a boy or as girls.</seg>
<seg id="9">You belong to the intersexual ones, a group that falls under the diagnosis „Sexualdifferenzierungsstörung" (DSD) a comprehensive term term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (Eierstöcken or testicles) or unusually genitals developed.</seg>
<seg id="10">Wallis Simpson was possibly intersexual.</seg>
<seg id="11">The sense of the sex identification is not yet very well developed, nevertheless most experts recommend that in the USA, one is supposed to use the best available information to the sex assignment if a definition is not possible, and wait not for the psychological and physical development of the child, before one decides – when anyway – for an operation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The New York psychiatrists' Dr. Jack Drescher who specialized on the problems natures of the sex identification said the new German law „rings to a good thing".</seg>
<seg id="13">Intersexual Children represent an ethical dilemma.</seg>
<seg id="14">„Some people have life-alarming illnesses which require a surgical intervention, however, that is not valid for most children", he said.</seg>
<seg id="15">One can carry out a sex assignment without operation and wait for it then, as the identity develops.</seg>
<seg id="16">The scientific data above how a child develops anyway his sexual identity are not very exactly.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nobody knows why it happens.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is as the secret why people are homosexual.</seg>
<seg id="19">In a report onto the European commission from the year 2011 is called it, intersexual people are of transsexual or to distinguish Transgender persons, because their status is not sex-gotten, but necessitated by their biological constitution that neither is not feminine manly yet exclusively, but typically both simultaneously or not defined as one thing by that clearly.</seg>
<seg id="20">These properties were proved in lower-level sexual characteristics as muscle measures, hairiness, breasts and stature, major sexual characteristics as reproductive organs and genitals or in chromosome structures and hormones.</seg>
<seg id="21">The report gives also an overview of the discrimination, that intersexual and see Transgender persons abandoned in the professional life as well as about the extent of molestation, power and prejudice criminality.</seg>
<seg id="22">Boys agreeing not with the sex picture have a specific camp now.</seg>
<seg id="23">Meanwhile it is possible in Australia and Nepal for adults, on official documents masculine, feminine or to declare „third sex".</seg>
<seg id="24">In June Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as worldwide a first „sexless" person after a court had granted the lifelong retention of a sex status „not defined".</seg>
<seg id="25">German identity cards have a third assignment, X for intersexual in the future next to M and W, according to the Ministry of the Interior Office.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the adjacent France sex topics are still controversial, such a notification of message on France 24.</seg>
<seg id="27">In 2011 French representatives of the severely Catholic country signed dozens a petition, that the „sex theory" is supposed to be removed from school books.</seg>
<seg id="28">The US American web site Catholic Online spoke out also against the German law, with the reason: „If the world is dragged into a new state, where the sex represents a decision, sexual activity, however, not, then we twist two more columns of the civilization."</seg>
<seg id="29">The mother of a newborn from Maryland declared opposite baby zone she would find it better if a sex is assigned to babies at the birth.</seg>
<seg id="30">„The parent existence is already stressful enough also without further restrictions especially if one" does not „know" the sex of the own child, she said to the parent web site.</seg>
<seg id="31">Children need stability and security</seg>
<seg id="32">Children were seen historical to, that both with masculine as also feminine genitals were given birth, than described to hermaphrodites, after the attractive Greek God that had both sexes.</seg>
<seg id="33">Still ten years ago the medicine considered the sex as something which one can wipe out and establish again then.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nevertheless meanwhile the ethical basics of an operation are doubted after now known is, how the sexual identity is in a complex way, and that doctors can be also wrong because they do not know how the child feels while growing up with the sex assigned by them.</seg>
<seg id="35">„In the middle of the 20th century one mentioned that a ,psychiatrischen emergency" Drescher said.</seg>
<seg id="36">If such a child was born, one called not the psychiatrist, but the surgeon then.</seg>
<seg id="37">The prevailing theory about the treatment of children with genitals not unequivocal goes back to Dr. John Money from the Johns Hopkins University who represented the opinion the sex is plastic.</seg>
<seg id="38">It shaped the concept „sexual identity" and argued, social and environment-conditional impulses – as the parents bring up a child – interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and shaped so, whether a person considers herself as masculine or feminine.</seg>
<seg id="39">However in a case become known under the title „John/Joan" from the year 1966 his theories became controversial.</seg>
<seg id="40">He recommended the parents of a boy whose penis had been separated at a bungled curtailment completely to castrate the child and to remove also his testicles and to raise him then as a girl.</seg>
<seg id="41">„Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation, which he, however, was" not, according to Drescher.</seg>
<seg id="42">As the boy about 15 was, it returned to the masculine sex and a woman got married.</seg>
<seg id="43">With 38, however, he committed suicide.</seg>
<seg id="44">According to Drescher there are still doctors who would practise this model.</seg>
<seg id="45">However in the 1990th years, with the entry of the Internet, survivors of these sex operations stepped onto the public that is not „happy with the result".</seg>
<seg id="46">So about instance with Jim Bruce, a 36 years old author from Montana that was born with XY-masculine chromosomes, however, ambiguous genitals.</seg>
<seg id="47">The doctors were not clear about that, whether he had a big clitoris or a small penis and were convinced, it can never lead a „satisfactory living" as a man.</seg>
<seg id="48">Therefore his external organ and the testicles shortly after the birth 1976 were removed surgically and he was raised as a girl.</seg>
<seg id="49">In the age of 12 he received feminine hormones.</seg>
<seg id="50">„I knew that I am not a girl", it declared opposite ABCNews.com</seg>
<seg id="51">I was unhappy, but it was really heavy to ask questions.</seg>
<seg id="52">In the age of 18 he should receive a vaginal plastic</seg>
<seg id="53">Nevertheless since it was depressive and knew, that something was not right, it demanded his medical files.</seg>
<seg id="54">What he found out was shocking.</seg>
<seg id="55">I was sterilized at my birth – and no one ever said that to me.</seg>
<seg id="56">Bruce was born with a DSD through which his body could not produce enough testosterone for the development of the genitals.</seg>
<seg id="57">After his having found out the truth, he changed again for the masculine identity, received testosterone injections and made remove his breasts.</seg>
<seg id="58">Through the operation he became infertile.</seg>
<seg id="59">Today he fights for others in an organization by the name of interface Project for intersexual people as normal being perceived.</seg>
<seg id="60">However Anne Tamar-Mattis, manageress of the right group of Advocates for Informed Choice resident in californiums, worries, that the German law to the stamping and Stigmatisieren can encourage.</seg>
<seg id="61">„Many activists are worried, that the German decision could encourage parents, to assign" fast decisions to hit and the child a ,nicht defined‘, she declared.</seg>
<seg id="62">We fear that favors interventions.</seg>
<seg id="63">We think it would be better the masculine or feminine sex to assign and to wait then.</seg>
<seg id="64">However nor we do not know how the law will affect, therefore we can only speculate.</seg>
<seg id="65">Tamar-Mattis said their organization supports the Australian law, because „it makes the recognition for adults possible as a third sex".</seg>
<seg id="66">„Adults should be in the situation to make own decisions on their legal sex", it declared.</seg>
<seg id="67">With the case of the German law it is a question of the assignment at the birth.</seg>
<seg id="68">That is not a fight which one should force small children to this time to.</seg>
<seg id="69">If they are grown-up, they themselves can decide on their body.</seg>
<seg id="70">However, Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast radiologist from Pittsburg who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation trouble and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group says the German law „authorizes" both parents and children.</seg>
<seg id="71">Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with masculine chromosomes, a DSD has, however, by the name of complete androgen resistance.</seg>
<seg id="72">Because of the receptor defect of the target cells for Testosteron Katie developed feminine characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="73">It has a vagina, however no uterus and no ovaries.</seg>
<seg id="74">Today Katie 29 is and marries; she works on the University of Pennsylvania as an employee in the child psychiatry.</seg>
<seg id="75">Indeed it is infertile, hopes, however, for being able to get a child through adoption or a lending-mother.</seg>
<seg id="76">„The law gives parents to room through which she does not rush decisions must hit", Baratz said.</seg>
<seg id="77">It provides them with the time, to do different tests and to clear things and time gives so to them before they „manly" or „in a feminine way" write.</seg>
<seg id="78">In this way everything is all right – one raises the child and loves it.</seg>
<seg id="79">One has a wonderful baby and enjoys the parent luck.</seg>
<seg id="80">And one does not have to carry out rashly an operation which cannot be canceled anymore.</seg>
<seg id="81">„That closes the children into the decision with one and removes the fear that drives parents because they think they would not „do" the correct thing" explained it.</seg>
<seg id="82">Finally the child decides on the sex that co-ordinates to it better – and that is wonderful.</seg>
<seg id="83">Through that children are moved into the situation to make the decision itself.</seg>

<seg id="1">Excellent the fight mastered</seg>
<seg id="2">The role of the Santiago, the old man in Hemingways novelette "The old man and the sea", is cut to Horst Janson onto the body.</seg>
<seg id="3">Janson is even an old hare in his profession, the dramatic art.</seg>
<seg id="4">The old man Santiago cannot fool to any during the fishing.</seg>
<seg id="5">So the two of them complement themselves simply splendidly.</seg>
<seg id="6">One almost thinks to be able to see the wrinkles in the nape of the old man which the Fisherman-Young Manolo speaks of.</seg>
<seg id="7">If Santiago in a tired way of the life fits bently on the chair, that is really at Janson.</seg>
<seg id="8">Next to that the role of the old fisherman through and through is a character role which Janson masters excellently.</seg>
<seg id="9">Hemingway told the history of a fighter, a courageous man who does not give up and finally gains the fight through his knowledge and also his will strength against the fish.</seg>
<seg id="10">Janson is in wide stretches as alone actors on the stage.</seg>
<seg id="11">It manages to focus the attention of the public on himself so that his monologs are no moment boring.</seg>
<seg id="12">His efforts, to grow the fish at last onto the surface of the water, are so really that the spectators forget that nevertheless the sea consists only of blue illuminated water bottles.</seg>
<seg id="13">Director Jens Hasselmann makes the old man in the boat before the fishing village act.</seg>
<seg id="14">During the performance he puts the in each case active scene in the light: The hut of Santiago, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Gunst, that with theirs songs' and their marvellous voice's the joy of living of Cuba records.</seg>

<seg id="1">Fancy for ice cream which shines in the dark?</seg>
<seg id="2">A British entrepreneur developed the first in the dark bright ice – with the aid of jellyfishes.</seg>
<seg id="3">Charlie Francis made the fluorescent properties of the sea animals zunutze and a radiant titbit created from that.</seg>
<seg id="4">The idea on that came to him after he had read a study work about jellyfishes and could convince Chinese scientists to make the radiant protein artificially</seg>
<seg id="5">The ice cream reacts with the case of the consumption with the tongue by which the pH-value is raised in the protein and the brightness activated.</seg>
<seg id="6">Chris declares, the ice cream reacts to the heat in the mouth and that shines – more each therefore one licks the brighter it becomes.</seg>
<seg id="7">Charlie, founder of the ice cream company „Lick Me I'm Delicious", says: „The product is incredible, however still in a very early production phase, and so one gets two grams of that for 200 pounds."</seg>
<seg id="8">The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue with the case of a neutral pH-value.</seg>
<seg id="9">If the mouth warms up the protein, the pH-value increases and the ice shines.</seg>
<seg id="10">We tested it in the last months and it seemed ideal to us to launch it at Halloween because it has this wonderful shining-effect.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is probably the most expensive ice cream which I ever manufactured, because the jellyfish phosphor is four times more expensive than gold is.</seg>
<seg id="12">Every ball costs me about 140 pounds.</seg>
<seg id="13">But for that it tastes delicious.</seg>
<seg id="14">Charlies experimental company with seat in Bristol is famous for their unusual taste directions which beer, cheese, beef and gold foil belong to.</seg>
<seg id="15">Nevertheless his newest creation is supposed to become even more ambitious.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says: „I would like to develop gladly an invisible ice cream."</seg>
<seg id="17">That is impossible at and for itself due to the refraction which is caused by the ice crystals which ice cream consists of; but I presume we find a possibility to create it.</seg>
<seg id="18">The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish that is made by Chinese scientist artificially</seg>

<seg id="1">The throw away society does not think</seg>
<seg id="2">The night was long, the music loud and the atmosphere well, but sometime it is slow house.</seg>
<seg id="3">Only: In the stomachs of the people on the co-driver and moving seat the hunger becomes noticeable.</seg>
<seg id="4">Clear, for that one or the other cocktail or champagne likes to be responsible!</seg>
<seg id="5">What seems likely there, than to go to the next Drive-In gechillt in order to treat oneself on a small thing?</seg>

<seg id="9">Because what one must lack, that one flings his Fastfood bags from the car window with constant regularity?!</seg>
<seg id="10">Paper bags thrown away are due particularly to the weekends at street edges and on parking places.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Why?" I ask to myself.</seg>
<seg id="12">The people are too dumb, around the bags with home respektive to take up to the next garbage can?</seg>

<seg id="1">A black box in the car?</seg>
<seg id="2">US American street planners are in search of a money source in order to repair the deteriorating highway-system, and believe to have found the solution in a small black box that finds place in the instrumentation panel of every car.</seg>
<seg id="3">The devices which record every driven kilometer and which information onto the authorities announce are central point of a controversial attempt of Washington and the planning offices of the Federal states to rework the obsolete system for the financing of US American streets.</seg>
<seg id="4">The usually rather boring field of the road planning provoked suddenly an intense debate with colored alliances.</seg>
<seg id="5">Libertäre allied with environmental groups and speak out for that, that the government use the small boxes for the write-out of the driven kilometers – and possibly also, where they were driven – and be able to use the information then for the calculation of notices of assessment assessment notices bills demands levies.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Tea Party is horrified.</seg>
<seg id="7">The American civil rights union (ACLU) is also most deeply worried and expresses a series of data protection objections.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, while one is not can agree on a procedure in the congress, several Federal states do not wait longer.</seg>
<seg id="9">You check currently how they can change in the course of the next ten years for a system with the driver per driven mile pay.</seg>
<seg id="10">Thousands of motorists already tested the tachographs from which some are endowed with GPS-supervision.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is really a must for our country.</seg>
<seg id="12">„It is not anything, that we will use only possibly", Hasan Ikhrata, manager of the Southern California Assn, said. of Governments who plans a recording of the driven miles with all Californian motorists in the Federal state from 2025.</seg>
<seg id="13">The kind and manner as we pay these taxes will change.</seg>
<seg id="14">The technology for that is there.</seg>
<seg id="15">The initiative comes to a time since the highway trust is broke to Fund which is financed from the taxes which US Americans give at the petrol pump.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, in America as much is not refueled more as formerly.</seg>
<seg id="17">Cars consume less gasoline.</seg>
<seg id="18">The state mineral oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 euro cents per liter) has not been increasing for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="19">Politicians do not dare with the case of high spirit prices also to lift the steering wheels only around a cent.</seg>
<seg id="20">„The gasoline tax is simply not future-capable", according to Lee Munnich, an expert for traffic legislation at the university of Minnesota.</seg>
<seg id="21">His Federal state furnished 500 cars with tachographs with which a mile-based paying-system is supposed to be tested recent.</seg>
<seg id="22">„That represents the on a long-term basis most reasonable alternative" he said.</seg>
<seg id="23">Bureaucrats refer to it as a mile-based user fee</seg>
<seg id="24">It does not surprise that urban liberals approve the idea, because the tax could be used for example dazu to influence the driving behavior so that jams and climate-harmful waste gases are reduced.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Californian planners put on the system during the preparation from strategies with which the ambitious, by law anchored objectives of the Federal state for the climate change are supposed to be reached.</seg>
<seg id="26">Nevertheless the republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania, chairperson of the House Transportation Committee, also declared that he sees the most feasible long-term alternative in that.</seg>
<seg id="27">Also the free ones Vermarkter of the Reason Foundation are caused from the idea to make drivers to covered stretch be paid.</seg>
<seg id="28">„That is not a tax which disappears in a black hole", declares Moore, vice-president, Adrian for guidelines at Reason.</seg>
<seg id="29">Paying the people directly for what they get.</seg>
<seg id="30">The movement is supported also by two former American Ministers of Transport that had asked in a report in the year 2011 the congress to move in direction of mile-based billing.</seg>
<seg id="31">The US senate approved last year a pilot project 90 million dollars expensive which would have contained 10,000 cars.</seg>
<seg id="32">Nevertheless the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the advance and reacted in this way to the objections of representatives from rural fields which people represent who must often cover many miles in the everyday life on the way to the work or into the city.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several Federal states and cities move nonetheless on own initiative in this direction.</seg>
<seg id="34">Oregon, which recruits currently 5,000 drivers for the greatest experiment of the country, is at the most engaged.</seg>
<seg id="35">These drivers will pay soon the mile fees to the Federal state instead of the mineral oil tax.</seg>
<seg id="36">Nevada finished already a pilot project.</seg>
<seg id="37">New York City considers also one like that.</seg>
<seg id="38">Illinois tests it in restricted measure with trucks.</seg>
<seg id="39">And the I-95-Koalition which the traffic ministries belong to from 17 Federal states at the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) examines currently as one could introduce the change.</seg>
<seg id="40">The draft is not a universal hit.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Nevada, where recently 50 volunteers were equipped with the devices, motorists were sceptical with the case of the thought the government could pursue each of their movements.</seg>
<seg id="42">„Objections against Big Brother and such things were a great problem", declares Alauddin Khan, conductor of the strategy and result management, in the traffic ministry of Nevada.</seg>
<seg id="43">The people did not want it.</seg>
<seg id="44">When the test started, the ACLU of Nevada warned on their web site: It would be relatively simple to change the tachographs into full-grown invigilators."</seg>
<seg id="45">No necessity to establish a gigantic, unwieldy technological infrastructure which would be used unavoidably to entering data about the daily movements of individuals exists.</seg>
<seg id="46">Nevada does not belong to a row exactly from Federal states that stay now according to affordable technology look-out with which the state can capture the driven kilometers, however, when and where.</seg>
<seg id="47">In this way, so khan, also the public would be more calmed.</seg>
<seg id="48">The hunt according to this technology led some authorities to a small startup-enterprise by the name of True Mileage in californiums.</seg>
<seg id="49">The company did not line up initially in order to help Federal states from motorists during the taxation.</seg>
<seg id="50">Rather it was their aim of gripping in a rising market for Kfz insurances feet in the case of which drivers are supposed to pay on basis of the driven miles.</seg>
<seg id="51">Nevertheless the devices tested by her are interesting also for the street planners because they do not work with GPS and only restricted information that are loaded regularly by modem deliver.</seg>
<seg id="52">„The people are rather ready to participate in that if their speed and locations are not recorded", declared Ryan Morrison, manager of True Mileage.</seg>
<seg id="53">In some of these public pilot programs great errors were made.</seg>
<seg id="54">There are considerably cheaper and less intrusive possibilities to transplant this.</seg>
<seg id="55">In Oregon the planners experiment with giving motorists a series of choices.</seg>
<seg id="56">You keep yourself up for a device or without GPS decide.</seg>
<seg id="57">Or they do not choose at all any device and pay one instead of this flat rate on basis of the miles on the average driven by all inhabitants of the Federal state.</seg>
<seg id="58">Other places hope for being able to sell the draft to a mistrustful public when they endow the devices with more functions when with wenigeren.</seg>
<seg id="59">In New York City traffic officials want to develop a device into the taxation with which make pay also parking fees, an insurance must be paid only for driven kilometers and speed data are raised by other vehicles in real time thanks to which motorists can evade jams.</seg>
<seg id="60">„Motorists would be motivated to the participation by the added value of the advantages which the system offers", it is said in a planning document of the city.</seg>
<seg id="61">Some traffic planners wonder however, whether the whole gossip is not only a gigantic diversion about the paying per mile.</seg>
<seg id="62">With the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the field of the San Francisco Bay officials declared, the congress can solve the problem of the bankrupt highway trust find simple through rise of the fuel tax.</seg>
<seg id="63">An additional unique fee or an annual delivery could be imposed on motorists with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles which consume little gasoline so that also these pay a fair part.</seg>
<seg id="64">„There is not any reason for an operation if an aspirin also suffices", explains Randy Rentschler, the conductor for legislation and public matters of the commission.</seg>
<seg id="65">If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists do themselves worry about their privacy and numerous other things.</seg>

<seg id="12">Mayor Klumpp brought into memory, that always again weather influences turning round in the spring and fall added the initial field so, that it could not be played on.</seg>
<seg id="13">Already 15 years ago there were the first considerations to the solution of the problem when the construction of a third place was thought of near the ground of the soccer club or near the secondary school at the saltworks lake.</seg>
<seg id="14">Both was rejected again.</seg>
<seg id="15">Six years ago thoughts for the application of an artificial turf sports ground arose, which was regarded as the ultimative solution generally.</seg>
<seg id="16">Concrete plannings were incorporated two years ago, when the FC took over the Schabelstube into heritage lease, a cost participation of 100 000 euros for the construction of the place accepted and the country promotion means of 104 000 euros approved.</seg>
<seg id="17">The district council concluded in October 2012 the takeover of the remaining 356 000 euros at the total costs of 560 000 euros, summarized Klumpp.</seg>
<seg id="18">The start of building of the 68 times 108 meters of big artificial turf place occurred on 4th June.</seg>

<seg id="2">Edward Snowden, the Whistleblower of the US American secret service, declared it is ready to travel to Berlin and to testify before the German Bundestag Federal Parliament if the American National Security Agency and their director Keith Alexander do not give any answers about their activities.</seg>
<seg id="3">The German representative Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where this received asylum in order to discuss the statement with him in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="4">In a letter of Snowden which was presented to the media by Ströbele on Friday in Berlin this writes: „Even if the result of my efforts was nachweislich positive, my government keeps on handling a differing opinion as a faith break and attempts to kriminalisieren political opinion comment with punishment threat with the case of which no defense is possible."</seg>
<seg id="5">To say the truth is not, however, a crime.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the letter Snowden writes it is convinced from that of the support of the international community being able to convince the American government of making the accusation against it fall.</seg>
<seg id="7">The accusation raised by the US Ministry of Justice covers espionage and theft of state property.</seg>
<seg id="8">The German Minister of the Interior Hans-Peter Friedrich said Online opposite time: „If Mr Snowden is ready to speak with German representatives, we find then ways to facilitate that."</seg>

<seg id="1">Security objections in Mozambique increase faced with collisions between influential personalities</seg>
<seg id="2">Thousands of people met in the center of Maputo among the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the state founder and first presidents of Mozambique in order to start at a rare public demonstration peace calls.</seg>
<seg id="3">„We want again peace, we want stability", Vanessa de Sousa, manageress of an investment enterprise, said.</seg>
<seg id="4">For fear around the future of the country she exchanged their business clothing against a T-shirt with the label „We demand security in Portuguese and connected on Thursday of the amount on the independence place of the capital.</seg>
<seg id="5">For two weeks there are almost daily reports about collisions between government strengths and Renamo which number among the worst combats since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="6">Renamo was at one time a notorious rebel movement, that initially of the Rhodesia ruled over from white and later the Apartheitsregierung Südafrikas was supplementary in the bothering, to destabilize the independent government of the country.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the peace treaty of 1992 she became an opposition party.</seg>
<seg id="8">Analysts hold it for improbable that the country lapses again into a full-grown conflict, nevertheless the recent events worried foreign investors and locals.</seg>
<seg id="9">For the rapidly growing economy a lot stands on the game, because the discovery of gigantic gas occurrences in front of the coast and coal stockyard in the north-west could bring into the country in the next years of investments of more than 50 billion United States dollars of companies as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">The ruling Frelimo party, since 1975 the dominating strength, and Renamo blame mutually for the tensions.</seg>
<seg id="11">Renamo says the government provoked the recent collisions when it would have attacked their members on 17th October in the province Sofala, a traditional stronghold Renamos.</seg>
<seg id="12">To kill the infringements of the former rebels escalated Afonso Dhlakama, attacked as government troops Renamo footholds and attempted, the chief of the group, declared Renamos speakers opposite the Financial Times.</seg>
<seg id="13">The government blames Renamo for the collisions and the organization accuses, to have attacked soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="14">President Armando Guebuza attempted to ran through objections about an instability.</seg>
<seg id="15">Opposite AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama considers himself as „a loser that wants to use „all his still residual strengths in order to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government".</seg>
<seg id="16">Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they would like to avoid a war.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless the objections increased since Mazanga with the words was quoted, Renamo gives the peace agreement from 1992.</seg>
<seg id="18">Opposite the FT it declared it thought in this way that Frelimo does not respect the agreement anymore.</seg>
<seg id="19">„Our vision is it, to resume negotiations and serious indeed", Mazanga said.</seg>
<seg id="20">Former conversations between the parties contributed only little to the settlement of the tensions that was inspired by a series of collisions this year.</seg>
<seg id="21">„We have here two grown-up men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) that the heads collide", thinks Joseph Hanlon, university lecturer, at the Open University and Mozambique-expert.</seg>
<seg id="22">No one of them is good in the negotiating and it is not ready to any to do the necessary concessions.</seg>
<seg id="23">Renamo who insists on choice reforms declared already she will boycott the local choices in November.</seg>
<seg id="24">Premiership and parliament choices are planned for next year.</seg>
<seg id="25">Some commentators interpreted the use of power as the attempt of a kränkelnden movement to obtain concessions and financial sales allowances of the government.</seg>
<seg id="26">Renamos choice successes shrink since 1992 while a newer party, the Movimento Democrático de Moçambique founded by a former Renamo-member (MDM), will presumably be improving at the choices</seg>
<seg id="27">Mazanga says that Guebuza – whose resignation waits if his second term of office ends in the next year – wants to destroy the democracy of the country.</seg>
<seg id="28">„He" wants no increase party democracy, „he does not want any transparent choices he does not want any peace because he does not „want" to give up the presidency" so Mazanga.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is unclear which capacities Renamo has, however, she has on attacks bringing about noise on police stations and vehicles one important north south connections done.</seg>
<seg id="30">Most combats occurred in the province Sofala, the some a Hundred Kilometers north of Maputo lies, in which there is Beira, however, the harbor use the mining industry skilled one as Rio Tinto and Vale for the export of coal.</seg>
<seg id="31">In June Rio suspended for a month the use of the railroad after Renamo had announced an attack on the stretch</seg>
<seg id="32">Mazanga answered cautiously the question whether Renamo will repeat this threat.</seg>
<seg id="33">Renamo wanted „the international community warn against the things" not „standing in Mozambique well Mazanga said.</seg>
<seg id="34">The instability still increased the frustration over the government, says Fernando Lima, conductor of Mediacoop, to an independent media enterprise, because many people worried already because of the corruption, the slow progress at the development and a recent kidnapping wave.</seg>
<seg id="35">„The people think" that the government and the president for the future of the country are responsible and he should be that one who finds solutions for the problems", it declares.</seg>
<seg id="36">Omar sultans, a demonstrator, said the people simply wanted only stability.</seg>
<seg id="37">„Renamo and Frelimo do not interest any, they simply want peace and usable streets only again", he declared.</seg>

<seg id="1">District council is pleased with sound budget</seg>
<seg id="2">Whenever it is a question of the budget in district council meetings mayor Ralph Gerster laughed well.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Gemeindesäckl in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and the administration does not know debts anymore already since 2005.</seg>
<seg id="4">Also the financial year 2012 can be credited as full success in this sense.</seg>
<seg id="5">This became clear during the idea of the annual accounts for 2012.</seg>
<seg id="6">How Andrea Rothmund explained is the administration budget with about 7.6 million euros more than one millions of euros more highly unusual than planned.</seg>
<seg id="7">Also the surplus of the administration house hold lies with about 1.8 million euros about one millions of euros above the approach.</seg>
<seg id="8">The surplus is to be owed to particularly higher trade tax gains and the municipality part of the income tax.</seg>
<seg id="9">Also the property budget lay again clearly about the planned values.</seg>
<seg id="10">Instead of the planned 1.5 million euros it was in the last year 2.5 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="11">"This is due basically to the higher supply from the administration budget", according to Rothmund.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since in the financial year 2012 less investments were made than plannedly, also the reserve supply turned out more highly.</seg>
<seg id="13">In total the general reserve could be increased by about 2.1 million euros on now in total 4.9 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and their team for the good work</seg>
<seg id="15">"One does simply not joggle such work from the sleeve", Gerster with look onto the annual accounts praised.</seg>
<seg id="16">It and the district councils were pleased with the good numbers visibly.</seg>
<seg id="17">It likes to ring paradoxical, nevertheless exactly these good numbers can the citizens soon to stand expensively come.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through the good financial condition the municipality could renounce in the past high tax factors.</seg>
<seg id="19">Through that in turn subsidies were already often shortened, however, by the country according to Gerster.</seg>
<seg id="20">For these subsidies from various compensation sticks there are conditions.</seg>
<seg id="21">Among other things the cities and municipalities which apply for subsidies must show certain tax factors.</seg>
<seg id="22">"We must have a look at the topic tax factors since in the coming years investments wait for which we would have subsidies gladly" announced Gerster in this connection</seg>

<seg id="1">Despair scream of an Obama-voter</seg>
<seg id="2">I elected president Obama twice in the hope for change being possible</seg>
<seg id="3">He says Obama undertook praiseworthy efforts which were foiled from the blockade tactics of the republicans</seg>
<seg id="4">The blockade politics does not excuse for the web site problems of Obamacare, the drone attacks</seg>
<seg id="5">Obamas memoirs about the election campaign 2008 are a sad memory of what would have been possible</seg>
<seg id="6">Nathaniel P. Morris is a student in the second year at that one Harvard Medical School.</seg>
<seg id="7">I read currently a dreadfully sad book.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is a book from which I believed, it would cheer me up during the sad second year of my medicine study and there would be again hope to me.</seg>
<seg id="9">„The Audacity to Win" (Courage to win) is called and describes the memoirs of Barack Obamas for the premiership choice 2008.</seg>
<seg id="10">If I am ready in the evening with my patient records and go to bed, the book takes me back then to a time, as the politics millions inspired and a talking the breath could rob.</seg>
<seg id="11">The choice became a landslide victory and newsreaders paused in order to make the historical importance of this hour clear.</seg>
<seg id="12">My classmates cried with joy and my parents collected all newspapers which they could find.</seg>
<seg id="13">A young team of visionaries was on the way into the White House and the nation was ready for change.</seg>
<seg id="14">When changed then 2008 Obama into the office, he had approval values of 82 %.</seg>
<seg id="15">And then I close the book.</seg>
<seg id="16">Again a bad awakening is to be switched over to the present as if one is torn from a dream.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is difficult to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder onto missed possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the years since I gave my voice for the first time something changed in fact.</seg>
<seg id="19">But it is simply not anything what I could have imagined.</seg>
<seg id="20">I acknowledge the splendid and many-sided things that Obama reached from the discharge of the Affordable Care Act for health insurance up to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced concealment of homosexuality in the army and the killing Osama of bin Ladens.</seg>
<seg id="21">Also I think that the party-political blockade tactics tilted too many attempts with which our nation should be brought forward: To name immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closing of Guantanamo Bay, only around some.</seg>
<seg id="22">However after I have defended countless times the Obama government opposite colleagues and acquaintances, I arrived with my declaration attempts at the end</seg>
<seg id="23">I reached a point of political despair.</seg>
<seg id="24">The republican blockade politics cannot declare, for which one approves the sound monitoring of foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children through drones overseas.</seg>
<seg id="25">It cannot be declared why the National Security Agency gathers data about the private life of Americans and why Whistleblower who disclose state error behavior are punished.</seg>
<seg id="26">It cannot declare, for which Anwar al-Awlaki, a US American citizen, without procedures was murdered, still why the public financing and edition borders are avoided during the premiership choices</seg>
<seg id="27">It does not justify the results of a report in which it means the efforts of the White House to the quiet position of the media are the most „aggressive... since the Nixon government".</seg>
<seg id="28">And recently it cannot excuse for the impotence, to project a simple web site in the more than three years since the discharge of the Affordable Care Act.</seg>
<seg id="29">I do not know whether it is what I should have expected.</seg>
<seg id="30">Whether I should have understood with 18 that the government work could contradict the political campaigns preceding to her.</seg>
<seg id="31">Obviously the representative office is not a foreseeable course since an opposition party and accidental events as the Newtown-massacre shape the public discussion.</seg>
<seg id="32">However if I have a look at the above-mentioned examples, then they seem elected by the government itself to a large extent his</seg>
<seg id="33">And that disturbs me the most.</seg>
<seg id="34">I chose in 2012 Obama again, not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy</seg>
<seg id="35">Mitt Romney represented a confusing and immature alternative, it seemed not to be able to define his direction and positions.</seg>
<seg id="36">I had the impression a second term of office for Obama, free from the pressure of future choices would fulfill the hope which we had heard about already for so long.</seg>
<seg id="37">However with the sinking of the approval values for Obama on less than 45 % this week the return became the harder in the year 2008 through this book.</seg>
<seg id="38">It wakes in me the longing for the many promises which dissolved in Luft.</seg>
<seg id="39">This week I read a section in the book, that one describes as Obama had to take a difficult loss against Clinton with the case of the preselections in Pennsylvania.</seg>
<seg id="40">In a meeting with the election officers according to the decision he said to his employees they would have to come back to course and follow the purpose of their thing.</seg>
<seg id="41">„I would like, that we regain our charm he said.</seg>
<seg id="42">We must remember who we are.</seg>
<seg id="43">It is five years later, Mr. President, and I could not agree to you more strongly.</seg>
