Pope Francis appoints first cardinals in February
Pope Francis new cardinals will call on 22 February, for the first time, the Catholic Church, the Vatican announced on Thursday.
The Cardinals senior clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope, and they are the ones who are choosing a pope, Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately be involved in the choice of his successor.
Currently, there are 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached the age of 80 years, can no longer take part in the election - this is a group of 120 "electorate Cardinals."
In a statement, in which the news was announced, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman said there will be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony for the appointment of the new cardinals will be held, which is also known as a consistory.
"Pope Francis has decided to give his decision on the holding of by in February in advance so that other meetings that require the attendance of Cardinals from around the world can be planned," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices, said that the number of voting cardinals will probably be dropped until February.
He said that a pope normally take so many cardinals as necessary, so that the number of eligible cardinals measured over 120, and so many cardinals over 80, as he would like.
The consistory next year is so important because it is the first since the election of Francis in March of this year, Valero.
Currently, there is a certain overhang on the part of Europe, and especially in Italy.
"It will be interesting to see whether the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to redress the balance," he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of Cardinals.
The Cardinals will also be the first to be appointed since the formation of the Council of Cardinals founded by Francis to find a group of eight Cardinals from around the world who have a mandate to reform the church.
In the past, the pope decided everything alone.
"Now that Francis has selected eight cardinals that will help him," Valero said.
He said that it was "quite possible" that Francis ask the Cardinals for advice.
But we have not been in this situation - that is all very new.
Valero said that the bishops would typically recruited from great places to Cardinals, but Francis "was full of surprises, we do not know whom he appoints."
