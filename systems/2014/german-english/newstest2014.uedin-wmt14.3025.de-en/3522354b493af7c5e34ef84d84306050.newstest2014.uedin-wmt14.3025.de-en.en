Kindergarten has found a private buyer
"The building is" in good hands, Winterlingens Mayor Michael Maier said.
The former kindergarten in the garden road, the municipality has sold to a private individual.
The sale of the council agreed in his recent meeting in the non-public part.
The building changed its owner to a "reasonable" price.
"The community is satisfied," Maier said.
In the budget of 100 000 euros were scheduled.
Still not clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten.
The mayor is right that winter for the responsibility of the building has handed over to someone else before winter and therefore no longer pay for the entertainment of the house, such as photo to look to the garden and to clear the sidewalk.
"This effort is now gone, Maier is happy.
