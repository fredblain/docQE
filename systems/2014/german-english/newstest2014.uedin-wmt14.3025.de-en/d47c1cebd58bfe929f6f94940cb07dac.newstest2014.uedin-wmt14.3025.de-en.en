Snowden, with Germany in terms of US surveillance to "cooperate"
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower of the US Secret Service, said that he was willing to travel to Berlin and testify before the German Bundestag, if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander, no answers about their activities.
The German MEP Hans-Christian Stroebele met with Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where he received asylum, with him to discuss the statement in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden, who was presented on Friday by Stroebele media in Berlin, he writes: "Even if the result of my endeavours was demonstrably positive my government treats, a dissenting opinion as a breach of loyalty and attempts to criminalize political expression with punishment, in which no defense is possible."
To tell the truth is not a crime. "
In the letter, Snowden wrote that he was convinced that the support of the international community to persuade the American government could be to drop the charges against him.
The US Justice Department trial includes espionage and theft of state property.
The German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Time Online: "If Mr Snowden is ready to talk with German representatives, then we can find ways to allow that."
Relations between the United States and Germany are burdened by the allegations that the NSA had intercepted the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the MEP, who heads the parliamentary committee responsible for the intelligence service, said that we should seize the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness, if it were possible, "without compromising him and ruining the relationship with the United States completely."
Stroebele, a member of the Greens, published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied on his visit to Russia by two German journalists.
Stroebele said that, according to the lawyer of the former NSA contractor Snowden could not return to Russia, if he leave the country.
If Snowden des in Germany, then he will need an assurance that he was "sure" there, the Member.
Snowden said in his letter that he would be subjected to a "serious and ongoing" persecution campaign that had driven from his home.
However, he was "touched by the global response to" my act of political expression.
People around the world, as well as senior politicians, including in the United States, described the revelations about an uncontrolled comprehensive monitoring system as a credit to the general public.
In his letter, Snowden makes the German authorities an offer of cooperation, "if the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation has been resolved."
