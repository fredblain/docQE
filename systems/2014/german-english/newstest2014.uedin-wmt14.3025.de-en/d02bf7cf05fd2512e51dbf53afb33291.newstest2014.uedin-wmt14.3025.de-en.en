A black box in the car?
American road planners are looking for a source of money, the decaying highway system repair, and believe the solution in a small black box on the dashboard of every car.
The devices, each mileage record and report the information to the authorities, are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the planning offices of the federal states, the antiquated system of financing American roads to review.
The normally rather boring area of road planning has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Libertarian have allied themselves with environmental groups, argue that the government of the small boxes to record the mileage - and possibly even where they were driven to use - and then use the information to calculate tax modest.
The Tea Party is appalled.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a series of data protection concerns.
But while in Congress could not agree on a course of action, several states are not waiting any longer.
You are looking at how they can over the next ten years to switch to a system in which drivers per-mile danger pay.
Thousands of drivers have the tachograph, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring, already tested.
This really is a must-have for our country.
"There is nothing that we will only use it," Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Assn. of government processes said, which is planning a record of driven miles on all California motorists in the state in 2025.
The way in which we pay these taxes, will change.
The technology is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is financed by taxes, the Americans pay at the pump, broke.
But in America is no longer as much fuel as before.
Cars consume less gasoline.
The state-run petroleum tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 euro cents per liter) has increased for 20 years.
Politicians dare not at high fuel prices, raising the tax by a penny.
"The gasoline tax" is simply not sustainable, Lee Munnich, an expert on business law at the University of Minnesota.
His state has recently 500 cars equipped with tachographs, a mile-based payment system is to be tested.
"This is the most sensible alternative in the long term," he said.
Bureaucrats call it as a mileage-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea is popular with urban liberals, because the tax could be used, for example, to influence the behaviour that congestion and climate-damaging emissions are reduced.
The Californian planners rely on the system in formulating policies that the ambitious, statutory objectives of the federal state on climate change is to be achieved.
But the Republican Bill Shuster made from Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, also said that he see it as the most viable long-term alternative.
The free marketer of the Reason Foundation are pleased with the idea to allow drivers to pay zur√ºckgelegter route.
"This is not a tax that disappears into a black hole," Adrian Moore, vice president for policy at the Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former American transport ministers who had urged in a report to Congress in 2011 to move in the direction of mileage-based billing.
The US Senate last year approved a $90 million expensive pilot project that would have included 10,000 cars.
But the majority in the House of Representatives blocked the move and responding to the concerns of MPs from rural areas, representing the people who need in everyday life, often many miles on the way to work or travel to the city.
Several states and cities are still on their own in this direction.
The most active Oregon, which currently 5,000 drivers for the biggest experiment in the country is mobilizing.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of the petroleum tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is considering such a also.
Illinois, it is testing limited with trucks.
And the I-95-coalition, to which the transport ministries from 17 states on the east coast, including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently examining how one could introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where recently 50 volunteers were fitted with the devices, motorists were skeptical of the idea that the government could pursue each of their movements.
"Concerns about Big Brother and such things were a big problem," said Alauddin Khan, head of strategy and product management at the Transport Ministry of Nevada.
The people wanted it.
When the trial started, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: "It is relatively easy to turn the tachograph in mature monitoring devices."
There is no need to build a gigantic, bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology, which the state can capture the mileage, but not exactly when and where.
Thus, Khan, the public would be some.
The hunt for this technology has some authorities to a small startup company called True mileage in California.
The company is not originally taken to help states in the taxation of drivers.
Rather, it was their goal, in an emerging market for car insurance, in which drivers based on the miles driven to pay.
But the devices are tested for road planners are interesting, because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information that is regularly uploaded via modem.
"People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded," Ryan Morrison, managing director of True mileage said.
In some of these public pilot programs big mistakes have been made.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement it.
In Oregon, the planners are experimenting with motorists to give a series of choices.
You can opt for a device with or without GPS.
Or they can choose any device and instead pay a flat fee, based on the average of all the inhabitants of the state driven miles.
Others hope that the concept of a suspicious public sale by providing the equipment with more functions than with little.
In New York City traffic officials want to develop a device for taxation, which can also pay parking fees to be paid only for driving distances insurance must be collected and speed data from other vehicles in real time, thanks to which drivers will be able to avoid traffic jams.
"Motorists would be the added value of the benefits of the system, motivated to participate," says a planning document of the city.
Some traffic planners wonder, however, whether the pay per mile over all the talk is not only a huge distraction.
The Metropolitan Transportation Commission, the area of the San Francisco Bay for officials said, the Congress, the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund can simply by raising the fuel tax.
An additional one-time fee or an annual levy could motorists with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume less gasoline, so they pay their fair share.
"There is no need for an operation, even if an aspirin is enough," said Randy Rentschler, director of legislation and public affairs of the Commission.
If we do that hundreds of millions, of drivers about their privacy, and many other things.
