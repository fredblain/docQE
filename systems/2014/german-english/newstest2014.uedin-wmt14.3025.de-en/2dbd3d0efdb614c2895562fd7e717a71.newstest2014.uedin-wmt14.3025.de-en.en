At present, more safety for pedestrians
You are not 100 yards away from each other, on Tuesday in Gutach is the new B 33-pedestrian traffic light on the village park has been put into operation, within sight of the old town hall lights.
Two plants so close together: Intention or folly?
Has answered that question Gutachs mayor yesterday.
"The town hall lights have been installed at the time because it ensures the school," said Eckert yesterday.
The Kluser-lights safe both cyclists and Busfahrgäste and Bergle-dwellers.
The official yesterday in operation system is important for the crossing area Sulzbachweg / fair.
We have the museum, two churches, gardens, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank and the traffic flow from the residential area "Grub ‹.
"With the high traffic and foot gear up another traffic lights to come to their safety," said Eckert.
This Peter Arnold the Offenburg also confirms.
"According to current measurements, the community through the B 33 at about 12 000 vehicles a day, of which about 10 percent are" heavy traffic, Arnold said.
Therefore, the construction of a new traffic light is more than necessary: "Security is simple," says Arnold.
A total of four road shows have been carried out, including a roundabout was considered, but rejected because of tightness in the intersection area Sulzbachweg / fair.
It has been tested, according to Arnold in the site selection of the traffic light poles before everything: "With an extra for us with very long wooden trunks loaded vehicle, we have equipped te, whether these vehicles from Sulzbachweg onto B 33, umzuknicken without the traffic light poles."
About 15 000 euros expensive traffic light system itself is the "state of the art, which is currently on the market," explained Arnold.
The plant is equipped with coloured LEDs that illuminate so strongly that the lights are visible from the drivers, for example, even with deep outsider sun.
And it is also economical: The older lighting systems consume about 100 watts, the new just eight watts.
Each direction, there are three lighting systems.
Arnold said the technique of the new plant, which is equipped with two radar sensors.
The pedestrian presses the button lights, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation.
The road is free, there is an immediate green for pedestrians, if it doesn't, about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be stopped for the pedestrian.
"A group of people were to go on the road, the green phase will be extended, it is everyone safe on the road," said Arnold.
Of course, the driver must think here as a partner and watch the road.
This was not the case yesterday: Hardly showed the green light for pedestrians, "a luxury car - in bright red.
