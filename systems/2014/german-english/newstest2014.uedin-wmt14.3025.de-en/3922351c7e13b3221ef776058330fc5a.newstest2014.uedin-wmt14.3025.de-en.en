Halloween 2013: In
When I was a child, Halloween was something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, grew late and clad in the neighborhood.
Today, I am more for the Halloween rings.
In the last two years, I have said I am not prepared to distribute sweets from my apartment, and it will probably not do this year.
But, according to the statistics, I am a black sheep on Halloween.
The majority of Americans - 158 million, to be exact - celebrate Halloween this year, giving it a total of 6.9 billion US dollars for candy, costumes and decorations, the American Association of retailers pulling.
One thing that I am every Halloween then again, are the trend values.
The costumes are approximately 1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, the principal.
This year, provocative inanimate objects are the rage.
Women must no longer remain in sexy clothes, they can now also tempting foods such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
When it comes to men, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet that speaking about Daft Punk-punk space men will this year in the Instagram feeds.
According to Google zombies, Batman, pirates and witches are the most wanted costumes.
I suspect that there is nothing wrong with tradition.
We have our dogs dressed last year, and to my surprise, were not alone.
In fact, Americans spend $330 million this year for costumes of their pets, the principal.
That is a lot of "Hot Dogs."
As for sweets, we are not squeamish.
This year, Americans will spend $1.9 billion, as The Nielsen Company.
That is about 270 million kilograms of chocolate bars, Lutschern, candies and Gummi.
That is good news for the US Department of Commerce 41 million people with the slogan "or sour" through the quarters.
In fact, we will buy about 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and - let us not delude ourselves - to eat.
The only thing we don't want to consume is the sugar-sweet candy corn; however, 15 million kilograms of which will be sold for Halloween, the National Association of confectionery manufacturer.
That is about nine billion corn grains.
It is a mystery that I could not solve.
Nothing is more on Halloween than houses where there are haunting.
You have great names like "terror Behind the Walls" (which, incidentally, is in a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock."
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognised haunted houses in the United States, which will reach $500 million revenue, as America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photographs of National straight into the pants and friends on Facebook, where you get rid of them, and then the guy that you leave a comment like "nice facial expression."
But we come to the tariff mouthful.
Charlie Brown made us with the Great pumpkin, when we were children, and the carving a pumpkin lantern is like the jewellery of the Christmas tree - something that we have made.
Fortunately, the "baby in the pumpkin" trend began only last year thanks to Pinte rest, so most of us have grown up with it, the pumpkin zurechtzuschnitzen and not to sit in it.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million for pumpkins, according to the US Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lantern, which rots slowly in the front yard, probably comes from Illinois, where this year were harvested 245 million kilograms of pumpkins.
If you want to score correctly, please call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and teaching you convert their 921-pound pumpkin.
