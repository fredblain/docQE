Parents can choose from inter-sexual children "gender vague"
Germany is the first European nation in which a third sex is recognised for children who were born with ambiguous genitals.
Newborn will no longer rigidly assigned male or female.
Under the new law, parents must be no more sex for such children, but will "vague" or "not" on the birth certificate.
The goal of the law is to take the pressure from parents, so that they will have no hasty decisions relating to operations for a gender assignment in newborns, and to fight against the discrimination of sexual beings.
An inter-sexual person, according to BBC years later said: "I am neither man nor woman.
I remain a patchwork that was created by doctors, mutilated and full of scars.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children comes every year, either as a boy or a girl.
They belong to the inter-sexual, a group that fall under the diagnosis of "sexual differentiation disorder" (DSD), an umbrella term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testes) or unusually developed genitals.
Wallis Simpson was Inter-sexually.
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts advise in the US, one should use the best available information on gender assignment if a provision is not possible, and not wait for the psychological and physical development of the child before it decides - if any - for an operation.
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who has focused on the issue of gender identification, said that the new German law "sound for a good cause."
-sexual children constitute an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have for life-threatening diseases that make a surgical procedure, but most children do not need it, he said.
We can make a gender assignment without surgery, and then wait to see how the identity is developing.
The scientific data about how a child develops at all his gender identity, are not very closely.
No one knows why it is happening.
It is like the mystery of why people are gay.
In a report to the European Commission in 2011, it says, sexual people are transsexual and transgender people to distinguish, for their status is not gender-related, but by their biological constitution, which is neither male nor female exclusively, but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them.
These properties were in junior sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitalia or chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also gives an overview of the discrimination, Inter-sexual, and transgender people face in the workplace and about the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice crime.
Not consistent with the image of men and boys now have a special camp.
Now it is possible in Australia and Nepal for adults, on official documents, male, female or "third sex."
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) as the world's first "gender-free" person acknowledged after a court, the lifelong maintenance of a "unspecified" gender status was granted.
German identity cards have alongside M and W, a third allocation in the future, X for Inter sexually, the Ministry of Interior.
In neighboring France gender issues are still controversial, as a news story on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French Members of the strict Catholic country signed a petition that the "gender theory" should be removed from school books.
The US Catholic Online website has also voted against the German law, claiming: "If the world is being dragged into a new state, where the sex is a decision, but not sexual activity, then we twist two other pillars of civilization."
The mother of a newborn baby from Maryland told zone, it would be better if babies at birth will be assigned to a sex.
"The parents existence is already stressful enough without further restrictions, especially if you know the sex of their child," she told the parents' website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children who were born with both male and female sex parts, known as Hermaphroditen, after the Greek god who had both sexes.
Ten years ago, the medicine regarded the sex as something that you could wipe out and then build new.
But now the ethical foundations are questioned an operation, now known as the gender identity is complex, and that doctors can also be wrong because they do not know how the child feels while growing up with their assigned gender.
"In the middle of the 20th century, one called it a" psychiatric emergency, "Drescher said.
If such a child was born, one called the psychiatrist, but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory about the treatment of children with ambiguous genitals to Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who took the view that the sex was malleable.
He coined the term "gender identity" and argued that social and environmental initiatives, such as the parents educate a child - interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and characterized as whether a person regard themselves as male or female.
But in one under the title "John / Joan" case from 1966 his theories have been controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis was severed in a botched circumcision to neuter the child and to remove his testicles and keep him as a girl.
"Money presented this case as a successful example of a conversion, which he was not, however," says Drescher.
When the boy was about 15, he moved back to the male sex and married a woman.
With 38 but he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still physicians who practice this model.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of this sex operations have come to the public, who are "not happy" with the outcome.
For example, when Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born male XY chromosomes, but ambiguous genitals.
The doctors were not clear about whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never a "satisfactory life" as a man.
So its external body and testicles were removed shortly after birth in 1976, he was brought up as a girl.
At the age of 12, he received female hormones.
"I knew that I am not a girl," he said on ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he should receive a vaginal plastic.
But because he was depressed and that something was amiss knew, he asked for his medical records.
What he found was shocking.
I have been sterilised in my birth - and no one has ever told me.
Bruce was born with a DSD, his body could not produce enough testosterone to the development of the genitals.
After he had told the truth, he moved back to the male identity, received testosterone injections and had his breasts removed.
The operation, he has become barren.
Today, he fights for others in an organization called Interface Project that inter-sexual people are perceived as normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, executive director of the California-based rights group Advocates for Informed Choice, worries that the German law "for stamping and stigmatised" could encourage.
"Many activists are worried that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and the child, not to", "she explained.
We fear that favours interventions.
We think it would be better to give the male or female sex and then wait.
But we still do not know how the law will impact, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supported the Australian law, because it allows adults, "the recognition as a third sex."
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex," she said.
The German law is about the allocation at birth.
This is not a war in which one should force small children at this time.
When they grow up, they can decide on their bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, supports a breast radio login from Pitt, who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and hundreds of others in a self-help group, says that the German law "authority" both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete Androgenresistenz.
The target because of the faulty receptor cells for testosterone Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and ovaries.
Today, Katy 29 and is married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as a co-worker in the child psychiatry.
Although it is barren, but hopes to get through adoption or a surrogate mother to a child.
"The law gives parents room, so they do not have to make hasty decisions," Baratz said.
It gives them the time to make various tests and to clarify things and gives them more time before they "male" or "female" write.
In this way, everything is fine, you take the child and loves it.
We have a wonderful baby and enjoys the parental happiness.
And we must not rush to make an operation that can no longer be reversed.
"That includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that concerns parents because they believe that they would not do the right thing," she explained.
Ultimately, the child determines the sex, which is more suited to him - and this is wonderful.
As a result, children will be able to make the decision themselves.
