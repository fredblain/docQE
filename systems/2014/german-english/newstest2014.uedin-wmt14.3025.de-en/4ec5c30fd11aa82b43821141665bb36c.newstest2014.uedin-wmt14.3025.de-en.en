Profits at Bombardier to decline in numbers and supply contracts
The Canadian aerospace and rail manufacturer Bombardier Inc on Thursday reported a 15-percent decline in net profit, due to declining orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and contract problems in the rail division under pressure.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, released a flight test data for his brand-new CSeries aircraft and gave no new information as to whether the plane could go under the ambitious timetable next September in commercial use.
The maiden flight of the test aircraft, one and a half months, only three more starts, what it is calling the testing phase is proceeding as planned so far followed.
The results fell short of forecasts and led to a drop of more than eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, on Thursday lowered its rating of "outperform" "performance sector" in view of the fact that the stock has over the next one to two quarters of a limited course potential.
"Although weaker sales figures were expected on planes, but the margins of development in the transport sector, we are clearly disappointed," Doerksen said in a client.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries, if the test program is progressing on the plane.
However, if no new orders will be announced in the coming months, we expect the market to be more sceptical towards the program.
Bombardier hopes that the series of the CSeries aircraft can catapult the company into the lower end of the market, which is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test plane was presented to the public in March, after months of delays and flew for the first time in September.
But so far, binding orders are for the CSeries with 177 moderate, as potential buyers wait for the results of the flight tests and see whether the claims of the company in terms of fuel efficiency and cost-saving potential of the new commercial jet aircraft are correct.
Currently, there are a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
CEO Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will achieve its goal of 300 binding orders at the start of the commercial use of the jets.
The company said on Thursday with analysts and media, the program is on schedule.
"The test aircraft is no longer than expected, remained on the ground," said Beaudoin during a telephone conference and added that during the lifetime of the aircraft were ground tests and software updates have been scheduled.
Each manufacturer is planning.
We have decided to take a first flight and then add a review period, what we have done.
This happens during the entire flight program.
The second of five test planes will probably start in the coming weeks, the remaining shortly afterwards, it said corporate side.
However, analysts remain skeptical that the first customer to 12 months after its maiden flight, take a CSeries aircraft in operation.
Bombardier said it checked the planning of the operation (EIS), and will update them in the next few months.
"The slow progress of the flight test - even if they are obviously BOMBARDIERS internal planning - reinforces our view that the commissioning of the first quarter of 2015, Doerksen said.
In the third quarter with the end on 30 September BOMBARDIERS net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share a year earlier.
The adjusted earnings per share is unchanged 9 cents.
Sales fell slightly, from 4.2 to 4.1 billion dollars.
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and sales of EUR 4,56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.
The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer indicates that he had delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter, a decline of 57 last year.
The net orders fell from 83 airplanes to 26.
The order book in the aerospace division amounted to 32.9 billion dollars on 30 September, and was unchanged from December 31.
"In the field of aerospace, the results were in line with our targets, but the low order intake and the overall market conditions were" disappointing, Beaudoin said.
Turnover in the aerospace division fell by 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, announced that sales in this area has increased by nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The order book in the transport sector amounted to $32.6 billion at September 30, and has increased to 31 December.
The profit margin in the field of transport has been hampered by handling problems in some big contracts.
According to corporate governance, there will be new requirements for the fourth quarter.
