Anger over the verdict for Bali bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who had come in the 2002 bombing in Bali killed over the verdict reacted angrily to the last of the instigators, which has been brought to justice, because Umar Patek, in their view, should be shot.
Patek, who was nearly ten years as one of the most wanted persons in Southeast Asia on the run, was sentenced yesterday for his role in the construction of explosives for the bombing to a sentence of 20 years.
With punitive suspension, he could be released after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many more were injured.
A guilty verdict also took place in a series of terrorism-related charges, including a wave of bomb attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecution had demanded a life sentence, even if it is referred to the man who "because of his reputation as a master bomb-maker known as" Demolition Man, asking for the death penalty could have.
The decision has aroused painful memories in June Corteen, a mother from Perth, which has lost its 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the Patek and his Mitverschw√∂rern almost ten years of devastation.
Fighting with tears, she said, should be sentenced to death had Patek.
I really believe that he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
"We should put him in front of a firing squad," said Corteen told AAP.
I have to live with it every day that I will have no further grandchildren, and I will never see my daughters.
The Sari Club has been razed to the ground when a powerful bomb exploded on October 12, 2002, shortly after 11 p.m. in a small truck, which was parked in front of the nightclub.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar, where only 20 seconds left before a suicide bombers explode a backpack filled with explosives.
After the attack, he fell into a coma for a month and "died" three times while he was on a life support system.
Hughes said Patek have earned the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah, Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra - who were responsible for the massacre and were executed four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty before any other.
To keep him alive - no, there is no reason to keep him alive.
For 20 years after he killed 202 people and injured hundreds, is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bomber, who was in court.
He cheated nearly a decade of the arrest, but was finally in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, picked up where US forces less than four months later, the former al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden killed.
During the trial, an FBI agent said that intelligence reports had provided the reference that Patek was in Pakistan, in order to meet bin Laden with the aim of the link between Southeast Asian terror groups and al-Qaida to rebuild.
"He has not asked, Corteen said.
Until recently, he has shown no remorse for the way he has a great deal of suffering to other people.
The ruling was issued before the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, which is celebrated with commemorations in Bali and Australia.
"This year, there will be many tears," said Corteen.
Patek may object to his judgment or appeal.
