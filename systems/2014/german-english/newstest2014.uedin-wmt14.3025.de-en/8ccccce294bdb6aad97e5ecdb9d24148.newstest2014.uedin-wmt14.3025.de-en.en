Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA staff before accusations against Jonathan Lord charged with sex offences
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) were for sexual offences relating to children has been charged before 2011 accusations against child carers Jonathan Lord from Caringbah, such as the Royal Commission for sexual abuse of children learned.
But, at the opening statement before the commission of the YMCA stated that we have had to do "in the organization never with an incident of sexual child abuse."
CEO Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which a YMCA employee for offences had been charged with child pornography, and another in which a sports teacher of the YMCA Caringbah Hall in 1991 because of the abuse of children entrusted to him had been convicted.
Hare Gail Furness, one of the Commission's assistance, a lawyer said that he had known of the first case, the second known but did not.
He admitted that the opening statement of the YMCA to the Commission was also vague on the claim that "there was external reviews of the YMCA, where the YMCA has been recognised as being at the forefront in terms of child safety."
Evidence before the commission that the YMCA has been informed that he had received the second-lowest rating of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities (Department of Education) in August of this year show.
Hare, who started with 21 at the YMCA, acknowledged that the company had "from me downwards" in the recruitment of Lord failed and failed to ensure that employees have been aware of their obligations to report violations of the regulations on the safety of children.
Lord was sentenced earlier this year for sexual offences against 12 boys during his two-year career for the YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum of six years in prison.
Hare denied, however, that the YMCA would have a cultural problem that employees have held them to report violations of Lords regarding the safety of children.
The employees said they had observed violations, among other things, that Lord was alone with children, she privately as a babysitter, they sit on his lap, leaving one said that he had loved it, and children play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose leader was Lord, who had asked for a training course on child protection, because she was concerned for his behavior, said that the children's services director Jacqui Barnat, who was at the YMCA Caringbah the supervisors Lords daunting, "and most of the time was very remote."
The director said that he would not accept statements by officials that they had not had the courage to report to their superiors.
Instead, he said, but their friendship with Lord have affected their judgment, which is why they had not reported it.
Hare said that he had the board of the YMCA NSW shared his view that the lesson that the organization from the "Jonathan-Lord-incident" to consider, "not reporting" by staff concerns, and the Board have agreed with him.
Hare said that the decision to push the employees to sign confidentiality obligations, shortly after the allegations were made by the director of the YMCA of children's services, Liam Whitley.
He said the contamination of the evidence should be avoided, but what had been overzealous "and" poorly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was at a time when Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011, no organization safe for children, Professor Stephen small bone from Griffith University, an expert on sexual child abuse, said the Commission.
He explained that there had been "serious problems" in recruitment, screening, training, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing was postponed until December 20.
