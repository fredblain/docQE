Veganism is, according to dictionaries the vegetarianism, but differs from that in a very significant way.
Because while vegetarians allow the consumption of cream cake, ice cream or a strong Edam, these feasts are not on the menu of a Veganers.
Milk, cheese, eggs, alongside the renunciation of meat and fish, the vegan from all consumption of animal products - even honey is denied.
What remains, one might ask, but on closer inspection, the vegan nutrition world through a considerable ingenuity.
"Sandwich spreads are very popular," Ute Henkel Mann, the owner of the local reform House, which provides a variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also visited the store in the Domgasse.
For 13 years, the native New Zealanders living vegan, in waters it is (almost) everything he needs to live. "I asked my diet in 1997 and was" vegetarians.
At the turn of the next step was then and I was vegan.
"The conviction came not only because of the food, but because of the shoe choice," says Proctor, who prefers artificial normal leather.
He acknowledged that it is also in other everyday needs no animal products.
First and foremost is his vegan an ethics.
"I don't want that animals have to die for me," Proctor says the maxim of vegans, which covers the entire consumer behavior.
Instead of hinterherzutrauern burgers, Rühreiern or rubber bears the vegan, quickly discovered a new products, rose the enthusiasm.
"It is a double bonus, Proctor said today," is actually his vegan no surrender, no asceticism, but it is an asset. "Back the assumption that blend with the diet, the choice of dining options, Proctor has more on the power of habit.
And it is precisely these conditions could also fail some well-intentioned attempt.
"The addiction is a crucial factor, which leaves many give up quickly, similar to the smoking," Proctor to a settlement.
And a: "Certain tastes are not pin on the animal."
It is often the spices or the type of preparation, which make up the taste.
"You can also produce the same effect in other ways," illustrates the vegan.
At a barbecue Proctor brings, for example, eggplant, mushrooms and a few vegan sausages.
He looks at a balanced and varied diet, which is supposed to taste first proper.
Of course, you want to have something between the teeth, which is legitimate.
"It should taste, but that is not only to reduce animal food," said Proctor.
Health damage to eating disorders, another widespread assumption that he had not suffered.
For me, the change had a positive aspect.
I am not a foreign cholesterol and have an increased share of vitamin.
There are high-performance athletes who eat vegan exclusively.
"My blood values are well, I let myself often check," says Proctor.
In particular, the lack of vitamin B12 warn many Vegansimus critics.
"As animals are fed with animal feed, instead of grazing on pasture, it is questionable whether the meat in the freezer purchases of vitamin B12 share is high," finds Proctor.
For Vegans, there is also the possibility to take the products in the form of tablets.
"My B12-values are in order," he explains.
Wide paths to Proctor, the food supply is not go.
Finally, there are basic foodstuffs everywhere and every supermarket has now soy milk and other products.
Everything I need, I think on the ground.
Only now and I buy something special.
"Many people overlook that only the finished products are expensive, but as it is" ordinary "finished products as well."
In any case, the preparation of vegan dishes is much cheaper and less time-consuming than commonly thought.
"In the home kitchen, there is a lot to discover, with a few small tips can be good, if not sometimes produce better results," Proctor said.
Margarine instead of butter, a bit more baking powder and carbon dioxide instead of egg, with its vegan cheesecake Proctor could also bring his in-laws.
Family firm of the vegan gives a new condiment.
It has dynamic when you boil it together, has a new significance.
"The situations that can arise, however, are as different as the people themselves," Proctor said.
Of course, he was also shown skepticism.
My food tastes you?
"Shall I now feel bad because I drank milk?" - on such issues, we must act as a vegan with sensitivity.
"I reject the people do not, I am part of this society," Proctor would end no enclaves.
And more precisely in the everyday world seems to be not so vegan foreign suspect - and the vegan not restricted in everyday life, as commonly believed.
Even fast food is allowed.
There are French fries everywhere!
"Many travel stores offer falafel, or a vegetarian Yufka," Proctor said.
In a pizzeria he is avoiding on pasta dishes, or everything just order a pizza without cheese, a matter of habit.
The restaurants are so slow.
"When I started 13 years ago to feed me vegan everything was" much more difficult to make the New Zealanders can find a development: "You have to talk to the people, they point out."
"If enough demands come, they are probably inclined to supplement the menu," he hopes.
Vegan restaurants develop, such as the galley in Mannheim, or the café bird.
Proctor has the desire that other restaurants have at least one veganes dish on the menu.
Basically, for all are vegan dishes.
Everyone can eat them, so they are precisely the opposite of exclusivity.
"Meat dishes are not exclusively, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others," Proctor.
"If you want to avoid food scandals, veganism is a safe way, the largest proportion of" to make impossible from the outset, Proctor said.
But the shopping vegan products can be a little difficult at the beginning.
Especially when you learn to understand, which also contain additives in animal peanuts and its donors, it seems to comply with the ethics to leave with so many hurdles and quickly fall of courage.
Not only so Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen wrote a book: "Veganissimo - animal ingredients and their alternatives," explains the many ingredients, but the food is also buried detergents.
"Gradually, it developed a scanner and you know the signs and logos to respect" It is sometimes has to do better than small steps or to stumble, "says Proctor.
Veganism, he is an important moral Remus, which proposes to raise awareness.
Perhaps he can't quite that one of his habits, but at least he can teach consumers to question his habits.
