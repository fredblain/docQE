By air ambulance from North Sea oil rig saving birds released again
An air ambulance to the coast geflogener bird who sleep on a sea-oil rig had been found, was back in the countryside.
Last month, the Wasserralle was flown in a helicopter to Aberdeen, where she was nursed by the Scottish SPCA animal protection organization in their rescue centre near Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the centre, said: "This Wasserralle was probably a wintry migrant from northern Europe, which has been held up by the strong winds over the North Sea."
Apparently, the exhausted bird sought refuge on the oil rig.
He added: "He could no longer continue to fly, which is why we have been contacted with a request for help."
Their release, the Wasserralle was fit and healthy.
