Places through an appeal against sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney in Phuket has been sentenced to 15 days in prison, because they had falsely claimed to have been raped by a taxi driver, has appealed against the sentence and was released on bail.
Stevie Bamford Rochelle was first found by a provincial court in Phuket on June 15, guilty of having made a false statement after she had indicated the Thai police, a local taxi driver told them in the early hours on Sunday, June 10, raped, while two other men clung to them.
Later, however, the photographs showed a video camera that they had arrived safely in their hotel after they had been separated from her Australian boyfriend.
The police in Phuket Bamford interrogated for two days, until she confessed to have invented the story.
Before the trial, she was on the ground in police custody.
Bamford was a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security detention centre stage on the edge of Phuket, rather than in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Rubgy League, to the foreign ministry in Canberra with a request for help for his daughter.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney, the whole family was "extremely concerned" about the welfare of his daughter and wanted them back in Australia.
"We are very concerned, of course, but we hope it is as soon as possible at home," said Tunks.
Bamford has appealed against the ruling and is against a deposit of 50,000 baht at large.
In Australian reports said that it makes in the meantime in the tourist resort of Krabi in southern Thailand.
On the part of the court was to hear Bamford will be represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and had been warned that the appeal could also lead to impose a sentence of up to two years in a prison for adults.
However, it is also possible that Thailand could, after the recent assassination of travel purchase wife Michelle Smith in Phuket have tried to improve its tarnished image of tourism, and it is therefore an acquittal.
