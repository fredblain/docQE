Dr. Georges Bwelle Heroes of 2013 is among the top 10 of the "CNN."
You can do for him or any of the other heroes in the top 10 vote to elect him to the "CNN Hero of the Year."
The winner receives $250,000 to continue its extraordinary work.
21 years, Georges Bwelle looked at how his sick father repeatedly lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals that did not have the resources to help him.
In 1981 Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
First, he had a broken arm, but then an inflammation that extended to his brain and caused a haematoma that would affect him for the rest of his life.
"There was no neuro-surgeon in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
We have released him from Cameroon, if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle years spent to accompany his father into overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment that they had to offer.
"It is not easy," Bwelle comments.
You can leave the house at five o'clock in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, and will not, however.
There are very many patients.
Indeed, some people die, because they have to wait.
The situation has changed little since Bwelles father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
In contrast, the ratio is in the United States with a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there was a doctor for them, most Cameroonians could not afford the visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of health spending in the country are private.
"The only problem we have is," poverty, Bwelle says.
And the poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
His father, and so many of his compatriots are suffering caused to mature in Bwelle decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his voluntary team held 700 free operations last year.
He was even a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a nonprofit organization called ASCO Vime, which travels at weekends in rural areas and free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
He almost every Friday and up to 30 people force in minibuses and drive up to the medical equipment on the roof over unbefestigtes terrain in the villages, need the help.
Not always everything runs smoothly.
More than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they are greeted like heroes: A feast, singing and dancing, and the best accommodation, the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a cause for celebration and Bwelle - with his broad smile and his boundless energy - the joyful celebration.
The next morning, the team begins with the investigation of hundreds of patients.
"We treat 500 people per trip," Bwelle.
You come from a radius of 60 kilometers around the village - and on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offer medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are being treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crutches, donated glasses or free birth certificates, a document that is required for the school, but many poor families simply cannot.
In the evening, the team simple operations with local anesthetic performs.
The operations typically take place in a school, the town hall or an apartment; after the procedure, the patient to stand and walk in the recreation area to make room for the next person.
The lighting for the operation and disinfection equipment is powered by a generator of the group and so Bwelle and his volunteer work until the early hours on Sunday.
It is an arduous work, but the village musicians usually help, motivated to keep the team.
"They drum all night, so we stay awake and able to continue our work," says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team moves back into the city, tired but proud of the work that has been done.
The group - a mixture of Cameroon foreign doctors and medical students - 700 last year has carried out free operations and know that they are with their work makes an enormous difference to the people it helps.
A man explained that the free operation of a work that he had received to work him now and again.
"It changes the future of my family," the man said.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon at the hospital Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
This second job, he is financed by 60% of its charitable activities, Bwelle; the rest come from private donations.
"I really do not know when he sleeps," Katie O'Malley, who studied in the second year at Drexel University in Philadelphia medicine and voluntarily participate in Bwelles group says.
He is always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization, so that he can go to these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students such as O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe and support Bwelle, this is an opportunity to gather practical experience that they would never get at home.
"We can be involved in operations, where we help blood abzutupfen or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwelle," says O'Malley.
That would be in America as a medical student in the second year never possible.
The students pay for their trip to Cameroon usually bring themselves and often donated medical equipment.
But they are only once in Yaoundé, Bwelle accommodation, transport and guide.
"He is very" undoubtedly a hero, O'Malley said.
He has devoted his life to this organization and his desire to help the people of Cameroon knows no borders.
Bwelle for the almost constant work is not a burden.
To help others to a more fortunate life, and to fulfill a promise he made to his father, gives him great pleasure.
"I am so happy when I make this work," says Bwelle.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I do.
I do it to bring people back to laugh and to alleviate the pain.
