New anti-nicotine vaccine could be the pleasure in smoking experiences
Scientists have an anti-nicotine vaccine, which could spoil the fun at the smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice a lifetime against nicotine addiction.
Before tests on humans further tests are needed, which could still take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, said the first results are good.
"We are very hopeful that this kind of vaccination strategy can even help millions of smokers who have tried and tried to stop all methods are available on the market, but saw that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches," said Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been changed so that the genetic information for the manufacture of nicotine-containing antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies chase the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, causing a smoker no nicotine-high.
In experiments vaccinated mice that nicotine was administered retained their normal level of activity.
Mice without vaccination against a "break" would have taken, the researchers said, a sign that the nicotine have achieved their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science translational medicine.
Former tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The vaccines had to be given to maintain the Antik√∂rperpegels so often that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine are likely to be significantly lower, because it transforms liver cells in antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said a future vaccine could, for people if he is sure to be administered to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, and thus prevent nicotine addiction.
It is more likely that smokers would use him to stop.
"You know that if they begin to smoke it, because of the nicotine vaccine, no more pleasure, and that helps them to give up the habit," he explained.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that it still further research is needed.
