It was an unusual, almost ghostly acoustics, which offered the viewer until shortly before the start of the Bundesliga match between the German vice-champion Borussia Dortmund and VfB Stuttgart in the Signal Iduna Park.
To hear the fans were mostly with their voices.
By contrast, the southern grandstand, where the most faithful of the faithful - and loudest - BVB fans, presented himself very quietly: No chants, no battle cries.
The podium of Capo, who coordinates the collective spirit, remained unfilled.
And on the grandstand blew lonely with a large banner reading "section stadium ban."
Just as goalkeeper Roman pastures Feller, as always, was the first BVB player entered the square, two short-lived jubilation.
When his team mates followed, there were loud singing and floating scarves - but not everywhere.

Even that stadium spokesman Norbert naval position unconnected again listed the positive experiences of the last few days - Derby victory, victory over Arsenal, contract extension of coach JÃ¼rgen Klopp - made no mood for celebration.
Only five minutes before the start of the Capo climbed his podium - and the almost tangible tension overflowed with hands in a loud cry when naval position unconnected restaurant had, as usual, the mood in the stands at the stadium.
Finally, as always, the southern grandstand was in the series - and finally was here again, as usual, the loudest place in the stadium.
And no later than kick from the southern grandstand vocal call "Derby winner is" came out, everything was back as ever.
The silence before a reaction to the events of the past few days was good.
Just before behind expectations at FC Schalke 04 had some of the mitgereisten BVB supporters flares into the grandstand and fired on the spot - and almost goalkeeper Roman pastures Feller.
The game was delayed starting whistle because of the chaotic scenes.
BVB-boss Hans-Joachim Watzke, the Dortmund Ultras had subsequently received in his office - and believes one Watzkes words, it was a rather uncomfortable for the Fanvertreter date.
