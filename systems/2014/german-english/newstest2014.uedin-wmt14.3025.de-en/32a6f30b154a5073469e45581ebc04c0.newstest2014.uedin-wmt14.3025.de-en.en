In the morning, the working group migration and integration wanted to continue their deliberations.
It should go, among other things, the issue of dual citizenship, in which both sides have opposing views.

A vignette is a "flat rate for a drive and thus environmentally counterproductive," said the SPD negotiator on the issue, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his group.
