The disposable society thinks not
The night was long, loud music and the mood is good, but at some point it goes home.
Only: In the bellies of the people on the passenger and rear seat of the hunger is apparent.
Clearly, for one or two cocktail and champagne may be responsible.
What is being closer than chilled to the next drive-in to drive to get a little bit to go?
I admit that I am happy with it when it late at night or early in the morning to fast food-fetching.
A couple of French fries and a Coke and a burger - and then as the home and go to bed.
But on the way home are the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco GÃ¤ngern.
What is missing one that constant regularity of its fast-food bags from the car window throws?!
Especially at weekends discarded paper bags around streets and parking lots.
"Why?" I wonder.
The people are too stupid to take the bags home or to the nearest dustbin?
It is not just that the paper stuff, the landscape.
Bags have also been concealed transport facilities such as crash barriers and triggered accidents.
So what is said "disposable society" but not, presumably, they do not even know what that word means.
If you travel frequently in the evening, especially with several people in the car, you know, as a back seat after by celebrated nights can be: Clothes, bottles and other garbage there.
There are a few bags would make more or less but also nix - in contrast to the street, where no one wants to eat on the remains of other rumtrampeln.
Already I can see the day coming when the removal of the cities and municipalities and running - and the fast food chains for their bags to demand deposit.
