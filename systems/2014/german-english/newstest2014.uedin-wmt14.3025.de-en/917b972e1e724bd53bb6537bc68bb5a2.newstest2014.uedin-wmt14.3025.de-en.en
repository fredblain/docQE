George Kerevan: European unbundling gives the Scots election
A new day, a new horror story to independence.
This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to meet the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This is the key word for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a secure border with barbed wire along of Hadrian's Wall.
In fact, it was in the communication template pointed to the potential economic benefits that greater freedom of movement in the rest of Europe would entail, but it played - as expected - no role in the headlines.
No one has also mentioned that the EU member states often bent to their strict rules, if it is cheaper for them.
As Scotland is not part of the Schengen area, would be the continued disregard for Brussels, only a small concession in exchange for what it really wants from the Scots.
So, no story.
And one that has come a long way in the years that they already resembles a fossil: The first time I have the "independence means passport controls" -Ente before at least 40 years.
An interesting point is lost in the constant refrain of this ancient history.
Why should we expect from an independent Scotland, dancing to the tune of Europe?
Why does the London yoke against the trade from Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: The big, taken after the war plan to the unification of Europe has stalled.
With the euro crisis, the project is officially died Europe.
Throughout the EU parties are gaining ground, the EU is hostile or the euro as a common currency would throw overboard.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic party was founded Alternative for Germany - until this year - Edith nearly five million votes in the federal election in September and distribute them effectively, the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There was always domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
The current economic crisis, it turns out, however, as a turning point.
The Berlin and the European Central Bank imposed strict austerity in connection with the straitjacket that the national economy is being forced by adhering to the common currency, many people are of the opinion that the European project has gone too far.
The crisis of the euro has little to do with national governments cause excessive budget deficits - that was only the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem nailed its members to exchange rates that are beneficial for German exporters - and that German politicians would like to keep it that way.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the local currency, Southern Europe finds itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage vis-Ã -vis Germany.
The only way is to cut wages and public spending - spurred on by Berlin.
Behind the current Etat- and currency problems a deeper European productivity problem.
As a result of the prescribed by Brussels "green" energy policies - a code for subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers - the European industry pays compared with the United States twice for electricity and four times for gas.
This is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we have seen in Grangemouth.
All pay fixed the world protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed by cheap US shale gas into the corner.
As a result, a revolt rolls, particularly in France, the former cheerleader of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check and lift Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
However, Paris, Berlin needs no longer as a gateway to the political legitimacy and Europe has imposed its own economic policy, giving the ailing French economy is struggling.
The result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, anti-EU National Front has just won a key by-election, and that the ruling Socialists pointed to three.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France, with 24 percent of the votes - a timely warning for the British Labour Party that they do not want a split in the right spectrum would automatically mean benefits for the left.
What Le Pen with its newly gained popularity is among the white working-class French?
They want the EU elections next year to take an anti-EU, anti-common currency bloc in the European Parliament to forge.
If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections - and it is very well possible - it could be the first time such a block dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point I want to make: In the not too distant future, is the growing resentment against the EU and the single currency together on the abolition of the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will be more "something like that" Europe of (sovereign) nations that General de Gaulle favored.
Germany and its satellite economies may keep the euro, but France and Southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect that Britain distances itself from this project in the hope to curry favour with the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in Pacific suggests that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where Scotland remains in all this?
We can decide a region of (ultimately) Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests, including Berlin and Brussels to say what they are where hinstecken.
I suspect that Scotland could be in a looser European Grouping quite well, as long as we keep our own currency.
The cooperation with others, like-minded countries is not in a federal Europe of the Nations.
Otherwise, we should consider it emulate Norway and keep our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland - remarkably - the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and has a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the rejection of the proposed cuts made (and won), which the Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition were to blame.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence, only to be imposed upon them from Berlin and Brussels austerity.
