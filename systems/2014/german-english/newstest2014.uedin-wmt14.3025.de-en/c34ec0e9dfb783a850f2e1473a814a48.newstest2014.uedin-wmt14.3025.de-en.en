Edwin: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical discussion forum
The next World discussion forum on Monday, October 21, at the New Museum of the castle is the subject of "To hell with the hell - theological reflections on today's dealings with the last things."
Advisor professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical discussion forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Protestant churches Salem, of Salem and the culture ministry Lake Constance.
Johanna Rahner wants to pursue in the forum of the question of how people embrace the "last things" after death.
If the people "in the last few centuries of them knew too much and relied on those images of heaven and hell," which still shape our ideas, the contemporary prophetic doctrine of the hopes for completion by a certain embarrassment or even silence in question.
"The big hope has been driven Christians and Christians by religion criticism marks," the speaker said.
"You have provided us with so many question marks that the exclamation point seem to be lost to us."
Johanna Rahner goes on to say: "But the key challenge remains the bane of death."
This is the question for those longing, "the dreams that everything will be good in the end."
