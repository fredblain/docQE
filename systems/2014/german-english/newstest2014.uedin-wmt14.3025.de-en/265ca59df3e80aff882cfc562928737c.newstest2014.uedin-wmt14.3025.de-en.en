This year will be a Hubertus fair on behalf of St. Hubertus in the parish church of St. Marien at Hüls mountain road.
St. Hubertus legend was a rather ruthless hunter, who was appointed by a vision of converting and later to the Bishop of Liege.
The hunting horn blower group of hunting runner Westphalia led by Brigitte Kluth performed on Parforcehörnern (natural horns in the mood It) to old, originally French melodies.
The brass are riding clothes because they are mainly riders, horse and dog kennel to drag hunts musically.
The fair will take place on Sunday, November 3, at 11: 30.
