Rescue package of 325 million Australian dollars for Tasman's health
The Australian government insists on the harsh conditions of the rescue package of 325 million Australian dollars are linked to the Tasmanian health care to ensure that the state government should not waste the money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth would take "immediate measures" to avert a crisis that has been caused by an ageing population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic disease and system constraints.
The funding for a period of four years, was decided after government consultations with Tasmanian Independent MP Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has put together an emergency rescue package, which, in our view, the unique challenges faced by the state," Plibersek said today.
The 325-million-dollar package includes $31 million in emergency aid for election results.
By further 2,600 operations, including orthopedic surgery and treatments for eye cataracts, residues are to be eliminated.
In addition, there is money for daily clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better aftercare for inpatient stays, the specialist training, mental health services and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.
"These investments are in line with the ideas that affected clinic employees have told me that they are the best way to improve the health care system," Tasmanian Tanya Plibersek said.
The minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability of the Tasmanian government.
The state needs to maintain the current level of funding to be able to receive money from the Commonwealth, and monthly report on where the extra money has been spent.
A three-member commission will be set up and is designed to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie said today, 325 million dollars of little use if "they are not accompanied by real reforms that bring the public Tasmanian health system on a more sustainable course."
Nevertheless, he praised the government that they have responded to his request for urgent aid, which he first expressed to the prime minister at the beginning of May.
"I am confident that the federal aid will make a major contribution to the public health system of the state of the list of worries," Wilkie said.
According to the state government this election services are largely offset the recent cuts.
But the health spokesman for the opposition at the federal level, Peter Dutton, believes that the announcement today is only a "Band-Aid solution."
"We are therefore in the current situation, because the lab-state government 430 million dollars, has withdrawn from the health system," he said on ABC TV.
It is not acceptable that a state government is nearly half a billion dollars from the system and the Commonwealth sticks 300 million and then do so when it is good news.
Dutton urged Plibersek to guarantee that a single dollar of the rescue package will not be spent on additional bureaucracy.
