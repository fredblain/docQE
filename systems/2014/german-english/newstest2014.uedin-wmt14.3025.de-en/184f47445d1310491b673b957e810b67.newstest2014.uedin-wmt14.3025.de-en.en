Europe's elite prepared to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to the table and to define what those who care in Britain for prosperity and work to change in our relations with the EU.
To this end, we have been the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders and asked them what they think about Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business leaders, the roughly the British company sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies now exports outside Europe and focuses on countries which modernize and grow, while the states are languishing in the EU.
You wish that the government of new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil are favoured, rather than the long and arduous process, the obscure to reform EU institutions.
Asked about their views on specific legal issues, from antitrust law to the product legislation - the majority of business leaders, believes that the control of this key competences should be returned to Westminster.
There was widespread dissatisfaction with the single market, as the cost of the Brussels rules, according to the companies would now outweigh the benefits to be part of Europe's trade zone - even 40 percent of large companies agreed to this, which are traditionally the most Europhile.
Finally, and this is probably the most, our survey of business leaders showed that a clear majority of Britain wants a course in the direction of change of the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not on politics.
This finding, which can be found in companies of all sizes and leading corporations, shows that the economy is pushing for a "meaningful change," which brings the tiller back to Britain.
It is about much - a change of the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead at 16 percent to change its mind to stay in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should have no doubts: This survey shows that the British economy behind his plan for the renegotiation of Britain's terms of EU membership.
It also shows that the companies expect a renegotiation of a significant shift in the balance of power back to Britain.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary after the eurozone is moving in the direction of a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority should be jobs and growth in Britain, as the results of our survey shows what companies will mean a greater emphasis on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulation.
