Security concerns in Mozambique grow in the face of clashes between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered in the centre Maputos under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder and first president of Mozambique, in a rare public demonstration, calling for peace.
"We want peace, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, managing director of an investment company.
Out of fear for the future of the country, they have their business attire for a T-shirt with the inscription "We want security" in Portuguese and exchanged the crowd on Thursday in Independence Square in the capital.
For two weeks, there are almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and RENAMO, which are among the worst fighting since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
A notorious rebel movement RENAMO, which was initially supported by the white-ruled Rhodesia and later the apartheid government of South Africa was once in an effort to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the 1992 peace treaty, she became an opposition party.
Analysts believe it is unlikely that the country back case back into a full-scale conflict, but recent events have alarmed foreign investors and locals.
For the fast-growing economy is a lot at stake, since the discovery of huge gas reserves off the coast and coal camps in the northwest over the next few years, could investment of more than $50 billion from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, ENI of Italy and Anadarko from the United States into the country.
The ruling FRELIMO Party, the dominant force since 1975, and RENAMO are blaming each other for the tensions.
RENAMO claims that the government had provoked the recent clashes, as they had attacked on 17 October, its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold Renamos.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated when government troops attacked RENAMO-bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, said Renamos spokesman to the Financial Times.
The government gives RENAMO, the blame for the clashes and accused the organization to have attacked soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to play down concerns about instability.
With AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama regard themselves as a "loser" who "wants to use all its remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions of the government."
Both FRELIMO and RENAMO stress that they want to avoid a war.
But the concerns have increased since Mazanga quoted with the words, RENAMO to give the peace agreement in 1992.
To the FT, he explained that he meant that FRELIMO no longer respect the agreement.
"Our vision is to resume negotiations and" seriously, Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have contributed little to resolving the tensions that have been fired by a series of clashes this year.
"We have two adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama), who heads collide," says Joseph'Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique expert.
None of them are good at bargaining and no one is willing to make the necessary concessions.
RENAMO, which is pressing for electoral reform, has already said that it will boycott the local elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an ailing movement's attempt to obtain concessions and financial incentives from the government.
Shrink Renamos electoral success since 1992, while a new party, a former RENAMO member, founded Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM), likely will improve in the elections.
Mazanga claimed that Guebuza, whose resignation comes when his second term ends next year, wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He wants a multiparty democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he wants no peace because he will not give up the presidency," said Mazanga.
It is unclear what capacity RENAMO, but it has disruptive attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south connections.
Most of the fighting took place in the province of Sofala, which lies a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo, Beira is, however, the port, the mining companies like Rio Tinto and Vale use for the export of coal.
In June, Rio interrupted a month for the use of the railways, after RENAMO announced an attack on the track.
Mazanga responded cautiously to the question of whether RENAMO will repeat that threat.
RENAMO, the international community "wanted to warn that" things are not going well in Mozambique, Mazanga said.
The instability has increased the frustration over the government nor Fernando Lima, Head of Media Coop, an independent media company says, because many people already worried about the corruption, the slow progress in the development and a recent wave of kidnapping.
"People think that the future of the country and the government is responsible for the president and he should be the one to find solutions to the problems," he says.
Omar sultans, a demonstrator, said that people simply wanted stability.
"Nobody interest RENAMO and FRELIMO, they simply want" just peace and usable roads, he said.
