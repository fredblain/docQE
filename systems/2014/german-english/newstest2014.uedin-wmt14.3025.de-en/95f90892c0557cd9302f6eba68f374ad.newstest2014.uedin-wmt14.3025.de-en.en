Gechingen: No absolute protection possible
"We want to involve the people early in the planning," Mayor Jens Häußler opened the public information event for flood protection concept in Gechingen.
About 80 participants had come into the town hall in order to explain the measures planned to ask questions to express concerns and ideas.
Häußler clear: "The ultimate decisions, the members of the municipal council."
The flooding that hit Gechingen on May 15, 2009, unprepared, was a crucial event that raised the question of protective measures for the future, Häußler.
A river basin investigation had been given with the neighbouring village of Stuttgart, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
"The protection of cultivated land" is the goal, Häußler.
Based on the planning of the protection is in front of a noisy German weather service statistically every 100 years to expected flooding.
The climate change is a 15-percent surcharge.
In expert circles, this is called "HQ 100a climate."
The water, which in 2009 Gechingen had resulted in serious damage, represented a 1,000-year flood.
"There is not an absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement," says Häußler.
In order to achieve the protection HQ 100a climate, around four million euros will be invested in Gechingen, with the community can expect to land shots to the tune of around 70 percent.
But Häußler pointed out that there are promoting only if a master plan will be implemented.
The community is dependent on the participation of the citizens.
An elaborate planning and approval process needs to be completed.
In the best case, 2016 could be started with the implementation.
Among other things, the protection plan that was presented last week in the municipal council members of local measures in the flow of the river valley from the IRM Stammheimer envisages.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants took the opportunity to bring their concerns.
Among other things, has been questioned why not more dams and reservoirs are planned for the protection of the place.
Gregor Kuehn, designer of the contracted engineering firms forest and Corbe from hillside home, who introduced the concept, stressed that it needs the cooperation of all measures presented to achieve the desired goal in the sum.
In addition, it is required to find the most economical solution, Joachim forest of forest and Corbe.
There was anger in countries bordering the Altorts who suffer even under normal storm rain again under an overload of the canal network.
The problem is known in the administration and the first steps have already been taken.
However, Häußler pointed out that the guidelines for canal systems are different than for flood protection and it should not be mixed.
The community is obliged to interpret the canal network so that two to three-year rain events will be recognized.
The sewers for bigger, would cost millions.
