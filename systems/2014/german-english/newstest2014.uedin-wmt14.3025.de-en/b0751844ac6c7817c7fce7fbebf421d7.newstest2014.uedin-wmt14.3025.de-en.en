Parents of a teenager from Georgia, who died in a tragic accident, believe in murder
The parents of the teenager, whose body was found in a rolled Ringer mats in the gym of his high school, are convinced that their son was murdered, the family's lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the US state of Georgia was on 11 January in an upright set mat found behind the gallery in the school gym.
The investigators of the Sheriff of Royal Horseguards County concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, the family of the 17-year-olds, however, doubts.
"They are convinced that their son was murdered," said Benjamin Crump, the lawyer of Kenneth and Thesis Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
You would never have believed that he had died just as it had concluded the sheriff.
"They are of the opinion that it lacks any logic, against the laws of physics, as well as against the common sense goes," said Crump.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth will be covered up to protect the person or persons who were responsible for the death of her son.
"Her son went to learning in school and came back in a body bag," he commented.
U.S. prosecutor Michael Moore said on Thursday that there will be a formal investigation into the death of Johnsons, since a number of important issues are still unresolved.
What was the cause of death?
His death is attributed to a crime?
That Moore said at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts in which direction lead them.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe that there is a sufficient basis for a formal investigation," he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy would interpret the fact that Johnson was on the consequences of a "post-related choking" died.
A second autopsy, however, gave a different cause of death, Moore.
"There are a number of issues that need to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if there is sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he would ask the FBI to conduct the investigation.
A representative of the authority of the County sheriff was on our request on Thursday would not immediately willing to comment.
A court in the South Georgias ordered on Wednesday that the authorities must release all the surveillance videos that the investigators have reviewed.
The parents of the teenager said they hoped that the video recordings contained evidence of how he had died.
