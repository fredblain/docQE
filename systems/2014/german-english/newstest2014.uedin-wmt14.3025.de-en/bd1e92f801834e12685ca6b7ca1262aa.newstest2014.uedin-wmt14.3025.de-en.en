The firefighters managed to bring a dog in security, which trapped on a 15-metre-high lead in a rock wall.
The nine months old Cockerspaniel-dog Ruby was after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon running and survived three days alone, on Wednesday, before they were rescued from a quarry.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend, Becky Hall, 20, the dog, came to the quarry Flappit in Denholme, West Yorkshire, Ruby in reception and to thank the firefighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had searched desperately for their missing dog and cries in social networks, while she was personally after the minor traffic accident in the quarry.
At around 2: 15 p.m. on Wednesday saw a pedestrian who said his dog, the Ruby stranded on the 15-meter-high (in the quarry.
The technical rescue team of Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the spot and rope to rescue Ruby, who was then transported in a Hundebox upwards.
Andy Clayton, a specialist of technical rescue teams, said: "She was in a dangerous situation.
She was in the middle of the rock wall - 15 meters from the top and the bottom.
There was no muscle during their rescue - as she was frozen stiff.
But now it is her well.
Then she has eaten a couple of dogs.
This was a very unusual deployment.
The fact that the dog was discovered, is unbelievable.
Peter Lau, a specialist of technical rescue teams, said: "Ruby had a giant luck."
There is the possibility that she was very seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was brought to a veterinarian for the investigation, but said nothing except exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "When watching the rescue was scary."
I could not believe that she was really up there.
It was wonderful to keep them back in the poor.
The vet said if the exhaustion has become too big and it would collapse, they would probably crashed.
The firefighters have done a great job.
It was very brave what they have done.
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added: "We were afraid that they would fall, but they remained above."
The firefighters were great.
I can hardly believe where they were.
