Tourism: Descent to the Romans
At around 120 metres a sewage canal is below Cologne received from the Roman era.
Visiting Cologne, arrived at the cathedral.
Some 157 yards, the two towers soar into the sky, making it the second highest church building in Europe.
But only a few visitors who visit the two ornate spires, suggests that there are also under the cathedral to discover a lot.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in the field of Cologne underworld.
Meeting point for his leadership is the service center of Cologne tourism in front of the cathedral.
The tour starts quite unspectacular: "We start in the garage," says Schulze.
In the 1970s, the city fathers wanted a car-oriented city, and that is why it remained from the remains of the ancient city wall only, which was not too big.
Most users of the Park House pass rush so today the Roman ruins and park their car.
But if you look closely, discovered in the parking deck D2 a metal iron bars separated archaeological site.
To see about five meters high ruins of large stones.
"There are remains of the Roman wall, which was built in the second half of the first century AD," says Schulze.
Before it comes back to light, Schulze will throw the participants on the upper level nor a glimpse into a dark, 15-metre deep well.
This is the fountain of the old cathedral, which, unfortunately, is perceived.
Next stop on the tour is the Pretorian, and here the participants will rise back down into the depths.
We are witnessing the official residence of the once powerful man north of the Alps, the pre-gate of the CCAA.
What does CCAA, a visitor wants to know.
"The abbreviation for" Colonia Claudia Ara Aggripinensium, "which in English means as much as" City of Roman law and city of Agrippinenser, founded by Emperor Claudius at the site of the altar for the emperor worship "."
And the Pretorian is the former proconsul Palace, the power center of the Roman empire on the Rhine.
From the lobby of the exhibition, a tunnel leading to the Roman sewer access, which is preserved here at around 120 meters in length.
"You can go quietly along a step along the so-called Cloaca Maxima, if you want," encourages guests to Schulze.
A surprise Schulze has.
Having taken the key at the box office, he leads the group to a 16 meters deep, walk-shaft.
"We are now in the mikvah, a Jewish ritual bath," he says.
The Jewish community built their bathroom deep into the soil, groundwater, which was essential for the Songkran.
Until now, the tours, whose origins date back to the eighth century are at the lower end, readable different water levels by varying levels of the Rhine.
Mikveh is part of an archaeological area in the town hall square for the construction work will begin soon.
Until the completion of a few years will pass away.
