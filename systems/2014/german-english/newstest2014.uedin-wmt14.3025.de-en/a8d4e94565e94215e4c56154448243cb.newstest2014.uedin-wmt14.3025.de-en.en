Egypt's first freely elected president sworn
Mohammed Morsi places the oath of office, but his day of triumph should not mean the end of the political disputes in Egypt.
The Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a "new Egypt" when he was sworn in as the first freely elected president of the country and took the succession of Hosni Mubarak, who was expelled from office 16 months ago.
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi, the first freely elected Islamist president in the Arab world, and Egypt's fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He took the oath in front of the 18 judges dressed in black robes of the court, which has its headquarters on the Nile and in an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We strive for a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic," Morsi said at the ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.
"Today, the Egyptian people, the foundation for a new life - absolute freedom, a genuine democracy and stability," said the 60-year-old Morsi, a US-trained engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that since its inception in 84 years mostly as a banned organisation of the respective government had been targeted.
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building, when Morsi arrived shortly after 11 p.m. local time in a small car convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered outside the court to cheer the new president, and unlike the presidential pomp from the Mubarak-era was only briefly stopped traffic, so that the car convoy was able to cross the usually bustling streets, the city centre with the southern suburbs.
When the Brotherhood uncharismatisches "spare tire" mocked his personal prestige has grown since his victory and a Friday speech in which he wanted to express itself not only as a candidate of the Islamists, but all those presented to the aspirations of the uprising in 2011 from the year against the authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt" is now a civilian, national, constitutional and modern state, in a blue suit with a red tie clad Morsi told the judges in the wood-panelled chamber, where he took the oath of office.
Morsi later went to the University of Cairo, where he should keep his inaugural speech.
He was officially welcomed by a military band played the national anthem, which he listened to in Habachtstellung.
The military leader, Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
He was on his arrival of hundreds of people in the main auditorium of the university, chanting "The army and the people are welcomed a hand."

Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, the birthplace of the uprising last year at the end of the authoritarian rule of Mubarak, and vowed to reclaim presidential powers that the military council of the hunted leader from office.
But, with the departure of the official oath before the court and not as usual in front of the parliament, he defers to the will of the military, indicating that the power struggle will continue.
Morsi's speech at the Tahrir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
