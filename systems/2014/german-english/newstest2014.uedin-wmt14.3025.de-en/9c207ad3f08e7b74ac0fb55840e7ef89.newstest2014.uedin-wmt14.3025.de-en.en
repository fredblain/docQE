Jumbo manufacturers argue in the face of large orders for seat width
Between leading aircraft manufacturers, there has been a debate about the width of seats in economy class on long-haul flights, which sets the tone for a bitter clash at the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute revolves around the seat width offered passengers on long flights in economy class - not always the ones that airlines seek the most, but the designated area is the key to the effectiveness of claims in the latest aircraft from Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for an industry standard, which is a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in economy class, but the US January Boeing says that the airlines should decide.
The controversy comes at a time when the aircraft manufacturer vying to sell even larger versions of its twin-engine long-haul planes, and expected at the event from 17 to 21 November record orders.
As the rear part of the plane is fleshed out, especially if it ranks with nine or ten seats - is crucial to the economic results indicated that the new "mini-jumbo" design is to deliver.
Boeing claims its modernized "777X" group 406 people in seats in economy class, which is about 17 inches wide and so allow 10 per series.
Airbus says that the competing version of the A350 car 350 people in 18-inch wide seats in economy class, and there are nine per series.
Aircraft giants often share of blows on technical details through advertisements in the trade press.
Airbus now calls before the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X, with over 100 orders are expected to make the race, directly to the public.
Recently, the company introduced an ad that showed the start of a new war and donors could display a picture in which three people are squeezed in a restaurant, and accept the title: "Would you?"
"Boeing is proposing long-haul flights in seats that are more closely than regional turbo-props," says Airbus sales chief John Leahy.
In the face of changed eating habits, the people are thicker, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined the modern long-distance travel, and the end of the century, has the weight of the average American male between 40 and 49 years increased by 10 percent, the data from the US Health Ministry.
The average American Taillenumfang of male in the 21st century, according to US health statistics 100,8 cm.
Airbus says that his rival is a seat concept from the 1950s, when the average body size of the fresh "Jet Set" was slim.
We have, as Airbus, carried out studies that showed that raises an extra inch (2.54 cm) per seat, the quality of sleep by 53 percent.
Boeing disputes the figures of Airbus on the seat and says it is not at the discretion of the manufacturers to decide how the balance between airlines flight fares and body shape.
The company also explains, according to surveys, the experience in the plane depends on more than the seat width.
"It is really important to give companies flexibility, so that they can do what they think they need to be successful," the airline cabin expert Kent Craver explained by Boeing.
You do not want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.
You know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, it is about more elbow, but for manufacturers, it is increasingly an issue that can affect the sales.
Behind the dispute is a race for aircraft orders, with an estimated volume of at least 700 billion US dollars at list prices in the coming decades, what a profound impact on the export performance of the US or Europe could impact.
As Reuters reported in July for the first time, the seating layout is the driving force behind the debate about the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing say 20 percent more efficiency per seat in its latest twin-engine long-haul designs as the market leader in this segment, the 365-seater Boeing 77-300ER.
Boeing's statements on the results depend in part on the fact that the 777X with its ten seats per row is compared with the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased cost per unit is still lower than currently used machines with ten seats per row.
"Boeing Quet CHT so more seats in his plane to make it more competitive for our products," Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort in the European Airbus says.
On the other hand, analysts say, full cabins with ten seats per row with existing feature indicated that many passengers could opted for closer arrangement, which go hand in hand with cheaper air fares.
"Eighteen-inch seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is that, from an economic point of view is the Airbus offer from the threat of the 777-driven," said Mary Kirby, an expert on cabin no direction, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing offer no seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which the airlines can choose.
The world passenger jet sellers bear even tape measure, the establishment of the competition after expending.
Even if they extol the convenience, all manufacturers offer but also jets with hochverdichteter design for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus A350, with 10 seater series, has sold but say none.
Until recently, Airbus has stressed the importance of greater adaptability of the cabin and was offered for some Jets wide seats in the corridors.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the call for a new industry standard will probably fizzle, but the wave of 777X-sales could distract.
