The electricity is more expensive in Pfullendorf
The citizens Pfullendorfs must adapt to higher electricity costs.
As the director of the municipal works, Jörg-Arne bias, opposite the SUEDKURIER confirmed, on a four-person family Pfullendorfer 70 to 90 euros per year in additional costs.
The main reason for the upcoming price increase is the rise of so-called EEG levy of 5,277 at 6.3 cents per kilowatt-hour.
This levy is set in October every year from the four operators of the major power lines.
They put them out of the Energiewende excess costs, which they can raise through a levy on the price of electricity.
The city Pfullendorf works are the last link in this chain.
The supervisory board of the energy company was in its forecasts, even from a higher levy, like Jörg-Arne bias.
Now the specific pay should be calculated before the Stadtwerke next week could inform their customers about the exact price increase.
"We go from an increase of 1 cent plus x from" bias, with the number rather close to the 2 cents will lie.
