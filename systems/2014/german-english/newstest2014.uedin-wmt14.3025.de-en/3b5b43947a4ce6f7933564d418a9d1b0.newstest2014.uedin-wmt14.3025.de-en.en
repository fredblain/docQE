When the horse experts in droves in Cardiff, brought together in order to select the horse of the year, they were aware that a rat race before.
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The kid, who is not even in kindergarten, and only a few months ago, made his first steps, and his Shetland pony-toffee trotted only loosely through three rounds and got the first prize, while 30 adult opponents left behind.
The 16 pairs, both of the same size, have been praised for their appearance, attitude and style at the annual competition, which is being organized by the Sunny Bank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
During his appearance in competition against men and women with elegant melons he had put his plate cap in a cheeky angle and led the two-year-old Toffee by the ring.
Fenton was praised by the judges for his natural abilities in dealing with the pony, which would be far beyond his age.
And toffee received top marks for his appearance and his personality.
Fenton had Toffees last March as a gift for his third birthday and since then every day with the Shetland pony.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: "Fenton and Toffee are a great team."
You had to compete against the entire field of participants and have gone with gold trophy and rosette.
It was only the second time that he had taken part in a competition with toffee, and we were all excited when he won.
Complete strangers in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who for more than ten years.
Howells said: "The whole audience was like hooked and all have cheered him and geklatscht."
He ran on sand, the entire length of the arena, and although he looked so tiny, he has done a fantastic job.
Fenton is crazy about animals - he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens that he cares.
Just as he started, it will not be long before he is on the "horse of the Year" shows - and I am sure he will do well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show said: "Fenton is only three, but he knows what he has to deal with his pony."
Together, they are a great team.
The jury considered Fenton and toffee how well they fared well in the Vorf√ºhrring would have presented.
Pay attention to good cooperation between pony and leader - and Fenton and Toffees were the best in the ring.
I am sure that Fentons sweet clothing has played its part, that really perfectly suited to the occasion.
