Tax for foreign real estate owners against London's speculative bubble
The Treasury has provisionally calculated the CGT-measure, but still waiting for the final decision by Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, in the budget for 2012, a stamp tax at a rate of 7% had imposed on homes that cost more than two million pounds, as well as annual fees for buyers, the apartments as a company and not as individuals.
Already exceed the revenue from the stamp duty on residential property in the districts of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, who were on the fiscal year 2012 / 13 at 708 million pounds, the proceeds for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North East, North West, Yorkshire and the Humber region combined.
Cook said: "After the increase in the stamp tax on high-priced homes and the introduction of legislation against the circumventing one can hardly claim that high-value properties are taxed too low, despite the impact of the old county tax system."
"But this step could make some foreign investors cautious about buying property in London, or prevent owners to sell," he added.
First-class real estate - the top five to ten percent of the housing market after prices - in London's affluent southwest belt, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, gave rise to a record 11.8% last year.
Prices in central London had a steady annual growth of 5.6%, but were from an emerging "overshadowed" domestic market, where the southwestern part of the city, the North (7.4%) and the East (6.5%) experienced an upward trend, according to a survey by Savills.
