ESA decides on large space missions: Missions for billions
Distant planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects, which they want to start in the next few years.
30 proposals were available, five are still in the race.
Distant worlds.
More than 1,000 planets around other stars, astronomers have already found.
Whether there is at least some of them, no one knows.
The selection is difficult: One is to look for gravitational waves?
Or prefer to explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or go to discover billion planets and thus perhaps alien life?
These issues, the leaders of the European Space Agency ESA.
For her program "Cosmic Vision" they are looking for ideas for two major space projects to advance the research.
The budget for such "L-missions" is about a billion euros.
The launch is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, the elite of the European Space Research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas on the table, five of which have come into the final round.
Many bodies examine the proposals, according to the researchers.
In the next few days, a final decision by the scientific program committee should fall.
A total of four major issues has chosen the Esa, which is to find the missions of the programme initiated in 2007 "Cosmic Vision" answers.
What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life?
The exact processes in the formation of stars from large clouds - and thus the formation of planets that orbit their stars - are still in the proverbial dark.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has a planet, under what circumstances life can there be?
Following this issue, is expected to start in 2017, the space telescope "royal dynasty," with the 500 known planetary systems are being investigated in our neighbourhood.
The options are limited, however, his is a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million.
With larger instruments astronomers could map erdähnliche planet and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres and search for "biomarkers" so: Gases, which are seen as an indicator for biological activity.
As the solar system works?
This question will ultimately be light on what conditions are there for the emergence of life.
An important part of the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field and the particle radiation emanating from him with the planetary system.
In our solar system, these events can be investigated as an example.
The Solar Orbiter "Esa has already a mission of the M-Class (there is the budget at about half a billion euros) for this issue.
The probe is expected to start in 2017 and observe surface and activity of the sun.
Of great interest to the researchers are Jupiter and its moons.
You want to find out what role of the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system.
The Esa sees the first of three L-missions of the "Cosmic Vision" programme.
The probe "Juice" (Jupiter Icy moons Explorer) begins its journey to 2022.
Eight years later, she reaches Jupiter and is designed to study the atmosphere of the planet and the icy moons Europa and Ganymede KALLISTO.
What are the fundamental physical laws of the universe?
The space offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions, and thus to investigate whether the laws of nature we know there are still valid.
Perhaps deviations that could show the physicists on the way to a new theory that all known laws of nature can be combined.
How the universe was created and what it is?
13.7 billion years ago, our universe was created by the Big Bang.
In addition to the familiar material from the stars, planets and life as we are, there are dark matter, whose gravity galaxies and galaxy clusters, and dark energy, through which the expansion of the universe is accelerating.
So far, the researchers do not know what were valid physical laws in the first split second of the Big Bang - measuring CMB, providing dark matter and dark energy.
"Euclid" has the Esa here already approved an M-mission, whose launch is scheduled for 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe will examine the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the whole sky and provide information on the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could make the race
Only two of the 30 proposals will remain at the end of the selection process left.
The best chances for a permit as L-mission, according to many experts "E-Lisa," an ambitious concept for the detection of gravitational waves.
Some physicists changes in the structure of space-time that Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago.
They were not yet proven.
Elisa that could create, the scientists hope behind the project.
The mission provides a two or three probes existing detector, which is stationed in space.
It could prove contrary to plant on earth, gravitational waves that were created in the Big Bang, and so provide new insights into the origins of the cosmos.
Four other proposals are competing for the second L-mission: A large X-ray telescope called "Athena," which, among other things, is to study black holes, "Icy Planets," another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism," a mission to survey the cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder," the planet is to detect and investigate erdähnliche.
Already retired include proposals for the samples-returning from Mars, the exploration of the moon, Venus and asteroids, as well as to the solar physics.
