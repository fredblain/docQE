Frontier Airlines charges for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to up to 100 dollars to demand from passengers who want to stow away on their flight hand luggage.
Frontier Airlines intends to up to $100 for a piece of hand luggage and 2 dollars for coffee or soda to calculate, even though the announcement on Wednesday was to read that passengers should keep the entire can.
The new fee applies to hand luggage in the overhead baggage compartment above the seat, small bag under the seat remain free.
Frontier said it charged 25 dollars if the fee will be paid in advance, and $100 for travelers who paid only at the gate.
Frontier-spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the fee of $100 introducing to move travelers, in the run-up to the payment.
"We do not want to charge this amount," she said.
Airlines began in 2008 to demand for the first and second checked baggage fees.
Passengers who tried to evade them, therefore, have plugged into the cabin baggage as much as possible, with the result that the baggage compartments are often overcrowded over the seat.
Fees are a way to encourage passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said the new fee was not really trying to make money.
It is about the most loyal customers of Frontier, which had clearly expressed that it will be increasingly difficult to find space in the box above the seat.
Passengers who buy your tickets on the website of the airline, will not have to pay.
This means that a passenger at the gate of Frontier, under certain circumstances should carry a bag for free, but the next person must pay $100 for a similar baggage.
O'Malley said that the site of Frontier and the self-service check-in procedures would be changed so that the passengers were informed about the fee before they come to the gate.
The new hand baggage fee of Frontier only enters into force in the summer, there is an exact date yet.
Passengers often ranting about baggage fees and other charges, but airlines are keen to return to it.
They argue that the transportation of the baggage costs money and passengers should pay for this service, if they wanted him.
Many on Wall Street view the new baggage fees as a sign that the airlines have enough money to cover after years of losses, the cost of air travel.
Most are so far, however, the fingers of charges for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded three years ago as the first charges for hand luggage and, later, the giant Air, a low-cost carriers.
The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, said the airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely follows the additional charges.
He estimated in a report in December 2011 that the hand baggage fee Spirit annually bring 50 million US dollars.
Sorensen, who previously held a senior position in Midwest Airlines, recently flown with spirit and was curious about what he would expect at the gate, where passengers with the unusual hand baggage fee, the company would face.
"The boarding process was one of the most fluid, which, in my career, I have experienced in aviation," he said.
I expected to see gnashing of teeth and physical discussions at the gate.
"The plane was full," he said, "and the boarding ran like lubricated."
Frontier spirit is also the 2 dollars, which are required for coffee, tea, soda or juice.
The company said that passengers who bought lemonade or juice, which would keep all can and will be filled with free coffee.
Water is still free of charge.
Us Airways tried briefly in 2008 to demand for soft drinks, it made money, but reversed seven months later, after passengers had complained and no other large company.
Frontiers step to charge fees for hand luggage if passengers don't buy directly from the airline, is the latest initiative to customers on their own website should be directed.
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as orbitz 10 to 25 U.S. dollars per ticket sold.
It provides an incentive for all societies, passengers to buy directly from them rather than moving through an online travel agency.
Frontier has gone in this area, however, most.
In September, the company began, when booking through an online travel agency, only half as many frequent flyer miles.
On Wednesday, the miles have been cut again to 25 percent of the flight.
A third-party booked a flight with Frontier over 1,000 miles brings customers, therefore, only 250 miles.
Passengers can also book solely with the direct purchase on the website of Frontier.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in Denver, but the business is shrinking, and the company is losing money.
The revenue fell by 9 percent and the flight capacity fell almost 13 percent in the first quarter, as reported in the financial report, which was released on Wednesday by the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc., released.
Republic has tried to get under the sale of the company's finances of Frontier.
