Council takes track facilities targeted
The railway crossing "On the deer" elaborate to be converted to increase the safety?
Yes, the local councils have decided.
Schiltach must take for 220 000 euros.
The Deutsche Bahn wants to next year's Kinzigtal line.
In particular, the security at railway crossings should be increased - it is regularly nationwide to collisions of trains with other vehicles.
The communities agree to the restructuring measures, they must with a third of the cost, with the rest divided and federal.
Schiltachs city builder Roland Grießhaber explained to the council the peculiarities of the Bahübergangs "On the deer."
There, the city plans to build in the amount of the tunnel mouth west of the railroad tracks a bulge.
There are also larger vehicles could, for example, to those who transport logs, standing at oncoming traffic, blocking the tracks.
Grießhaber therefore proposed to construct a retaining wall so that the city could widen the subsequent street at the appropriate time to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This has been discussed in the council controversial, as some councils, the need for a road expansion in doubt: Thomas Kipp said in his statement, the mood of the critics: "We must because so few vehicles have so much money?"
Mayor Thomas Haas disagreed: The railway crossing "deer" will be used regularly for long wood shipments.
Even the wood from the area "Kuhbach" will be transported via this route, in part, because the up to 20 meters long vehicles could use the route along the Häberlesbrücke because they could not turn into the main road.
In addition, the route serves as a diversion for those vehicles that do not use the tunnel, if the road is blocked, Haas argued.
It is conceivable that church mountain and Schlossberg tunnel and need to be cleaned up, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the railway crossing "On" deer "for an extended period, an important traffic.
The council agreed to investigate what costs would cause the expansion of the street.
Regardless of the reconstruction of the railway crossing the majority agreed with the proviso that the necessary supporting wall will be built in such a way that the subsequent road towards "Bahnhofstrasse" if necessary to meet the city traffic could increase to around 5.5 meters.
The reconstruction of the railway crossing in the tanning Trautwein could draw against a different problem, which is access to the strong growth "Geroltzhäuser way."
The administration had to examine the restructuring plans of the railway from the engineering firm Breinlinger, because they had doubts as to whether the planned end of Geroltzhäuser route is possible even without further ado.
The study concluded that it cannot be ruled out that the tendency of road conditions could lead to longer vehicles do.
The responsibility for this, in turn, carrying the city as a road last winner.
The change could therefore take liability disputes.
Since both the wood collection and turning in the current state of development work to support the reconstruction of the railway crossing, Haas argued.
The risk of a collision of the train is here with a vehicle on the transition are significantly lower than in the other railroad crossings, because the mid-point is right next to it, which is a good visual contact.
Even the terms should be spirals at this juncture that no collision threatened.
The approval was largely the reconstruction of the railway crossing refused because the city Schiltach "the problem with aufsitzenden vehicles" would have to pay for, the councils, as the railway could after completing the construction of the responsibility.
In 2006, the panel considers the changes of the railway crossings "Before the village" and "Before Kuhbach" that have already been made arrangements with the railway junction.
