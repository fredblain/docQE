The closest advisers of President Barack Obama have considered in secret to replace Vice President Joe Biden in the 2012 campaign by Hillary Clinton, the New York Times.
The revelation is the surprise of the long-awaited work by Mark John and get healthy man on the 2012 campaign, "Double Down: Game Change 2012."
The Times is a copy of the forthcoming book, and they reported on Thursday evening that the president Topberater "extensive group meetings and opinion polls at the end of 2011" had carried out to find out whether the appearance of Obama's dwindling hopes of re-election better if he let fall Biden.
According to Jonathan Martin, national political correspondent for the Times, the book carefully traces the history of efforts from senior officials of the campaign and the White House to exchange names of former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley to measure what effect it had on the poll numbers, the former Secretary of State Clinton against the vice president.
The potential change was a closely guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and in the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president's closest advisers - including Daley, Obama's former campaign manager, Jim Messina, and the former White House senior adviser, David Axelrod and David Plouffe, knew about the planned change.
In "Double Down" is claimed, Daley had stood at the forefront of efforts to exchange Biden, despite their "close, personal relationship" before it finally decided against such a move after the data showed that the Clinton's candidacy "would not significantly improve the chances of Obama."
In an interview with Martin Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered to replace Biden by Clinton.
"I made a whole series of things that you should consider, and this was one of them," Daley told the magazine.
We must remember that the president had terrible poll numbers, so we thought: "For God's sake, what do we do?"
While Daley described the investigation as "due diligence," Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN said that the re-election of considerable effort has been made during the campaign to find out whether such a move is paid in relation to the ballot box.
"In campaigns is not spent so much money on surveys and focus groups, if you don't think seriously about something," said Martin on AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team thought about an exchange.
Martin said on CNN, he asked Daley whether his former boss had known about the potential change.
Although Daley said that he does not believe that the president of the possible change was "aware" that the former chief of staff, admitted that it was "possible" that Obama did not know about it.
Martin added that "Double Down" deliver a definitive answer to the question of whether the political soundings have reached Obama's desk.
Martin Cooper, whether he seriously think asked Obama knew nothing of the inquiries about whether we should let Biden in the elections.
"Possible," said Martin.
