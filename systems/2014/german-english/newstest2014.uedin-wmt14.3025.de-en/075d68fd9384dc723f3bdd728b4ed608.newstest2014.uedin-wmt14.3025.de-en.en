In the officials
I was asked to write to you for your examination of mass surveillance.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and used to be contractually or via a direct employment as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA employed) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
In the course of my employment in these facilities, I have been witness to systematic violations of the law of my government, which led me from a moral obligation to act.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I saw myself, I faced a serious and persistent smear campaign that forced me to leave my family and my home.
I currently live in exile and enjoy temporary asylum, which the Russian Federation in accordance with international law grants to me.
I am encouraged by the response to my political action, both in the US and elsewhere.
People around the world, and even senior officials - including the United States - have the revelations of mass surveillance to a system that is answerable to, as judged a service to the public.
The spying revelations attracted many proposals for new laws and directives that the previously concealed abuse of the public trust.
The benefit to society from these findings is becoming clearer; at the same time, the risks taken in buying were visibly reduced.
Although the result was demonstrably positive about my efforts, my government dissent, still as a breach of loyalty and seeks to criminalize political expression and put on trial.
Nevertheless, to the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the government of the United States, with the support of the international community will take this damaging attitude.
I hope that I will be the humanitarian situation if the problems are resolved, the ability to take part in the responsible clarification of the facts about the statements made in the media, particularly with regard to truth and authenticity of the reports, appropriately and in accordance with the law.
I look forward to a conversation with you in your country, once the situation is resolved and I thank you for their efforts to uphold international law that protects us all.
