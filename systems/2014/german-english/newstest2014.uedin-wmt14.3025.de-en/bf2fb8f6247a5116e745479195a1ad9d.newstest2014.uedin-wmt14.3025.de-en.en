U.S. border: "Super-tunnel" discovered the drug smuggling
On the border between Mexico and the United States have a "super-tunnel investigators" for drug smuggling discovered and shut down.
As the US Customs told, was the more than 500 meters long tube between Tijuana and San Diego with electricity, railway tracks and a ventilation system.
Thus, three suspects were arrested, seized eight tons of marijuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine.
The tunnel had been taken, according to the information not yet in use.
"These cartels are stupid if they think they can get away by digging under the radar," said the general prosecutor of the US District Southern California, Laura Duffy, at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego, where one end of the tunnel had been discovered.
Turning to the drug gangs, Duffy said: "If you continue to build such tunnels and trying to use them, we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money."
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a long-running fight against the drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77, 000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with the drug-related crime.
Constructed by experts
Because of the elaborate equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it was designed by architects and engineers, and that the construction took about a year to complete.
The railway track was designed in such a way that electrically powered cars could be deployed there.
On the Mexican side of the access is located in a building, which is 80 meters from the border.
According to authorities, a ladder leads 20 meters in depth to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters in height and 90 centimetres wide.
In doing so, he would have been well suited to encourage illegal immigration to the US.
Two of the suspects were in connection with the cocaine-Fund arrested.
The third, a Mexican, was taken because of the confiscated marijuana.
All three face a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, officials said.
Since 2006, eight such tunnels have been discovered, it further said at the press conference in San Diego.
But it is the first time that cocaine was found in a tunnel.
Normally, cocaine is smuggled in small quantities and not through tunnels.
This shows the "desperation" of drug gangs, whose traditional routes are cut off by now, Bill Sherman of the drug investigation DEA in San Diego said.
You would do everything to get into the United States.
The detainees, no details have been announced, at least one is Mexicans, it said.
You have to reckon with prison sentences of up to 10 years.
