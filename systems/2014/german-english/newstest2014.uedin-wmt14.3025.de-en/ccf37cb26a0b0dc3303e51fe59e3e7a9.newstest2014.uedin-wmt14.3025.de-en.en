After oil prices are up to $96 per barrel
The price of oil has fallen even further on Friday, after concerns about a high offer overshadowed a report that the energy-hungry China's manufacturing sector is growing.
The benchmark crude oil for delivery in December had fallen by late morning in Europe in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, up 14 cents to $96,24 per barrel.
The contract fell 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a fall of 5.8 percent in October.
The large crude oil supply has weighed on prices in recent weeks.
The Department of Energy of the United States said on Wednesday, the US offer last week have increased by 4.1 million barrels.
Over the course of five weeks, the offer was increased by 25 million barrels.
But on Friday, there were signs of stronger demand by two reports of an increase in activity in the Chinese manufacturing.
This points to a continued recovery of China's economy, whose growth has risen to 7.8 percent in the third quarter, after it was reached in the previous quarter at its lowest level in two decades.
The variety of Brent crude, a benchmark for international crude also used by U.S. refineries, fell on the ICE exchange in London by 26 cents to $108,58 per barrel.
