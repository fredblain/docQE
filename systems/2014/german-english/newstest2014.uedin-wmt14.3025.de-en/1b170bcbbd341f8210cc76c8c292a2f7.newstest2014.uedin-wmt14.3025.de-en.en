Instead of learning unemployed: Pilot project for unskilled in tourism
At the Mecklenburg Seenplatte today launches a pilot project for the tourism industry.
Under the leadership of the Federal Employment Agency 49 women and men who are already working as unskilled in the industry, for hotels and restaurants across three winter to be qualified professionals.
"What is new is that the six-month courses with qualifications" end, Carmen Wiechert from the labour agency Neubrandenburg said.
The benefits are many: The participants would not unemployed, the companies would have trained professionals who increasingly lacked in hotels and restaurants, and the agency should not finance unemployment.
The project is also the Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Neubrandenburg, as well as the German hotel and restaurant association (coordinated) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
