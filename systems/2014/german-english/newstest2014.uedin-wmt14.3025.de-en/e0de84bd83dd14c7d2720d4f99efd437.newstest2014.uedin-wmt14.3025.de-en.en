NSA says, an "internal error" and not hackers are to blame for the crash of the site
The shadow of National Security Agency said late Friday that a mistake had crippled their public Web site a few hours and not hackers, as has been claimed online.
"NSA.gov tonight was unavailable for several hours, as during a scheduled update an internal error," explained the spy agency in a message sent via e-mail.
The problem will be resolved this evening.
The claim that the outage was executed by a distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) has been caused, is not true.
In the early evening hours spent online server sites noticed that the NSA website at least six hours was not available and this will continue for some users.
Earlier, a spokesman for the NSA to ABC News had declared that the sensitive internal network of the authority was "compromised in any way."
Secret information is not in danger, the spokesman.
At least one group of said was, the NSA website with a DDoS-attack crippled.
In such attacks, the target site is awash with page until the servers are overloaded and the site will collapse.
The cyber tactic is relatively simple and the attacks do not serve to penetrate into the internal network of the target system.
The super-secret NSA, whose nickname once No search Agency (No such authority) was now finds himself in the bright light of the public and sees itself in recent months after the reported revelations about their extensive surveillance program at home and abroad under severe criticism - a result of the secret NSA data from disaffected former NSA employee Edward Snowden stolen and published.
The growing controversy over the secret police fired on initial speculation that the incident today is the result of a deliberate Cyperoperation.
