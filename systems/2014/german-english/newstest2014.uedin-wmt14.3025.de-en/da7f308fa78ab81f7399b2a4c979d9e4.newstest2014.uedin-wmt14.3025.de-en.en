Chinese newspaper should be reformed to call "
A Chinese newspaper, which had demanded on the front page of the release of a reporter who had been charged with defamation should be reformed, a press regulator said.
The Guangzhou-based New Express had printed a rare public call for the release of the journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen admitted later on television that he had accepted bribes to forge reports on a part of state-owned company.
Now, the New Express will be subjected to a "comprehensive Rektifizierung," said the regulator.
The "Rektifizierunganordnung" was issued by the authority for press and publications, radio, film and television in Guangdong.
Preliminary investigations showed that the New Express, which belongs to the Yang Cheng Evening News Group, between September 2012 and August 2013, several inaccurate reports of the listed companies posted zoom Lion.
"The editorial management of the New Express was disorganized," the regulator announced in a statement.
She said that they had decided to impose an administrative penalty for Chen Yongzhou and to deprive him of his reporter license. "
"We have also instructed the Yang Cheng Evening News Group to carry out a full Rektifizierung of the New Express and recommended to identify the relevant authorities in the New Express and the leadership team of the New Express to check."
Chen had written several articles for the New Express, where he reported on alleged financial irregularities at a manufacturer of construction equipment called Zoom Lion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and stood behind his journalistic work.
But Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports against payment.
"In this case, I have zoom Lion damaged as well as the entire news industry and its ability to win the trust of the public," he told the state news channel CCTV.
I did it in the first place, because I was on money and fame.
I realized that I have done wrong.
In the wake of Chen's apology, the New Express published an apology on the front page and declared that they had failed to verify the reports.
Various known suspects have recently placed on television confessions.
Experts say that confessions are still routinely forced to force despite a change in the law at the beginning of the year in which the authorities have been banned, someone to blame themselves.
