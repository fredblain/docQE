Nick rank-bashing for Schiris: No swallows seduce king
Ralf Rangnick so satisfied with the current high form of league-leaders Red Bull Salzburg, was disappointed by the sporting director of the "bulls" by the referees.
"There is currently a dangerous tendency to seduce and Alan" are being pushed into the category of swallows kings, he took the two Offensivwirbler on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg.
The recent rise in rank nicks criticism was yellow to seduce at 3-0 against Grödig last Sunday, in which the Senegalese an alleged acting doomed - which was not, however, as the TV pictures showed.
"A gross misjudgment," Rank Nick, the referee Harkam described as "completely overwhelmed," said.
Harkam also had "its part" to the escalation between Salzburg coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig-coach Adi Hütter after the game.
He defended his fellow countryman firmly: "I would have me in every situation just behave like Roger Schmidt."
Schmidt itself will have had after the skirmish with Hütter no contact with his colleague.
I do not know why.
"Because I am the one who has been offended," said the 46-year-old.
In the light of the successful run rank Nick sang a eulogy.
"There are only two words:" Really well, he noted.
There is not much to suspend.
Above all, the way the team plays, is impressive.
This should continue quietly.
Kader changes in the winter transfer period, it will be difficult.
There is no great reason to change something.
"Except for a player approaches in the hope that he wants to leave the club," said Rank Nick.
