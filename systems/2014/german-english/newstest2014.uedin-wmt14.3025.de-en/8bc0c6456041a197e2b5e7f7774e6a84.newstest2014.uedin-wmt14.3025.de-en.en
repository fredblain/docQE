Germany's largest country church has launched an offensive to promote the work of the pastor.
The background is a possible priest shortage: Divine country church Hanover expects that the number of their current 1,800 pastor and pastors to present situation by 2030.
For young people of today, the work is very attractive and offer good prospects, Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) said in an interview with the press service.
It is attractive to determine the work and daily routine itself.
With the country Burfien church has commissioned a pastor for the first time at a full point to inspire young people to study theology.
Currently, fewer and fewer young people decide after graduating to study theology.
This leads Burfien back on the process of secularisation: "God's voice is quiet, the world is" out loud.
The work of great freedom and diversity is shaped.
I am Mr my calendar and I can put my focus there, where it is important to me.
Pastor pastors could be very close to the people.
They earned as much as teachers and could live well.
Certainly, more will be paid in the free economy, but would have a secure employer theologians.
This brings me to the young people of today, it is not just about career, but a meaningful work.
According to the national church, which includes three-quarters in Lower Saxony, around 60 pastors are now a year into retirement.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology student start their Order.
In sparsely populated regions such as the resin - or the Wendland could be difficult in the future to fill vacancies.
Among other things, have Burfien wants to hold study days for young people and also invite celebrities who studied theology.
The studies offer a broad education.
You can even be President.
