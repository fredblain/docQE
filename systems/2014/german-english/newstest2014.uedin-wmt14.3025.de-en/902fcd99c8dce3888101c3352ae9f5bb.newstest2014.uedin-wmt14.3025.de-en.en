Land Rover Rally Series announced
The interior are racing seats and six-point belts and an overmold.
The options range from enhanced brakes, a service package of care for Bowler Works-mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, managing director of Bowler Motorsport, said: "The rally-customers who come to Bowler, have changed."
They are not all experienced cyclists, but people who are looking for excitement and adventure, and after an achievable path to world-class events.
We are looking forward to this path in partnership with Land Rover and Ma to open and believe that the format opens up new possibilities, the various rally-disciplines in Britain and abroad to experience and newcomers to the rigours and the reality of Rally Raid.
We really had fun, the Defender Challenge-car to develop - this is an entertaining championship.
In addition, there is the Defender Challenge, a training and crash in February, as well as the option to participate in desert race in North Africa and the Middle East.
