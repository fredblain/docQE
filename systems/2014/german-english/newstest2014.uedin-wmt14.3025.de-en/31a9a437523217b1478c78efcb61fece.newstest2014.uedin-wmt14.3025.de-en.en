Foreign workers on 457 visas could be subjected to "authenticity test"
The government thinks extended measures in the framework of a "authenticity test" for foreign workers on 457-visa.
The test should be introduced, he came across a criterion used to prevent the 457 to fill unskilled jobs or used as a back door for the influx of family and friends to Australia.
Today, the government has been discussing a proposal published after the former members of the Labor Party, Maxine McKew, the comments of the government in terms of foreign workers had condemned because it from Australia's neighbors could be perceived as an insult.
"Strident statements like that foreigners should stand behind" and stop Australian first "is a very unpleasant relapse at a time when unions demanded a protected job market," she said the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white workers should be protected, and if some people in the area heard an echo of this historical artifact would not surprise me.
The debate proposal outlines 12 measures that were once considered by the former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was yesterday to talk about people smuggling in Sri Lanka, has converted five of the recommended changes, the others are still being considered.
If the "authenticity" criterion is accepted, then someone who will be applying for a visa, examined the effect could be whether the request is real in cases where the applicant is the owner or a relevant person of the sponsoring company spent or personally connected. "
Companies could also be obliged to account for the number of 457-visa holders, as in the past, only a small number of workers wanted to support, and hundreds have stopped.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri-lankischer Asylant presumably of a heart attack after he this week with a refugee boat has arrived at Christmas Island.
The stunning nine-year-old son of the man who had come with him to Australia, is being cared for since the death of his father on Wednesday from an adult cousin, who was also on the boat.
Australian authorities took the man in the Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
