Rules on electronic devices on planes will remain in force for the time being in Australia
Australian airline passengers must continue to tablets and smartphones during takeoff and landing, despite efforts in the US to relax the rules for such devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US airlines to change its rules so that passengers on their devices during critical phases of flight e-books to read, watch videos or play unless they are in the "flight mode.
While the bulk of the flight's passengers already permitted, but many people find it annoying that the landing at the start and not read their e-books.
Australian companies are watching the decision to implement the US airlines need to do a lot of work, but have no immediate plans to change its rules.
The air safety authority CASA also said that we will look at the announcement, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight in Australia.
"The CASA currently has no specific regulations on the use of electronic devices on the plane," was announced.
The issue is subject to provisions requiring airlines must always maintain the safety of the passengers and the crew's safety instructions.
Virgin has already with CASA talks on an extension of its use Wi-Fi-entertainment system on flights and said that he is open to changes, but they should be initiated by the legislator.
"We would welcome a review of the approval of electronic devices by CASA, because we are convinced that it would improve the customer experience, after we now offer" (wireless entertainment) during the flight, a spokesman said.
Qantas said that they will remain until further notice in the current regulations.
"Our current guidelines stipulate that electronic devices during takeoff and landing should not be used, and we currently have no plans to change that," said the company.
The FAA regulations apply to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations, which can benefit passengers, and the FAA decision and the reasons behind it certainly exactly.
The decision affects of US companies differently depending on the age of the fleet.
You have to prove that their planes, the radio interference from mobile devices can tolerate, and manuals, training materials, hand luggage programs as well as customers instruction.
"After the airline confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can passengers using portable, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smart phones at every level allow," gave the FAA.
In rare cases, where visibility, the crew will instruct passengers during the landing to disable the devices.
The group also recommended to pack heavier devices during takeoff and landing safely under the seat or in the lockers.
