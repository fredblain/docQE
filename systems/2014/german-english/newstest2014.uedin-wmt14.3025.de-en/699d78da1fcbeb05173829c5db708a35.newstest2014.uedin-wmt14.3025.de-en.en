The British government announced a study that the benefits of the hs2-rail project for Scotland is to increase.
In the work of hs2 Ltd proposes to achieve with the start of Phase 1 in the year 2026 high-speed links between Scotland and the north of England.
Transport minister Baroness Kramer said that the project will "Britain closer together."
The Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was very pleased to work with the British government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-rail link between London and the West Midlands.
After the completion of Phase 2, there will be links to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost for the construction of the high-speed link between London and the north of England from 32.7 billion pounds to 42.6 billion pounds.
The British government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, instructed hs2 Ltd to look for other routes, capacity and travel time improvements in northern England and Scotland.
These include the possibility of a travel time of three hours or less in the end of Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our aim for hs2 is a truly national network, the United Kingdom and its cities closer together."
We are progressing with hs2 because it brings enormous benefits.
Without it, we are facing a crisis in our rail network.
But it is also about the link between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will be improved thanks to hs2.
The Scottish Secretary Alistair conservative commented: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish Government called Keith Brown to secure, "unequivocally" for the Scottish involvement in the hs2 network.
Brown said: "The high-speed rail link has the potential of enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but also provides the economic strength of Scotland, an argument for high-speed rail links across the UK."
That is why we are pleased, as a partner of the British government to work and the options for a high-speed rail link to study in Scotland, which provides benefits to all, and the Glasgow-Edinburgh adds that the Scottish Government plans already.
I look forward to examine the investigation report with the British ministers next year and to jointly decide on the next steps.
