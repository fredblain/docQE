RBS suspends two foreign exchange traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders in its foreign exchange department, two people who are familiar with the situation; this is a further indication that the global regulatory investigation into the alleged manipulation of the currency market is rapidly accelerating.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that the authorities in the investigation into the world's largest financial market, where daily 5.3 trillion US dollars an ounce.
The two traders would be the first RBS staff in the widening investigation has been suspended by the scandal surrounding the Libor interbank business.
The bank made no comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from authorities.
"Our investigations are continuing on this issue and we are cooperating fully with the FCA and other regulators," said the bank two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to the situation said that the RBS the records of e-mails and instant messages, and have been sent to a former trader, the British regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, have passed.
The dealer, Richard Usher, had left the RBS in 2010 and is now at its current position as a European head of forex spot trading at JPMorgan Beyazid did.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of the European spot trading at Citi, Beyazid did this week and Matt Gardiner, senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week at Standard Chartered.
None of these traders has been accused of any wrongdoing.
The instant message group of Usher were bankers at Barclays and Citigroup, said people close to the situation.
UBS announced this week that they have taken steps against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator FINMA had declared that they examine the alleged manipulation of the foreign exchange market on a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities around the world - the European Commission, FINMA, the Swiss competition authority WeKo, the FCA, the US Justice Department and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - currently dealing with allegations that bankers in transactions in the currency market should have denied.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or information requests from authorities, said people familiar with the situation.
Banks comb instant messages and e-mails from several years looking for cases of misconduct.
The news of these investigations, the dealers in a field in turmoil, which in recent years has become one of the most profitable of the trading units has heard from investment banks, but this year under pressure because of low volatility in currency limits the opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair, and said that it was almost impossible to manipulate the extensive and highly liquid currency market, but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true.
A senior trader noted that despite the huge daily volume in foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the growing use of its own internal platforms by banks leads that "one with very low ticket prices can affect the market."
The news came on the same day, when Credit Suisse announced that it had this week, a dealer of the London exchange traded funds-offices terminated after he at the end of last year, a loss of nearly six million dollars had caused.
The bank promptly informed the relevant authorities and is working with them.
"We are sure that the trader acted alone and that the matter is under control," said Credit Suisse.
