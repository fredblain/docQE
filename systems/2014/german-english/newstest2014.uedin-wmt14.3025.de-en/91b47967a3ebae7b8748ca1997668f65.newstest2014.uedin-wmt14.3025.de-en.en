FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices on planes (but no mobile phone calls)
Passengers can now hear from departure to land their electronic devices for reading, activities, games, music and use the image of films, but not with the phone calls, the new guidelines, which were issued on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States.
But passengers should not expect that these changes will be implemented immediately.
How quickly it would be implemented, drawn by the respective airline, said FAA employee Michael Huerta at a press conference.
The airlines need to prove to the FAA that aircraft meet the new guidelines and that they have updated the training manuals of the flight crew, as well as the rules for the store of the devices, according to the new rules.
The FAA said it had already received by some airlines plans to expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes.
Under these airlines, including Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the expanded use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA announced in a statement.
Currently, passengers must turn off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
You may not start again when the plane reached an altitude of three kilometers, and the captain gives the green light.
When entering the landing the passengers need to disable them again and may not start them again before the plane has landed.
According to the new guidelines could airlines whose planes are secured against electronic malfunctions, allow its passengers to use the devices for takeoff, landing on the tarmac, the FAA said.
Most of the new commercial aircraft and other planes for the use of Wi-Fi have been converted into greater heights, should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Flight Attendants, welcomed the changes.
"If the new regulation is implemented safely - and we are working closely with the airline in this regard - will benefit both sides," Glading said.
We are told it honestly sorry to have to deal with this issue as minders.
Nevertheless, remained Internet connections for surfing, exchange of e-mails, text messages or downloading data still banned under three kilometres, the agency explained.
Passengers are urged to enable smartphones, tablets and other devices in flight mode.
So still no "Words With Friends," the scrabble classified online game that the actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when he publicise a jet of American Airlines had to leave because he refused to turn off the device, while the plane was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices such as laptops must continue to be stored as an injury risk here if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile phone calls during the flight will also continue to banned.
The regulatory authority for telephone calls at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not with the FAA.
FAA may lift ban on certain electronic devices during takeoff and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker said of the Transportation Security Administration National Transportation Safety Board, security expert for national transport issues at CBS News, mobile phones are still viewed as a risk.
"Mobile is really a problem, not only because they could potentially cause problems in navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that the transfer from the air can also disrupt transmission towers," Rosenker.
An advisory committee of the industry, which was created by the FAA to investigate this issue, recommended last month that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, the pressure on the FAA has increased to loosen restrictions on its use.
Critics such as the Democratic senator from Missouri to overtake Japan take the view that there is no valid security reasons for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce, because the use of the devices has become ubiquitous.
In some studies, the speech that forgets up to one-third of the passengers of the closure of the device or ignored.
The FAA began in 1966, the use of electronic devices by passengers, after reports of disturbances of navigation and communication devices by passengers keep FM radios were aware that the latest technology trends.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA that electronic interference represent them nothing.
Airlines offer passengers for several years, Wi-Fi, if the altitude is reached.
The Wi-Fi systems adapted planes are also less susceptible to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft for the greater use of electronic devices to be placed under the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices are generally much less phone radiation than previous generations.
E-Reader, for example, provide only minimal radiation, if one umbl√§ttert.
However, when downloading or sending data transfer values are stronger.
Among the supporters of an easing of restrictions on the use of passenger counts Amazon.com.
In 2011, company officials invited a passenger plane full of Kindle e-reader and made a test flight in order to identify problems, but none could say.
Members of the FAA's advisory committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk in the use of devices.
Douglas also from the passenger Association, National Association of Airline Passengers said he was of the view that the disruption of the device is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other committee members said that there were only scattered reports of pilots who favours a disruption of aircraft systems by the devices, and most of them are very old.
However, the committee recommended the FAA to allow pilots to mandate in instrument landing under poor visibility conditions of the closure of the devices by the passengers.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes, describing it as a sensible adjustment for travelers who are now well equipped with technology.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a passenger experience is not incompatible with the security," Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association said.
