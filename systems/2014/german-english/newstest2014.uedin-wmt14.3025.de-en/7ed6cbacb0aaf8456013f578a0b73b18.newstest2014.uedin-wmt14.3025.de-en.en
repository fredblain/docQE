The using builders fences painted on the Bechtle-plot
A group of the citizens' initiative "Swiss meadow" is using builders fences on the Bechtle-land along the promenade in Bad industrial embellished.
Moreover, they cleared and broadened the footpath, it said in a press release.
The planned covering of the decaying house at the rear of the property had been allowed for security reasons, because the site is in danger of falling.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, had denied the beautification campaign with his colleague Reinhard Domke of the BI.
Before the action of the BI had been affixed a banner with the message "We are in favour."
That's about 20 members of the citizens' initiative, however, little disturbed in their action.
Their motto on a large poster said "We are against Bauruinen.
They wanted to draw attention to the danger of even greater ruins on the Swiss meadow - the giant project should fail one day.
In conversation with many passers-by before the "site," it became clear that some people believe that it will go with the implementation of the project in the city of many better, though not a few have the same questions to the scale of the project presented as the BI.
But they are beginning to resign because the city is delaying these answers on states, the BI.
As they say, the public statements of the mayor's work.
May said the City Council meeting that he feared the death of the thermal baths, the population of the citizens to vote against the plans for a spa and wellness complex voting on the Swiss meadow.
That is why some people seem downright scared, others see it as a "crude blackmail attempt" to the population, goes on to say in the press release of the BI.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all volunteers.
