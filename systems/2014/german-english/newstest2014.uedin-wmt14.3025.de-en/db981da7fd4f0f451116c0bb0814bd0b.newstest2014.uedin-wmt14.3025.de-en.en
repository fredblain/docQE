Löffingen: Köpfler still only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the Baar town Löffingen 7514 with its inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a pioneering school, children, youth and senior policy, as well as its own city works can be described as an attractive city, a second mayoral candidate has been reported so far.
As the only candidate for the succession of for reasons of age no longer ran Mayor Norbert Brugger is so far the 46-year-old bank clerk and business manager Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen.
The application deadline expires on Monday, November 11, at 6 p.m.
