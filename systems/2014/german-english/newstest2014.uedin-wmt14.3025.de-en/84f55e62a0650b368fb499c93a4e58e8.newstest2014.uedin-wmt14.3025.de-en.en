Coulson was phone-hacking for checking a tip a
The former News of the Word-editor Andy Coulson was supposedly "phone-hacking, monitoring and confrontation" in the attempt, a false tip about an affair of the former Home Secretary Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the court in the Old Bailey, the News of the World listened in May 2005, a false rumor that Clarke had a relationship with his "special adviser" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper commissioned the private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack voicemails Pawlbys, and pursued them, but they also Coulson called and left messages, the court heard.
"According to the public prosecutor Coulson, who is now the editor of the NotW, no one who stands in front of the apartment of people and hopes to monitor them, but one, faced with a history of people like to see their reaction," said Edis.
He said that NotW use three procedures in order to investigate citizen stories: Phone-hacking, monitoring and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously, he knows of the second, the surveillance, it cannot be otherwise.
What about the first?
He knows about the phone-hacking?
He denies that, but we say: "And whether he knew about it."
Rumors of an affair were Clarke's first feature by the editors of NotW picked up as a source who was sexually interested to Pawlby, said: "You don't waste your time, together with Charles."
A band with voice mail from their phone on at least three occasions was secured in August 2006 in Mulcaires apartment.
The investigators also found entries on the computer of the detective to Pawlby and her sister were stored as "projects."
At a time when the searches were the grandparents of Pawlby anonymous calls in which they received for information, they were asked, Edis said.
Meanwhile, the former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup monitored the monitoring of the movements of Pawlby.
On 18 June 2005 Coulson left her a voice mail with the following content: "I have a story that we want to bring out tomorrow, I would like to talk with Charles."
Edis explained, coul's activities in this story followed the same pattern as in other important figures, including the former Home Secretary David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett due to an affair with a married woman have faced when he himself was romantically involved with the co Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at the time.
Brooks and Coulson deny having events conspired with others, between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006 to hack the phones.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted the phone-hacking.
