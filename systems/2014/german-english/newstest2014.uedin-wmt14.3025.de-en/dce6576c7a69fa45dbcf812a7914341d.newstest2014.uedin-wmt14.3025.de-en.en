Mick Jagger said that he had never turned on Katy Perry, when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, said the pop star, she had as a backing singer at Jaggers song "Old such" Die Hard in 2004.
Perry said that she had with the gun at dinner eaten, and that he has "angebaggert me when I was 18."
She added: "It is a long time ago and he was very kind to me."
In a statement, a representative said Jaggers, 70, on Thursday that he "categorically denied that he had ever made overtures to Katy Perry."
The representative added: "Maybe they had confused him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers who in the Rolling-Stones tour this year had a guest appearance.
Her new album, "Prism" landed on the first attempt at No. 1 this week.
