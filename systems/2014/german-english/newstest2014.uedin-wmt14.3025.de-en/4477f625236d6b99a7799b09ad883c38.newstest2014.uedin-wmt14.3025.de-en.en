Court blocks decision to Stop-and-Frisk directive of the NYPD
A federal appeals court in the United States on Thursday blocked the formation of a judge, the changes to the stop-and-Frisk Program ("stop and search") of the New York Police Department had requested, and the judge absolving them from the case.
The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court said that the decision of Judge Shira Scheindlin would be suspended until an appeal of the city is decided.
The judge had ruled in August, the city was violating the constitution with the way the program will be implemented for stopping and questioning of people.
The city filed an appeal against their assessment and ordered remedial measures, the decision to set up an observatory, including who should support the police in changing its directive and the appropriate training program.
The appeal court heard the arguments on Tuesday the required suspension.
The report said that the judge should be released from the case, as the code of conduct for American judges have violated, is determined that a judge the appearance of partiality to avoid; this was partly with a series of media interviews and public statements, in which they publicly responded to the criticism of the court.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, because they inappropriately targeted black and Latin American men with the Stop-and-Frisk program targeted.
It has appointed an outside agency to monitor the implementation of significant changes, including reforms to policies, training and supervision, and ordered a pilot program with the body worn cameras in areas where most of the checks were carried out.
In August, the city of New York agreed to end the practice of storing names and addresses of people who have been made redundant after an inspection by the police.
An oral hearing on the appeal of the city is scheduled for March 14, 2014.
The Stop-and-Frisk-tactic by a number of civil rights advocates criticized.
There is this kind of controls for decades in various forms, but most of them increased the number of recorded controls during the term of the partyless Mayor Michael Bloomberg to an all-time high of 684.330 in 2011, black and Latin American men.
In 2004, was submitted by four men, all of whom were members of minorities, claim that developed into a class action.
Advocates of changes to the stop-and-Frisk Program of the NYPD said that the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police and influence the way, like other police chiefs are using the scheme.
Opponents argue that the changes would dampen the morale of the police, but not the crime wasted; neither would money and the broader problem of a police solved that stand after the loss of thousands of jobs in the last decade under pressure.
The judge pointed out that the stop-and-Frisk practice not finish that is constitutionally, but only the kind of the implementation of the controls by the NYPD reforms.
