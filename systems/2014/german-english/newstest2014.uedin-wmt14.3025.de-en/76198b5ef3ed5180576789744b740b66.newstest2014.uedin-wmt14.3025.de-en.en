Alexei Miller, Gazprom calls pipeline in Bulgaria as the start of a new Gas√§ra
The construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria put the start of one of Europe's biggest energy projects, said the Gazprom board.
"Today's event is a milestone: The construction work on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, have started," said the chairman of Gazprom, Alexei Miller, in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is designed to ensure greater diversity in Russia's export routes through Europe.
A contract dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, where the bulk of Russian gas is stored for Europe, providing an increased risk in conventional routes, officials said.
Miller said that the direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are "forever" off.
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream at reduced rates if the project goes into operation in 2015.
According to Gazprom, the construction work will begin in other countries downstream on the planned route at the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed to an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
