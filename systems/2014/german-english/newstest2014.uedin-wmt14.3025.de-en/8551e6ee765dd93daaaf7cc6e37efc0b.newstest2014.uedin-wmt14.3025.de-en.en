Early puberty: Grow up faster
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty than their white age, as studies show.
Physical changes mean not directly puberty
There is no evidence that hormones and other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic is a trigger of the early puberty
The trend toward early puberty is less pronounced among boys
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist based on children's health and family issues.
A mother should be concerned when breasts and pubic hair grow their daughter already at the age of seven or eight years ago?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics paediatricians Association this week in Orlando, Florida, a pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz said that these early physical changes are relatively normal among American girls and a new standard.
"I spend a lot of time to reassure parents - usually, this is not a sign of puberty happens quickly," explained Kaplowitz.
Obvious indicators of development, such as growing breasts, Scham- and Achselhaare and body odor, formerly show girls.
However, there was only a slight shift in the age of the Menarche (first menstruation) over the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age at 12.5 years, slightly less than visual in 1970.
"If the development of breasts starts, it will take" at least two to three years until the Menarche, Kaplowitz, author of the book "early puberty in girls said: The Essential Guide to deal with this commoner problem."
The most accurate test is how puberty progresses.
It is controversial, which is actually the onset of puberty, but it is ready for "early" if the breast augmentation is accompanied by a spurt of growth before the age of eight years.
In most cases, the process has slowed down or stalled - something that can monitor a pediatrician.
For faster progress tests could be indicated by a Endikronologen so serious problems such as tumor or cyst can be ruled out.
There are treatments for the delay of an early menstruation and the defense of another consequence: The premature aging of the bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and small stature in adults.
The recommendations for a drug or hormonal therapy based on the age of the child, the speed of development, the growth rate and the emotional maturity.
Psycho-social aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious about drugs, but he admits: "That suppress puberty can mitigate behavioral problems and the feelings of girls, unlike their age to be."
The other major problem is understandable: Parents simply do not want that their very young daughters have the period.
"They worry about the risk of pregnancy, or about how they handle" the hygienic side, Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock, a woman whose daughter has received with ten remembers their days.
Although there have been signs, and we talked about menstruation, they were not emotionally prepared.
She was scared and excited home from school, because it was the first in her group of friends.
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty.
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages were found in the media.
Young boys are like girls before puberty.
Kaplowitz believes that the most compelling premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported the implementation of a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine years, which establishes a connection between body fat and entering puberty.
Other studies support that conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country of African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty than their white age.
There are various explanations for this.
Global appears to be an early puberty influenced by all sorts of things, economic conditions, the climate and genes.
Another mystery: Although boys grow the face and pubic hair before the trend towards a comprehensive early puberty is not as high as for girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference underscored the complexity of the issue.
The emergence of acne and pubic hair is widespread even babies and young children.
"We have to be careful how we identify the real onset of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey said.
Parents should not hesitate to take advice from their pediatrician, how they should talk with their child.
"It may mean that you have to have a conversation earlier than expected," advised Kaplowitz.
If you stay calm, the child is usually good.
Girls who are flowering early, need the assurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it happens sooner than expected.
