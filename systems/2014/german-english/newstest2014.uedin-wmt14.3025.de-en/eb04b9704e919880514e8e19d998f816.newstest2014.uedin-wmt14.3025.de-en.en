Haslach: Scepticism is increasingly confident
With the elections to the parish council in 2015, for example, will change in the ministry unit Haslach (SE) mission.
Then there is only a single parish council for all six parishes.
At a joint meeting of the councils from Haslach, years later, mills, fishing stream, Alpine and catfish Chen health prepared on Saturday to the changes.
Because nothing is more in the fundamental decisions to change the diocese and the parish councils to implement them as well.
In the course of the day, it was very clear: The skepticism about the new is tentatively but increasingly a confidence.
The ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and the size of the parish council filed the very constructive discussions of the six bodies with the main official of the ministry teams.
Regional dean George Schmitt explained in a presentation of the revised guidelines for ministry units in the diocese of Freiburg.
After that, the SE Haslach forms as a parish in the future, a public body that enters the rights and obligations of the past six individual parishes.
There will be only a single parish council and a foundation board, where the pastor force office is represented.
In every parish at least two elected members are to be represented in the six parishes so-called community teams will be formed on the ground.
Their task will be to promote the religious life in the village.
When asked about the finances of the individual parish considerable conversation needs showed.
The innovations provide that accumulated assets remain in the parishes earmarked.
By contrast, the liabilities go to the whole community.
Particularly in view of the large planned investments, whose commitment to make all parishes, there have been major concerns.
"In the past has been invested in projects that could be managed by individual parishes alone," Haslachs parish council chairman Bruno Prince Bach relativism.
Practical experience with a joint body for five parishes described Barbarian Knight, the chairman of the board at the ministry unit Schutterwald-Munich.
In 2006, they had to be "One, five remain" and noted that it is not so simple.
The bodies of the Haslacher ministry unit were then to answer the questions on the future composition and size of the joint parish council and the practical work of the local teams.
The compositions are specified in further meetings and decided in another joint meeting of all six bodies next spring.
In the end, parish council Michael Pleasant from Steinach presented the new logo of the ministry unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
