In Pfullendorf the river becomes more expensive
The citizens Pfullendorfs must adjust themselves to higher cost of electricity.
Like the managing director of public utilities, Jörg-Arne Bias, opposite whom SOUTH COURIER confirmed, to a four-member Pfullendorfer 70 to 90 euros extra costs per year come to family.
Substantial reason of the lining up price increase is the rise of the so-called EEG allocation of 5,277 to 6,3 cent per kilowatt-hour.
This allocation is again determined each year in October by the four operators that of the large electricity lines.
These number them from the energy turn developing extra costs, which can raise them by an allocation over the electricity tariff.
Public utilities Pfullendorf form the last member in this chain.
The supervisory board of the energy company had proceeded in its prognoses even from a higher allocation, as Jörg-Arne Bias reports.
Now would have the concrete pay to be calculated, before public utilities could inform next week their customers about the accurate price increase.
“We go to bias from a rise of 1 cent plus x out”, thus, whereby the number will lie rather in the proximity of the 2 cent.
