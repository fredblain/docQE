Despair cry of an Obama voter
I have president Obama twice selected in hope on the fact that change is possible
He says, Obama undertook praise-worth efforts, which were defeated by the blockade tactics of the republicans
The blockade politics does not excuse the website problems of Obamacare, the drone attacks
Obama's memoirs over the election campaign 2008 are a sad memory of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student in the second year to the Harvard Medical School.
I read at present a terribly sad book.
It is a book, from which I believed, it me during the doleful second year of my medical studies would cheer up and to me again hope would give.
It is called „The Audacity ton Win” to win (courage) and describes the memoirs Barack Obamas to the presidential election 2008.
If I am finished with my patient minute in the evening and go to bed, then the book leads me back into a time, when the policy millions inspired could rob and from talking the breath.
The choice became a landslide victory and a newscaster stopped, in order to lead the historical meaning of this hour before eyes.
My school fellows cried before joy and my parents collected all newspapers, which could find them.
A young team from visionaries was on the way in the white house and the nation was ready for change.
When 2008 Obama changed at that time in the office, he had agreement values of 82%.
And then I close the book.
Again to switch to the present is bad awaking, as if one is torn from a dream.
It falls heavily to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder to missed possibilities.
In the years, since I delivered my voting for the first time, actually somewhat changed.
But it is simply nothing that I could myself have presented.
I recognize the great and versatile things on, which Obama reached, of concealing of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden, forced by the adoption of the Affordable Care act for health insurance up to the military departure from Iraq, the end.
Also I am the opinion that party-political blockade tactics tilted too many efforts, with which our nation forward be brought should: Immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closing of Guantanamo Bay, in order to call only some.
But after I defended countless marks the Obama government opposite colleagues and acquaintance, I arrived with my attempts at explanation in the end.
I reached one point of political despair.
The republican blockade politics cannot explain, why one permits a hearing of foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas.
It cannot explain, why those collects national Security Agency data over the private life of Americans and why Whistleblower are punished, which reveal national failure.
It cannot explain, why Anwar al-Awlaki, an US-American citizen, was murdered without procedures, still why the public financing and edition borders during the presidential elections is gone around.
It does not justify the results of a report, in which it means, the efforts of the white house toward the immobilization of the media is „aggressivsten… since the nixon administration”.
And jüngstens it cannot excuse the inability to sketch in more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care act a simple website.
I do not know whether it is that, which I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood with 18 that the government work could contradict her preceding political campaigns.
The office for delegate a foreseeable course is not obvious, since an opposition party and fortuitous events coin like the Newtown massacre the public discussion.
But if I view myself the examples specified above, then they seem to a large extent from the government selected to be.
And disturbs me at most.
I selected 2012 again Obama, not because I was enthusiastic over its candidacy.
Mitt Romney represented a confusing and ill-considered alternative, he seemed his direction and positions not to specify not to be able.
I had the impression, a second term of office for Obama, freely from the pressure of future elections, the hope would fulfill, of which we had for such a long time heard.
But with the sinking of the agreement values for Obama on under 45% this week the return became all the harder in the year 2008 by this book.
It wakes the longing in me after the many promises, which dissolved in air.
This week read I a section in the book, which describes, how Obama had to put a heavy loss against Clinton with the primaries into Pennsylvania.
In a meeting with the election helpers after the decision he said to its employees, her would have to come back after course and follow the purpose of their thing.
„I would like that we regain, said our charm” it.
We must remember, who we are.
There is five years later, Mr. President, and I could not agree you more strongly.
In this comment expressed opinions are excluding from Nathaniel Morris.
