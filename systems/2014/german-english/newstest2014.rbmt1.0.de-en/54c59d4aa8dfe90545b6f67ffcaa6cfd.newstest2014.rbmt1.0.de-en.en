A persistent injury at the ankle joint threatens to prevent the employment of Nicolai Müller in the Bundesliga away game of the FSV Mainz 05 with the FC Augsburg.
Mainz bnagt around an employment of Nicolai Müller.
Tomorrow he will try to train with the crew.
So far it could only individually.
“We will decide at short notice on its employment”, said coach Thomas Tuchel.
The 40-year old hopes to have its goal scorer best with six hits thereby.
Because the Mainz must already do without the injured service providers Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
