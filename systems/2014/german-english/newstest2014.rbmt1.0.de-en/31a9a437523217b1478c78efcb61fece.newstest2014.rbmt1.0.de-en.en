Foreign employees with 457-Visa could be submitted „authenticity test”
The government thinks in the context of extended measures about one „authenticity test” for foreign employees with 457-Visum.
If the test should be introduced, it would be used over a criterion, which was to prevent that is used 457 for occupation unqualified jobs or as back door for the influx from family and friends to Australia.
Today a proposal for discussion of the government was published, after the former delegate of the laboratory party, Maxine McKew, which had condemned comments of the government regarding foreign employees, because these of the neighbours of Australia as offense could be understood.
„Loud explanations as, foreigners are to employ themselves in the back ` and, Australians first adjust ` are a very unpleasant relapse in times, in which trade unions demanded, said a protected job market” them the Australia India of institutes today.
Historically regarded meant that white workers should be protected would not surprise – and if some heard an echo of this historical artifact in the region, that me.
The proposal for discussion outlines twelve measures, which were started thinking once by the former immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, which stayed yesterday to discussions over human being smuggling in Sri Lanka, converted five of the recommended changes, which become others still considered.
If „the authenticity criterion is taken over”, then someone, which requests a visa, could be examined to that effect, whether „the request is genuine in the cases, in those the applicant to the owner or a relevant person of the supporting enterprise related or personally connected is.”
In addition companies could be obligated to put account down over the number of 457-Visumsinhaber after in the past enterprises, which wanted to support first only a small number of workers, stopped final hundreds.
Meanwhile a 35-year old asylum-seeker of Sri Lanka probably died at a cardiac infarct, after he had arrived this week with a refugee boat on the Christmas island.
The disturbed son of nine years of the man, who had come with him to Australia, is cared for since the death of his father on Wednesday by an adult cousin, who likewise was on the boat.
Australian authorities brought the man into the Christmas Iceland hospital, where he died.
