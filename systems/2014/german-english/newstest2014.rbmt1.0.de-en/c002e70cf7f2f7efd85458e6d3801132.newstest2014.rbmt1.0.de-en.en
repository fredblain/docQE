Parents of inter+sexual children can select „sex indefinitely”
Germany is the first European nation, in which a third sex for children is appreciative, who were born with not clear genital organs.
Newborn children one does not assign any longer rigidly male or womanlike.
After the new law parents must no more sex for such children explain, but can „indefinitely” or „fixed” on the birth certificate indicate.
A goal of the law is it to take the pressure from parents to so that they do not have to make decisions over-hurried regarding operations for a sex assignment with newborn children to fight and discrimination from inter+sexual humans to.
A inter+sexual person said years according to BBC later: „I am neither man nor woman.”
I remain the patchwork, which became to create from physicians, mutilated and full scars.
Roughly one of 2.000 children comes each year neither as a boy nor as a girl to the world.
They belong to the inter+sexual, to a group, which fall under the diagnosis „sexual differentiation disturbance” (DSD), a comprehensive term for humans with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testicles) or unusually developed genital organs.
Wallis Simpson was possibly inter+sexual.
The understanding of the sex identification is not yet very fully-fledged, but guesses most experts in the USA to it, one is the best available information for sex assignment to use, if a regulation is not possible, and for psychological and physical child development not to wait, before one decides – if at all – for an operation.
The New Yorker psychiatrists said Dr. Jack Drescher, who specialized in the problem of the sex identification, the new German law „sounded after a good thing”.
Inter+sexual children represent an ethical dilemma.
„Some humans have life-threatening illnesses, which make a surgical interference necessary, but for most children that is valid not”, said it.
One can make and then await a sex assignment without operation, as the identity develops.
The scientific data over it, how a child develops at all his sexual identity, are not very exact.
Nobody knows, why it happens.
It is like the secret, why humans are homosexual.
In a report to the European commission from the year 2011 it, inter+sexual humans means are to be differentiated from transsexual or transgenic the people to, because its status is not sex-referred, but causes by its biological constitution, which is neither exclusively male nor female, but typically both at the same time or clearly as one of it does not define.
These characteristics showed up in subordinate sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair coat, breasts and stature, priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genital organs or in chromosome structures and hormones.
As well as the report gives also an overview of discrimination, to the inter+sexual and transgenic the people in the active life suspended sees itself over the extent of annoyance, force and prejudice crime.
With the sex picture agreeing boy does not have now a special Camp.
In the meantime it in Australia and Nepal for adults are possible to indicate on official documents male, womanlike or „third sex”.
In June Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as world-wide first „a genderless” person, after a court the lifelong retention one had been entitled „to fixed” sex status.
German documents of identification have a third assignment, X for inter+sexual, so the ministry of the Interior apart from M and W in the future.
In the neighbouring France sex topics are still controversial, so a message on France 24.
2011 signed dozens French delegates of the strictly catholic country a petition that „the sex theory was to be removed” from school books.
The US-American website Catholic of online likewise expressed itself against the German law, with the reason: „If the world into a new condition is however not pulled, where the sex represents a decision, sexual activity, then we rotate two further columns of the civilization.”
The mother of a newborn child from Maryland explained zone, her opposite baby it would find better, if babies with the birth a sex is assigned.
„The parents existence is even without further restrictions already stressfully enough, particularly if one does not know, said the sex of the own child” her the parents website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically were seen to children, who were born both with male and female sex parts, when Hermaphroditen designates, after the attractive Greek God, which had both sexes.
Still before ten years the medicine regarded the sex as something, which one could extinguish and then again develop.
But in the meantime the ethical bases of an operation are doubted, after now it admits is how complex the sexual identity is, and that physicians can lie also wrongly, because they do not know, how the child feels when growing up with the sex assigned by them.
„In the middle the 20. Century called one the one, psychiatric emergency `”, said Drescher.
If such a child were born, then one called not the psychiatrist, but the surgeon.
The dominant theory about the treatment of children with not clear genital organs decreases on Dr. John Money of John Hopkins University, which held the opinion, the sex is ductile.
It coined the term „sexual identity” and, social and impacts due to environmental factors argued – as parents a child educate – interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and coined in such a way whether a person regards itself as male or womanlike.
But in one under the title „” become case from the year 1966 became controversial its theories admit John/Joan.
It guessed/advised to parents of a boy, whose penis had been separated with a cutting bungled, to castrate the child completely and to remove also its testicles and to then bring up it as girls.
„Money presented this case as successful example of a transformation, which it was however not”, so Dre.
When the boy was about 15, it changed back to the male sex and married a woman.
With 38 however he committed suicide.
Loud Dre there are still physicians, who would practice this model.
But into the 1990er years, with which introduction the Internet, are survivors of these sex operations to the public stepped, which are not happy „with the result”.
So for instance with Jim Bruce, a 36 years old author from Montana, who was born with XY-male chromosomes, but ambiguous genital organs.
The physicians were not clear itself over it, whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and was convinced, it can never „a satisfying life” as a man lead.
Thus its external organ and the testicles were removed shortly after the birth 1976 and it as girls were brought up by surgery.
At the age of 12 it received female hormones.
„I knew that I am not a girl”, explained he opposite ABCNews.com
I was unfortunate, but it was really heavy to place questions.
At the age of 18 it should receive a Vaginalplastik.
But since it was depressive and knew that somewhat it was not correct, required he its medical documents.
Which it found out, was shocking.
I was sterilized with my birth – and none ever said that to me.
Bruce was born with a DSD, by which its body could not produce enough testosterone for the development of the genital organs.
After it had experienced the truth, he changed his breasts again to the male identity, received testosterone injections and let themselves remove.
By the operation it became infertily.
Today it fights for others in an organization named interface Project for the fact that inter+sexual humans are noticed as normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, Geschäftsführerin in California of the residents right group of Advocates for Informed Choice, worries herself that the German law „for stamping and stigmatizing encourage” can.
„Many activists are to be met anxiously that the German decision could encourage parents, fast decisions and the child, fixed ` not to assign”, explained them.
We are afraid, favour interventions.
We think, it would be better to assign and then await the male or female sex.
Still we do not know, how the law will affect itself, therefore can we only speculate.
Tamar Mattis said, their organization supports the Australian law, because „it makes the acknowledgment for adults possible as the third sex”.
„Adults should be able to make own decisions over their legal sex”, explained them.
With the German law it goes around the assignment with the birth.
That is not a fight, to which one should force small children at this time.
If they arose, they can decide on their body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a chest radiologist from Pittsburg, which has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disturbance and other one supports hundreds in a self-help group, says, the German law „authorizes” both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, has however a DSD on behalf of complete androgen resistance.
Because of the receptor defect of the goal cells for testosterone Katie developed female characteristics.
It has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Today Katie 29 is married and; she works on the University OF Pennsylvania as an employee in the child psychiatry.
It is infertily, hopes however, to be able to get by adoption or a surrogate mother a child.
„The law gives parents to area, whereby it does not rush into decisions meet must”, said Baratz.
It provides the time for them to make and things clarify different tests and gives them time in such a way, before they write womanlike „male” or „”.
In this way everything is correct – one pulls the child largely and loves it.
One has a marvelous baby and enjoys the parents luck.
And one does not have over-hurries an operation to make, which cannot be cancelled any longer.
„Into the decision also and eliminates the fear, which plagues parents, because they the opinion are, includes the children, them the correct would not do”, described it.
Finally the child decides on the sex, which fits better it – and that is marvelous.
Thus children are put into the position to make the decision.
