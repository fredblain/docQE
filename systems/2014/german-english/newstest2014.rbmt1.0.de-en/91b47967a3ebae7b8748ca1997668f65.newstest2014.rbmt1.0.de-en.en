FAA: Aircraft passengers can use however electronic devices in airplanes now (no mobile phone discussions to lead)
Airline passengers can hear now from the takeoff to the landing their electronic devices for reading, work, plays, music and viewing films use, however with the mobile phone not telephone, so the new guidelines, which were published on Thursday by the federal aviation administration (FAA) in the USA.
But the passengers should not expect that these changes are converted immediately.
How quickly they were implemented, at a press conference on the respective airline, Michael Huerta would depend explained FAA employees.
The airlines must prove the FAA that airplanes correspond to the new guidelines and that the training manuals of the flight crew as well as the regulations for stowing the devices away updated it according to the new regulations.
The FAA explained, her from some airlines plans had already received, which would like to develop the employment of portable electronic devices in airplanes.
Under these airlines were also delta and JetBlue.
„Depending upon condition of the plan we could approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon”, announced the FAA in an announcement.
At present passengers smartphones, Tablets and other devices must switch off, if the airplane doors are closed.
They may start it only then again if the airplane reached a height of three kilometers and the captain gives green light.
With the entering the approach flight the aircraft passengers must switch and not be allowed to do it off again them not again start, before the airplane landed.
After the new guidelines airlines, whose airplanes were secured against electronic disturbances, could permit, the devices to their passengers also with start to use landing and on the runway explained the FAA.
Most new airliners and other fliers, which were reequipped for the use of Wi-Fi in larger heights, should correspond to the criteria.
Laura Glading, Präsidentin of the professional association of professional flight attendants, welcomed the changes.
„If the new regulation surely converted actual and we co-operate in this connection closely with the airline –, both side will profit from it”, to commentated Glading.
We are honestly said it suffering to have to feel us with this topic such as Aufpasser.
Internet connections to surfing, exchange of emails, text news or downloading data under three kilometers nevertheless remained further forbidden, described the authority.
Passengers are requested, smartphones, to shift Tablets and other devices into the flight mode.
Thus still none „Words With Friends”, the Scrabble resembling online game, which the actor Alec Baldwin played 2011 on its smartphones, when he had to leave public-effectively a jet of American Airlines, because he refused itself switching the equipment off while the airplane at the gate was parked.
And heavier devices such as laptops must be also further stowed away, since a danger of injury exists here, if it by the cab fly.
Mobile phone discussions during the flight remain likewise further forbidden.
The adjustment competence for telephone calls is with the federal Communications Commission (FCC), not with the FAA.
FAA possibly waives prohibition for certain electronic devices with takeoff and landing
Mark Rosenker said last month of the road safety authority national Transportation Safety board, security expert for national traffic questions on of CBS news, mobile phone as risk was still regarded.
„Mobile phone are real a problem, only because they could not cause potential disturbances with navigation equipment, but because we know of the FCC that the transmission from air can disturb also transmitting poles”, so Rosenker.
A consulting committee of the industry, which was brought of the FAA for the investigation of this topic into being, recommended last month that the government permits a broader employment of personal electronic devices.
In the last years the pressure increased to the FAA to loosen restrictions for the use.
Critics like the democratic senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri do not hold the opinion, it give valid safety reasons for the prohibition.
The restrictions are also increasingly more difficult to implement, because the use of the devices became pervasive.
In some studies of it the speech which up to a third of the passengers switching the equipment off forgets or ignores, is.
The FAA began 1966 to limit the use of electronic devices by airline passengers after reports over disturbances of navigation and communications equipments through from passengers carried UKW radios admits had become, which represented the newest technology trend at that time.
New airplanes depend by far on electrical systems than earlier generations of aircraft, but they are also in such a way designed and authorized of the FAA that them electronic interference do not constitute anything.
Airlines offer for some years Wi-Fi already to passengers, if the flight altitude is reached.
The fliers adapted to Wi-Fi-systems are also more insensitive in relation to interference.
The vast majority of the passenger airlines should be suitable for the stronger use of electronic devices after the new guidelines, said Huerta.
The today's electronic devices deliver generally substantially less radio radiation than earlier generations.
He vein for example deliver only minimum radiation, if one turns over.
But with downloading or sending data the transmission values are stronger.
Among the advocates of a loosening of the restrictions for the equipment use by passengers Amazon.com ranks.
2011 loaded company employees a passenger airline of full Kindle he vein and made a test flight, in order to determine problems, could however none determine.
Members of the FAA Beratungskomitees expressed mixed feelings, what concerns the risk with the use of devices.
Douglas Kidd of the passenger federation national Association OF airline Passengers said, it was the opinion, the disturbance by the devices was genuine, even if the risk is minimal.
Other committee members said, it give only isolated reports of pilots, who would speak for a disturbance of equipment services by the devices, and which were most of it very old.
The committee recommended the FAA however to permit it to pilots to arrange during instrument landing under bad visibility a switching of the devices off by the passengers.
A grouping from the travel branch welcomed the changes and called it reasonable adjustment for travelers, who would be extensively equipped with technology today.
„We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience contradicts to Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association not security”, said.
