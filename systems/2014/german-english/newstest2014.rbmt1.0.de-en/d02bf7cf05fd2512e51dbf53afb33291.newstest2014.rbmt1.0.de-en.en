A black box in the car?
US-American road planner are in the search for financial resources in order to repair the purging highway system, and believe the solution in a small black box to have found which finds in the instrument panel of each car place.
The devices, which note each driven kilometer and which information announces to the authorities, are quintessential point controversies of an attempt of Washington and the planning offices of the Federal States to revise the outdated system for the financing of US-American roads.
The normally rather boring area of the road planning suddenly kindled an intensive debate with multicolored alliances.
Libertarian with environmental groups it allied itself and to suggest itself out that the government the small boxes for noting the driven kilometers – and possibly also, where they were driven – to use and the information then for the calculation of tax assessments to use knows.
The Tea party is frightened.
The American civil right combination (ACLU) is likewise deeply anxious and expresses a set of privacy doubts.
But while one cannot agree in the congress on an action, several Federal States do not wait longer.
They check at present, how they can change in the course of the next ten years to a system, with the driver per driven mile pay.
Thousands of drivers tested the tachographs, by which some are equipped with GPS monitoring, already.
That is real must for our country.
„It is not anything, which we will only possibly use”, said Hasan Ikhrata, Geschäftsführer of the Southern California Assn. OF Governments, which plans a recording of the driven miles with all California drivers in the Federal State starting from 2025.
The way, how we pay these taxes, will change.
There the technology for it is.
The initiative comes to one time, since the highway Trust the Americans at the gasoline pump pay find, which is financed from the taxes, broke is.
But one refuels no longer so much in America like in former times.
Cars use fewer gasolines.
The national oil tax of 18,4 cent per gallon (less than 4 eurocent per litre) did not rise for 20 years.
Politicians do not dare with high petrol prices to raise the tax only around a cent.
„The gasoline tax is simply not sustainably”, like that Lee Munnich, an expert for traffic legislation at the university of Minnesota.
Its Federal State equipped recently 500 cars with tachographs, with which a mile-based payment system is to be tested.
„The on a long-term basis most meaningful alternative represents”, said it.
Bureaucrats call it mile-based user fee.
It does not surprise that the idea finds with urban liberal resemblance, because the tax would let itself begin for example to affect the handling in such a way that back-up and climaticharmful exhaust gases are reduced.
The California planners set on the system during the elaboration of strategies, with which the ambitious anchored, legally goals of the Federal State to the climate change to be achieved are.
But the republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, likewise explained that he therein see the most passable long-term alternative.
Also free marking out of the Reason Foundation are done of the idea to let pay drivers after put back distance.
„That is not a tax, which disappears to Adrian Moore, Vizepräsident for guidelines in a black hole”, explains with Reason.
The people pay directly for what they get.
The movement is supported also by two former American transport ministers, who had requested the congress in a report in the year 2011 to move toward mile-based account.
The U.S. Senate approved last year 90 million a dollar expensive pilot project, which would have covered 10,000 cars.
But the majority in the house of representatives prevented the raid and reacted with it to the doubts of delegates from rural areas, which represent humans, who must often put many miles back on the way to work or into the city in the everyday life.
Several Federal States and large cities move nevertheless on own fist in this direction.
Oregon, who enlists 5,000 drivers at present for the largest experiment of the country, is most committed.
These drivers will pay soon the mile fees instead of the oil tax to the Federal State.
Nevada already concluded a pilot project.
New York town center considers likewise such.
Illinois tests it in reduced measure with trucks.
And the I-95-Koalition, to which the Ministries of Transport of 17 Federal States at the east coast belong (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), examined at present, as one would bring the change in could.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where recently 50 volunteer was equipped with the devices, drivers were sceptical with the thought, the government could each of their movements pursue.
„Doubts against Big Brother and such things were a large problem”, explain Alauddin Khan, director/conductor of the strategy and result management in the Ministry of Transport of Nevada.
The people did not want it.
When the test started, the ACLU of Nevada on its website warned: „It would be relatively simple to transform the tachographs into full-grown control instruments.”
There is not a necessity to develop a gigantic, bulky technological infrastructure which would be used inevitably for it, data over the daily movements from individuals to seize.
Nevada belonged to a set of Federal States, which hold now after affordable technology look out, with which the state the driven kilometers seize can, but not exactly when and where.
Thus, so Khan, would be also the public more reassuring.
The hunt for this technology led some authorities to a small Startup enterprise named True Mileage in California.
The company originally did not begin, in order to help Federal States with the taxation from drivers to.
Rather it was their goal of seizing in a rising market for car insurances foot with which drivers on basis of the driven miles are to pay.
But devices tested of their are interesting also for the road planners, because they work not with GPS and supply only limited information, which is uploaded regularly by modem.
„The people are rather ready to take part in if their speed and locations are not noted”, explained Ryan Morrison, Geschäftsführer von True Mileage.
In some these public pilot programs large errors were made.
There are substantially cheaper and less intrusive possibilities of converting this.
In Oregon the planners experiment to give to drivers a set from options to.
They can decide for equipment with or without GPS.
Or they select at all no equipment and pay instead a lump sum charge on basis on the average of the miles driven from all inhabitants of the Federal State.
Other places hope to be able to sell the concept of a distrustful public by equipping the devices with more functions than with few.
In New York traffic officials equipment for taxation to develop, with which also parking fees can be paid, an insurance only for driven kilometers be paid, want to be able to evade to town center must and speed data are raised from other vehicles in real time, owing to those drivers of back-up.
„Drivers were motivated by the increase in value of the advantages, which the system offers, to the participation”, are called it in a planning document of the city.
Some traffic planners ask themselves however whether the whole gossip is over paying per mile not only an enormous diverting manoeuvre.
With the metropolitan Transportation Commission for the area of the San Francisco Bay officials, the congress explained could solve the problem bankrupt highway Trust find simply by increase of the fuel tax.
An additional unique fee or an annual delivery could be imposed upon to drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles, which use little gasoline, so that also these paid a fair portion.
„There is no reason for an operation, even if an Aspirin is sufficient, describes” Randy Rentschler, the leader for legislation and public affairs of the commission.
If we do that, hundreds make themselves millions of drivers ensure over its privacy and numerous other things.
