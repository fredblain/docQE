Desire on ice cream, which shines in the dark?
A British entrepreneur developed the first in the dark bright ice – assistance of jellyfishes.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent characteristics of the sea animals and created from it a bright treat.
The idea in addition came it after it had read a research work over jellyfishes and Chinese scientists convince could to manufacture the bright protein artificially.
The ice cream reacts with the consumption with the tongue, whereby the pH value in the protein is raised and shining is caused.
Chris explained, the ice-cream reacts to the warmth in the mouth and shines – the more one thus licks, the more brightly becomes it.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company „Lick ME I'm Delicious”, says: „The product is unbelievable, but still in a very early production phase, and so one receives two gram of it for 200 pound.”
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH value.
If the mouth warms up the protein, the pH value rises and the ice shines.
We tested it in the last months and appeared it to us ideally to bring it at Halloween on the market because it has this marvelous shining effect.
It is probably the most expensive ice cream, which I manufactured ever, because the jellyfish phosphor is four times more expensive than gold.
Each ball costs me to about 140 pound.
But but it tastes more delicious.
Charlies experimental company with seat in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavors, to which beer, cheese, beef and gold foil belong.
But its newest creation is to become still more ambitious.
He says: „I would like to develop gladly an invisible ice cream.”
That is impossible to and for itself due to the refraction of light, which is caused by the ice crystals, of which ice cream consists; but I assume, we find a possibility of creating it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent characteristics of a jellyfish, which are artificially manufactured of Chinese scientist
