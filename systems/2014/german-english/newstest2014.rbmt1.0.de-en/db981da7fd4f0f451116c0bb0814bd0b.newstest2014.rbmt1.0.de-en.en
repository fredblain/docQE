Löffingen: Köpfler still only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the Baarstädtchen Löffingen with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a trend-setting training, child, youth and senior politics, as well as own public utilities can be called attractive city, so far still no second mayor candidate announced himself.
As an only candidate around the follow-up of the mayor Norbert Brugger any longer not standing as a candidate from reasons of age so far the 46-year old banker and operation manager Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen are certain.
The application deadline runs off on Monday, 11 November, at 18 o'clock.
