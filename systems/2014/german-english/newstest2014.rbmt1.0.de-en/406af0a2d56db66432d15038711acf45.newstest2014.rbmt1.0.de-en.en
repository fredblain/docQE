Iran contently with process of the nuclear negotiations
Iran shows up one week before the next atomic meeting with the five UN-veto powers and Germany contently with the negotiation process.
“After years one has now an agreement with the international atomic energy authority, around the differences of the last years to eliminate”, wrote minister of foreign affairs Mohammed Dschawad Sarif on its Facebook side.
It would be still another long way, but the atomic chief negotiator was content and also optimistic with the negotiation process that in the end both sides come to a solution.
