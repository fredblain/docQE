Coulson used telephone Hacking for examining a hint
The earlier news OF the Word publishers Andy Coulson used allegedly „telephone Hacking, monitoring and confrontation” with the attempt to confirm a wrong hint over an affair of the Minister of the Interior at that time Charles Clarke.
Public prosecutor Andrew Edis QC explained the World to the court in the old Bailey, news OF in May 2005 a wrong rumor to that effect heard that Clarke would have a relationship with its „attractive special advisor” Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper assigned the private detective Glenn Mulcaire to chop Pawlbys voice mails and pursued it, but Coulson also called it and left news, as the court experienced.
„In the opinion the public prosecutor's office Coulson, which is now publisher of the NotW, is not anybody, which stands and hopes before the apartment of people to surprise her in the act but one, the people gladly with a history confronts, around their reaction to see”, explained Edis.
He said, to NotW uses three procedures, in order to investigate to stories investigatively: Telephone Hacking, monitoring and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously white it of second, the monitoring, differently can be it.
How does it look with first?
Knowing it over the telephone Hacking?
It denies, but say we: „And whether he knew of it.”
Rumors over an affair Clarkes were taken up first by the feature editorship by NotW, when one said to a source, which was interested in Pawlby sexual: „Wasting you its time, it is together not with Charles.”
A volume with voice mails of their telephone of at least three causes was guaranteed in August 2006 in Mulcaires apartment.
In addition the investigators found entries on the computer of the detective, on whom Pawlby and their sister were stored as „projects”.
In the time, when the searches ran, grandparents received anonymous calls, in which they were asked for information about them, from Pawlby explained Edis.
Meanwhile the former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and the former reporter James Weatherup supervised the monitoring of the movements of Pawlby.
On 18 June 2005 Coulson left a voice mail with the following contents to it: „I have a story, which we want to bring out tomorrow, about which I gladly with Charles to speak would like.”
Edis explained, Coulsons activities with this story followed to the same sample as for instance with other important personalities, the former Minister of the Interior David Blunkett.
The jurors heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett had confronted because of an affair with a married woman, when he was associated with the codefendants Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at that time.
Coulson and Brooks deny with others to have conspired to chop between 3 October 2000 and 9 August of 2006 telephones.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted the telephone Hacking.
