When the horse exhibition experts appeared themselves in flocks in Cardiff, in order to choose the horse of the year, it was conscious to them that a hard competition was approaching.
But none was preparatory for three years old Fenton Kirkland.
The tot, who are not even in the kindergarten and made only before a few months its first steps, and his Shetland Pony Toffee trotted loosely by the three rounds and got the first price – whereby they let 30 adults opponents behind itself.
The inseparable pair, both equally large, because of its occurrence, behavior and style with the annual competition were praised, which is organized by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry close Cardiff.
With its appearance in competition against men and women with elegant melons he had put and led his plate hat on in an impudent angle the two years old Toffee by the ring.
Fenton was praised by the Juroren for its natural abilities while handling the pony, which would lie far over its age.
And Toffee received full marks for its occurrence and its personality.
Fenton had gotten Toffee last March as gift to its third birthday and had practiced since then each day with the Shetland pony.
Its mother, Donna, 30, said: „Fenton and Toffee are a great bottom plate.”
They had to begin against the entire participant field and with gold cup and rosette from the place went.
It was only the second time that it had participated with Toffee in a competition, and we were enthusiastic all, when he won.
It held foreigner in the arena perfectly it for so phenomenally that they wanted to be photographed with it.
The small boy from the village Nantyglo in close proximity to Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footstep of his aunt Sharon Howells, who demonstrates horses for over ten years.
Howells told: „The whole audience was as electrified and everything it encouraged and applauded.”
It ran on sand the entire length of the arena and although he looked so tiny, he carried fantastic work out.
Fenton is moved after animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens, about which he worries.
As it is started, it will not for a long time last, until he on „the horses of the year” - exhibition actual and I am sure me that it will fare well.
A spokesman of the annual horse exhibition said: „Fenton is only three, but he white, as he with his pony to deal must.”
Together they are a great team.
The Juroren evaluated Fenton and Toffee thereafter how well they would have struck themselves and would have presented in the demonstrating ring.
They pay attention to good co-operation between pony and leader – and there Fenton and Toffee were the best ones in the ring.
I am me reliably that Fentons contributed sweet clothes their part to it, fit really perfectly the cause.
