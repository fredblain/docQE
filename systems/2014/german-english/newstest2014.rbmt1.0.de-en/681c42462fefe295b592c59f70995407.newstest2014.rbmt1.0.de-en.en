Rank-pitchscold for refs: Mane no swallow king
Ralf Rangnick with the current high form of federal league table leader Red Bull Salzburg is also so content, then disappointed the director of sport of the “bulls” appeared from the arbitrators.
“There is at present a dangerous tendency that Mane and Alan are pushed into the category of swallow kings”, took it the two Offensivwirbler on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg in protection.
Recent cause for Rangnicks criticism was yellow for Mane with the 3:0 against Grödig on the past Sunday, at which the Senegalesen an alleged acting became the calamity - which was certainly none, as the TV-pictures showed.
“A crass wrong decision”, meant rank-nods, the arbitrator Harkam as “completely overtaxed” designated.
Harkam besides “to the escalation between Salzburg coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig Coach Adi Hütter after the portion would have contributed its part”.
It defended its German compatriot decidedly: “There I would have behaved in each individual situation equal as Roger Schmidt”.
Schmidt does not want to have had a contact with its colleague after the skirmish with Hütter.
I would not know, why.
“I am that, which was insulted”, stressed the 46-year old.
In view of the success run rank-nods however a praise hymn was correct on.
“For it there are only two words: Correctly well”, he stated.
There is not much to suspend.
Above all the way, how the crew plays, is impressing.
That is to continue calmly in such a way.
It will hardly give changes of cadre in the winter transfer time.
There are no great reasons to change something.
“Except a player comes closer with the desire that he wants to leave the club”, placed rank-nods clearly.
