Frankfurt parking fees are to rise strongly
Parks in Frankfurt could become sensitively more expensive soon.
Municipal authorities of the city this morning Stefan Majer (the Green) advises over a template of traffic departmental head.
Therefore the parking fees are to be increased by 50 percent.
However not the prices are to be raised, but the time interval of parking meters and park illusory automats of 30 to 20 minutes be shortened.
In December then still the town council must decide.
The retail trade committee of the IHK Frankfurt holds “for no good idea”.
The parking possibility before the business is directly “an not underestimating advantage for smaller specialist dealers”.
The traffic club Germany is the opinion that an increase is “for a long time overdue” quite appropriately and actually after two decades.
The public suburban traffic becomes also more expensive.
