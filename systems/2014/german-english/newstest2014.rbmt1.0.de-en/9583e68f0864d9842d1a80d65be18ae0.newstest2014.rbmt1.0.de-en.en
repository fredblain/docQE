Freudenstadt: Fast actions surprise hosts
With a narrow cadre the Mr. I of the TSV Freudenstadt had to begin in the Schiller Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen against the TG Gönningen of the Swabian Alb.
The Älbler stood with an experienced crew on the other line side.
Soon it showed up however that it, also age-related, with which fast actions of the joy townspeople could keep up not completely.
With the hard and impacts placed the Gönninger had trouble extremely.
Repetitive missed them the passports and attacks passed on by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz cleanly over the net center and were with the block defense not to the place.
Two high first sentence gains expressed clearly the superiority of the joy townspeople in all interests.
In view of this crushing and play-determining achievement the third sentence was then won somewhat lackadaisically and desireless to the 3:0-Endstand (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
There on 2 November with the TV Baiersbronn, which in gnawing old clearly become generally accepted could, a substantially higher performance opponent on the field will stand.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In UC-let faced each other into the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn the second crews from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt.
They delivered a hard disputed two-hourly match.
Nervousness on both sides caused particularly with the taking of the ball errors and point gifts; also with the passports the precision was occasionally goods in short supply and in some critical play scenes prevented the overeagerness the view for possible point gains.
In this performance-related very balanced meeting the large physical employment and a pleasing commitment of both teams were correct however throughout in the TSV team of Marcus Blasutto.
