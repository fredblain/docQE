Salem: Johanna Rahner at the ecumenical discussion forum
At the next ecumenical discussion forum on Monday, 21 October, in the new museum of the lock goes it around the topic “to hell with hell - theological considerations to today's handling the last things”.
Adviser is a professor Johanna Rahner.
The ecumenical discussion forum is an initiative of the catholic and protestant parishes Salem, the lock Salem and the Office of Cultural Affairs Bodensee district.
Johanna Rahner wants to follow in the forum of the question, how today humans classify the “last things” after death.
If humans would have known in the past centuries of it too much and on those pictures of sky and hell set, “to today our conceptions coin”, then be characterised the contemporary prophetic science of hopes for completion rather by a certain embarrassment or speechlessness.
“Larger hope was driven out Christians and Christians by religious criticism duly”, says the adviser.
It supplied “us with so many question marks that us the exclamation marks seem to have been misplaced”.
Johanna Rahner shares: “The crucial challenge remains the annoyance of death” nevertheless.
With it the question about that longing, “those is connected of the fact dreams that may be good in the end everything”.
