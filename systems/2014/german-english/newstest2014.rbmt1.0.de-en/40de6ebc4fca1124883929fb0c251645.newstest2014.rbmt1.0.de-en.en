The Australian government insists on the hard conditions, which are linked with the rescue package over 325 million Australian dollar for the Tasmanian health service, in order to guarantee that the government of the Federal State cannot waste the money.
Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek announced, Commonwealth to that „immediate measures” will seize, in order to turn a crisis away, which was caused by an aging population of the island state, a higher ratio at chronic illnesses and system restrictions.
The financing for one period of four years was decided after government consultation with the independent Tasmanian delegate Andrew Wilkie.
„The government tied an emergency rescue package, which turns on in our opinion the singular challenges, to which opposite the Federal State sees itself”, explained Plibersek today.
The 325-Millionen-Dollar-Paket covers 31 million dollar emergency aid for choice elections.
By further 2600 operations, including orthopedic interferences and treatments because of grey star, residuals are to be eliminated.
Beyond that there is money for day hospitals in kind of main header and Launceston, better aftercare after stationary stays, the specialist training, services in the range mental health and the introduction of a system as the electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.
„These investments correspond to the ideas, of which hospital employees concerned told me, it are the best possibility, the Tasmanian health system to improve”, said Tanya Plibersek.
The minister insisted on a strict report and accountability of the Tasmanian government.
The Federal State must the current financing level maintained, in order to be able to receive money from the Commonwealth, and report monthly where the extra money was spent.
A three-person commission is furnished and is to guarantee that the Federal State makes health services available as effectively and efficiently as possible.
How Wilkie explained today, the 325 million dollar would only little use, if „they are not accompanied by genuine reforms, those the public Tasmanian health system on a lasting course bring.”
Regardless of its it praised the government for the fact that she had reacted to its request for urgent assistance, whom he expressed first opposite the prime minister at the beginning of May.
„I am that federal aid will make a large contribution in addition, the public health system of the Federal State from the concern list to take confidently”, said Wilkie.
According to the government of the Federal State these choice elections will make up for the recent cuts to a large extent.
But the health-political spokesman of the opposition on federal level, Peter Dutton, is the opinion, the today's announcement is only one „plaster solution”.
„We are in the today's situation, because the laboratory state government took off, said 430 million dollar from the health system” it opposite ABC TV.
It cannot be that a state government tears almost a half billion dollar from the system and that puts in and then does Commonwealth 300 million in such a way, as if is good realigning.
Dutton demanded Plibersek on to guarantee that only one dollar of the rescue package is not spent on additional bureaucracy.
