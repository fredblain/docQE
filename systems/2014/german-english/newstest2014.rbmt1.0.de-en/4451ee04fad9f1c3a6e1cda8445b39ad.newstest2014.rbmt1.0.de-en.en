One could call it the Dostojewski of the USA.
Philip K. Dick was a God seeker, a Metaphysiker, its novels and narrations has also something serial.
Astonishing the relationship in the exterior: the stinging eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And in such a way, as Fjodor M. Dostojewski with its substantial Oeuvre is to be understood as Ergründer and Apologet of the Russian soul, one reads Philip K. Dick as American prophet, which is valid in the own country quite somewhat.
Some titles appeared to publishing house in the Heyne, the Haffmans cartridge with the 118 narrations sell two thousand-unity.
Thickly America explains - the realm of the technical progress breath-taking, paired with paranoia, safety illusion and the faith to be chosen.

This history is now particularly significant.
The “minority report” originates from the year 1956, it radiates the smell of the cold war and the McCarthy tribunals.

“We snatch it us, before they can commit a violent crime”.
And: “In our society there are no big criminals, but we have a prison camp of full Pesudoverbrecher”. They read time stream.
They accept that bad happens, and prevent that the criminal thought is put into practice.
Dicks narration works like the blueprint for the anti-terror laws and the hearing intoxication of the NSA.
Anticipation of the attack: Thus also Obama's drone philosophy functions and - to practice.
But Dicks story is not yet in the end.
The police head deplores the fact that it gives no more division of power, which controls military the everyday life - and which from the state is remaining.
Then the supervisor is supervised and transferred of a future crime.
The system revs up.
It is perfect, but it lies.
