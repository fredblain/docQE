New anti-nicotine vaccine could make for the pleasure when smoking from
Scientists developed an anti-nicotine vaccine, which joke at smoking spoil could.
Only one dose of the vaccine could protect mice a life long against nicotine addiction.
Before tests at humans still further attempts are needed, which can take still some years, but professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical college in New York said, the first results were good.
„We are very hopeful the fact that this kind of inoculation strategy can help once millions of smokers, who tried to stop and, had to have tried but experience all methods out available on the market that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches”, so Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus, which was changed in such a way that it contains the genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus infects selectively the liver cells, which produce then a constant river of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them, before they reach the brain, whereby a smoker nicotine High does not experience.
In attempts inoculated mice, to which nicotine was given, maintained their normal level of activity.
Mice without vaccination against it would have taken, explained one „to time-out” the researchers, an indication for the fact that nicotine had reached its brain.
The experiments are descriptive in the trade paper Science Translational Medicine.
Earlier tobacco vaccines failed, because they contained antibodies.
Vaccinations had to be so frequently given for the maintenance of the antibody level that they were expensive and unpractical.
But the costs of the new vaccine are probably clearly lower, because it transforms liver cells into antibody factories.
As professor Crystal said, in such a way a future vaccine for humans, if it were completely safe, could be given to children, before they came into temptation to try a cigarette and nicotine addiction to prevent.
More probably however it is that smokers would use it, in order to stop.
„You know then: If they begin again to smoke, feel them because of the nicotine vaccine no more pleasure thereby, and helps them, the habit to put down”, describes it.
British scientists said, the results were interesting, warned however at the same time, is necessary still further research.
