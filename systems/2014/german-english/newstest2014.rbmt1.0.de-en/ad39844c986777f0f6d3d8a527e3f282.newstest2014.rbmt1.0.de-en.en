Frontier Airlines raises fees for hand baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to require up to 100 US Dollar from passengers to who would like to stow hand baggage away on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to compute up to 100 US Dollar for a piece hand baggage and 2 dollar for coffee or lemonade even if in the announcement on Wednesday it were to be read that passengers might keep the whole box.
The new fee is valid for hand baggage in the rack over the seat, small bags under the seat is further free.
Frontier explained, one computes 25 US Dollar, if the fee is in advance paid, and 100 US Dollar with travelers, who paid only at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said to worry the fee of 100 US Dollar aimed off to move travelers before over the payment.
„We would like not to compute this sum”, explained them.
Airlines began 2008 to require for the first and second given up luggage item fees.
Passengers, who tried, to go around these plugged therefore as much as possible in the hand baggage, which has as a consequence that the racks over the seat are frequently overcrowded.
Fees are a possibility of inducing passengers of taking less also on board.
O'Malley said, with the new fee does not go it not really therefore, money earning.
It concerns the most faithful customers from Frontier, which would have expressed clearly that it becomes ever heavier, to find place in the subject over the seat.
Passengers, who buy your tickets on the website of the airline, do not have to pay.
That means that perhaps a passenger at the gate of Frontier may carry a luggage item forward free of charge, which must pay next person however to 100 dollar for a comparable luggage item.
O'Malley explained, the website of Frontier and the check in procedures was changed, so that the passengers were informed about the fee, before they would come to the gate.
The new hand baggage fee of Frontier does not come into force only in the summer, an exact date gives it yet.
Passengers grumble frequently about luggage additions and other fees, but airlines fall back gladly to it.
They argue the fact that the transport of the luggage costs money and passengers should pay this service, if they wished it.
Many at Wall Street regard the new luggage fees as indications for the fact that the airlines take enough money, in order to cover after years of the losses the costs from air passage to.
Most leave so far however the fingers of fees for hand baggage.
Spirit airlines Inc. required before three years as first fees for hand baggage and followed later Allegiant air, likewise a low cost airline.
The only other airline with a such fee is Hungarian Wizz Air, explained the airline advisor Jay Sorensen, which pursues the extra charges attentively.
He estimated in a report from December 2011 that the hand baggage fee Spirit brings in annually 50 million US Dollar.
Sorensen, which held in former times a leading position at Midwest Airlines, flew recently with Spirit and was curious, which would expect him at the gate, if passengers were confronted with the unusual hand baggage fee of the enterprise.
„The Boarding process belonged to the smoothest, which I had experienced, said in my career in aviation” he.
I expected to see tooth crunching and palpable discussions at the gate.
„The airplane was full”, explained it, „and the Boarding ran as lubricated.”
Frontier follows Spirit also with the 2 dollar, which are required for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The enterprise explained the fact that passengers, the lemonade or juice bought whom might keep whole box and coffee is free of charge refilled.
Water is further free.
US Airways had tried 2008 briefly to require for refreshment beverages money made this however seven months later again retrogressive, after passengers had weighted and no other large society were pulled tight.
Frontiers step to raise fees for the hand baggage if passengers do not buy directly at the airline, is the recent initiative, with which customers are to be steered on the own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz 10 to 25 US Dollar per sold ticket.
That supplies an incentive to all societies with for inducing passengers to the direct purchase with them instead of over an online travel agency.
Frontier went in this range however furthest.
In September the enterprise began to assign when reservation over an online travel agency only half so many frequent flyer miles.
On Wednesday the miles were shortened again on 25 percent of the air route.
An air passage with Frontier over 1000 miles, booked with a third provider, brings in therefore only 250 miles for customers.
Passengers can reserve also exclusively with the direct purchase on the website of Frontier places.
Frontier has a faithful customer master at its seat in Denver, but the business shrinks and the enterprise loses money.
Proceeds decreased by 9 percent and the flight capacity shrank scarcely 13 percent in the first quarter, as in the financial statement is to be read, that on Wednesday by the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc., were published.
Republic tried to get in the context of sale of the society finances of Frontier into the grasp.
