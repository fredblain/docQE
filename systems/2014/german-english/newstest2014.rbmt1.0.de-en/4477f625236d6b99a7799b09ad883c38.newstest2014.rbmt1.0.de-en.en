The 2nd US-court of appeal explained, the decisions of judge Shira Scheindlin was suspended, until on an appointment of the city was decided.
The judge had judged in August, the city offence against the condition with the way, as the program for stopping and questioning of people are converted.
The city inserted appointment against its estimate and the arranged remedies to furnish including the decision, one supervisory body which was to support the police with the change of its guideline and the appropriate training program.
The court of appeal heard the arguments on Tuesday for demanded suspension.
The appointment report explained, the judge had to be relieved by the case, since she injured the code of conduct for US-American judge, as it is certain that a judge is to avoid the appearance of the partyness; this was partly justified with a set of medium interviews and public statements, in which she had reacted publicly to the criticism of the court.
The judge had judged, police officers injured the civil rights of tens of thousands of humans, because they would take black and Latin American men with the stop and Frisk program in inadequate way aimed in its sights.
She appointed an external place the monitoring of the conversion of substantial changes, including reforms with guidelines, training and supervision of service, and arranged a pilot program also at the body carried cameras in quarters, in which most controls were accomplished.
In August the city explained itself New York ready to terminate the practice of the storage of names and addresses from people to who became to dismiss after control by the police again.

Proponents of changes at the stop and Frisk program of the NYPD say, which becomes changes unfair practices to terminate and a more trustworthy and more effective police to create as well as the way affect, as other police headquarters use the regulation.
Opponents are the opinion, which changes would absorb the moral of the police, but not the crime; also money was wasted and the broader problem of a police was not solved, which is after omission thousands of places in the last decade at pressure.
The judge pointed out that she does not terminate the stop and Frisk practice, which is constitutional, but only the kind of the conversion of controls reforms by the NYPD.
