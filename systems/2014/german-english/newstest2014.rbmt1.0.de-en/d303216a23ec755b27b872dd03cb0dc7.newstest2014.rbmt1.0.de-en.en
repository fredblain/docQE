Bath dry home: A dream becomes true for the FC
At the meaning for the city and the football club the official inauguration celebration for the artificial turf sports field did not lose anything despite the cold weather and the rain.
On past Saturday all had probably desired a more pleasant ceremony, but Petrus did not want to play thereby.
So all those had a checking, which came without umbrella or could not for such one from possibly a reason not hold.
That could be done to the musicians, who framed the ceremony, exactly the same as so some speaker.
Therefore also the FC-chairman Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream, became wet.
Its thanks were valid for all in front mayors Walter Klumpp, who had strongly engaged himself for the conversion of the project, the local council, the enterprises involved and club members, who brought in themselves.
Here completely particularly Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The sprightly pensioners moved 400 square meters of paving-stones for the new ways.
This remarkable honorary commitment appreciated also the state parliament delegate Karl Rombach.
Further greetings spoke for the urban sport committee Hubert Baier, the district chairman of the football federation, Kuno Kayan southof Baden, and Friedrich Knorr of the planning office, which announced a donation for the youth department of the club.
Mayor Klumpp brought in memory that always recurring weather-related influences added to the original lawn in such a way in the spring and autumn that he could not be taped.
Already before 15 years there were the first considerations for the solution of the problem, when the building of a third place with the area of the football club or at the six-form high school at the saltworks lake one thought.
Both was again rejected.
Before six years thoughts on the application of an artificial turf sports field arose, which was generally viewed as the ultimative solution.
Concrete planning was taken up before two years, when the FC transferred the Schabelstube to hereditary lease, assured a cost sharing of 100,000 euros for the building of the place and conveyance of 104,000 euros approved of the country.
The local council decided the assumption of the remaining 356,000 euros at the total costs of 560,000 euros in October 2012, summarized Klumpp.
The commencement of construction of the 68 times 108 meters large artificial turf place took place on 4 June.
During over three months the persisting construction phase 3000 cubic meters of earth were cleared away, about which half for the application of a Dirt Bike distance was used.
