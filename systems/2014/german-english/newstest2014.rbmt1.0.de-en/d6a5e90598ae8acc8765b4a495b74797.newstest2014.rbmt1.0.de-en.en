Security doubts in Mozambique grow in view of collisions between influential figures
Thousands of humans met in the center Maputos under the watchful eyes of the Statue of Samora Machel, the founder of the state and first president Mosambiks, in order to intone with a rare public demonstration of peace calls.
„We want again peace, we want stability”, said Vanessa de Sousa, Geschäftsführerin of an investment enterprise.
From fear around the future of the country it exchanged its business clothes against a T-shirt with the label „we to demand security” on Portuguese and on Thursday of the quantity at the independence place of the capital followed.
For two weeks there is almost daily report over collisions between government forces and Renamo, which rank among the worst engagements since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, by Rhodesia governed by white ones and later the Apartheitsregierung South Africa was initially supported in the effort to destabilize the independent government of the country.
After the peace treaty from 1992 it became an opposition party.
Analysts hold it for improbable that the country drops back again into an full-grown conflict, but the recent events foreign investors and native ones worried.
For the fast growing economy stands much on the play, because the discovery of enormous gas reserves before the coast and coal camps in the northwest could bring in the next years investments from over 50 billion US Dollar of companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the USA in the country.
The governing Frelimo party, since 1975 the dominating strength, and Renamo give themselves mutually the debt for the tensions.
Renamo states, which government has the recent collisions provoked, by having attacked its members in the province Sofala, a traditional center Renamos on 17 October.
The encroachments on the former rebels escalated, than government troops attacked and tried Renamo bases to kill Afonso Dhlakama the leader of the group, explained Renamos spokesman opposite Financial Times.
The government gives the debt for the collisions to Renamo and accuses the organization of soldiers to have attacked.
President Armando Guebuza tried to play doubts down over an instability.
Opposite AFP, he said French press agency to which on Wednesday that Dhlakama regards itself as „a loser”, who wants to use „all its still remaining forces, in order to prove that it can force upon its decisions to the government”.
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they would like to avoid a war.
But the doubts have increased, since Mazanga with the words was quoted, Renamo give up the peace agreement of 1992.
Opposite the FT explained he, thus he had meant that Frelimo does not respect the agreement any longer.
„Our vision is it to take up again negotiations seriously”, said Mazanga.
Earlier discussions between the parties contributed only few to the settlement of the tensions, which were beaconed by a set of collisions in this year.
„We have here two adults of men (Guebuza and Dhlakama), who collide, mean the heads” Joseph Hanlon, Dozent at the open University and Mozambique expert.
None of them is well in negotiating and none is ready to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, which pushes on choice elections, explained, it the local elections in November will already boycott.
Presidency and parliamentary elections are planned for next year.
Some commentators interpreted the employment of force as the attempt of an ailing movement to obtain concessions and financial privileges from the government to.
Renamos of electoral successes shrink since 1992, while a newer party, those from a former Renamo member created Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM) will probably improve, with the elections.
Mazanga states that Guebuza – whose resignation lines up, if its second term of office ends in the next year – which democracy of the country wants to destroy.
„It does not want multi-party democracy, it wants no transparent elections, it wants no peace, because he does not want to give the presidential office”, so to Mazanga up.
It is unclear, which Renamo has capacities, but she undertook unrest pin end of attacks on police stations and vehicles on important north south connections.
Most engagements took place in the province Sofala, which lies some hundred kilometers north of Maputo, in which however Beira is, the port, which mining industry companies use such as Rio Tinto and Vale to the export of coal.
In June Rio interrupted one month long the use of the railway, after Renamo had announced an attack on the distance.
Mazanga answered reservedly to the question whether Renamo will repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to warn „the international community that the things are located to Mazanga in Mozambique not well”, said.
The instability increased frustration over the government still, says Fernando Lima, Leiter von Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many humans worried themselves already because of the corruption, the sluggish progress with the development and a recent kidnapping wave.
„Humans think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and it should be that, which finds, explains solutions for the problems” it.
Omar Sultane, a demonstrator, said, humans wanted simply only to stability.
„Renamo and Frelimo, them do not interest want simply only again peace and usable roads”, explained it.
