Shed said, the decision, the employees for the signing of secrecy obligations shortly after occurrence of the accusations to urge, by the managing director of the child services of the YMCA, Liam Whitley was met.
He said, thus should a contaminating of the proofs be prevented, what had been badly converted however „overeagerly” and.
