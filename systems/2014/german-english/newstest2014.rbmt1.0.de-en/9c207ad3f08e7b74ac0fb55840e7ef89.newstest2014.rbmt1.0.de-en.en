Jumbo jet manufacturers argue in the face of large orders about seat width
Between prominent aircraft manufacturers it came to an argument over the width of seats in the tourist class with long-haul flights, which indicates the tone for a bitter collision on the Dubai air show this month.
The controversy turns around the seat width, which is offered to passengers during long flights in the tourist class – not always those, for which airlines at most strive, but this proven area places the key for the efficiency statements with the newest airplanes of airbus SAS and Boeing Co. .
Airbus demanded this week a branch standard, which a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 duty) in the tourist class prescribes, but the US-American archrival Boeing says, which the airlines should decide.
The argument comes to one time, since the aircraft manufacturers compete to sell still larger versions of their twin-engine long haul fliers and with the event of 17. until 21 November orders for record expect.
Like the rear part of the airplane decorated actual in particular whether it rows with nine or ten seats gives –, is crucial for the indicated economic results, which new „mini jumbo jet” - design to supply is.
Boeing stated, its modernized „777X” seizes 406 people with seats in the tourist class, which are over 17 inch wide and permit in such a way ten per row.
Airbus explained, the competitive version of the A350 carries 350 people in 18 inch wide seats in the tourist class, whereby there are nine per row.
Airplane giants distribute frequently blows over technical details by means of advertisement in the technical literature.
Now airbus appeals before the Dubai air show, where the 777X will also make a running over 100 orders presumably, directly to the public.
Recently the enterprise presented an announcement, which is the beginning of a new indicator war could and backers a picture showed, in which three people together-squeezed in a restaurant sits, and in addition the title: „You would accept that?”
„Boeing suggests long-haul flights in seats, which are closer than regional turbo Props”, says airbus distribution boss of John Leahy.
In view of changed nutrition habits the people change more thickly, but airplane seats to have not radically.
Between the early 1970ern, when the modern long haul travel defined Boeing 747, and the end of the century the weight of the male average American increased so the data of the US-Ministry of Health between 40 and 49 years by ten percent.
The waist extent of the male average American in 21. Century amounts to according to US-American health statistics 100.8 cm.
Airbus says, its rival adhere to a seat concept from the 1950ern, when the average body extent freshly baptized „jet set” was narrower.
One accomplished, thus airbus, investigations, which proved that an additional duty (2.54 cm) per seat increases the sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing denies the numbers from airbus to the seat-measured and says, it does not stand not in the discretion of the manufacturers to decide, how the balance between flight tariffs and facility arranges airlines.
The enterprise explains also, according to investigations the experience depends on the plane on more than the seat width.
„It runs out really to give airlines flexibility so that they can do that, what it in her opinion must, to be over successful”, the flight cab expert describes Kent Craver von Boeing.
They would not like that we dictate to them, which makes them for profitable.
They know their business better than every different one.
For aircraft passengers it concerns more elbow freedom, but for manufacturers it becomes increasingly a topic, which can affect the sales.
Behind the argument running stands around airplane orders with an estimated volume from at least 700 billion US Dollar after list prices in the coming decades, which could affect effectively the export balance of the USA or Europe.
As Reuters reported for the first time in July, the seat layout is the driving strength behind the argument around the new jets.
Both airbus and Boeing maintain 20 percent more efficiency per seat with their newest twin-engine long haul designs as the market leader in this segment, the 365-sitzige Boeing 77-300ER.
The statements of Boeing to the results depend partly on the fact that the 777X is compared with its ten seats per row with the original design by nine seats in the 777.
The increased costs per unit are still smaller than with machines with ten seats per row, used at present.
„Boeing squeezes therefore more seat into its airplane, around it our products to make more competitive”, says Kevin Keniston, Leiter for passenger comfort with the European airbus.
On the other hand say analysts, full cabs with ten seats per row with existing 777s pointed on it that many passengers decided for the closer arrangement, what with cheaper flight tariffs accompany could.
„Eighteen duty seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic criterion the airbus offer of the threat steered by the 777”, says Mary Kirby, Expertin for cab facility, foundress and publisher of Runway Girl network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but a catalog of suppliers, from which the airlines can select.
The world travelers jet salespersen carry even tape with itself, in order to check the facility with the competition.
Even if they advertize the comfort, then nevertheless all manufacturers offer also to jets with highly compressed arrangement for cheap airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers a A350 with zehnsitzigen rows, however according to own statement still none sold.
Until recently airbus stressed, like importantly more adaptability of the cabs is and offered for some jets broad seats at the courses.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets experts say the fact that the call will probably deflagrate after a new branch standard but from the wave from 777X-Verkäufen to divert could.
