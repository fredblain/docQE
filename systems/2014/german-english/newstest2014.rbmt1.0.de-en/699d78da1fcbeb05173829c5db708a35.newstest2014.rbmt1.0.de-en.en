A study was announced by the British government, which was to increase the advantages of the HS2-Eisenbahnprojekts for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd. one suggests realising with beginning of phase 1 in the year 2026 high-speed connections between Scotland and the north of England.
Transport minister Baroness Kramer said, the project „Great Britain together will more near bring”.
The Scottish transport minister Keith Brown explained, it was very much pleased to work with the British government about this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed railway connection between London and West Midlands.
After conclusion of phase 2 it will give to connections after Manchester and Leeds.
In June the government corrected the estimated costs of the building of the high-speed route between London and North England of 32,7 billion pound on 42,6 billion pound.
The British government, that stands in discussions with transport Scotland, assigned HS2 Ltd. to look for further distance capacities and travel time improvements for North England and Scotland.
In addition the possibility belongs less travel time from finally three hours or from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: „Our goal for HS2 is a really national route network, the Great Britain and its cities more near brings together.”
We precede with HS2, because it brings enormous advantages with itself.
Without it we stand before a capacity crisis in our railway network.
But it concerns also the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which are improved owing to HS2.
The Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commentated: „The today's announcement is a good message for Scotland.”
In the name of the Scottish government Keith Brown Carmichael requested to use itself „unmistakably” for the Scottish integration into the HS2-Netzwerk.
Brown said: „In addition, the high-speed railway connection saves the potential of enormous economic advantages for Scotland, at the same time supplies the resource of Scotland an argument for fast railway connections to all of Great Britain.”
Therefore we are pleased to work and the options for a high-speed railway connection in Scotland examine as partners of the British government, the advantages for all create and the connection Glasgow Edinburgh supplemental, which already plans the Scottish government.
I look forward to check the investigation report together with the British Ministers in the next year and to decide the next steps.
