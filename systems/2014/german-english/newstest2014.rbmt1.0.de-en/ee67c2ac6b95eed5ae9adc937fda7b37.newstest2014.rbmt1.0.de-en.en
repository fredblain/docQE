Even if the SG Achim/bathing is for four play days without victory, further good tendency prevails with the handball Oberligisten.
To it coach Tomasz Malmon leaves at all no doubts.
All are further fully motivated with the thing.
I hope nevertheless that we win finally also once again.
“I white already no more, like such a victory tastes”, expects Malmon a sense of achievement of its crew with the VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even if the third league reserve from Fredenbeck peeled off up-to-date still no trees, Malmon lifts before warning the index finger.
Many players I trained still in the A-youth.
They against their ex-coach will be from there it surely completely particularly motivated.
“Besides it is valid to await whether then still reinforcement from first is thereby”, clarifies the SG-coach.
In order to return finally again to the success trace, the Malmon team must increase compared with the past appearances in any case.
First of all in the covering work and with the switching play it lacked last nevertheless enormously.
Also the opportunity utilization must become definitely better.
From there I hope that my players got the head during the short break finally freely.
