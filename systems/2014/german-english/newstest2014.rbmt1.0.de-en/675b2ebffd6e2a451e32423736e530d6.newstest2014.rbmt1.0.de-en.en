Pledge houses boom in Singapore, since the crisis arrived in the middle class
In a pledge house in the shopping centre Bendemeer in Singapore exchanges Janani Amirthalinga a golden bracelet, a ring and a pair of earrings, in order to be able to pay the school fees of their daughters.
„My husband and I have a straight house bought, there put my whole money in it”, say Amirthalinga.
Although she earns each month 3,000 Singapore dollar (approx. 1,730 euros) as an administrative employee and its man also works, be sufficient the monthly family income not, describe it.
Actual is demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where the indebtedness of the households increases – so largely that VALUE Max, where she made her exchange became this week the third pledge house, which is listed at the Singaporean stock exchange.
Pawning of jewelry is too gotten – 1,300 Singapore dollar in the case of Janani Amirthalinga –, but also nearly as favorable not only a fast way, in order money as an unsecured bankers' loan.
Typically pledge houses in Singapore an annual percentage rate of 17 percent, which lies only scarcely over the 15.4 percent, which requires United Overseas bank, require, a local creditor with a branch in the same shopping centre.
Pledge houses offer however the advantage that no examination of the credit-worthiness or the income proof is necessary here, why loans are faster than possible with banks.
For this reason millions of humans in the region turn to pledge houses, after families feel the pressure by rising cost of living as well as an increasing household and consumer indebtedness.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credits due to a loose financial policy in the developed marketing areas families with smaller and middle incomes visit pledge houses to adjust with stuttering economy the difference.
This week called the rating agency standard & Poor's increasing household indebtedness, mainly by rising mortgages, a factor of risk for the credit-worthiness of Asian banks.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household indebtedness in Asia in relation to the gross domestic product according to estimate of the agency.
Malaysia still stands with 80 percent of the Gross Domestic Product at the point of the list, a rise of 60 percent in the year 2008.
Political economists worry themselves also because of the high consumer indebtedness in Thailand, which came out this week scarcely from a technical recession.
On Thursday the data showed further existing export weakness and a leaving of the consumer demand.
„Eventually that means that in view of rising costs humans in the middle to lower segment (the income scale) will try to supplement their income where that is possible always”, says for song Seng Wun, Ökonom with CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historical highest levels with the gold prices in the last two years still strengthened the trend for the pledging of personal articles, since humans use the opportunity to transform the jewelry of the family into cash.
In Singapore about 70 percent of the pawned articles in the 200 pledge houses of the city state is gold.
The people say themselves: „The gold price looks good, lets us Großmutters gold chain pawn and next month back bring.”
The largest Thai pledge house operator, EasyMoney, experienced a 20-percent customer increase in his branches in the last months.
Growth in the pledge business is so strong that VALUE Max, would like to expand Betreiber of the branch in Bendemeer and 15 further in Singapore not only into neighbouring Malaysia – where the enterprise operates four houses –, but also outside of Asia, so Yeah Lee Ching, managing director of VALUE Max.
The enterprise finances with 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollar, which took it this week with the initial public offering in Singapore.
During some creditors because of high interest rates in the crossfire are guessed/advised, explain Yeah that pledge houses would not only offer more favorable interest than other lenders, but also not directly the debts increased.
„Customers beleihen articles, which already possess them, and which liquefaction of personal objects of value does not describe increased the Haushaltsverschulung”, it.
The pledge borrowing business is accepted socially increasingly as short term, secured financing.
Also not all humans are, the pawn shop use, in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore come also into the branches of VALUE Max, in order to pawn gold bar and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
To us customers come from each social layer.
„To it belong wealthy ones, which borrow something at short notice for a business or an investment, or small enterprises, which must bridge bottlenecks in the cash-flow”, say Yeah.
Sometimes they need also simply only very fast money.
