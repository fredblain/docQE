Of Germany largest regional church one offensive-started, in order to promote for the profession of the minister.
Background is a possible lack of minister: The Evangelical-Lutheran regional church Hanover counts on the fact that the number of their will halve itself at present approximately 1,800 ministers and ministers according to current situation to 2030.
For young people today the profession is very attractive and offers good future prospects, said minister Mathis Burfien (43) in the discussion with the protestant news service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the work and routine of the day.
Burfien the regional church for the first time assigned a minister on a full place to inspire young people for the theology study.
At present less and less young people decide after the Abitur to study theology.
Burfien attributes this to the process of the Entkirchlichung: “God voice is quiet, the world is loud”.
The profession of large freedom and variety is coined.
I am master of my calendar and can my emphasis set, where it is important to me.
Ministers could be completely close as pastors with humans.
They earned so much like teachers and could well on it live.
Surely in the free economy more one pay, but theologians would have a safe employer.
That comes to meet the young people today, those it not only around career, but go around a sense-fulfilled work.
To information at present approximately 60 ministers go to the regional church, which covers three quarters of Lower Saxony, into the retirement per year.
At the same time about 40 graduates of a theology study begin their Vikariat.
In thinly populated peripheral areas like the resin, which can become Emsland or the turning country in the future it difficult to occupy places.
Burfien wants to organize and to it also well-known people invite among other things study days for young people, which studied theology.
The theology study offers broad training.
One can become thereby even Federal President.
