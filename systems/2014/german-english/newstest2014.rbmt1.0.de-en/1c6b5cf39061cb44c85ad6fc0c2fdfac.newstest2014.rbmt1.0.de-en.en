Mother in the forest buried and pension takes the money
When its aged mother died, a man from Wolfsburg forged a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and took further its pension and nursing allowance.
In order to be able to take the money far pension and nursing allowance, a 67-year old Wolfsburger bury has its dead mother after investigations of the police in the forest.
First it hushed up the death of the 89-year old, then he coated the money more than one and a half years long.
Now the 67-year old must answer for itself because of fraud, how a spokesman said on Friday.
Therefore the man hid the woman in a forest in close proximity to Helmstedt.
The man was suspected already in May: At that time it was noticeable that for the mother in need of care no more medicines were needed.
The pensioner, its mother told the investigators to Spain had traveled.
Because this seemed to the official strangely, they continued to determine.
It came out that the two had lived for more than 15 years in a common apartment and it had maintained it last.
The 67-year old finally granted the death of its mother.
An autopsy did not show reference points for a capital crime according to police.
