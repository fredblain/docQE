Tourism: Descent to the Romans
On approximately 120 m is received to Cologne a sewer from the Roman time below.
Who visits Cologne, does not go past at the cathedral.
Approximately 157 meters rise up the two towers into the sky and make it the second highest church building of Europe.
But only few visitors, who admire the two delicate steeples, suspect that there is a quantity to discover also under the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is expert in things Cologne underworld.
Meeting place for its guidance is direct the service center of Cologne tourism at the cathedral.
The tour begins completely more unspectacular: “We catch in the underground parking on”, say Schulze.
In the seventies the city fathers wanted a auto+fair city, and therefore only that stopped from the remains of the old city wall, which was not too large.
Most users of the multi-storey car park rush therefore today also at the Roman remnants and turn off only their car.
But who looks more exactly, in the parking deck an archaeological place of discovery separated by metal lattice bars discovers D2.
To see about five meters are high ruins from handplate-large stones.
“There is remains of the Roman city wall, which was built in the second half of the first century after Christ”, tells Schulze.
Before it goes again back to the daylight, Schulze the participants on the upper park level still another view lets deep pit throw into a dark, 15 meter.
That is the well of the old cathedral, which is unfortunately also hardly noticed.
Next station of the tour is the praetorium, and here the participants rise again down into the depth.
We experience here the seat of the once most powerful man north the alps, the Prätors of the CCAA.
Which means CCAA, a visitor would like to know.
“The abbreviation stands for “Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium”, which” means” so much on well German like “city of Roman right and city of the Agrippinenser, based among emperors Claudius at the place of the altar for the emperor cult.
And with the praetorium it concerns the former governor palace, the center of power of the Roman empire on the Rhine.
From the lobby of the exhibition leads a tunnel entrance to the Roman sewer, which is received on approximately 120 m here.
“You can go along calmly a piece along the so-called Cloaca maxima, if you want”, muntert Schulze the guests up.
A surprise has Schulze still.
After it got at the cashier the key, he leads the group to a 16 meters deep, accessible pit.
“We are now in the Mikvah, a ritual Jewish bath”, explain it.
The Jewish community built its bath deeply into the ground, in order to come to the groundwater, which was indispensable for ritual ablutions.
Until today different water levels are readable by changing levels of the Rhine in the lower end the Mikvah, whose origins decrease in the respected century.
The Mikvah becomes part of an archaeological zone on the town hall square, for which the construction work is to begin shortly.
Up to the completion however still some years will offense.
