Dr. Georges Bwelle belongs to the Top 10 „the CNN Heroes OF 2013”.
They can for it or one of the other heroes in the Top 10 co-ordinate, in order to select it to „the CNN Hero OF the Year”.
The winner receives 250,000 dollar for the continuation of his unusual work.
Long Georges Bwelle viewed 21 years, how his patient father again and again lost consciousness and to hospitals traveled, which did not have the means, in order to help him.
Jamef Bwelle became 1981 with a car accident in close proximity to Yaoundé, which injures capital of Cameroon.
First it had only a broken arm, but then formed an inflammation, which expanded on its brain and caused there a hematoma, which should impair it for the rest of his life.
„It gave no to neurosurgeons in Cameroon”, thus Georges Bwelle.
We would have brought it out from Cameroon, if we had had the money.
Instead spent Bwelle years to accompany its father in overcrowded hospitals and hospitals to offer in order to get there the treatment, which they had.
„It is not simple”, commentates Bwelle.
One can at five o'clock in the morning the house leave and to the hospital run, in order to be first, and is nevertheless not first.
There are a great many patients.
Some humans die even, because they must wait.
The situation hardly changed, since Bwelles father died 2002.
In Cameroon there is only one physician for 5,000 humans each, so the World Health Organization.
In contrast to this the relationship lies in the United States with a physician for 413 people.
But even if there were a physician for it, most Kameruner could not afford the visit.
Two of five humans in the country live below the poverty line and almost three-quarter of the expenditures for health in the country are private.
„The only problem, which they have, is the poverty”, says Bwelle.
And the poverty not possibly makes it to enjoy the life.
Its father and so many of its compatriots suffering to see let mature in Bwelle the resolution to undertake somewhat against it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and its volunteer team accomplished 700 free operations in the last year.
He became even a physician and works as a container surgeon in the cent ral hospital in Yaoundé.
In addition it created a nonprofit organization named ASCOVIME, which travels to weekends to rural areas and offers there free medical supply.
Since 2008 it and its volunteer group helped scarcely 32,000 humans.
Almost each Friday obligations it and up to 30 people into minibuses and drive themselves with the tied medical equipment on the roof over fastened terrain into the villages, the assistance need.
Always everything does not run smoothly.
Already more than once they had to push the vehicles by rivers and mud.
But if they arrive, they are received like heroes: a feast, a singing and dance and the best accommodation, which the place has to offer.
In these villages free medical supply is real a reason to celebrating and Bwelle – with its broad smile and its boundless energy – participates gladly with the merry celebration.
On the next morning the team begins then with the investigation of hundreds of patients.
„Pro trip we treat 500 people”, thus Bwelle.
They come from an area of 60 kilometers around the village – and to foot.
Each of these weekend hospitals offers medical supply in a set of ranges.
Many people are treated because of malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasite and sexual transferable diseases.
Others receive sprags, donated glasses or free birth certificates – a document, which is necessary for the school, however many poor families simply not to afford know.
In the evening the team implements simple operations with local anaesthetization.
The operations normally take place in a school, the city hall or a apartment; after the interference the patients rise and go into the recovery range, around place making for the next one.
The lighting for the OI and the disinfection equipment fed of the generator of the group and in such a way to work Bwelle and its volunteers into the early morning hours on Sunday.
It is a arduous workload, but the village musicians normally help to keep the team motivated.
„You drum the whole night, with it we to remain awake and our work to continue be able”, say Bwelle.
On Sunday the team drives then back into the city, tiredly, but proudly on the performed work.
The group – a mixture from Cameroonian physicians and foreign medical students – accomplished and knows 700 free operations in the last year that it causes an enormous difference for humans, who she helps with her work.
A man explained that the free operation of a ledge break, which it received makes possible for him now to work again.
„The future of my family changes”, meant the man.
Beside the weekend hospitals and its work as a surgeon in the hospital Bwelle works also at night in private hospitals in Yaoundé.
With this second job of financiers it 60% of its non-profit activity, so Bwelle; the rest originates from private donations.
„I do not know really, when he sleeps, says” Katie O'Malley, which studies in the second year to the Drexel University in Philadelphia medicine and voluntarily in Bwelles group cooperates.
It always either in the hospital or tried is to raise money for the organization so that it can go on these campaigns.
For medicine and nursing for the sick students such as O'Malley, which come from the USA and Europe and support Bwelle, this is an opportunity to gain practical experiences which were never gotten it at home.
„We can be with operations thereby, where we help, blood to dab or the instruments for Dr. Bwelle hold”, explain O'Malley.
That would be in America as a medical student in the second year never possible.
The students normally pay their travel to Cameroon and bring along frequently donated medical material.
If they are however for a start in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over the accommodation, transport and the instruction.
„He is completely certainly a hero”, says O'Malley.
He does not dedicate his life to this organization and its desire to help the Cameroonian people knows borders.
For Bwelle the almost constant work is not a load.
Other to a happier life to help and thus a promise fulfill, which it gave to its father, prepares large joy for it.
„I am so happy, if I make, mean this work” for Bwelle.
And I think of my father.
I hope, he see, what I do.
I make it, in order to bring humans back the laughter and alleviate around the pain.
