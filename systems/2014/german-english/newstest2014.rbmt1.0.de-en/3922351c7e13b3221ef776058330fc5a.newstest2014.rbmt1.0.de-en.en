Halloween 2013: In figures
When I was small, Halloween had somewhat magic.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, stay up late and to disguise us for the neighbourhood.
Today I became rather the Halloween Muffel.
In the last two years I did not explain myself ready to distribute from my apartment from sweets and it this year will probably not do.
But according to statistics I am a black sheep, which concerns Halloween.
The majority of the Americans – 158 million, in order to be exact – celebrate this year Halloween and spend thereby altogether 6.9 billion US Dollar on sweets, costumes and decorations, so the US-American federation of the retailers (NRF).
A thing, to which I look forward each Halloween then nevertheless again, are the trend values.
The costumes will constitute about 1.2 billion of the 6.9 billion spent US Dollar, so the NRF.
In this year are tantalizing dead articles the last word.
Women do not have to wrap themselves no more in sexy clothes, them can now also seductive meal as for instance pizza, a Hamburger or carrots embody.
Which concerns men, I expect a lot of zombies owing to The Walking DEAD, and I bet, which becomes Daft punk Weltraummänner it this year into the Instagram feeds to create.
According to Google the most wanted costumes are zombies, Batman, Piraten and Hexen.
I assume, it am wrong nothing at tradition.
We disguised last year our dogs and were thereby to my astonishment not alone.
Americans actually spend 330 million dollar this year on costumes of their domestic animals, so the NRF.
Those are a quantity „Hot Dogs”.
Which concerns sweets, we are not squeamish.
Americans will spend this year 1.9 billion dollar on it, so The Nielsen Company.
Those are about 270 million kilogram at chocolate bars, Lutschern, drops and gummi bear.
Thus good news for according to US-Ministry of Trade 41 the millions of people, who pulls sweet or sour with the saying „” by the quarters.
We will actually buy over 40 million kilogram of chocolate for Halloween and – will make we nothing pre to eat itself.
The only one, which we would not like to consume, is the sugar-sweet Candy Corn; 15 million kilogram of it around Halloween are sold nevertheless, so the national federation of the confectionery manufacturers.
Those are about nine billion corn grains.
It is a mystery, which I could not solve yet.
Nothing belongs more to Halloween than houses, in which it haunts.
They have great names like „terror Behind of the embankment” (which is by the way located in a genuine prison), „Howl O Scream” and „The House OF shock”.
There are actually 1,200 officially recognized spook houses in the United States, which obtain 500 million dollar proceeds, thus America striking NT, and the marvelous photos include, on which one pees oneself straight into the trousers and which friends place then on Facebook, where one does not get rid of her again, and then the type, on which one stands, leaves a comment to one like „nice facial expression”.
But we come finally to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown made us familiar with the large pumpkin, when we were children, and carving a pumpkin lantern is like a decorating of the Christmas tree – something, which from small we made on.
Fortunately began „the babies in the pumpkin” - trend only last year owing to Pinterest, so that most of us grew up thereby, the pumpkin to into shape-carve and not to sit in it.
This year Americans about 106 million dollar on pumpkins will spend, so US the Census office.
The pumpkin lantern, which rots slowly in the front garden, probably originates from Illinois, where this year 245 million kilogram of pumpkins were harvested.
If you liked to score correctly, then you called Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and carve you somewhat pretty from its 921 Kilo heavy pumpkin.
