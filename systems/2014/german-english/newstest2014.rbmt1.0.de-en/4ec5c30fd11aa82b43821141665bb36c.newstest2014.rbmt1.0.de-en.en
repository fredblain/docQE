Losses of profit with bombard after decrease in the case of delivery numbers and orders
The Canadian airplane and railway manufacturer bombard Inc. announced on Thursday a 15-percent decrease of the net profit, after it by declining orders and distribution were guessed/advised with airplanes in the third quarter as well as contract problems in the railway section under pressure.
Bombard with seat in Montreal published also no flight test datas for his brand-new airplane of the CSeries and gave no new information over it whether in accordance with the airplane the ambitious schedule in next September into the commercial use can go.
After the maiden flight of test flight things one and a half months ago followed so far only three further starts, which lets it appear questionable whether the test phase runs as planned.
The results stayed behind the prognoses and led to a sharp fall in prices from over eight percent at the stock exchange of Toronto.
Cameron Doerksen, Analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered on Thursday his evaluation of „outperform” on „sector by form” with this in view that the share possesses into the next course potential limited to two quarter.
„Weaker delivery numbers were expected as far as possible with airplanes, but of the margin development within the transport range we are completely clearly disappointed”, said Doerksen in a customer letter.
We are the opinion that bombard new orders for the CSeries will receive, if the test routine for the airplane progresses.
If however in the coming months no new orders are announced, then we expect that the market the program becomes more sceptical opposite.
Bombard hopes that the airplane row of the CSeries can catapult the enterprise into the lower market segment, which is dominated at present by Boeing and Airbus.
First test flight things were introduced in the March of the public and flew to months-long delays for the first time in September.
But so far obligatory orders for the CSeries with 177 are moderate, since potential buyers wait for the results of the flight tests and would like to see whether the statements of the enterprise are applicable regarding fuel efficiency and cost saving potential of the new jet passenger plane.
At present there are altogether to 403 orders and promises of 15 customers and societies.
Chairman of the board Pierre Beaudoin gives itself confidently that bombard his goal from 300 obligatory orders to beginning of the commercial use of the jet will reach.
The management insured the program on Thursday in relation to analysts and media in addition, lies in the schedule.
„Test flight things remained not longer at the ground than expected”, said Beaudoin at a telephone conference call and added, during the service life of the airplane ground tests and software updates were set.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to undertake a first flight and attach then one revision period, which we also did.
That happens during the entire flight program.
Second of five test flight witnesses will presumably start in the next weeks, the remaining briefly thereafter, was called it from enterprise side.
Analysts remain nevertheless sceptically whether after the maiden flight the first customer an airplane of the CSeries can take twelve months in enterprise.
Bombard explained, it examine planning for start-up (ICE) and these in the next months will update.
„Slow progressing the flight test – even if they correspond obviously to Bombardiers of internal planning – our opinion encourages that start-up shifts, said on the first quarter 2015” Doerksen.
In the third quarter with end on 30 September Bombardiers net profit fell on 147 million dollar and/or 8 cent per share of 172 million dollar and/or 9 cent per share in the year before.
The adapted earnings per share amount to invariably 9 cent.

That world-wide fourth largest aircraft manufacturer indicates, he delivered 45 airplanes in this quarter, a decrease of 57 in the last year.
The net orders fell from 83 airplanes to 26.
The order books in air and space section amounted to on 30 September 32.9 billion dollar and were unchanged thereby in relation to 31 December.
„Within the range the results were appropriate for air and space travel in the context of our defaults, but the low incoming orders and market conditions altogether were disappointing”, said Beaudoin.
The revenue in air and space section fell by 13 percent on two billion dollar.
Bombard, the world-wide largest railway manufacturer, it announced that the revenue in this section rose around scarcely eleven percent to 2.1 billion dollar.
The order books in the transport section amounted to on 30 September 32.6 billion dollar and were easily increased thereby in relation to 31 December.
The profit margin within the range transport was impaired by completion problems with some large contracts.
According to management it will give new defaults for the fourth quarter.
