Özdemir wants to receive jazz training in Stuttgart
Into the continuous discussions around the future of the colleges of music in Baden-Wuerttemberg now also Cem Özdemir, Federal leader of the Greens intervened.
“I consider it wrong to give the holistic training up in the college of music Stuttgart”, said to Özdemir “Stuttgart News”.
Jazz and classical period belong together straight at the jazz location Stuttgart.
Thus Özdemir, which is valid in Stuttgart as favorite for a direct mandate with the election to the Bundestag on 22 September, contradicts the green-red federal state government.
This forces a re-organization of the five colleges of music in Baden-Wuerttemberg on the basis of an expert study.
Afterwards among other things the course of studies jazz and Pop is to be shifted by the college of music Stuttgart to the college of music Mannheim.
