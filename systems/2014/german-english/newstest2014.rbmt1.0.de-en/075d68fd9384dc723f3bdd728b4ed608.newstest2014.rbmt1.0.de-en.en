To the responsible persons
I was asked to write you concerning your investigation for mass monitoring.
I am called Edward Joseph Snowden and was Security Agency (NSA) in former times contractual and/or over a direct employment than technical expert with that national, which employs cent ral Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (dia.) of the United States.
In the course of my occupation in these facilities I became a witness of systematic violations of the law of my government, which caused me from moral obligation to acting.
As result of the publication of these doubts I saw my family and my homeland relying I to a serious and continuous agitation suspended, which forced me.
I live at present in the exile and enjoy limited asylum, which grants me the Russian federation in accordance with international law.
I am encouraged of the resonance on my political action, both in the USA and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world and also high office-holders - including the United States - have the exposures to a system of the overarching monitoring, which is not guilty to anybody of account, when judges a service at the public.
These espionage exposures drew many proposals to new laws and guidelines, which aimed at the before times covered abuse of public trust.
The benefit for the society from these won realizations becomes increasingly clearer; at the same time the risks taken in purchase were obviously decreased.
Although the result of my efforts was as can be prove positive, my government disagreement still treats as loyalty break and strives to criminalize political expression of opinion and place under accusation.
Nevertheless: The truth to express is not a crime.
I am confident that the government of the United States with support of the international community becomes this detrimental attitude placing.
I hope that I, if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are settled will be able, me at the responsible clearing-up of the facts concerning the statements, in particular regarding truth and authenticity of the reports transacted in the media, to take part appropriately and law-appropriate.
I look forward to a discussion with you in your country, as soon as the situation is clarified and thanks you for their efforts to protect the international law us all protected.
