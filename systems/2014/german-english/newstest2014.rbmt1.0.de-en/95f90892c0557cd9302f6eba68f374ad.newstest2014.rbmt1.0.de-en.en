GEC-hung: No absolute protection possible
“We want the inhabitants promptly into planning to merge”, open mayors Jens Häußler the citizen information event to the flood protection concept in GEC-hang.
Approximately 80 participants had come into the community hall to express in order to let the planned measures be explained to place questions doubts and bring in ideas.
Häußler got straight: “The last-finite decisions fell the members of the local council”.
The flood, the GEC-hung to 15. May 2009, unprepared met, a drastic event was, which raised the question about preventive measures for the future, so Häußler.
A river basin investigation had been given with the neighbour community Aidlingen in order, which is now basis for the flood protection concept in GEC-hung.
“The protection as much as possible cultivated properties is the goal”, like that Häußler.
At the basis put planning the protection from a loud German weather service is statistically every 100 years floods which can be expected.
By a 15-percent addition is considered to the climate change.
Among experts this is marked with “HQ 100aKlima”.
The masses of water, which had led 2009 in GEC-hung to considerable damage, corresponded to a 1000-year old flood.
“There is not an absolute protection, but we can obtain a relative improvement”, so Häußler.
In order to obtain the protection HQ 100aKlima, must in GEC-hung approximately four million euros be invested, whereby the community can count on national subsidies at a value of approximately 70 percent.
Häußler pointed out however that it gives the promotion only if a total concept is converted.
In addition the community is dependent on the co-operation of the citizens.
A complex planning and licensing procedure must be completed.
In the best case 2016 can be begun with the conversion.
Among other things sees the protection concept, that in the past week in the local council was already presented (we reported) local measures in the supply of the river Irm from the Stammheimer valley forwards.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept the participants used the opportunity to bring in their requests.
Among other things it was questioned why no more dams and retention basins were planned for the protection of the place.
Gregor Kühn, Fachplaner of the assigned engineer's office forest and Corbe from hill home, which presented the concept, that it needs the interaction of all presented measures stressed, in order in the sum the desired goal to reach.
Beyond that one is to be found held the most economical solution, so to Joachim Wald von Wald and Corbe.
Displeasure prevailed with adjoining owners of the old place, who have suffering even with normal thunderstorm rains again and again under an overloading of the duct system.
The problem is with the administration and first measures was already seized.
Häußler pointed out however that the guidelines for duct systems were others, than for the flood protection and this may not be mixed.
The community is obligated to lay the duct system out in such a way that two to three-year rain events could be borne.
The sewers more largely to dimension, millions would devour.
