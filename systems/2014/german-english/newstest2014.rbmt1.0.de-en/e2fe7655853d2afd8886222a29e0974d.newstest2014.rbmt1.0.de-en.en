Children should receive myths and legends as „models for the life” taught, mean an author.
Stories of Thor showed that „brutal strength does not have an opportunity against smarter cheats”, and the Artus legend demonstrates, how important it is to have a dream.
Many of the myths are however „by far too wild, to offensive and in some cases too dirtily, over at schools to be taught”, why Crossley Holland pleaded for one „careful selection” of agefair works.
„I find it wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of the education”, said it.
I already suggested that for twenty years as plan.
It added, with authors and teachers, who were excessively didactical „”, children „completely would switch off”, because in entertaining stories the messages were obtained „subliminally”.
Crossley Holland, which translated Beowulf from the anglo-saxon one and author of the Penguin Book OF Norse Myths and that are British Folk of valley, explained: „One can pursue certain intentions, but one should keep her if possible in the background.”
Perhaps that big difference between an adult is appropriate for author, who write for adults, and an author, who write for children, in the necessity to obtain hope.
Everything must be simplified or led to the happy ending, but there is an immanent sense for good and evil.
This must be subliminally represented, reveal by those history and not explained.
That is old history of showing instead of telling.
