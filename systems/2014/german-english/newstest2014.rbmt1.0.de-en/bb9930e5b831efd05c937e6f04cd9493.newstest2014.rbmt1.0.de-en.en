Esa decides on large space missions: Missions for billions
Far planet, gravitation waves or black holes - experts of the European space agency must agree now on two large-scale projects, which want to start them in the next years.
30 proposals stood to the selection, five still are in running.
Far one worlds.
More than 1000 planets with other stars already found astronomers.
Whether it gives at least on some of it lives, does not know.
The selection falls heavily: Is one to look for gravitation waves?
Or rather the origin of the cosmos investigate?
Search or for earthsimilar planets and thus perhaps extraterrestial life discover?
These questions arise the straight responsible persons of the European space agency Esa.
For their program “Cosmic vision” look for it ideas for two large space projects, which are to make progress with the research crucially.
The budget for such “L-missions” is approximately in each case with a billion euro.
The start will be presumably 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of Septembers met into of Paris the elite of the European space research, in order to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas stood to the debate, five of it now into the closer choice came.
Numerous committees examine the proposals, probe with the researchers.
In the next days a final decision is to fall by the scientific program committee.
Altogether the Esa selected four large questions, on which the missions the 2007 initiated program “Cosmic vision” answers to find are.
What are the conditions for the emergence of planets and lives?
The exact procedures with the emergence of stars from large gas clouds - and concomitantly the emergence of planets, which circle these stars - lie still in proverbial darkening.
A large infrared telescope in the universe could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star possesses planets, under which life can develop for circumstances there?
In order to follow to this question, 2017 are to start the space telescope “Cheops”, with which 500 already well-known planetary systems in our closer environment are examined more exactly.
The possibilities are however limited, Cheops are a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments the astronomers could illustrate earthsimilar planets and analyze and for “bio markers” look for even the composition of their atmospheres in such a way: Gases, which are considered as indication for biological activity.
How does the solar system function?
Also this question is to give final information on it, there are which conditions for the emergence of lives.
An important role plays the magnetic activity of a star and the reciprocal effect of its magnetic field as well as particle radiation with the planetary system, outgoing from it.
In our solar system these procedures can be examined exemplary.
With “solarly the orbiter” the Esa already granted a mission of the M-class (the budget is there with approximately to a half billion euro) for this question.
The probe is to start 2017 and to observe surface and activity of the sun exactly.
Are of great interest to the researchers also Jupiter and its moons.
They want to find out, which role the giant planet played with the development of the solar system.
But the Esa plans first that altogether the three L-missions of the “Cosmic vision” - program.
The probe “Juice” (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) presumably begins its travel 2022.
Later it reaches and is eight years Jupiter the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy moons Europe, Callisto and Ganymed to examine.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The universe offers many possibilities of studying and of examining subject under extreme conditions in such a way whether us admitted of laws of nature are there still valid.
Perhaps are also deviations, which could point the way to a new theory to the physicists, under whose roof all well-known laws of nature be united can.
How did the universe develop and what does it consist of?
13.7 billion years ago our cosmos resulted from the Big Bang.
Beside the common subject, of which stars, planets and organisms as we consist, there are us dark matter, whose gravity galaxies and galaxy cluster holds together, and dark energy, by whose working the expansion of the universe accelerates itself.
So far the researchers know neither, who physical laws were valid in the first fractions of a second of the Big Bang, nor from which dark matter and exists dark energy.
With “Euclid” the Esa also here already granted a M-mission, whose start is intended for 2020.
With a special telescope the probe is to examine the distribution of the subject in the universe for the first time in the entire sky and to make in such a way conclusions possible on the condition of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could make a running
Of the 30 proposals in the end the selective procedure only two will remain remaining.
“E-Lisa” has the best opportunities on a grant as L-mission, a demanding concept to the proof of gravitation waves according to opinion of many experts.
Among them physicists understand changes in the structure of the space-time, which had forecast Albert Einstein before nearly 100 years.
They were not proven until today.
Elisa could create that, hopes the scientists behind the project.
The mission plans a detector consisting of two or three probes, which is stationed in the universe.
It could prove gravitation waves, which developed with the Big Bang contrary to plants on earth also, and so new realizations over the emergence of the cosmos to supply.
Four further proposals still compete around the second L-mission: a large Roentgen telescope named “Athena”, which is to investigate among other things black holes, “Icy Planets”, a further mission to the outside planets of the solar system, “Prism”, a mission for the measurement of the cosmic background radiation, and the “exoplanet Finder”, which is to seek out and examine earthsimilar planets.
Among other things proposals to the sample return motion of Mars, for the research of moon, Venus and asteroids as well as to sun physics were already ruled out.
