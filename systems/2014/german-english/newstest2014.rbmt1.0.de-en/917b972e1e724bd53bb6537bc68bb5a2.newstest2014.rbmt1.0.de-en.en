George Kerevan: European decartelization gives the choice to the Scots
A new day, a new fright history to independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is necessary, in order to step the Schengen area as condition for the EU membership.
That supplies the keyword for stories over passport checks to Berwick and a border secured with barbed wire along the Hadrian's Wall.
Indeed in the Strathclyde template to the possible economic advantages, which would bring more freedom to travel in remaining Europe with itself, but played this – as expected – was referred in the headlines no role.
Also nobody mentioned that the EU member states bend into shape frequently their strict rules, if it is more favorable for them.
Since Scotland does not belong at present to the Schengen area, the continued neglect for Brussels would be only a small concession in response for what one wants really from the Scots.
Thus actually no story.
And one, which came already in such a way into the years that it already resembles a fossil: The first time has I „independence means passport checks” - duck before at least 40 years belongs.
An interesting point is lost with constant repeating of this age-old history.
Why should one expect from an independent Scotland that it dances after the European whistle?
Why the London yoke against of Brussels exchanges, particularly now?
Those are the real European news: The large plan for the combination of Europe, seized after the war, is guessed/advised in the stagnation.
With the euro crisis the project Europe died officially.
Everywhere in the European Union win parties at ground, which are European Union-hostile or which euros would like to throw as common currency over board.
Even in Germany the euro-sceptical party alternative for Germany – only this year based – could get hold of scarcely five million voices with the election to the Bundestag in September for itself and drive out thus effectively the free democrats (the equivalent to the British liberally Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There was always domestic resistance against the plan to create federalistic Europe.
The current economic crisis turns out however as turning point.
Because of Berlin and the European central bank strict austerity policy in connection with the straitjacket, into which the respective national economy is forced by adherence to the common currency, are many humans of the opinion, the project Europe imposed went too far.
The crisis of the euro has to do a little with the fact that national governments cause excessive budgetary deficits – that was only in Greece the case.
Instead the euro system its members festgenagelt on rates of exchange, which are favorable for German exporters – and German politicians would like to leave that gladly in such a way.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the local currency south Europe with an inserted productivity disadvantage appears opposite Germany.
The only possibility consists of shortening wages and public expenditures – spurred from Berlin.
Behind the current budget and currency problems a more deeply going European productivity problem lies.
As consequence of Brussels „become green” energy guidelines – a code for the subsidization of French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumers – ordered pay the European industry compared to the United States the double for electricity and the quadruple for gas.
That is an immobilizing cost disadvantage, as we could already see in Grangemouth.
All wage fixing of the world do not protect the European petrochemical industry by cheap American slate gas into the corner to be pushed.
As consequence a revolt pulls, up particularly in France, to the former Cheerleader of the European Union.
After the war the political elite of France saw the European Union as a vehicle, with which one could hold Germany in chess and lift Paris eye level with Washington.
But Berlin does not need Paris any longer than gate for political authentication and Europe its own economic policy pushed open, with which the fastened French economy has to fight.
The result: Of Marine Le Pen's Front National oriented towards the right and European Union-hostile a straight crucial by-election won and thus the governing socialists to place three referred.
Front National is now the popular party in France with 24 percent of the votes – a time-fair warning for the British labour party that it cannot assume that, a splitting in the right spectrum would mean advantages automatically for the left one.
What makes again popularity among the white Frenchmen of the working class won for Le Pen with their?
She would like to use the European Union-elections next year in addition, an anti-European Union, to forge anti-common currency block in the European parliament.
If the anti EUROPEAN Union parties fare with these elections well – and that is very well possible –, then such a block could dominate the European parliament for the first time.
This is the point, on which I want outside: In too furthermore future will not come together the increasing resentment against the European Union and the common currency for the abolishment of the euro.
The European Union will not disappear, but it will become rather something like „Europe (sovereigns) of the nations”, which favored general de Gaulle.
Perhaps Germany and a few its satellite managing hold to the euro, but France and south Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect that Great Britain dissociates itself from this project in hope to curry favor itself with the USA.
However Washington's increasing interest in the Pacific area puts close that Great Britain will be located alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where does Scotland remain with all that?
We can decide to be a region from (in last consequence) small England to.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – to which also belongs to say Berlin and Brussels what it where put itself can.
I assume, Scotland could drive in a looser European group completely well, if we keep our own currency.
Co-operation with other, similarly thinking countries is simpler in föderierten Europe of the nations.
Otherwise we should consider to follow suit it to Norway and keep our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland actual remarkably – most successful political movement against the austerity policy in Europe and has 2011 a spectacular majority due to the refusal of the suggested (and made) shortening won which, which the labour Minister of Finance Alistair Darling and the following Tory Lib the coalition had to answer for.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to decide now for an independence to only get in order then forced upon of Berlin and Brussels an austerity policy.
