Pope Franziskus appoints first cardinals in February
Pope Franziskus will appoint new cardinals of the catholic church for the first time on 22 February, as Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest-ranking clerics in the catholic church after the Pope and them are it also, which select a Pope, so that Franziskus thereby will appoint the first group of men, who will finally participate in the choice of its successor.
At present there are 201 cardinals.
However a cardinal, who reached an age of 80 years, can do no more at the Papal election participates – is assigned to a group of 120 „cardinals entitled to vote”.
In an explanation, in which the message was announced, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman of Vatican said, it a meeting of all cardinals will take place, before the ceremony is held for the appointment of the new cardinals, which admits also as consistory is.
„Pope Franziskus decided, his decision for the summoning of the consistory in February in advance admits to be given, thus different meetings, which require the participation of cardinals from all over the world, be planned can”, said Lombardi.
Jack Valero von Catholic Voices said that the number of the cardinals entitled to vote will have probably sunk until February.
He explained, a Pope normally appoints so many cardinals as necessary, so that the number of the cardinals entitled to vote amounted to again 120, and so many cardinals over 80, as he would like.
The consistory in the next year is important, because it is first since the choice of Franziskus in March this year, like that Valero.
At present give it a certain overhang to up sides of Europe and in particular Italy.
„It will see being interesting, whether the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world, around the balance to restore”, said it.
Forty percent of the catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
The cardinals will be also first, who will appoint since the education of the advice of the cardinals created by Franziskus, a group of eight cardinals from around the world, who have the order to find possibilities for the reformation of the church.
In the past the Pope decided everything alone.
„Now Franziskus selected these eight cardinals, who are to help him”, said Valero.
He explained, it was well possible „” that Franziskus asks the cardinals for advice.
But so far we were not in this situation – that is completely new everything.
Valero said that typically the bishops from large places would appoint as cardinals, but does not put Franziskus „full surprises – we know thus not, whom he appoints”.
