NSA exposures strengthen firm paranoia because of national monitoring
On a mild day at the end of August flew a German law enforcement helicopter deeply over the US-consulate to Frankfurt/Main, the financial capital of Germany.
On instruction of the federal office for protection of the constitution and counterterrorism (BVT), the German interior secret service, he should photograph the roof of the US-outguard, who less than 5 km of the European central bank and the Federal Bank is.
According to German media the BVT wanted to prove the presence of monitoring antennas and the action led to a dispute between the USA and the German State Department in Berlin.
James Clapper, US-American Director OF national Intelligence, consisted to develop these again in September on it that the USA did not use possibilities of the foreign espionage to steal „around the trade secrets of foreign enterprises on behalf US-American companies thereby their international competitive ability or their profit could.”
But since Edward Snowden, who is not to the Whistleblower former employees become, with whom publication of its Füllhorn at US-American monitoring secrets began, European governments and head of a company any more surely whether they can take the director with the word.
Reports, according to which the American national Security Agency the Brazilian oil company Petrobas spied and data of American Cloud providers including Google and Yahoo procured itself, brought firm paranoia because of national monitoring on a new highest level.
The barrel for overflowing possibly already brought the exposure that chancellor Angela Merkels telephone was verwanzt, for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can turn out in its sights, then also managements are potential targets with security.
Snowden made intensive co-operation between U.S. secret services and enterprise transparency.
I believe, it am conceivable that these data are used for the mutual benefit.
„Germany must wake up”, explains Oliver Grün, Präsident of the BITMi, which represents small and middle IT-companies in Germany.
German enterprises believe, the USA represented now almost just as large risk as China, if it concerns industrial espionage and data larceny, so a survey, which was published in July by the advisor company EY.
In the documents oozed by Snowden there was however so far no proof that the USA passed the trade secrets on of foreign enterprises to own companies.
Politicians expressed their concern over the fact that certain IT and Internet possibilities were missing to the European Union and their dependence on the USA it should reduce.
The enterprises are in this connection sceptical.
In the Bundestag was suggested, we should construct a German Google.
I can close only my eyes and open her slowly again…
„So functioned that”, does not say Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software vendor SAP.
If one had wanted a strong European IT industry, then one had been supposed to let her become extinct not before 20 years.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, by the coal over cars up to the agriculture.
Everything, up to the IT-industry.
Nevertheless range and technical refinement of the US-Spionagebehörden uncovered by the Snowden exposures shocked companies, which had before seen the largest espionage risk in China.
At the Cloud Computing takes place a large change, because European enterprise leaders are conscious now that in the USA stored data are subject to the local jurisdiction and therefore potential are endangered.
According to one of the Cloud Security Alliance, a commercial institution, accomplished survey rejected about ten percent not in the USA of the residents of members of plans after the exposures over the US-American DATA Mining activities with Prism to use an American provider.
Jim Snabe, deputy managing director of SAP, says: „We see a new question of customer, who gave it one year ago not yet – she reads: Where my data become and can stored you guarantee that these remain physical in this right area?”
Many German enterprise leaders hold the opinion, which confirms recent report simply only, what they anyway already knew, i.e. that powerful States of their most valuable secrets to steal want and these therefore at any price to be guarded to have.
That industrial espionage takes place, is no surprise.
That was always like that.
„It was many years long a topic and by the current discussion fundamentally changed”, does not say Kurt Bock, chairman of the chemistry company BASF.
The Americans spy us on commercial and industrial level, as we also make, because it is in the national interest to defend our enterprises.
The management does not boast normally over the counter measures, which one seized, because provides for aggressors advantages.
In large enterprises for a long time hammered into that carrying of a free USB stick forward on a fair or unguarded leaving of a laptop is not advisable in the hotel room, gentle is said to employees.
Ulrich Hackenberk, Vorstandsmitglied with automaker Audi, says that it belongs for years to standard practice to collect before an executive committee meeting the mobile phones so that her not when listening units can be used.
The German BVT guesses/advises executive personnel to use simple Prepaid mobile phones if they go on foreign travel, because smartphones can possibly be compromised.
The Prepaid mobile phones are afterwards thrown away.
There is however the concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain open to attack in relation to Hacking and monitoring.
In Germany many of these enterprises are world-wide market leaders in the respective niche.
„Small and medium-sized enterprises are missing often the experience, staff and financial resources, around trade secrets effectively approximately did not authorize access to protect”, do not warn the BVT in a report.
The USA warn own companies before industrial espionage by other countries.
According to Washington Post in US were arranged national the Intelligence Estimate in February France, Russia and Israel behind China on rank two of the countries, which availed themselves for the procurement of economic parameters of the Hackings.
A member of the board of a German Blue chip enterprise agreed, if it concerns industrial espionage, then „is the Frenchmen the worst ones”.
Bernard Squarcini, former director/conductor of the French interior secret service DCRL, was quoted this month in an interview with the following words: „Secret services know very much exactly that all countries, even if they co-operate in the fight against the terror spy their allied ones.”
