The veganism is subordinate to vegetarianism according to lexicons, differs from this however nevertheless in completely substantial way.
Because during vegetarians this Schlemmereien takes the liberty, does not stand the consumption of layer cake, ice or a strong Edamer not on the menu of a vegan.
Milk, cheese, egg, beside that renouncement of meat and fish leaves the vegan of the all consumption of animal products off also honey is answered in the negative.
Which remains, one may ask oneself, but on closer inspection the vegane nutrition world is characterised by a considerable imaginativeness.
“Spreads are much like”, explain Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the local reform house, who holds a variety ready of special products for vegans.
Also Reuben Proctor visits the shop in the cathedral lane gladly.
Since 13 years lives the native New Zealander vegan, in Lampertheim finds he (nearly) everything, which he needs to the life. “placed 1997 I mean nutrition over and became vegetarian”.
Over the turn of the century took place then the next step and I became vegan.
“The conviction did not however only come because of the nutrition, but due to the shoe choice”, says Proctor, which prefers imitation leather normal leather.
It recognized that it goes also in other everyday interests without animal products.
Primarily is vegan its an ethics.
“I do not want that animals for me must die”, express Proctor the maxim of the vegans, who extend to the entire consumer behaviour.
Instead of Burgern to afterwards-mourn scrambled eggs or rubber bears the vegan discovered fast completely new products, rose the enthusiasm.
“It is not a double bonus”, says Proctor today, “actually represents vegan its renouncement, no asceticism, but it is an enrichment”. The acceptance that one reduces the selection of food options with the nutrition conversion, attributes Proctor rather to the power of the habit.
And exactly these conditioning let some still so well meant attempt fail also.
“The craze factor is a completely crucial factor, which lets many give up fast, similarly as when smoking”, sets up to Proctor a comparison.
And objects: “Certain tastes are not at the animal to fasten”.
Often there is the spices or the kind of the preparation, which constitute the taste.
“One can produce in addition, in other way the same effect”, clarifies the vegan.
To a barbecue Proctor bring along for example eggplants, mushrooms and also a few Veganwürste.
It pays attention to a balanced, varied nutrition, with which it is to taste quite also once hearty.
Naturally one would like to have something between the teeth, that is legitimate.
“It is to taste, but that is not only to animal food to reduce”, like that Proctor.
, He did not suffer health damage up to eating disorders, a further widespread acceptance.
For me the conversion had a positive aspect.
I do not take up strange cholesterol and have a increased vitamin portion.
There are high speed athletes, which exclusively nourish themselves vegan.
“My blood values are in the best way, I can often be checked”, betray Proctor.
In particular before the lack of vitamin many Vegansimus critics warn B12.
“There animals with animal feeds to be fed, instead of grazing on the pasture, it is questionable whether in the meat, which one buys in the cooling chest, which is high Vitamin-B12-Anteil”, finds Proctor.
For vegans give it besides the possibility of taking the Coenzym in the form of tablets to itself.
“My B12-Werte is correct”, explains it.
Far ways does not have Proctor for the food procurement to go.
Staple food gives it finally everywhere and to each supermarket has meanwhile soy milk and other products.
I find everything that I need, locally.
Only now and then I buy something special.
“Many people surveyed that just only the finished products are expensive, but it in such a way behaves “usual” finished products well-known-measured also”.
Anyway the preparation of veganer courts is by far more favorably and less time-consuming, than generally accepted.
“In the house kitchen it gives to discover much, a few small tricks can one good, if not partly better results obtain”, say Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, somewhat more baking powder and carbonic acid instead of egg, with its veganen cheesecakes could bring also its parents-in-law to Proctor to being astonished.
The vegan lends a new spice to family celebrations.
That has dynamics, if one cooks together, has that a new value.
“The situations, which can develop thereby, are as differently as humans themselves”, say Proctor.
Naturally was already brought to it in addition, skepticism.
Doesn't my meal taste to you any longer?
“Target I now badly feel, because I drink milk?” - with such questions one must act as vegans with intuitive feeling.
“I do not reject humans, I am part of this society”, would like Proctor no enclave existence to eke out.
And the everyday life world appears more exactly regarded then not at all in such a way veganfremd as assumed - and the vegans not as in the everyday life reduced as generally accepted.
Also nearly Food is permitted.
There are French fries everywhere!
“Many kebab shops offer falafel, or just, Proctor says a vegetarian Yufka”.
In a pizzeria it changes over to pasta courts, or orders just a pizza without cheese, everything a question of the habit.
The restaurants adjust themselves so slowly to it.
“As I began before 13 years to nourish me vegan was still many more difficult all”, can the New Zealander a development make: “One must talk with the people, her on it draws attention”.
“If sufficient demands come, are perhaps bent them to supplement the menu”, hope it.
Vegane restaurants develop, like for example the galley in Mannheim or the café bird-freely.
Proctor preserves the desire that also different restaurants stand at least a veganes court on the menu have.
Strictly speaking are vegane courts for all there.
Everyone can eat it, it is thus exactly the opposite of exclusive.
“Meat dishes are exclusive against it, in the true sense of the word, because they close others out”, determine Proctor.
“If one food scandals to avoid wants, then veganism is a safe way to make the all-largest part from the beginning impossible”, says Proctor.
The purchase of veganer products can be somewhat difficult however at the beginning.
In particular if one learns to understand, which also into peanuts animal additives contain as color givers its can, one seems with the observance of the ethics with so many hurdles to leave and traps fast the courage.
Therefore Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen did not only write a book: “Veganissimo - the many ingredients, which are buried food in addition, detergents, explain animal ingredients and their alternatives”.
“Gradually one develops a scanner view and knows, to which indications and logos one has to pay attention “it is sometimes better small steps to do than stop or to trip”, white Proctor.
The veganism, it is an important moral pointer, which strikes on consciousness.
Perhaps it creates it not completely that one puts its habits down, but at least can it the consumer teach to analyze its habits critically.
