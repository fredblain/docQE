Property oh: Still more security for pedestrians
They do not stand 100 meters from each other remotely: On Tuesday into property oh new B 33-Fußgängerampel at the village parking lot in enterprise one took - in range of vision of the older city hall traffic light.
Two plants so near together: Intention or Gothamite caper?
This question answered of property ACH yesterday mayors clearly.
“The city hall traffic light was installed at that time, because this secures the way to school”, for described Eckert yesterday.
The Kluser traffic light safe both cyclists and bus passengers and the Bergle inhabitants.
Yesterday officially the plant taken in enterprise is important for the crossing range Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße.
We have the museum, two churches, spa gardens, the bus stop, a physician and a bank as well as the flow of traffic from the populated area› dug ‹.
“With high traffic and pedestrian arising a further traffic light had”, ago so Eckert for their security.
This confirms also Peter Arnold of the district administration office open castle.
“Sound current measurements on the B of 33 daily about 12,000 vehicles the community property oh, of it about ten percent heavy transport” is driven through, stresses Arnold.
Therefore the building of a further traffic light is more than necessary: “Security goes here simply forwards”, thus to Arnold.
Altogether four traffic exhibitions, also a roundabout were accomplished were started thinking, however because of the tightness within the crossing range Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße again rejected.
According to Arnold with the choice of location the traffic light masts before all this was tested: “Means we have extra for us with particularly long wood trunks of loaded transporters edition-Estonian-constantly, whether these vehicles from the Sulzbachweg can drive out on B 33, without the traffic light masts to snap”.
Those approximately 15,000 euros expensive traffic light device is the “most modern, which gives it on the market” at present, to described Arnold.
The plant is equipped with colored LEDs, which shine so strongly that the lights of the drivers are to be recognized for example also with low-standing sun well.
And economically is it also: The older lighting systems use about 100 Watts, the new just eight Watts.
Per driving direction there are three lighting systems.
Arnold explained the technology of the new plant: This is equipped with two radar detectors.
If the pedestrian presses the traffic light button, the upper radar detector the traffic conditions test.
If the road is free, directly green comes for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
A further radar detector checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be terminated.
“A group should or go-obstructed humans over the road to go, the green phase is extended, it comes thus everyone reliably over the lane”, explained Arnold.
Naturally the driver must follow here as partners and observe the lane.
This was not yesterday the case: The traffic light for pedestrians hardly showed green, rushed an upper class vehicle through - with bright red.
