Scientists could throw more lights on it in which connection stands for the tail whisks of a dog with his tendency.
Earlier research had shown that happy dogs wagged the tail more to the right (from view of the dog), while it was with nervous dogs the left side.
But scientists say now that other dogs can these subtle differences notice and to it react.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuro scientist of the University of Trento, said: „With humans is well well-known that the left and right brain half differently to stimuli reacts, the positive or negative emotions cause.”
Here we tried to view to us this with other species.
In addition he noticed that with dogs exactly as with humans the right brain half was responsible for the movement of the left side and turned around, and that different roles played the two hemispheres with the feelings.
In order to experience more over it, how dogs react to the lateral tail whisks of their animals of the same species, the researchers supervised the animals, while these films of other dogs viewed themselves.
They measured the heart rate of the four-legged friends and analyzed the behavior.
Probably we will soon understand, why the tail moves times into the one, times in the other direction
Professor Vallortigara said: „We showed the dogs of films with dogs – either a version true to nature or a silhouette, in order to eliminate diverting other aspects, and we could steer thereby the movement of the tail more to the left or right.”
If the animals saw, like an otherwise inexpressive dog (seen by the perspective of the wagging dog out), remained it moved the tail to the right completely eased.
However if the tail inclination was primarily to the left (perspective of the dog, which wags), then its heart rate and it rose looked jerky.
In opinion of professor Vallortigara the dogs do not communicate intentionally with one another by these movements.
It is rather convinced that the dogs from experience would have learned, with which movements it itself worrying should and when not.
He said: „If one different meetings with other dogs has and a wagging the tail in a direction rather linked with friendly behavior is rather a less friendly behavior produced and the right side, then one reacts to basis of these experiences.”
The researchers say that the realizations could help owners of dog, veterinary surgeons and coaches to a better understanding of the emotions of their animal.
John Bradshaw, Experte for dog behavior and guest scholarship holder at the faculty for veterinary science of the university of Bristol explained, this had not been the first study, with which it was examined whether on the left and on the right was important for dogs.
Last year found a team out of the university from Lincoln that dogs turn the head to the left, if they view an aggressive dog, and to the right, if it concerns a content dog.
In another research work at the university of Victoria in Canada the following stood: „Dogs go rather toward a robot dog, if its, tail wags ` left and not right, instead of becoming jerkily – exactly differently than in the Italian study.”
According to its statement the differences could agitate from there that the dogs in the different studies the animals in the films and/or the robot dogs not when dogs interpreted.
A study, how dogs react to genuine dogs, could help, explained it.
„There are considerable proofs for many different mammals that the two brain halves for different purposes are used, but must many of the details be still determined – and dogs form there no exception”, thus for Bradshaw.
Since its behavior can be noted however simply, it will probably not for a long time last, until we understand, why sometimes the tail moves into the one, sometimes in the other direction.
