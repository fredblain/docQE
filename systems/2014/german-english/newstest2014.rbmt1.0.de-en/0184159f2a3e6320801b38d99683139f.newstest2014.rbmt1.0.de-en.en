Schools are stopped to larger focus on mathematics, orthography and grammar
In courses to English literature pupils must in the future at least one piece of Shakespeare, a novel the 19. Century, treat romantic lyric poetry and contemporary British novels starting from 1914.
Into the examination also „unseen texts find to” entrance, in order to stimulate to broader reading.
The combined course from English literature and language is abolished.
Starting from 2015 pupils their own GCSE examination for language placing must, whereby there are strong incentives for selecting English literature as separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will tomorrow publish the new curricula for English and mathematics – the first subjects, which were radically transformed.
Other core subjects are changed next year.
In a separate initiative becomes Ofqual, which supervisory authority for examinations, a reorganisation of the GCSE structures to announce, including a new grading system and a less coursework.
In a speech in the summer said Secretary of Education Michael Gove that there are one „broad consent that we must reform our test system, around public trust to restore”, whereby he stressed, which would become GCSEs „more provocatively, more ambitious and stricter”.
Studies show that in English schools less time on mathematics one spends – 116 hours per year or three hour weekly per school year – than in most other countries.
In contrast to this Australian schools inform on the average 143 hours annually and pupils in Singapore receive 138 hours.
It will not give a formal requirement to plan in the time table more time for mathematics but from coalition sources means it, which comprehensive math examination – combines with a stronger weighting of the subject in rank lists – will encourage schools probably to set more hours.
In the curriculum more attentions to „problems from the correct life” one puts, including mathematics of finance.
