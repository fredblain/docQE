Advice takes railway tracks in its sights
Is the railroad overpass to be converted “at deer” the complex, in order to increase the road safety?
Yes, the local councils decided.
Scold oh for it 220,000 euros must take into the hand.
The German Railways wants to improve the Kinzigtal railroad line in the coming year.
Particularly thereby security at railroad overpasses is to be increased - regularly it comes country widely to collisions of courses with other vehicles.
If the communities the structural alteration measures agree, they must take part with a third in the costs, the rest divide course and federation.
Of scolding ACH architect-general Roland Grießhaber described the characteristics of the Bahübergangs to the local council “to deer”.
There the city plans to build at height of the local tunnel mouth west the railway lines a projection.
There also larger vehicles, for example such, could the long trunks transport, with oncoming traffic stand, without having to block the tracks.
Grießhaber suggested from there designing a necessary retaining wall in such a way that the city could widen the following road at given time, in order to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This discussed in the local council controversially, there some advice the necessity for a road spreading impugned: Thomas Kipp brought the tendency of the critics with his expression on the point: “Having we because of so few vehicles so much money into the hand to take?”
Mayor Thomas Haas contradicted: The railroad overpass “deer” is used regularly for long trunks transportation.
Even wood from the range “cow brook” is partly transported over this distance, because up to 20 meters could not use long vehicles the distance to the Häberlesbrücke, because they could not turn there into the main street.
Beyond that serve the distance as bypass for those vehicles, which may not use the tunnel, if the main street is closed, argued Haas.
Since it is to be foreseen that Kirchberg and lock mountain tunnels would have to be converted and reorganized, how this is in wolf oh the case at present, can come to the railroad overpass “to “deer” also for a longer period an important traffic meaning.
The advice agreed, examine to leave, the widening envisaged of the road would cause which costs.
Regardless of its change of the railroad overpass by the majority affirmatively under the condition that the necessary retaining wall is built in such a way that the city can remove the following road direction “Bahnhofstraße” if necessary for meeting traffic on approximately 5.5 meters.
The change of the railroad overpass with the tannery cozy wine could lead to against it completely different problem, which concerns the approach road in the strongly rising “Geroltzhäuser way”.
The administration had let examine the change plans of the course of the engineer's office Breinlinger, since it had doubts about it whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser of way was still easily possible then.
The investigation came to the result that it was not to be excluded that inclination conditions of the road could lead to the fact that longer vehicles mount.
The responsibility for this carries again the city as road construction load carrier.
The change can therefore lead to liability disputes.
Since both the wood removal and bending in the current development condition functioned, one was not to agree the change of the railroad overpass, argued Haas.
Also here the risk of a collision of the course with a vehicle standing on the transition is clearly smaller than at the other railroad overpasses, because beside it the critical point center is directly, to which a good line of sight connection exists.
Even courses from the main station would have to be already so far braked here that no collision threatens.
By the majority the change of this railroad overpass the agreement refused, there the city scold oh the problem with mounting vehicles “to pay for would have”, so the advice, since the course can withdraw itself after conclusion of the construction work from the responsibility.
As unproblematic the committee regards the changes at the railroad overpasses “before hay brook” and “before cow brook”, for which crossing agreements were already met with the course.
