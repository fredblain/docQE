By air emergency service bird saved by North Sea offshore construction work again set free
By air emergency service a bird flown to the coast, which had been found exhausted on a North Sea offshore construction work, became again into nature to dismiss.
The water rail was flown last month with a helicopter to Aberdeen, where it was fed up by the Scottish animal rights group SPCA in their rescue centers in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, Leiter of the center, said: „This water rail was a winter migratory bird from Northern Europe, that by the strong hoist over the North Sea was probably stopped.”
Apparently the exhausted bird looked for refuge on the offshore construction work.
It added: „He could not fly on any longer, why we were contacted with the request for assistance.”
During its release the water rail was again fit and healthy.
