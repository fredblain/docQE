CDC publish allergy guidelines for schools
On Wednesday those of center published for Disease control and Prevention (CDC) a set of guidelines for handling food allergies of children at schools.
These are the first such guidelines, which the US-American government published, since the number of schoolable children with food allergies rises.
One of 20 children in the United States has in the meantime a food allergy.
The spreading of food allergies among children increased 1997 and 2007 according to CDC between by 18 percent.
The guidelines contain information for schools, which is to be supposed to wake a consciousness for food allergies with faculty and the employees and as with children be gone around, who show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have Epinephrin available – the autoinjection of the brand EpiPen is most frequently used –, in order to be able to meet a potentially deadly hypersensitivity reaction.
The legislators in the Federal States changed recently the regulations, so that schools Epinephrin can keep more simply available.
In the report also a list is contained of typical symptoms, which are called by children, who exhibit an allergic reaction.
Perhaps children say: „It feels, as if something presses my tongue on my tongue”, „feels, as if a hair lies on it” or „my tongue tingles”.
