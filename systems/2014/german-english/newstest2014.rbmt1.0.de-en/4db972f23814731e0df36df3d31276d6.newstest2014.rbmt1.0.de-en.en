Traffic light on continuousred: To latency pay attention
Sometimes a traffic light does not become simply green.
The contact loop in the road does not react, or the light signal is defective.
What is one to then do - at the red light to drive?
If a concerning waited for a long time enough at a red traffic light and is free the crossing, he can drive on, explains the Stuttgart attorney Ralf Becker in the magazine “motorcycle”.
The latency must be “appropriate” however, which can be for each individual case differently laid out.
Becker guesses to endure at least five minutes before from a malfunction of the traffic light is to be proceeded.
Who continues driving despite red light, it must realize itself however that he carries the full debt for an accident caused thereby.
Who waits less than five minutes, perhaps not for a long time, warns Becker waits enough and refers to a resolution of the higher regional court Hamm.
In the case negotiated a driver had ignored and had the traffic light after approximately three minutes continuousred for a negligent red light offence to answer for itself.
The traffic light was not defective, but wrapped around a little later on green.
A driving ban remained for it because of the special situation saved - the fine however not.
