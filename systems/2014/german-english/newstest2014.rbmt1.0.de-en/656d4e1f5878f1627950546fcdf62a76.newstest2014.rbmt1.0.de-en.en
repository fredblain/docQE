New goals announce UN with the fight against poverty
The United Nations begin immediately with the elaboration of a number of new goals, with which before twelve years the announced Millennium development targets are to be replaced to the fight against poverty.
Before the UN-summit for sustainable development, which in the evening in Rio de Janeiro began, Australian diplomats played a key role with the raid for „lasting development targets”, which are to replace the 2015 running out Millennium goals.
They were taken up to the concluding draft of the document, which will be adopted by world-political leaders, including Mrs. Gillard, with the summit.
UN-Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon explained in the evening on the summit, the time came, „beyond the national interests”.
„I am pleased that the member states informed themselves to tackle a process with that universal, lasting development targets to be agreed upon am”, said he.
„These goals will develop on our progress from the Millennium development targets and integrals a component of the framework for the development after 2015 will form.
I will shrink from no troubles, gave this me from the member states mandate to convert, in order to realise our vision of the lasting development targets, those on the success of the Millennium goals develop.”
