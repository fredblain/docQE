Kindergarten found a private buyer
“The building is in good hands”, says Winterlingens a mayor Michael Maier.
The municipality sold the former kindergarten in Gartenstraße to a private person.
The sale agreed the local council in its recent meeting in the not public part.
The building changed its owner at a “appropriate” price.
“The community is content”, stresses Maier.
In the household 100,000 euros were set.
Is not yet clear, as the new owner wants to use the earlier kindergarten.
The mayor is it right that Winterlingen handed over the responsibility for the building the winter ago to someone else and thus no more must be responsible for the entertainment of the house to be heated as to the garden to be looked and the sidewalk vacated.
“This expenditure is now away”, is pleased Maier.
