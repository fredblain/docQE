The waste-oriented society does not think
The night was long, the music loud and the tendency good, but it goes sometime home.
Only: In the bellies of the people on the front seat passenger and rear seat hunger becomes apparent.
Clearly, but or other cocktail or sparkling wine may be responsible!
What lies there more near to drive as chilled to the next drive in order to grant itself a little thing?
I admit, I participate gladly also, if it goes lateat night and/or early in the morning to the fast food getting.
A few French fries, a cola drink, a Burger - and then nothing like off home and in the bed!
But on the way home the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco Gängern become apparent.
Because which must be missing to one that one throws its fast food bags from the autowindow with constant regularity?!
Above all on weekends thrown away paper bags lie at edges of road and on parking lots.
“Why? ”, I ask myself.
Are the people too stupid, in order to take the bags with home respectively up to the next garbage pail?
It is not only like that that of paper things ruins the landscape.
Bags already covered transportation facilities such as guard rails and released thus accidents.
About something like that meant “waste-oriented society” does not think however, probably white it not even, what actually means this word.
If one in the evening more frequently on the way is, more than ever with several people in the car, one knows, how partied non-stop after back bank nights look can: Gears, bottles and other garbage pile up themselves there.
There few bags would not constitute more or less nevertheless also a nothing - contrary to the road, where none wants to rum-trample on the leftovers of others.
I see the day, on which clearing will have to require the cities and communities to dumb - and the fast food chains for its bags pledge coming.
