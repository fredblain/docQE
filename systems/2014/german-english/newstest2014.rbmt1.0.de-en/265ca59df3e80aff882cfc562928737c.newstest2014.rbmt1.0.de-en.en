Also in this year at the name day of the holy Hubertus in the parish church St. Marien is celebrated to the Hülsbergstraße a Hubertusmesse.
St. Hubertus was after the legend a quite inconsiderate hunter, that was converted by a vision and appointed the bishop later of Liege.
The hunting horn wind player group of the hunt riders Westphalians under the direction of Brigitte Kluth makes music on Parforcehörnern (natural horns in the tendency it) after old, originally French melodies.
The wind players carry REIT clothes, because they accompany primarily riders, horses and dog pack on dragging hunts in music.
The solemn fair finds instead of on Sunday, 3 November, at 11.30 o'clock.
