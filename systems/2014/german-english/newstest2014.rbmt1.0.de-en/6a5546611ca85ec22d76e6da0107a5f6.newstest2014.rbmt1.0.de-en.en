Live with future prospect
Actually Waltraud Ries lives fantastically.
Their house lies in a calm residential area of Stuttgart with much green, an old tree existence, nice neighbour and also not all too much traffic.
Into the city there is only few minutes with public means of transport.
“You have hopefully no fear of spiders? ”, Waltraud Ries asks and points to a fat spider at the door frame.
I look for already for some time a new apartment for my man and me.
But you know, how is difficult in Stuttgart.
The reason is however no spider phobia, but the concern not to be able to master at the age the many stairway steps to the house and in the apartment no more explains it.
Besides: Since a meniscus operation the woman in her fitties at the own body had to experience, what means it to induce itself with handicap from floor to floor.
Recently only a book of it is published to the topic 'happy lives in the age - which apartment form is the best for me?'.
'Our apartment is the best example of it, what does not go at all, begins in the age' it to tell.
When it pulled more than 20 years ago with its man into the May sonnet apartment, it was simply only a beautiful apartment in the middle in the country.
Today with center fifty Waltraud Ries thinks differently of it.
In addition, she knows that she belongs to few humans, who argue at all with the topic 'living in the age'.
Most displace it, as long as it goes.
In each case anderen' one, say they become old grinning quietly.
Only if the psychological strain is really large, one thinks.
'Then it can be in addition, to late', already so Ries.
In her book the interior decorator presents 17 patterns of dwelling for self-determined living in the age.
'Which apartment form one selects however, is always an individual decision', explains it.
D i.e. solution does not give it for the age.
Even who can afford the age resting seat in Tuscany or Brittany, it should itself always considers that he also suffer become can.
And: 'Without good knowledge of the national language,' the specialist book authoress Aussiedlungswilligen gives to consider vereinsame one also in the Dolce résumé.
Under their models are classical support models, alternative apartment forms or the often quoted pensioner WG.
At the age everyone has so its spleens and defects
'For me so a group house would be however nothing', means it with a winking.
Already not at all as in a student WG with a common bath and a kitchen.
'At the age one needs simply also its retreat areas', thus Ries.
The fact that a senior group house can function nevertheless does not want to exclude the book authoress nevertheless.
That must run then however differently than in the classical student WG.
And sometimes one wants simply only its Ruhe', believes her.
With this opinion it does not stand at least in the state capital alone there.
'Most old humans in Stuttgart want so for a long time it go in their own apartment remaining', are also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the chief the civil services the lives in the age of the state capital.
Their agency advises humans around the topic 'old becomes round'.
Therefore straight older humans would accept frequently also to inconveniences and restrictions to be able to remain only in order in their used to environment that are also the experience of the foundation goods test.
There are today many possibilities of arranging the house or the apartment barrier-free.
Ries recommends all, which concern themselves with the agefair change of their house or their apartment, to inform for a start thoroughly and not to assign the firstbest craftsman.
Today there are specialists also for the agefair change.
Even in the rented flat let yourself or others realize, and if it is only the toilet seat increase, the interior decorator clears up.
But always the existing apartment cannot be transformed agefairly and thus barrier-free, even if it lies still so beautifully.
This experience had to make Waltraud Ries.
One could install a stair lift within the apartment, the way to on the housing door, likewise paved with stairs, would be however the by far larger obstacle.
It will continue searching, until she found the ideal object for itself and her man.
Of the move it has a horror it more than of the spider at their housing door.
