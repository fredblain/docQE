US-border: “Supertunnel” to drug smuggling discovers
At the border between Mexico and the USA investigators discovered a “supertunnel” to drug smuggling and shut down.
As the US-customs authorities communicated, more than 500 meters long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, railway lines and a ventilating system.
Three suspects were therefore arrested, eight tons marijuana as well as nearly 150 kilograms cocaine were seized.
The tunnel had not been taken reports the according to yet used.
“These trusts are stupidly, if they mean, them could under the radar away dig through itself”, said the prosecutor general of the US-district Southern California, Laura Duffy, at a press conference before a depot in San Diego, where an end of the tunnel had been discovered.
To the drug gangs eloquently Duffy insured: “If your far such tunnels builds and tries to use she are we decided, an enormous wasting of your dirty money to make”.
Both the US-authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a continuous fight against the drug trusts.
Since 2006 in Mexico more than 77. 000 humans were killed in connection with the drug-related crime.
From experts designs
Because of the complex equipment of the tunnel the investigators assume it was designed by architects and engineers and that the building took one year up approximately.
The railway track was in such a way equipped that electrically operated cars could be used there.
On Mexican side the entrance is in a building, which is distant from the border 80 meters.
According to authorities leads a ladder 20 meters into the depth to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross section of 1.20 meters height and 90 centimeters width.
It would have been also suitable in order to promote the illegal immigration direction the USA.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine find.
Third, a Mexican, was seized because of the seized marijuana.
Lifelong freedom withdrawal threatens all three as maximum penalty, as officials said.
Since 2006 eight such tunnels were discovered, continued to be called it to the press conference in San Diego.
It is however the first time that in such a tunnel construction cocaine was found.
Normally cocaine in small amounts is smuggled and not by tunnels.
This shows the “despair” of the drug gangs, whose traditional routes are cut off in the meantime, said Bill Sherman of the drug squad DEA in San Diego.
They would do everything, in order to arrive into the USA.
To the arresting no details were announced, at least one was Mexican, it was said.
They must count on detentions up to ten years.
