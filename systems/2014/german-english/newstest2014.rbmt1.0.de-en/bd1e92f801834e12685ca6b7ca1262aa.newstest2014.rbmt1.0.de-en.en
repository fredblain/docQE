The nine months old Cockerspaniel dog Ruby after a traffic accident in the Sunday afternoon and survived three days had run away alone, before them were saved on Wednesday from a quarry.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his friend Becky Hall, 20, those the dog belonged, came to the quarry Flappit into Denholme, west Yorkshire, in order to take Ruby again in receipt and thank you the firefighters of the west Yorkshire Fire and Rescue service.
They had looked desperately for their missed dog and cries for help in social networks had published, when them had run away after the small traffic accident into the quarry.
Approximately against 14:15 clock on Wednesday saw a walker, who implemented its dog, the stranded Ruby on the 15-meter-high paragraph in the quarry.
The technical rescue team of the Cleckheaton Fire station rushed to the place and roped themselves for rescue Rubys, which was then transported upward in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, Spezialist of the technical rescue team, said: „You was in a dangerous situation.
It was in the center of the cliff – 15 meters from above and for the ground removes.
It did not move a muscle during its rescue – she had rigid-frozen as.
But is now she well.
It ate afterwards a few dog biscuit.
That was a rather unusual employment.
The fact that the dog was discovered, is unbelievable.
Peter Lau, Spezialist of the technical rescue team, said: „Ruby had a giant luck.”
There was the possibility that she was very heavily injured or worse.
Ruby was brought to the veterinary surgeon to the investigation, which however except exhaustion and dehydrogenation nothing determined.
Becky Hall from Halifax, west Yorkshire, said: „With the rescue to watch was frightening.”
I could not believe at all that she really up there was.
It was wonderful to hold it again in the arms.
The veterinary surgeon explained, if the exhaustion had become too large and had broken down it, it would have probably fallen.
The firefighters carried great out.
It was really courageous, which they did.
We are simply so grateful and to everyone of them were absolutely unbelievable.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added: „We had fear that them would fall down, but she remained above.”
The firefighters were great.
I can hardly believe, where she was.
