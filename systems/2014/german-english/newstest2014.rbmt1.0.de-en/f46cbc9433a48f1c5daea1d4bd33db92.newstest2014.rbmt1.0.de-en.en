Local council is pleased about solid household
Every time it concerns into session of the district councils the household, mayor Ralph Gerster has well to laugh.
The Gemeindesäckl in stove cheek beautiful oh is filled well and debts knows the administration already since 2005 no more.
Also the financial year 2012 can be booked in this sense as full success.
This became clear with the conception of the annual account for 2012.
How Andrea Rothmund described, the operating budget with approximately 7.6 million euros over millions a euro had more highly failed than planned.
Also the surplus of the operating budget lies with approximately 1.8 million euro approximately millions euros over the approach.
To owe the surplus is above all higher business tax revenues and the community portion of the income tax.
Also the fortune budget lay again clearly over the planned values.
Instead of the intended 1.5 million euros it amounted to last year 2.5 million euros.
“This is essentially because of the higher supply from the operating budget”, thus to Rothmund.
Since in the financial year 2012 fewer investments than were planned transacted, also the reserves supply failed more highly.
Altogether the general reserve could be increased by approximately 2.1 million euros on now altogether 4.9 million euros.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked you Rothmund and their team for the good work.
“One vibrates, praised such a work not simply from the sleeve” Gerster with view of the annual account.
It and the local councils were pleased obviously about the good numbers.
It may sound paradoxically, but exactly these good numbers could stand the citizens soon expensively to come.
By the good financial situation the community could do in the past without high rates of assessment.
Thus again however according to Gerster already repeatedly subsidies were shortened by the country.
For these subsidies from various balance sticks there are conditions.
Among other things the cities and communities, which request subsidies, must show certain rates of assessment.
“The topic of rates of assessment we must look at, since in the coming years investments line up, for which we gladly subsidies would have”, announced ourselves Gerster in this context.
