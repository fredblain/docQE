The newly designed Opschlag shines with a new cafe.
One, to stay and come back again.
One thing that would make the name on the program.
Be described as déjà vu, according to lexicon, a psychological phenomenon that is in a sense, a new situation to have ever seen or experienced.
In the case of the visit of the eponymous cafes in the district town on Opschlag successor in sight at the Hochschule Rhine-Waal, it must not remain at the pure déjà vu feeling.
Finally, the cafe with the beautiful name aimed at just that: A real stay not only intellectually, but to make hand always experience the pulse.
It's very fun and is simply beautiful.
A look into the inner life on Opschlag 8 gives the viewer a good feeling at the first attempt.
The state-of-the-art, but not cool cafe-style looks like a place to relax.
Here, the team with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top of the guest with a wide variety of coffee or cocktail variants.
There's delicious cakes or individually made fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, have made a name for himself before the opening of the picturesque cafes on the Opschlag as restaurateurs: In Kranenburg, they held the "Art lounge."
The move after a staunch supporter of the Opschlag hope the coffee-lovers more sympathetic audience.
Last but not least by the university.
"While we do not have a specific target," said Daniel Büttner.
Instead, the two would like to raise young students in the same way as seniors and all ages in between.
Apropos cafe-lovers.
The friendly owner few stands behind the coffee-drinking.
The fragrant hot brew enjoys itself in various forms.
Expressofan
Daniel Büttner is rather the Expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the cappuccino-drinking woman.
"A baguette - this is my thing," she tells the NRZ.
Two events there's even in bright cafe.
Rather one.
Because if the port festival took place outside - the Café déjà vu benefited not of it.
But there was also the stripy Natz evening.
"Beautiful, successful and funny," found the two 33-year-olds.
But not for everybody.
Perhaps Daniel Büttner is therefore not a great fan of event evenings: "It's of course not all of the time."
And with an event, I always speak only those who are also interested in the special event.
For this reason, events will be the exception rather for us.
"We want to disrupt the normal operation as little as possible."
Should read: Déjà vu also stands for reliability.
In terms of the quality of the products, which are offered here, as well as on the team and the beautiful surroundings at Opschlag in destroyed.
The street, which is more and more developed into a gastronomy mile.
To the delight of many Klever, guests from near and far, and students who discover the gastro mile and thus the Café déjà vu for themselves.
