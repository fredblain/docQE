A black box in the car?
American road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying highway system, and believe to have found the solution in a small black box, which is in the dashboard of every car.
The devices that record every mileage and report the information to the authorities, are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the planning office of the federal states to review the outdated system of financing American roads.
The normally rather boring area of the road planning has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Libertarian have allied with environmental groups and are in favour of the government use the small boxes for the recording of the mileage - and possibly, where they were driven - and the information can then be used for the calculation of modest tax.
The Tea Party is appalled.
The American Civil Rights Association (UCLA) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns.
But, while people in Congress cannot agree on a course of action, several states are no longer waiting.
They are currently examining how they can switch to a system over the next ten years, at the driver a risk-mile pay.
Thousands of motorists have already tested the tachograph, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring.
This really is a must for our country.
"There is nothing that we may only be used," said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Assn. of governments, which plans a recording of the driven miles in all California motorists in the state in 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is funded by the taxes that Americans pay at the pump, is broke.
But in America is no longer so much fuel tank as before.
Cars use less gasoline.
The state-owned petroleum tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 cents per litre) is not increased for 20 years.
Politicians dare not with high fuel prices to increase the tax by even a cent.
"The gas tax is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, an expert in traffic law at the University of Minnesota.
His state has recently 500 cars with tachographs with which a mileage-based payment system is to be tested.
"This is the most sensible alternative," he said.
Bureaucrats describe it as a mileage-based user fee.
It is no surprise that the idea will appeal to urban liberals, because the tax could, for example, to try to influence the behaviour so that congestion and climate damaging emissions be reduced.
The Californian planners rely on the system in the formulation of policies with which to achieve the ambitious goals set by the law of the state on climate change.
But the Republicans see Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also stated that he is the most viable long-term alternative.
The free marketer of the Reason Foundation are done from the idea to allow drivers to pay zur√ºckgelegter route.
"This is not a tax that disappears into a black hole," said Adrian Moore, vice-president for directives on reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former American transport ministers, in a report in 2011, had urged the Congress to move in the direction of mileage-based billing.
The US Senate approved a $90 million expensive pilot project, which includes 10,000 cars last year.
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the thrust and responded to the concerns of MPs from rural areas who represent people in everyday life often have to travel many miles on the way to work or in the city.
Several states and cities are nonetheless moving in this direction on their own.
Most committed is Oregon, which currently enlists 5,000 drivers for the biggest experiment of the country.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of the mineral oil tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is also considering such a thing.
Illinois tests it in a limited way with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), are currently investigating how one could introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where recently 50 volunteers were fitted with the devices, motorists were skeptical of the idea that the government could pursue its every move.
"Concerns about Big Brother and such things were a big problem," said Alauddin Khan, head of the strategy and product management in the Transport Ministry of Nevada.
The people did not want it.
As the trial started, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: "It would be relatively easy to transform the tachograph in mature monitoring devices."
There is no need to build a huge, bulky technological infrastructure that will inevitably would be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology, with which the state can collect the mileage, but not exactly when and where.
With that, Khan, would also be free to the public.
The pursuit of this technology has led some authorities on a small startup company called True mileage in California.
The company is not originally taken in order to help states in the taxation of car drivers.
Rather, it was their goal to gain a foothold in the emerging market for car insurance, in which drivers should pay on the basis of the driven miles.
But the devices tested by her are also interesting for the road planners, because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information, which are regularly uploaded via modem.
"People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded," said Ryan Morrison, managing director of True mileage.
Big mistake has been made in some of these public pilot programmes.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement it.
In Oregon, the planners of this experiment to give drivers a number of choices.
You can opt for a device with or without GPS.
Or they choose no equipment and pay a flat rate based on the average of all the inhabitants of the federal state driven miles instead.
Other authorities hope to be able to sell the concept of a suspicious public, as they provide the equipment with more features than with little more.
In New York City traffic officials want to develop a device on taxation, which is also pay parking fees, insurance must be paid only for driving distances and speed data can be collected from other vehicles in real time, thanks to which drivers avoid traffic jams.
"Motorists were motivated by the added value of the benefits offered by the system to take part," says a planning document of the city.
However, some traffic planners wonder whether all the talk about the pay per mile was not just a huge red herring.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission on the territory of the San Francisco Bay, officials said that Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by simply increasing the fuel tax.
An additional one-time fee or an annual levy could be imposed on motorists with hybrid cars or other vehicles that consume less gasoline, so they also pay a fair share.
"There is no reason for an operation, even if an aspirin is enough," said Randy Rentschler, the head of the Commission's legislative and public affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists care about their privacy, and many other things.
