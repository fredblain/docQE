Even if the SG Achim / Baden is for four games without victory, there is still a good atmosphere in the handball-Oberliga).
This leaves coach Tomasz Malmon no doubt at all.
All are still fully motivated for the cause.
However, I hope that we will finally win again, too.
"Because I know already no longer, as a victory tastes," expected Malmon a successful experience of his team at VfL Fredenbeck II
Although the third league-reserve from Fredenbeck currently has no trees uprooted, highlights Malmon in advance warning of the index finger.
Many players I have trained myself in the A-youth.
So they will certainly be particularly motivated against her ex-coach.
"It is to be seen whether it is still gain from the First," highlights the SG-coach.
For a long time to return to the track gauge, must increase the Malmon team compared to previous appearances in any case.
Above all, in the work of the coverage and the shift game it suffered last is huge.
Also the chances recovery must definitely be better.
Therefore, I hope that my players have received free during the short break at the head.
