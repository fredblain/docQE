Europe's elite is ready to do business with the United Kingdom?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention to bring the economy to a table and to define what those who care for prosperity and work in the United Kingdom, to want to change our relationship with the EU.
To this end, we have the largest and most comprehensive survey commissioned by British business leaders and asked them what they think about the United Kingdom, the economy and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business leaders, some of which depict the British company sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of businesses now exported outside Europe and focused on countries to modernise and grow, while the states in the EU are stagnant.
They wish that new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil are favoured by government regulators, rather than to deal with the long and exhausting process, the obscure to reform EU institutions.
Asked for their view on certain legal issues - from the antitrust law to the product legislation - the majority of business leaders is of the opinion that control of these key competences should be brought back to Westminster.
There was widespread dissatisfaction about the internal market, according to the company, because the cost of Brussels regulations now would outweigh the benefits to be part of Europe's trade zone - even 40 percent of large companies agreed to, which are traditionally the most pro-European.
Finally, and this is probably the most, showed a survey of business leaders that a clear majority of Britain wants a course in the direction of the change of the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not on politics.
This realization that finds itself in companies of all sizes and leading corporations, shows that the economy is on a "meaningful change" that brings the driver's seat of the world economy back to Britain.
It is about a lot - a change of the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to a change of view in favour of the participation in the EU in a referendum at 16 percent.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: This survey shows that the British economy is behind his plan for the renegotiation of the UK conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that the companies expect a renegotiation of a significant shift in the balance of power back to Britain.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and necessary to an increasing extent after the eurozone is now moving in the direction of a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority should be jobs and growth in Britain, as the results of our survey shows, which means an increased emphasis on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach for rules for companies.
