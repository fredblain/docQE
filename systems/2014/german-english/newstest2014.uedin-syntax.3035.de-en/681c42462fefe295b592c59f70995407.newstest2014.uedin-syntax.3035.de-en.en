Nick-bashing rank for Schiris: Joust no swallows King
So happy Ralf rank Nick so disappointed with the current high form of Bundesliga table leaders Red Bull Salzburg is also, showed the sporting director of the "bull" by the umpires.
"There is a dangerous trend at the moment that Mane and Alan will be pushed into the category of swallows kings," he took the two Offensivwirbler on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg in protection.
The recent occasion for rank nicks criticism was yellow to joust with 3-0 against Grödig last Sunday, in which the Senegalese was an alleged acting undoing - which was not, however, as the TV pictures showed.
"A gross misjudgment," said senior Nick, the referee Harkam as "completely overwhelmed."
Harkam would also "its part" contributed to the escalation between Salzburg coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig-coach Adi Hütter after the game.
He defended his German compatriot decidedly: "I would do the same in each situation as Roger Schmidt."
Schmidt wants after the skirmishes with Hütter have had no contact with his colleagues.
I do not know why.
"Because I am the one who was offended," said the 46-year-old.
In view of the successful run agreed rank Nick but a eulogy.
"There are only two words: Really well," he noted.
There is not a lot wrong with that.
In particular, the way the team plays is impressive.
This is quietly to continue.
Kaderänderungen there will be little in the winter transfer period.
There is no great reason to change something.
"Unless a player is approach with the wish that he wants to leave the club," rank Nick is clear.
