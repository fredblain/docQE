Freudenstadt: Quick action twist hosts
With a narrow cadres had the gentlemen I TSV Freudenstadt in the Schiller-school gym in Reutlingen play against the TG Gönningen of the Swabian Alb.
The Älbler stood side by side with an experienced team on the other network.
Soon showed, however, that, also due to old age, they could not compete with the quick action of city dwellers of joy.
With the hard and placed crashes did the Gönninger is extremely difficult.
Repeatedly missed it by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz clean on the network in mid-course played passports and attacks and were not in place in the block defense.
Two high first sentence profits significantly pushed the superiority of the delights of city dwellers in all aspects.

The B-class stood in the Murgtal Hall in gravies towards the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt.
They provided a competitive two-hour match.
Nervousness on both sides caused mainly by the ball adoption errors and points gifts; also in the passports was the precision sometimes scarce and in some critical game prevented scenes of over-eagerness to look for possible point gains.
A very balanced encounter in this performance, the TSV team of Marcus Blasutto agreed but all the great physical effort and a pleasing commitment of both teams.
