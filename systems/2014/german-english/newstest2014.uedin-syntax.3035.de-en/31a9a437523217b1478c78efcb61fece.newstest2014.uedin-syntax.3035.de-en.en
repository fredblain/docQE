Foreign workers on 457-visa could be subjected to "authenticity test"
The government is under additional measures on a "authenticity test" for foreign workers on 457-visa after.
The test should be introduced, would he used on a criterion that prevent the 457 to the occupation of unqualified jobs or used as a back door for the influx of family and friends to Australia.
Today was a discussion proposal released by the government, after the former member of the Labor Party, Maxine McKew, had condemned the comments of the government in terms of foreign workers, because they could be seen as an insult by Australia's neighbours.
"Loud statements like that foreigners should set back" and that Australians first set "are a very unpleasant throwback at a time when unions demanded a protected labour market," she said of the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, it said, that white workers should be protected, and if some people in the region, an echo of this historic artifact vernähmen, I would not be surprised.
The debate proposal outlines 12 measures that were once considered by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who visited Sri Lanka yesterday for talks on people smuggling, has five of the recommended changes implemented, the others are still under consideration.
If the "authenticity" criterion is accepted, then someone who applied for a visa, could be reviewed if the request is real in the cases, in which the applicant is related to the owner or a relevant person of the sponsoring company or personally connected. "
Companies could also be required to account for the number of 457-visa holders, after companies that initially only wanted to support a small number of workers in the past, finally stopped hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri-lankischer Asylant probably died from a heart attack, after he was this week with a refugee boat arrived on Christmas Island.
The verstörte nine-year-old son of the man, who came with him to Australia, will be supervised by an adult cousin on Wednesday since the death of his father, who was also on the boat.
Australian authorities brought the man in the Christmas Island hospital, where he died.
