Alexei Miller described by Gazprom pipeline in Bulgaria as the start of a new Gas√§ra
The construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria would represent the start of one of the largest European energy projects, said the Gazprom board.
"Today's event is a milestone: The construction work on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, have begun," the chairman of Gazprom, Alexei Miller, said in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element for the security of the entire European continent.
South Stream would ensure more diversity in Russia's export routes through Europe.
A contract dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, where the bulk of Russian gas for Europe is stored, sorge for an increased risk for conventional routes, and to hear from officials.
Miller said that direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries "forever" were turned off.
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream at discounted rates, when the whole project comes into operation in 2015.
According to Gazprom, the construction work in other downstream countries should start on the planned route at the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
