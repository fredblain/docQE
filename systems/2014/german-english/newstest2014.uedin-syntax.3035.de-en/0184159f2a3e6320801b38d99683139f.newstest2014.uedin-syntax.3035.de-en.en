Schools are encouraged to a greater focus on math, spelling and grammar
In courses in English literature, pupils must deal with at least one piece of Shakespeare, a novel of the 19th century, romantic poetry and contemporary British novels from 1914 in the future.
"You text" entrance to encourage broader reading also found in the audit.
The combined rate of English literature and language will be abolished.
From 2015, pupils must file a separate GCSE examination for language, and there are strong incentives for choosing English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education, tomorrow will publish the new curriculum for English and maths - the first subjects that have been radically transformed.
Other core subjects will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the exams regulator, announce a reorganization of the GCSE structures, including a new tracking system and less course work.
Education Secretary Michael Gove said in a speech in the summer, that there is a "broad consensus that we need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence," he said that GCSEs would be "challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous."
Studies show that in English schools less time is spent on mathematics - 116 hours per year, or three hours per week per school year - than in most other countries.
On the other hand, Australian schools teach received an average of 143 hours per year and students in Singapore 138 hours.
Although there will be no formal request, to provide for more time for mathematics in the curriculum, but states from coalition circles, the comprehensive math test, combined with a greater weighting of the compartment in ranking, will probably encourage schools, more hours.
The curriculum will put more emphasis on "real life problems" including financial mathematics.
