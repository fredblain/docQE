Halloween 2013: In figures
When I was little, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, late aufbleiben and disguise ourselves for the neighborhood.
Today, I am rather become a Halloween muffle.
In the last two years, I have not agreed to distribute sweets from my home, and it will probably also do not do this year.
But, according to the statistics, I am a black sheep, as regards Halloween.
The majority of Americans - 158 million, to be precise - celebrate Halloween this year and give it a total of $6.9 billion for candy, costumes and decorations, as the American Association of retailers (direction and advice on military policy and strategy).
One thing on which I am every Halloween back then, are the trend values.
The costumes are issued for roughly 1.2 billion of 6.9 billion US dollar amount, so the direction and advice on military policy and strategy.
This year are inanimate objects of the rage artist Christine Hill.
Women do not have to invest more in sexy clothes, you can now also embody tempting food like pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The walking Dead, and I bet the daft punk space men will create this year in the Instagram feeds.
According to Google, the most wanted costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I suspect that there is nothing wrong with tradition.
We have dressed our dogs last year and were not alone in order to my surprise.
Indeed, Americans are $330 million this year for costumes of their pets, so the direction and advice on military policy and strategy.
That is a lot of "Hot Dogs."
As for candy, we are not squeamish.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, according to The Nielsen Company.
There are about 270 million kilograms of chocolate bars, Lutschern, sweets and Gummi bears.
That is good news for the 41 million people, according to the US Commerce Department's draw with the slogan "sweet and sour" through the quarter.
In fact, we will buy more than 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and, let's face it, eat.
The only thing that we do not want to consume, is the sugar-sweet candy Corn; however, 15 million kilograms of them are sold for Halloween, as the National Association of the confectionery manufacturer.
That is about nine billion corn grains.
It is a mystery that I still could not solve.
Nothing is more on Halloween as houses, in which it haunting.
They have great names like "Terror Behind the Walls" (which, incidentally, is in a real prison), "Beat-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock."
There are, in fact, 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States, the $500 million proceeds reach, as America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photos on which it is precisely in the pants pinkelt and then put the friends on Facebook, where they cannot back into existence, and then the guy you will leave a comment like "nice facial expression."
But we will finally bite to the free skate.
Familiar with the Great pumpkin, Charlie Brown made us when we were children, and the carving a pumpkin Lantern is like that decorate the Christmas tree - something that we have made from childhood on.
Fortunately, the "baby in the pumpkin" -Trend only last year thanks to public transportation, rest, so most of us have grown up, the pumpkin zurechtzuschnitzen and not, to sit in it.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins, according to the US Census Bureau.
The pumpkin Lantern, which slowly rotting in the front yard, probably comes from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms this year have been harvested pumpkins.
If you really want to score points, then call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and carve something pretty from the 921 pound pumpkin.
