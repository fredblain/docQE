NSA declared that an "internal error" and not hackers were to blame on the website crash
The shadow of a National Security Agency said late Friday that a mistake had crippled its public website for a few hours and not hackers, as has been claimed online.
"NSA.gov was last night unavailable for a few hours, as is an internal error during a planned updates," explained the spy agency in a message sent via e-mail.
The problem will be fixed on this evening.
The claim that the crash had been caused by a executed distributed denial of service attack (DDOS) is not true.
In the early evening hours was online server sites noted that the NSA website was not available for at least six hours and this is still not for some users.
A spokesman for the NSA to ABC News had previously stated that the sensitive internal network of the authority was "in no way" compromised.
Secret information were not in danger, said the spokesman.
At least one study group took advantage for themselves, to have crippled the NSA website with a DDOS attack.
In such attacks will call the target site with pages flooded, until the servers are overloaded and the website collapses.
The cyber tactic is relatively simple and the attacks are not to invade the internal network of the target system.
The once super-secret NSA, whose nickname was once the Search Agency (No such authority), is now in the bright light of the public and faces sharp criticism after the revelations about her extensive surveillance program revealed in the last few months at home and abroad - a result of the secret NSA data stolen from the disaffected former NSA employee Edward Snowden and published.
The growing controversy about the secret service by initial speculation about the incident today is the result of a targeted Cyperoperation.
