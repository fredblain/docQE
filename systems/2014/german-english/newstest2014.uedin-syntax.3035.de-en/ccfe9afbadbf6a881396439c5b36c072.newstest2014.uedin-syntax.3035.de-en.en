The disposable society does not think
The night was long, the music and the mood is good, but at some point it is home.
Only: The hunger is noticeable in the bellies of the people on the passenger and back seat.
Clearly, this may be responsible for a cocktail or sparkling wine!
What is more logical than pretty chilled to drive to the next Drive-In, in order to take a bite?
I admit that I am happy with that, when it comes to fast food-fetching late at night or in the early morning.
Some Fries, a Coke and a burger - and then nix as from home and into bed.
But on the way home are the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco GÃ¤ngern felt.
For what must be a shortfall that it raises its fast-food bag from the car window with constant regularity?!
Especially at the weekends are discarded paper bags at the periphery and in parking lots.
"Why?," I wonder.
The people are too stupid to take the bags with home or until the next dustbin?
It is not the only way that the paper stuff disfigured the landscape.
Bags have also been hidden transport facilities such as guard rails and caused by accidents.
Think about something said "disposable society" but not after, presumably, they even know what the word actually means.
If you travel more often in the evening, especially with several people in the car, you know, like a back seat after by celebrated nights can be: Clothes, bottles and other garbage towers are there.
There were a few bags, more or less, but also represent nothing - in contrast to the street, where no one wants other rumtrampeln remains on the food.
I can already see the day is coming when the cities and communities to invest the removal - and the fast-food chain must demand a deposit for their bags.
