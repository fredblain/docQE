Tripodi disputes to be influenced by Obeid
The Labor Party against the former minister Joe Tripodi from New South Wales will be launched an investigation by the state corruption in sight.
The former NSW minister denies, to have changed the rules to the maritime lease at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, the covert interests in three plots on state-controlled land owned.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC Â­ Independent Commission against Corruption) has extended its investigations on the issue on Friday, whether Obeid influenced several government ministers to the effect that leases at circular Quay, where the Obeids two restaurants and a cafe run to extend any tender after their expiration in August 2005.
Now will be determined because of the accusation, Tripodi have known of Obeids covert interest in the land after Tripodis former deputy team leader had testified Lynne Ashpole on Thursday accordingly.
In years of talks, which began in 2005, the government had pushed for public tenders for the leases.
The tenant were against it and also wanted longer maturities.
In 2009, the leases were extended at circular Quay, which gave the Obeids $2.5 million per year, without a public tender for the company.
Tripodi, who was from February 2006 until November 2009 ports minister, had originally called for public tenders.
But he denied to have made the changes at the request of Obeid, which Tripodi confirmed that had pushed for a review of the lease arrangements of the government.
One of the ICAC's telephone transcript showed talks between Obeid and Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official from the August and September 2007, the Ministry of the port was changed, after he had been working in the fisheries authority under Obeid.
"It was in these telephone conversations debating the drafting of the commercial lease arrangements?," asked the deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
"No," Tripodi said.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it was definitely not.
Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid.
