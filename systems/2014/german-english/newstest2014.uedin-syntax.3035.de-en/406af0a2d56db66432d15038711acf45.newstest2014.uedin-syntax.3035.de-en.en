Iran satisfied with the process of nuclear negotiations
Iran shows a week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN veto powers and Germany satisfied with the negotiation process.
"For years we now have an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency, in order to eliminate the differences of the past years," Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Sarif wrote on his Facebook page.
It would still be a long way, but the nuclear chief negotiator is satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that in the end both sides come to a solution.
