In the importance for the city and the football club, the official inauguration ceremony for the artificial turf sport despite the cold weather and the rain took nothing.
A more pleasant ceremony last Saturday had probably all wanted, but Peter did not play it.
It had all those at a disadvantage, which came with no umbrella or such a could not hold for any reason.
This was the musicians who framed the ceremony, as well as so many speakers.
Wet, therefore, the combination of FC chairman Albrecht spoke of the fulfilment of a dream.
His gratitude was led by Mayor Walter Klumpp, which is strongly committed to the implementation of the project, the local council, the companies involved, and members of an association that is presented.
Here, in particular, Lothar hero, Paul wheat Egger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The sprightly pensioner relocated 400 square tiles for the new ways.
This remarkable voluntary commitment also praised the provincial representative Karl Rombach.

Mayor Klumpp brought in memory that recurring weather-related influences the original grass pitch afflicted so that he could not be played in spring and autumn.
15 years ago, there was the first ideas to solve the problem, as was thought to the construction of a third place in the area of the football club or in the secondary school on the Salinensee.
Both was rejected again.
Six years ago, thoughts on the creation of an artificial turf sport Square came on what was widely regarded as the ultimate solution.
Concrete plans were included two years ago, when the FC took over the Chronicle Schabelstube, pledged a cost of EUR 100 000 for the construction of the place and the country approved funding of EUR 104 000.
The council decided in October 2012 the acquisition of the remaining EUR 356 million of the total cost of EUR 560 000, summarised Klumpp together.
The start of the 68 times 108 metre artificial turf pitch was made on June 4.
During the construction phase lasted about three months, 3,000 cubic metres of earth were discharged, half of which was used for the creation of a dirt-bike route.
