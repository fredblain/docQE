Scientists were able to throw more light on it, is the context in which the tail wag the dog with his mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs with the tail stretched more to the right (from the point of view of the dog), while it was the left-hand side with nervous dogs.
But now, scientists say that other dogs can perceive these subtle differences and respond to it.
Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, neuroscientists at the University of Trento, said: "When people are well aware that the left and right brain hemisphere respond differently to other sources that produce positive or negative emotions."
Here we have tried to look at this in other species.
He also noted that the right brain hemisphere in dogs as in humans was responsible for the movement of the left and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings.
To learn more about it, as dogs respond to the lateral tail wag of their own kind, monitored the researchers viewed the animals, while these films from other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the dog and analyzed the behavior.
Probably we will soon understand why the tail is moving in one direction, even in the other
Professor Vallortigara said: "We have shown the dogs films with dogs - either a lifelike version or a Silhouette, in order to eliminate ablenkende other aspects, and we were able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or right."
If the animals were, like the other expression of a dog's tail has moved to the right (seen from the perspective of the Wedel-dog), they were completely relaxed.
But was mainly the tail tilt to the left (again from the perspective of the dog wag), as increased their heart rate and they looked restless.
In the opinion of Professor Vallortigara the dogs do not deliberately communicate with each other through these movements.
He is convinced that the dogs would have learned from experience, in which movements they should worry about, and when they are not.
He said: "If you have different encounters with other dogs and a swish with the cock in one direction rather is associated with friendly behavior and the right side rather produces a less friendly behavior, then responded to on the basis of this experience."
The researchers say that the findings could provide a better understanding of the emotions of their animal for dog owners, veterinarians and trainers.
John Bradshaw, an expert on dog behavior and visiting Fellow at the Faculty of veterinary medicine at the University of Bristol has said that this is not the first study, which has been investigated, whether on the left and the right is important for dogs.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found out that dogs turn your head to the left, if they see an aggressive dog, and on the right, if we are talking about a happy dog.
In another research at the University of Victoria in Canada was the following: "Dogs go on a robot dog when the tail wag" on the left, not the right, rather than to be restless, rather than the other way around in the Italian study. "
According to his statement could stir the differences so that the dogs in the various studies of the animals in the movies or the robot dogs are not interpreted as a dog.
A study how dogs respond to real dogs could help, he said.
"Although there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that both halves of the brain are used for different purposes, but many of the details still need to be determined - and dogs are no exception," said Brad Shaw.
Since their behavior record but simply put, it will probably not last a long time, until we understand why the tail sometimes moved in one direction, sometimes in the other.
