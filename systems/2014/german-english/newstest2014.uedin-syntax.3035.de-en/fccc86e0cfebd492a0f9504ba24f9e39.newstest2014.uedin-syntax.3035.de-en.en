The cost of electricity in Pfullendorf
The citizens Pfullendorfs must adjust to higher electricity costs.
As the Managing Director of the municipal works, Jörg-Arne bias, opposite SUEDKURIER confirmed, come on a four-member Pfullendorfer family to 70 to 90 euros extra costs per year.
The main reason for the forthcoming price increase is the rise of the so-called EEG 5,277 levy on 6.3 cents per kilowatt-hour.
This levy will be re-established in October from the four operators of the great power lines each year.
This put the extra costs incurred of turning them out of the energy that can make it through a levy on the price of electricity.
The Stadtwerke Pfullendorf form the last link in the chain.
In its forecasts, the Supervisory Board of the energy company was even reported a higher levy assumed, like Jörg-Arne bias.
Now the concrete figures should be calculated before next week, the Stadtwerke could inform their customers about the exact price increase.
"We go from an increase of 1 cent plus x," bias, and the number will be in the vicinity of 2 cents more.
