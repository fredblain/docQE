Frontier Airlines collects fees for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to ask for up to 100 dollars of passengers who want to store on their flight hand luggage.
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $100 for a piece of hand luggage and $2 for coffee or lemonade, even if to read in the announcement on Wednesday was that passengers are likely to keep the whole box.
The new fee applies to hand luggage in the overhead baggage compartment on the seat, small bags under the seat remain free.
Frontier said that you calculate 25 US dollars, if the fee will be paid in advance, and $100 for passengers who paid only at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said that the fee of $100 is geared towards that, to move travelers to care in the run-up to the payment.
"We do not want this sum charge," she said.
Airlines began to demand that, for the first and second checked baggage fees in 2008.
Passengers who have tried to circumvent them so plugged into the hand luggage as much as possible, with the result that the baggage compartments on the seat are often overcrowded.
Fees are a way to persuade passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said that with the new fee, it was not really trying to make money.
They go to the most loyal customers of Frontier, which would have clearly expressed that it will be increasingly difficult to find space in the specialist on the seat.
Passengers who buy your tickets on the website of the airline, do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger at the gate of Frontier, under certain circumstances, can take a piece of luggage for free, but the next person must pay $100 for a similar baggage.
O'Malley said, the website of frontier and the check-in procedures would be changed so that the passengers were informed about the fee before they came to the gate.
The new hand baggage fee of frontier enters into force only in the summer, an exact date is not yet there.
Passengers often grumble about baggage surcharges and other fees, but airlines like to take it back.
They argue that the transportation of the baggage cost money and passengers should pay the service if they wanted him.
Many on Wall Street consider the new baggage fees as a sign that the airlines have enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Most have so far, however, the finger of charges for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded three years before the first charges for hand luggage and later followed all Giant Air, also a low-cost airlines.
The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian WIZZ Air, said the airline consultant Jay Sorensen, closely followed by the additional fees.
He estimated in a report in December 2011 that the hand baggage fee equals Spirit of US $50 million a year.
Sorensen, who previously held a leadership position in Midwest Airlines, has recently flown with Spirit and was curious to know what he would expect at the gate if passengers were faced with the company's unusual hand baggage fee.
"The boarding process was one of the most fluid, which I have seen in my career in aviation," he said.
I expected to see gnashing and vehement discussions at the gate.
"The plane was full," he said, "and the boarding ran as lubricated."
Frontier spirit will also be asked for $2 for coffee, tea, soda or juice.
The company said that passengers who bought juice or lemonade are likely to keep the whole can and will be filled with coffee for free.
Water is still free of charge.
Us Airways had tried for a short time in 2008 to demand money for soft drinks, had made it back seven months later, after passengers complained and was pulled after no other major company.
Frontiers step to collect fees for the hand baggage, if passengers do not buy directly from the airline, is the latest initiative, with the customer should be drawn to the website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies like Orbitz $10 to 25 / sold ticket.
That all societies provides an incentive to move passengers to buy directly from them rather than an online travel agency.
Frontier has gone furthest in this area, however.
In September, the company began to book through an online travel agency only half as many frequent flyer miles to forgive.
On Wednesday, the miles were reduced to 25 percent of the route again.
A flight booked with a third party about 1,000 miles with Frontier brings customers therefore only 250 miles.
Passengers can also reserve exclusively at the direct purchase on the website of Frontier places.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in Denver, but the business is shrinking and the company is losing money.
The proceeds went back to 9 percent and the flight capacity shrank nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, as can be read in the financial report, which was published by the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc., on Wednesday.
Republic has tried to get a grip on the finances of frontier as part of the sale of the company.
