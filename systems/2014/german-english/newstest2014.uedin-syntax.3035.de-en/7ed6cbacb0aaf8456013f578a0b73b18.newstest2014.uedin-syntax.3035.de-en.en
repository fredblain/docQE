The hoarding painted on the Bechtle-plot
A group of the citizens' initiative "Swiss meadow" the hoarding on the Bechtle plot at the spa promenade in bath has embellished their congresses and seminars.
Also looted and they broadened the footpath, says in a press release.
The planned covering of the crumbling house at the rear of the property was not allowed for security reasons, because the terrain is the decline of civilization.
Alfred Abel, who manages the property at the moment, the beautification campaign had agreed with his colleague Reinhard Domke of the bi.
Before the action of the bi was a banner with the message "We have been making" appropriate.
The wailing about 20 members of the citizens' initiative, however, little in their action.
Their motto on the big poster saying "We are against Bauruinen."
So they wanted to draw attention to the danger of even greater ruins on the Swiss meadow - one day the giant project should fail.
In conversation with many passers-by in front of the "building site" became clear that some people believe that it will be better off with the implementation of the project of the city many, although not a few have the same questions of the dimension of the proposed project as the bi.
But they are beginning to resign, because the city these answers is postponed, it means from the bi.
As they say, are also the public statements of the mayor.
May had in the parish council meeting said that he fears the end for the thermal baths, the population in public decision should vote against the plans for a spa and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow.
Some appear so downright scared, others see it as a "crude blackmail" of the population, according to the press release of the bi.
The bi thanked the donors for the color and all volunteers.
