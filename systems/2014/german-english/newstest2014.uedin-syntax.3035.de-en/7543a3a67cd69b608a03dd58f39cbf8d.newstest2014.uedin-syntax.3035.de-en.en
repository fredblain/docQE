Until now, the police inspection agencies can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
The officials have been called twice only to children throwing eggs, which threw them against building facades.
As the house owner recognized this in time and the egg remains equally remote, should also be no material damage.
Furthermore, some Sylvesterb√∂ller were ignited in the city as well, but there is no material damage.
A resident in the Bishop-Freundorfer way reported that his car wrapped with toilet paper and his Radzierblenden were stolen.
Until the arrival of the police, the man his Radzierblenden, however, in the immediate vicinity all recovered, and the police had no further action.
