An Obama voter cry of despair
I have twice elected President Obama in the hope that change is possible
He says that Obama has commendable efforts had been thwarted by the Republican blocking tactics
The blockade policy does not excuse the website problems of Obamacare, the drone attacks
Obama's memoir about the 2008 campaign are a sad reminder of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student in the second year at Harvard Medical School.
I read a terribly sad book at the moment.
It is a book, of which I have believed that it would spot me during the sad second year of my medical degree and give me hope again.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" (courage to win) and describes the memoirs of Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election.
If I am ready for dinner with my patient transcripts and go to bed, it brings me back to the book at a time when the policy inspired millions and the speeches were able to take your breath away.
The election was held to a landslide victory and news spokesman to lead the historical significance of this hour before your eyes.
My classmates wept with joy and my parents collected all the newspapers, they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on the way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
As Obama into office in 2008 at that time, he had approval values of 82%.
And then I close the book.
Switch back to the present is a rude awakening, as if one is ripped from a dream.
It is difficult to recall these optimistic times - they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I have given my voice for the first time, something has changed.
But there is simply nothing that I could have imagined.
I recognise the great and versatile things that Obama has achieved, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act for health insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of forced) of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I also believe that the partisan blockade tactics have dumped on many efforts, with which our nation should be brought forward: Immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closing of Guantanamo Bay, just to name a few.
But after countless times defended the Obama administration against colleagues and friends, I am with my statement attempt at the end.
I have reached a point of political desperation.
The Republican blockade policy cannot explain why it allows for the interception of foreign leaders or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data about the private lives of Americans and why whistleblower punished, to disclose government misconduct.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, was killed without trial, nor why the public financing and spending limits be circumvented during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report, which states that the efforts of the White House to restrain the media are the "most aggressive... since the Nixon administration."
And j√ºngstens cannot excuse the inability to create a simple Web site in more than three years since the passage of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if that is what I would have expected.
Whether I with 18 should have understood that the government could run counter to its previous political campaigns.
Apparently the Abgeordnetenamt is not a predictable course, as an opposition party and random events like the Newtown massacre shape the public debate.
But when I look at the above examples, they seem to be largely elected by the government itself.
And that bothers me the most.
I have re-elected Obama in 2012, not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and half-baked alternative, he seemed unable to determine its direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would comply with the hope that we had heard for so long.
But with the sinking of the approval ratings for Obama to below 45% this week has become the return in 2008 by this book so much harder.
It awakens in me the desire for the many promises that have vanished into thin air.
This week I read a section in the book, which describes how Obama had to plug a heavy loss against Clinton in the primaries in Pennsylvania.
In a meeting with the electoral agents after the decision, he told his staff that they must come back on track and follow the purpose of their cause.
"I would like us to find the magic," he said.
We must remind us who we are.
Five years later, Mr. President, and I could not agree more.
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nathaniel Morris.
