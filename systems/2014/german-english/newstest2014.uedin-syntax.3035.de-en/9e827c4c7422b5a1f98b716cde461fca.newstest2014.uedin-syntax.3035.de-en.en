The vegan, according to dictionaries under the vegetarianism, differs from this, but in a very significant way.
Because while vegetarians will allow the consumption of cream cake, ice cream or a strong Edam, these gourmet shops are not on the menu of a Veganers.
In addition to the renunciation of meat and fish, milk, cheese, egg, leaves the vegan from all consumption of animal products - including honey is denied.
What remains, you may ask, but on closer inspection, the vegan diet is world through a considerable ingenuity.
"Sandwich spreads are very popular," said Ute Henkel Mann, the owner of the local reform house, which provides a variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor, too, will be happy to visit the store in the Domgasse.
For 13 years, the native New Zealanders vegan, in water, he is (almost) everything, what he needs to life. "In 1997, I was in my diet and became a vegetarian."
Around the turn of the century, then the next step and I became a vegan.
"The conviction, but not only because of the food, but because of the shoe choice," says Proctor, who prefers artificial leather normal leather.
He realized that this is also in other everyday concerns without animal products.
First and foremost is vegan be an ethics.
"I do not want animals have to die for me," says Proctor, the maxim of vegans, which extends to the entire consumer behaviour.
Instead of burgers, dated or rubber bear behind to grieve, have increased the vegan quickly discovered in new products, the enthusiasm.
"It is a double bonus," says Proctor today, "in fact, vegan be no surrender, no asceticism, but it is an asset." The assumption that it leads with the diet of the selection of dining options externalities, Proctor rather on the power of habit.
And this very conditioning also left some well-intentioned attempts fail.
"The addiction is a crucial factor that makes many give up quickly, as with smoking," Proctor is a comparison.
And if a "certain tastes are not the animal."
Often it is the spices or the kind of preparation, which make up the taste.
"You can also create the same effect in other ways," shows the vegan.
At a Barbecue festival brings Proctor, for example, eggplant, mushrooms and a few vegan sausages with.
He is committed to a balanced and varied diet, in which it is supposed to taste even proper.
Of course, we would like to have something between the teeth, which is legitimate.
"It should taste, but that is not only to reduce animal food," said Proctor.
Health damage to eating disorders, another widespread adoption, he had not suffered.
For me, the conversion had a positive side.
I am not a foreign cholesterol and have an increased share of vitamins.
There are high-performance athletes who are exclusively vegan diet.
"My blood values are well, I am often check," Proctor reveals.
In particular, many Vegansimus critics warn against the lack of vitamin B12.
"As animals are fed with animal feed, rather than on the pasture to graze, it is questionable whether the vitamin B12 share in the flesh, which buys it in the freezer, is high," Proctor will take place.
There is also the possibility that nicotine in the form of pills to take him for a vegan.
"My B12-values are in order," he says.
Long distances to Proctor does not go to the food supply.
Basic foodstuffs are finally everywhere and every supermarket now has soya milk and other products.
I think everything that I need on the ground.
I only buy something special from time to time.
"A lot of people overlook the fact that it is only the finished products are expensive, but it is also known for" ordinary "finished products."
In any case, is the preparation veganer courts far cheaper and less time-consuming than is commonly believed.
"There is a lot to discover in the kitchen of the house, with a few small tips can be good, if not better results in part," Proctor said.
Margarine instead of butter, a bit more baking powder and carbon dioxide instead of egg, with its vegan cheesecake Proctor could also bring his in-laws in wonder.
Family firm adds a new spice of the vegan.
The dynamic is that if you cook together, it has a new significance.
"The situations that can arise in this are as diverse as the people themselves," Proctor said.
Of course he was also shown already skepticism.
No longer tastes you my food?
"Should I now feel bad, because I drink milk?" - on such issues, we must act as a vegan tact.
"I do not reject the people, I am part of this society," like Proctor no enclaves being confined.
Strikes and looked at the everyday world then not so vegan foreign as suspects - and the vegan not as restricted as commonly believed in everyday life.
Fast food is also allowed.
Fries are everywhere!
"Many Döner shops offer falafel at, or just a vegetarian Yufka," Proctor said.
He is in a pizzeria on pasta dishes, or order a pizza without cheese, everything is a matter of habit.
The restaurants are so slowly to be prepared for it.
"When I started 13 years ago to feed my vegan, everything was much more difficult," the New Zealanders can find a development: "Talk to people, they warn."
"If sufficient demand, they are perhaps inclined to complement the menu," he hopes.
Vegane restaurants develop, such as the galley in Mannheim or café bird-free.
Proctor has the desire that other restaurants also have at least one veganes court are on the menu.
In fact, vegan dishes are there for everyone.
Anyone can eat them, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive.
"Meat dishes are against this exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, because they are different from," Proctor said.
"If you want to avoid food scandals, then veganism is a safe way to make the greatest part from the outset impossible," Proctor said.
But the shopping veganer products could be rather difficult at the beginning.
Especially if you can learn to understand that's also contain animal additives in peanuts as a color donor, seems to leave you with the courage of the ethics compliance with so many hurdles and traps.
Not only have Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen wrote a book: "Veganissimo - animal ingredients and their alternatives," explains the many ingredients that are buried food and cleaning products.
"Gradually developed a scanner views and white, in which characters and logos to respect you," It is sometimes better small steps to do than stop or stumble, "Proctor knows.
The veganism, he is an important moral finger show that proposes on awareness.
Perhaps he creates it not quite that one rediscovers his habits, but at least he can teach consumers to question his habits critical.
