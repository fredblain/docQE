Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott have conflict with parental leave
The billionaire and MP Clive Palmer says that Prime Minister Tony Abbott was in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave, because his daughters become pregnant and therefore could benefit from it.
The mining magnate, which is located in a legal dispute over the payment of $6 million in carbon tax, made the claim when he wanted to wipe the issues on the table, whether he is in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important for the decision, whether the carbon and mining taxes will be eliminated or reduced.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers may have conflicts of interest and the daughters of Abbott personally would benefit from the laws.
"He is in a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because if one of his daughters is pregnant, he has a direct interest, whether or not they receive holiday," Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the electoral commission Palmer with 53 votes ahead after the recount officially to the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax.
Palmer called for a review of the process of counting for this to go faster.
Tony third daughters Frances and Bridget.
These elections should be decided two months after the end of the vote?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why should we have no system, in which one in marches, enters the data into a computer, immediately selects and then at 6: 30 p.m. the result?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark the ballot.
To use it, because then you can wipe the results, if they do not like?
Today to vote with pencils is incredible.
The Electoral Commission has examined the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, said that an international airport for the Sunshine Coast belong to his policy and that he will take his new post "very serious".
In a public office go to the service to the public.
"We strive for no reward except the history, namely, that we can serve in a critical period of this community," he said.
