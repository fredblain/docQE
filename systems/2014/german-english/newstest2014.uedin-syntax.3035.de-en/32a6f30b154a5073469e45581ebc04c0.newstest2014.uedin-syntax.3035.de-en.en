The Union and the SPD have continued their coalition negotiations with the issues of justice and home affairs.
For this purpose, the competent working group came together in the morning in Berlin.
Among other things, it is about direct democracy, Members of corruption and the federal police.
In the morning, the working group of migration and integration also wanted to continue their deliberations.
At the same time it will go by, among other things, the issue of dual citizenship, in which both sides have conflicting ideas.
The SPD would end the compulsion for immigrant children born in Germany to opt for one - the Union rejects a double pass.

It threatened alternative traffic on the roads were already black spots.
The introduction of a toll for all cars would be out of sight Pronolds also only a first step.
"There is a danger that the compensation for Germans will be removed at a later date," he said.
