The more than 100-year-old stone wall as a front demarcation of the church before the renovation of the old school farm road will once again be put on the cleanup costs the city Bräunlingen plan.
In the days before the Kilbig was a small angle in the first work of the redevelopment of the front school courtyard wall, to stabilize and static discharge of over a hundred years old stone wall built with balustrade.
The further procedure stipulates that include Alexander Misok from Bräunlinger Stadtbauamt built in the plans and to create a recovery plan for the old wall.
Then a cost assessment will be made by professionals, then the council's decision and determining the best way forward is to be put on the table.
A decision is expected to fall back in the coming year.
After the renovation, paving and tree planting of the old school courtyard within the two wings of the school built in 1912 must be rehabilitated in the foreseeable future as a follow-up to the insalubrious boundary wall from scratch and put on new foundations.
The historic, one hundred years old boundary wall of the old school station on Church Street, is particularly in need through water and frost damage, because there is no drainage, renovation and has a signature tilt forward.
Deep cracks in individual stones are evidence of weather damage, but the wall is not currently at risk of collapse.
A state safe wall is a prerequisite for a school students use, which is carried by the current fortification work.
Originally the school playground rehabilitation even planned in 2008 / 2009, but high unplanned expenditure brought a shift.

The students of the Bräunlinger elementary school, which are now being taught in a well refurbished old school buildings with new auditorium will soon be able to use the old school playground.
