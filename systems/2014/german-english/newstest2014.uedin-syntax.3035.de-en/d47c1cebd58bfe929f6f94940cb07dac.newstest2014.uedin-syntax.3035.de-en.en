Snowden ready to "cooperate" with Germany in terms of US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower of the American secret service, has said he is prepared to travel to Berlin and in the German Bundestag to say if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander be no answers on their activities.
The German MEP Hans-Christian Stroebele met Snowden in Russia, where it has received asylum on Thursday to discuss with him the statement in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden, which was presented on Friday by the media in Berlin Stroebele, writes this: "Even if the result of my endeavours was demonstrably positive, treated my government continue to break a dissenting opinion as loyalty and tried to criminalize political expression with criminal threat in defence is not possible."
To tell the truth, however, is not a crime.
Snowden writes in the letter, he was convinced that the support of the international community could convince the American government to drop the charges against him.
The collected by the US Department of Justice indictment includes espionage and theft of state property.
The German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said over time online: "If Mr Snowden is prepared to talk with German representatives, we will find ways to allow that."
Relations between the United States and Germany are burdened by the allegations that the NSA had bugged the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the MEP, who heads the parliamentary committee responsible for the secret services, said that we should take the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness, if that is possible, "without prejudice to him and completely ruining relations with the US."
Stroebele, a member of the Greens, posted a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
Stroebele said that, according to the lawyer of former NSA employee Snowden could not return to Russia, if he leave the country.
If Snowden said in Germany, then he needs an assurance that he was "sure" that the Member.
Snowden said in his letter that he would face a "serious and ongoing" persecution campaign that have driven him from his home country.
However, he is touched by the worldwide response to "my act of political expression."
People around the world, as well as senior politicians, including in the United States, have described the revelations about an uncontrolled comprehensive monitoring system as a credit to the general public.
In his letter, Snowden makes an offer of cooperation, "if the problems have been resolved around the humanitarian situation" of the German authorities.
