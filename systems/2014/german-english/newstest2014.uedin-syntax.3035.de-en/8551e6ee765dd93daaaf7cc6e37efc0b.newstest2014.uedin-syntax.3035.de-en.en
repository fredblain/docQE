Early puberty: Grow up faster
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach the puberty rather than their white age in custody, as studies show.
Physical changes mean not yet directly the puberty
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that the epidemic of obesity is a trigger of early puberty
The trend of early puberty is less pronounced in boys
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family issues.
A mother should be worried if her daughter grow already at the age of seven or eight years of breasts and pubic hair?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics paediatricians Association in Orlando, Florida, this week, the pediatric Endokrinologe Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and constituted a new standard.
"I spend a lot of time in order to reassure parents - normally this is no sign that the quick puberty occurs," Kaplowitz said.
Obvious ads of the development, such as growing breasts, Scham- and Achselhaare and body odor, show earlier in girls.
However, there was only a slight shift in the age of the Menarche (appearance of the first menstrual period) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age at 12.5 years, something less than a visual arts in 1970.
"If the development of breasts begins, it takes at least two to three years to the Menarche yet," said Kaplowitz, author of the book "Early puberty in girls: The essential guide for dealing with this problem that often occurs too."
Time is the most accurate test, as puberty progresses.
It is controversial, which is actually the onset of puberty, but it is "early ripe," if the breast surgery is accompanied by a growth spurt at the age of eight years.
In the majority of cases is slowing down the process or stagnating - something that can closely monitor a pediatrician.
Faster progress could be tests indicated by a Endikronologen so serious problems such as tumors and cysts can be ruled out.
There are treatments to delay an early menstruation and the defense of another consequence: The premature ageing of the bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and small stature in adults.
The recommendations for a medical or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the speed of development, the growth rate and the emotional maturity.
Psycho-social aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious about drugs, but he admits: "The suppression of puberty can mitigate behavioral problems and the feelings of girls, unlike their age to be in custody."
The other major problem is understandable: Parents don't want their very young daughters have the period.
"They are concerned because of the risk of pregnancy or about how they handle the hygienic side," Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter has received their days with ten.
Even if there were the first signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was emotionally unprepared.
She was scared and excited home from school, because it was the first in her group of friends.
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty.
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other food, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media were the cause.
Young are similar to girls in puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz is of the opinion that the most compelling premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported the implementation of a study on girls in 2001 at the age of six to nine years, producing a connection between body fat and the entry into puberty.
Other studies support that conclusion, but there are many other factors played a role.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to be the puberty rather than their white age in custody.
There are various explanations for this.
Globally, an early puberty seems to be influenced by all sorts of things, from economic conditions on the climate to the genes.
Another mystery: Although the boy's face and pubic hair grows earlier, the trend towards a full earlier puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference underscored the complexity of the issue.
The emergence of acne and pubic hair is widespread even among babies and young children.
"We have to be careful how we identify the true beginning of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric Endokrinologe at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to be advised by her doctor, as they should talk with their child.
"This may mean that you have to lead a conversation earlier than expected," advised Kaplowitz.
If you remain quiet, the child responds normally good.
Girls, the early bloom, need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it is sooner than thought.
