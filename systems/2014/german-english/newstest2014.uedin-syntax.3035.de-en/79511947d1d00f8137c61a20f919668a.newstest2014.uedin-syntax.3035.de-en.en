Ben Greenman: Ten years New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
You could say that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: Nearly a hundred years ago, began to be that of Jaque artist Frank Fay, who worked as it in the Palace Theatre on Broadway, the crowd directly to tell jokes in the form of a conversation.
Pretty innovation has been developed over the years, as least at the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and directed by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of Caroline's stand-up institution, the festival this year celebrates its tenth anniversary with over sixty shows in small clubs and theaters.
"The majority of these headliners began at Caroline's on and then were always more successful, until they were known for some time to act in a club," Hirsch said.
We have designed this festival, so that we can continue to work with them.
At this year's event, there are appearances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as from "Stand Up for Heroes," an annual music and comedy fundraising event for army veterans in Madison Square Garden, in which, among other things, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby may occur.
The festival has grown as the world of comedy.
A number of comedians, which this year take part in the festival, have become known about rather unconventional ways, such as shipments on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and spike.
Nick Kroll was known in the cable TV with a sitcom (the ironic-schl√ºpfrige fantasy-football-series "The League" on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was both "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and recreation" part of the occupation, even though they best known for their viral video series "Marcel the Shell With Shoes On."
Both Kroll and slate and other young comedians with distinctive voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, focused on racial issues W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
The largest visitor attraction of the festival include an interview: David Steinberg speaks with Larry David.
Steinberg started as a stand-up comedian, but has developed into a respected television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a television program with the title "sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" on TV Land.
The meeting will take place in the Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry entire work," Steinberg said.
He told me that if he is here, he would sometimes pass through the lane between two buildings and thinking: Hey, if I lose all my money, then perhaps I live here.
