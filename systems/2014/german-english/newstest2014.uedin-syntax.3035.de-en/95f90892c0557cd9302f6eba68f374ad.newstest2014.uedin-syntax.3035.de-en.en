Gechingen: No absolute protection possible
"We want to involve the people at an early stage in the planning," Mayor Jens Häußler opened to the public information event for flood protection Gechingen concept.
About 80 participants were in the town hall had to explain the planned measures for you to ask questions to express concerns and ideas.
Häußler was clear: "The ultimate decisions by the members of the parish council."
The flooding that Gechingen on May 15, 2009, unprepared, had been a crucial event, which raised the question of protective measures for the future, so Häußler.
A basin study was commissioned with the neighbouring village S1, which is now the basis for the flood protection Gechingen concept.
"As the protection of cultivated land is the goal," so Häußler.
The basis is the planning of protection against a flood expected according to the German weather service in every 100 years of statistics.
Climate change will be met by a 15-percent surcharge.
In expert circles, this with "HQ 100a climate."
The mass of water that 2009 had led to considerable damage in Gechingen matched a 1,000-year flood.
"It is not an absolute protection, but a relative improvement we can achieve," so Häußler.
In order to achieve the protection HQ 100a climate, must be invested in Gechingen around four million euros, and the community can expect country to shots to the tune of around 70 percent.
Häußler but pointed out that it will only give the promotion if a master plan implemented.
This is dependent on the participation of the citizens of the municipality.
An elaborate planning and approval procedures should be is completed.
In the best case, 2016 could be started with the implementation.
Among other things, provides for the protection concept that has already been presented in the past week in the local council (we) reported local measures in the flow of the river Irm from the Stammheimer valley.
At the end of the presentation of the concept of flood protection, the participants used the opportunity to introduce their concerns.
Among other things, questioned why not more dams and reservoirs are planned for the protection of the place.
Gregor Kühn, designer of the forest and Corbe commissioned engineering firms from hillside home, who presented the concept, stressed that it needs the cooperation of all introduced measures in order to achieve the desired objective in the sum.
Moreover, it is required to find the most economical solution, as Joachim forest of forest and Corbe.
Dissatisfaction reigned for operators of Altorts that even in normal thunderstorm rain continues to suffer from an overload of the canal network.
The problem is known in the administration and first measures have already been taken.
Häußler pointed out, however, that the guidelines for sewer systems are different, as for the flood protection and this should not be mixed.
The community is obliged to interpret the canal network so that two to three-year rain events could cope with.
The sewers have larger dimensions, would waste millions.
