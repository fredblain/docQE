Mick Jagger said that he had never dressed Katy Perry, when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week said the pop star, she worked as a backing vocalist at Jaggers song "Old Habits Die Hard" from 2004.
Perry said that she had dinner with the Altro Slater, and that "he has me wag, when I was 18."
She added: "This is a long time ago and he was very nice to me."
In a statement, a representative Jaggers, 70, said on Thursday that he "categorically denies that he ever overtures have taken on Katy Perry."
The representative added: "Perhaps it has confused with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers, who had a guest appearance at the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album "prism" landed at the first attempt at number 1 this week.
