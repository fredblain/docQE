George Kerevan: European unbundling gives the Scots the election
A new day, a new horror story for independence.
This time we will be warned that an independent Scotland is necessary to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the key word for stories about passport controls in Berwick and along a secured with barbed wire border of Hadrian's Wall.
In fact, in the Strathclyde template pointed to the potential economic benefits that would bring more travel in the rest of Europe, but this - as expected - played no role in the headlines.
No one has also mentioned that the EU member states often bent to its strict rules when it is convenient for them.
Since Scotland currently does not belong to the Schengen area, the continued disregard for Brussels would be only a small concession in exchange for what it really wants from the Scots.
That is not really a story.
And one that already has been the case in the years that they already have a fossil resembles: The first time I have heard the "independence means passport controls" -Ente at least 40 years ago.
This is an interesting point lost in the constant refrain of this ancient history.
Why should we expect of an independent Scotland, that dances to the tune of Europe?
Why the London yoke against the trade of Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: The large, taken after the war plan to the unification of Europe is faltering.
With the euro crisis, the European project is officially dead.
Parties win anywhere in the EU are hostile in soil, the EU or want to jettison the euro as a common currency.
Even in Germany, the euro-sceptic party Alternative for Germany - founded until this year - nearly five million votes in the federal election in September for themselves get and thus effectively distribute the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There have always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis turns out as a turning point.
Because of the strict austerity in connection with the straitjacket imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, in which the national economy is forced by the adherence to the common currency, many people are of the opinion that the European project had gone too far.
The crisis of the euro has little to do with the fact that national governments cause excessive budget deficits - that was only the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has nailed its members on exchange rates, which are good for German exporters - and that German politicians would like to leave it that way.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the local currency, southern Europe is again with a built-in productivity disadvantage against Germany.
The only way is to cut wages and public spending - spurred by Berlin.
Behind the current Etat- and currency problems lies a deeper European productivity problem.
As a result of the "green" energy policies imposed by Brussels - a code for the subsidy of French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers - pays the European industry compared with the United States twice for electricity and four times for gas.
This is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we have seen already in Grange mouth.
The European petrochemical industry does not protect all wage-writing courses in the world before, from cheap US shale gas to be pushed into a corner.
As a result, a revolt up, especially in France, the EU's former cheerleader.
After the war saw the French political elite could lift the EU as a vehicle with which to keep Germany in check and Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to the political legitimacy and Europe has imposed its own economic policy, by which the ailing French economy is struggling.
The result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, EU-hostile National Front has just won a decisive choice and referred to the ruling Socialists at number three.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote - a timely warning for the British Labour Party that they cannot assume a split in the right range would automatically mean benefits for the left.
What makes Le Pen, with its newly gained popularity among the white working-class French?
They would like to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti-common currency bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties in these elections do well - and this is very possible - then could dominate the European Parliament for the first time such a block.
This is the point that I am going with this: In the not-too-distant future, the growing resentment against the EU and the single currency will come together for the abolition of the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will be more like something like the "Europe of Nations (sovereign)" which favored General de Gaulle.
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may keep the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect that Britain distanced itself from this project in the hope that the United States look presidential.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific region suggests that Britain will be in the Atlantic rain alone.
Where is Scotland in all of this?
We can choose to be a region of (in the last consequence) Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests - including, Berlin and Brussels to say what they are where hinstecken can.
I suspect that Scotland could go very well in a looser European network, if we keep our own currency.
The cooperation with other like-minded countries is easier in a federal Europe of the nations.
Otherwise, we should consider it replicate Norway and keep our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is, remarkably, the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and has won a spectacular majority because of the rejection of the proposed (and) cuts carried out in 2011, the Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition had to answer for.
It would be ridiculous to decide now for an independence for Scotland, only to be imposed on an austerity from Berlin and Brussels.
