Security concerns in Mozambique grow in light of clashes between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered in the centre Maputos under the watchful eyes of the statue of the founder and first president of Mozambique, Samora Machel, call for peace in a rare public demonstration crowing.
"We want peace, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, managing director of an investment company.
Out of fear for the future of the country, it has exchanged their business clothes for a T-shirt with the inscription "We want security" in Portuguese and joined the crowd at the Independence Square in the capital on Thursday.
For two weeks, there are almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, which are among the worst battles since the peace agreement for over 20 years.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, which was initially supported by the apartheid government of South Africa from white-ruled Rhodesia and later in a bid to destabilise the country's independent government.
After the peace treaty of 1992, it has become an opposition party.
Analysts believe it is unlikely that the country back into a full-blown conflict trap, but recent events have alarmed foreign investors and locals.
Much is at stake for the rapidly growing economy, since the discovery of huge gas reserves off the coast and coal camps in the north-west could investment of more than $50 billion over the next few years by companies such as Rio tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko bring into the country from the United States.
The ruling FRELIMO party, the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo are blaming each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government had provoked the latest clashes, with its members in Sofala province, a traditional stronghold on 17 October Renamos, had attacked.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated, when government troops attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, said Renamos spokesman told the Financial Times.
The government is Renamo the blame for the clashes and accused the organization to have attacked soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to play down concerns about instability.
With AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama regard themselves as "losers" who "wants to use all his remaining forces in order to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government."
Both FRELIMO and Renamo stress that they want to avoid a war.
But the concerns have grown since Mazanga was cited with the words, Renamo acknowledge the 1992 peace agreement.
With the FT, he said that he had meant that FRELIMO no longer respect the agreement.
"Our vision is to restart negotiations and seriously," Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have contributed little to resolve the tensions that have been fired by a series of clashes this year.
"We have two adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) that the heads collide here," says Joseph'Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique-expert.
None of them is good in the negotiation and no one is prepared to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, which pushes on electoral reform, has already declared that it will boycott the municipal elections in November.
Presidential and legislative elections are planned for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as the attempt of an ailing movement to obtain concessions and financial incentives from the government.
Renamos electoral success shrink since 1992, during a recent party founded by a former Renamo member Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM), probably will improve in the elections.
Mazanga claimed that Guebuza, whose resignation comes when his second term ends next year, wanted to destroy the country's democracy.
"He wants no multi-party democracy, it wants no transparent elections that he does not want peace, because he does not want to abandon the presidency," said Mazanga.
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has, but it has made disruptive attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south connections.
Most fighting took place in the Sofala province, which lies a few hundred miles north of Maputo, Beira but finds itself in, the port, the use of coal mining companies like Rio tinto and Vale for export.
In June, Rio for a month is the use of the railways, after Renamo had announced an attack on the track.
Mazanga responded cautiously to the question of whether Renamo will repeat that threat.
Renamo "wanted to warn the international community that things are not good in Mozambique," Mazanga said.
The instability have increased the frustration over the government yet, says Fernando Lima, Head of Media coop, an independent media company, because a lot of people were concerned earlier because of corruption, the slow progress in development and a recent kidnapping wave.
"People think that the government and the President are responsible for the future of the country and he should be the one to find solutions to the problems," he says.
Omar sultans, a protestor, said that the people simply wanted stability.
"No interest Renamo and FRELIMO, they just want to restore peace and usable roads," he said.
