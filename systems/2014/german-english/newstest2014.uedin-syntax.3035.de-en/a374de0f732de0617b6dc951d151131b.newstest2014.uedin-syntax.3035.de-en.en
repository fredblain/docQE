New anti-nicotine vaccine could make the pleasure of smoking of the oxygen
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun on smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine cravings for a lifetime.
Further tests are needed before tests on humans, which may take a few more years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results were good.
"We are very hopeful that this kind of vaccination strategy can even help millions of smokers who tried to quit smoking and have tried all methods available on the market, but had to witness that nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches," said Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been changed so that it contains the genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus infected selectively the liver cells, which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies chase the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, causing a smoker is not a nicotine-High.
In experiments vaccinated mice, which was administered nicotine, retained their normal level of activity.
Mice without vaccination, on the other hand, would have taken a "break", said the researchers, a sign that the nicotine have reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science translational Medicine.
Former tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The vaccinations had to be made to maintain the Antik√∂rperpegels so often that they were expensive and impractical.
But the costs of the new vaccine are likely to be much lower because it transforms liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, could be a future vaccine for people, if he is sure to be administered to children, before they came into temptation to try a cigarette, and thus prevent nicotine addiction.
More likely, however, is that smokers would use him to quit.
"They know that if they re-start to smoke, they feel no more pleasure in it because of the nicotine vaccine, and that helps them to abandon the habit," he explained.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but warned at the same time, there is still a need for more research.
