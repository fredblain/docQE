Local council appreciates sound budget
Whenever it comes in council meetings around the budget, Mayor Ralph Gerster has a good laugh.
The herd Gemeindesäckl cheeks-Schönach is well stocked and debt no longer knows the administration since 2005.
In this sense, the 2012 financial year can also be booked as an unqualified success.
This was evident in the presentation of the annual accounts for 2012.
As Andrea Roth mouth explained, is the administrative budget with approximately 7.6 million euros over a million euros higher than planned.
The surplus of the administrative budget also lies with about EUR 1.8 million around a million euros on the approach.
The result was the surplus mainly higher corporate tax revenue and the local share of the income tax.
The capital budget was again well above the planned values.
Instead of the proposed EUR 1.5 million he averaged 2.5 million euros last year.
"This is essentially on the higher feed from the administrative budget," says Roth mouth.
There have been fewer investments have been made as planned, is also the reserve feeding higher in 2012.
Overall, the general reserve could be increased by around EUR 2.1 million to a total of EUR 4.9 million now.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Roth mouth and her team for the good work.
"As a work shakes you not just from the sleeve," praised renaissance with a view of the annual financial statements.
He and the municipal councils were visibly on the good figures.
It may sound paradoxical, but these very good figures, the public could soon pay dearly.
Through the good financial situation the county in the past could forgo high lifting rates.
This, in turn, are but, according to renaissance has often been cut subsidies from the country.
There are conditions for these grants from various compensation poles.
Among other things, to apply for the grants, the cities and municipalities must show some lifting rates.
"The issue of lifting rates, we need to look at us, as investment in the coming years, for which we would like grants," announced renaissance in this context.
