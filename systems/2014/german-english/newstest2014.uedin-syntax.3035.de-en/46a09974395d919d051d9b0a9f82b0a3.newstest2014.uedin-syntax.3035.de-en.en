Anger over judgment for Bali bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people were killed in the bombing in Bali in 2002, reacted angrily on the verdict for the past the instigator, who was put on trial because, in their view, Umar Patek should be summarily.
Patek, who was on the run for nearly ten years as one of the most wanted persons of South-East Asia, was sentenced to a prison sentence of 20 years for his role in the construction of shells for the bomb attack yesterday.
With criminal suspension, he could be released after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many more were injured.
A guilty verdict was also included in a series of terrorism-related charges, including a wave of bomb attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecution had demanded a life sentence, although they would have the death penalty for the man, who is also called the "demolition Man" because of his reputation as a master bomb maker, can apply.
The decision has aroused painful memories in June Corteen, a mother from Perth, the 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny has lost in the devastation caused by Patek and his Mitverschw√∂rern nearly ten years ago.
Fighting back tears, she said, Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I mean, he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
"You should ask him before a firing squad," said Corteen towards AAP.
I have to live with every day that I will get no further grandchildren and I will never see my daughters.
The Sari Club was razed to the ground, as on 12 October 2002 shortly after 11 p.m., a powerful bomb exploded in a small truck, which was parked in front of the nightclub.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar, where only 20 seconds before a suicide bombers explode a backpack filled with explosives.
He fell into a coma after the attack for a month and "died" three times while he was on a life support system.
Hughes said, Patek have earned the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah, Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra, who were responsible for the massacre and executed in four years.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty before anyone else.
To keep him alive, no, there is no reason to keep him alive.
To get 20 years after he killed 202 people and injured many hundreds, is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bomber, who was in court.
He took almost a decade of the arrest, but was finally picked up in January 2011 in Abbottabad in Pakistan, where US forces nearly four months later the former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden killed.
During the trial, said an FBI agent from that intelligence reports had provided the reference to Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim to rebuild the link between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
"He has not asked," said Corteen.
Until recently, he has shown no remorse for how much pain he has caused to other people.
The ruling came in this year, which will be committed with commemorations in Bali and Australia before the 10th anniversary of the attack.
"There will be many tears this year," said Corteen.
Patek can still appeal against his sentence.
