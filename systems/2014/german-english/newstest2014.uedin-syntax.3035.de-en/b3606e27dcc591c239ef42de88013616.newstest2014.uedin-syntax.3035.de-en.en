John Kerry said in an unprecedented acknowledgement that the US spy is "inappropriate gone too far"
John Kerry indicated with an unexpected admission of a slackening of the defensive attitude of the United States in terms of their surveillance programs, saying that the espionage has gone too far in certain cases "inappropriate."
The foreign minister, in addition to that he bore the responsibility that we have switched on "autopilot" together with Barack Obama, as the explosive revelations of the whistleblowers Edward Snowden were publicly about the NSA's spying activities.
The leaked information, the US government is caught in a diplomatic storm of indignation from its allies.
In a speech transmitted by video link at the Open Government conference in London, Kerry said, "without question the president and I and others in the government have experienced by some things that are expired almost on autopilot, simply because there was the ability to do so, even to the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and, of course, dates from the 11th of September."
He then acknowledged as the first high-ranking member of the US government that the US espionage have crossed a line, also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said: "It is inappropriate in some cases have gone too far."
The president is determined to create clarity, and therefore leads through a thorough investigation, so no one has to have the feeling here find abuse took place.
I assure you that the rights of innocent people in this process will not be affected.
Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force for good and through its surveillance operations had been saved many lives.
He added: "We are dealing with a new world in which people are willing to break itself into the air."
There is a radical extremism in the world, the crazy point is to kill people, to break into the air and attacking governments.
What would be, if you would be able to intercept it and to stop before it happens?
We have, in fact, plane crashes, prevent attacks on buildings and the killing of people, because we have experienced in the run-up to such plans.
Meanwhile, US lawmakers will travel to Europe in order to allay the concerns against the alleged American espionage and to convince the Europeans of the need to continue to cooperate with the United States, in anti-terror efforts, such as the chairman of the Senate Committee on European Affairs said on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he spoke this week with representatives of the European Parliament and others and is no longer concerned about their threats because of frustration with the surveillance by the National Security Agency to take part in anti-terror organizations.
"It is very important for the national security interests of the United States that the Europeans remain on board in terms of our joint efforts against terrorism," said Murphy, who sits as a Democrat for the first time in the Senate and as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and European affairs, in an interview in Washington.
I go to Europe, in order to make it clear that we need to continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their anger over the NSA programs.
Media reports that the NSA has collected millions of phone data in Europe, have strained relations with some U.S. allies, although the head of the secret service said this week that the reports were incorrect and based on a misunderstanding of the meta data collected by NATO allies and had been exchanged with the United States.
Other revelations quoted from documents provided by Snowden further that the NSA had monitored the cell phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other leaders around the world.
The director of national intelligence, James Clapper, defended the spying on allies as necessary and explained that this is common on both sides.
In all the uproar, Murphy said, his bureau before the journey of the congress, which will take place this year, and hoped that the delegation will include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating members are to be published in the next few days.
He said that the exact itinerary will be worked out.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip is the improvement of relations, said he also said that there would be some "serious words'.
He said that the European governments need to be honest with their people on the kind of espionage programs that use them for years.
"Although we can change our surveillance programs and thus better protect the rights of Europeans, but they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones that spy," says Murphy.
Meanwhile stands for John Kerry over the weekend and a trip to the Middle East to Poland to deal with the resentment over the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as the US surveillance activities there.
