To hear were mainly the visiting fans with their voices.
The south gallery, on the other hand, where the most faithful of the faithful - and loudest - BVB fans are, presented himself at first exceptionally quiet: No chants, no battle cries.
The podium of the capo, who coordinates otherwise the collective spirit, remained unfilled.
And completely on the front of the grandstand blew lonely a large banner with the inscription "section stadium ban."
Just as a goalkeeper Roman pastures jolly as always the first BVB players entered the square, brandete short-lived jubilation on.
As his team colleagues followed, there was loud singing and floating scarves - though not everywhere.
In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the southern grandstand suggested nothing.
