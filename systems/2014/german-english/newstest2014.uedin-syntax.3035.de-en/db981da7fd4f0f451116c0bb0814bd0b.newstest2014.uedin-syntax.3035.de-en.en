Löffingen: Köpfler still single candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the Baar town Löffingen with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a pioneering school, children, youth and senior policy, as well as its own city works can be described as an attractive city, has so far reported no second mayoral candidate.
As the only candidate for the succession of for age reasons no longer standing mayor Norbert Brugger is so far the 46-year-old bank clerk and business manager Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen.
The application deadline expires on Monday, November 11, at 6 pm.
