First, he wants to know, however, clarified his situation.
It has not addressed the US wanted former NSA employees in a letter made clear that the Greens politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and published in German government, the Bundestag and General Confederation of Walt more audacious.
The letter, according to one of the following text Stroebele widespread translation:
In the House
I was asked to write to you for your examination of mass surveillance.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and was once a contract or through a direct employment as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), employed by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (dia) of the United States.
In the course of my employment in these facilities, I was witness systematic violations of the law of my government that led me from moral duty to act.
As a result of the publication of these concerns I saw I face a serious and persistent smear campaign that forced me to leave my family and my home.
I live now in exile and enjoy temporary asylum, which gives me the Russian Federation in accordance with international law.
I am encouraged by the response to my political action, both in the US and elsewhere.
People around the world, as well as high officials, including the United States, the revelations have judged on a system of mass surveillance, which is accountable to no one, as a service to the public.
The espionage revelations drew many proposals for new laws and directives aimed at the former covert abuse of public trust.
The benefit for the company gained from these findings is increasingly clear; at the same time, the risks taken in purchase were visibly reduced.
Although the result of my endeavours was demonstrably positive, treated my government dissent remains as a loyalty break and seeks to criminalize political expression and to put on trial.
However, the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that, with the support of the international community, the government of the United States will give this damaging attitude.
I hope that, if the problems are resolved of this humanitarian situation, I will be able to focus on the good awareness of the issues in terms of the statements made in the media, particularly with regard to truth and authenticity of the reports, appropriate and to take part in accordance with law.
I look forward to a conversation with you in your country, once the situation is clarified and thank you for their efforts to maintain international law that protects us all.
