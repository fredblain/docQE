When the horse show-experts in droves in Cardiff incident Andes, to select the horse of the year, was aware of them that a rat race.
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The Knirps, who is not even in the kindergarten and just a few months ago has made his first steps, and his Shetland pony toffee trabten loosely through three rounds and brought the first prize, while 30 adult opponents behind.
The inseparable pair, both the same size, have been praised for their appearance, behavior and style in the annual competition, which is organized by the sunny Bank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
During his appearance in competition against men and women with elegant melons, he had set up his plate cap in a cheeky angle and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the judges for its natural skills in dealing with the pony, which would go far beyond his age.
And toffee received top marks for his appearance and personality.
Fenton had toffee last March as a gift to get his third birthday and practiced every day with the Shetland pony since then.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: "Fenton and toffee are a great team."
They had to compete against the entire field of participants and went from the square with the Gold Cup and rosette.
It was only the second time that he had participated in a competition with toffee, and we were all excited when he won.
Complete strangers in the arena thought it was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, the horse reins for more than ten years.
Howells said: "The whole audience was as electrifying and all have cheered him and clapping."
He ran on sand the entire length of the arena and although he looked so tiny, he has done a fantastic job.
Fenton is crazy after animals - he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens, to look after himself.
As it is launched, it will not take long until he is on the "horse of the year" -Schau - and I am sure that he will do well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show said: "Fenton is only three, but he knows what he has to deal with his pony."
Together, they are a great team.
The jury assessed Fenton and toffee according to how well they had beaten and presented in the Vorf√ºhrring.
They take care of good cooperation between pony and leader - and there were Fenton and with the best in the ring.
I am sure that Fentons sweet clothing has played its part, it was really perfect for the occasion.
