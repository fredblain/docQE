Pope Francis appoints in February first Cardinals
Pope Francis will rely on February 22 new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the senior clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope and they are also to elect a pope, Francis is to appoint the first group of men who will participate in the election of his successor at the end of the day.
Currently, there are 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal, who has reached the age of 80 years, can no longer take part in the papal election - that falls to a group of 120 "electorate" cardinals.
In a statement, in which the news was announced, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman said, there will be a meeting of cardinals, before the ceremony will be held on the appointment of the new cardinals, which is also known as a consistory.
"Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision on the convening of the by last February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of the cardinals from around the world can be planned," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of cardinals eligible voters will probably be dropped until February.
He said that a pope appointing normally so many Cardinals as necessary, so that the number of voters scared again 120 amount, and so many cardinals over 80, as he would like.
The consistory next year is so important because it was the first since the election of Francis in March of this year, as Valero.
At the moment there is some overhang on the part of Europe, and in particular in Italy.
"It will be interesting to see whether the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world in order to restore the balance," he said.
Forty percent of Catholics living in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
The Cardinals will also be the first to be appointed since the formation of the Council founded by Francis of the Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world who have the task to find ways to reform the church.
In the past the Pope decided everything alone.
"Now Francis has selected the eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said that it was "quite possible" that Francis the Cardinals ask for advice.
But so far, we were not in this situation - this is all very new.
Valero said that typically the bishops from great places to cardinals appointed would, however, route Francis "full of surprises - we know that is not who he appoints."
