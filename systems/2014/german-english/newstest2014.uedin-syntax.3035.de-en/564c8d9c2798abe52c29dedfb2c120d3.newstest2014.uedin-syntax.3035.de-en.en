British police, Assange to an extradition decision
The British police has an extradition decision today passed to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and has applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said that it had sent a "call to ask themselves," the 40-year-old Australian, who urge him to appear in a police station, and added that if he did not comply, threatened him with arrest.
Assange faces extradition to Sweden in a sex offence because of the indictment, after his options are exhausted under UK law, since the Supreme Court rejected his appeal against the extradition at the beginning of the month.
Because he feared that Stockholm will extradite him to the United States, he had sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on June 19 and asked for political asylum from the South American country.
Scotland Yard have "a 40-year-old man sent an invitation to put itself at a police station on a date chosen by us," said a spokesman.
He also violated the conditions of his release on bail.
The message gave no comment on the delivery of police call.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States and accused of possible espionage charges, after he had published more than 250,000 diplomatic messages on the Web site WikiLeaks disclosure.
