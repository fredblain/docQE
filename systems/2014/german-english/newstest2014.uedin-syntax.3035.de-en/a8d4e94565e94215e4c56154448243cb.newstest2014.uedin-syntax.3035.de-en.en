Egypt sworn first freely elected president
Mohammed Morsi sets their oath of office, but his day of Triumph will not mean the end of the political disputes in Egypt.
The Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a "new Egypt," when he was sworn in as the country's first freely elected president, and thus took up the succession of Hosni Mubarak, who had been driven from office 16 months earlier.
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi was also the Arab world's first freely elected Islamist president and Egypt's fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He put the oath before the 18 judges of the court, which has its seat on the Nile dressed in black robes and is inspired by an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We strive for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," Morsi said at the ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.
"Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundation for a new life - absolute freedom, a genuine democracy and stability," said the 60-year-old Morsi, a trained engineer and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group in the United States, the most since its inception 84 years ago as a banned organization had been targeted by the respective government sharply.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building, as Morsi arrived shortly after 11 p.m. local time in a small car convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered in front of the court to the new president zuzujubeln, and in contrast to the presidential pomp from the Mubarak era, the traffic was stopped for a short time, so that the auto convoy was able to cross the usually bustling street, which connects the city centre with the southern suburbs.
As uncharismatisches "spare tire" of the Brotherhood mocked his personal prestige has grown since his victory and a Friday speech, in which he presented himself not only as a candidate of the Islamists, but all those who wanted to bring the aspirations of the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubarak to your destination.
"Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state today," said the judges in the wood-panelled chamber of Morsi dressed in a blue suit with a red tie, his oath of office in August.
Morsi later went to the University of Cairo, where he should keep his inaugural speech.
He was officially welcomed by a military band played the national anthem, which he listened to in Habachtstellung.
The military leader Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
On his arrival he was greeted with chanting, "The army and the people are one hand" of hundreds of those present in the main auditorium of the university.
The Cairo University built in 1908 as a bastion of secular education has become a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Morsi presented on Friday a symbolic oath in Tahrir Square, the birthplace of the uprising, which led to the end of Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year, and vowed to reclaim presidential powers, which the SCAF had taken over from the hunted leader from office.
But with the drop of the official oath before the court and not as usual before Parliament prevents it is the will of the military, which shows that the power struggle will continue.
Morsi's speech on the Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
