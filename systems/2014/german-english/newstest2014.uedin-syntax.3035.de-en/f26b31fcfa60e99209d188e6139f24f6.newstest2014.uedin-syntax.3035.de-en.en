America will continue to prosecute Snowden
The United States has not changed its stance on the former US intelligence employee Edward Snowden.
He will continue to have accused of illegally passed on secret information.
Therefore, he must face a criminal trial in the United States, the US State Department spokeswoman, Jennifer Psaki, said in Washington.
The recent comments of Snowden would not change this.
Previously the German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow, appealed to the United States not to threaten him with further punishment.
Psaki emphasized that Ströbeles statements is that of a parliamentarian was and is not a member of a German government.
