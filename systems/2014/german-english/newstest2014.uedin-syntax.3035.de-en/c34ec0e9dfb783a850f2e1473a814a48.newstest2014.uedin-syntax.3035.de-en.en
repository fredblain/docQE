Johanna Rahner wants to look into the issue in the forum, such as the "last thing" because the people today after death.
If the people in the last few centuries of them know too much and put on those images of heaven and hell, "which still shape our ideas," that will draw the contemporary prophetic lesson of hopes for completion by a certain embarrassment or even speechlessness.
"The greater hope is Christians and Christian by religion criticism belonging been exorcised," the officer said.
They have "provided us with so many question marks that we seem to have lost the exclamation point."

Linked to this is the question that desire, "the dreams that at the end of the day, everything will be good."
