Germany's biggest country church has launched an offensive to advertise for the job of the pastor.
Background is a possible priest shortage: The Protestant-Lutheran country church Hanover expects that will halve the number of its current 1,800 Pastor Home and pastors to present situation by 2030.
For young people of today is the profession very attractive and offer good prospects, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to choose the work and daily routine.
With Burfien instructed the country church, for the first time, a pastor at a full point to inspire young people for the first time.
At present, fewer and fewer young people decide after graduating from high school to study theology.
Burfien leads back to the process of secularisation: "God's voice is quiet, the world is loud."
This is a career marked by great freedom and diversity.
I am the master of my schedule and can there my priorities, where it is important to me.
Pastors could be close to the people as a chaplain.
They deserved as much as teachers and could well live on it.
No doubt will pay more in the free economy, but theologians would have a secure employer.
This will go to the young people of today that it is not just a career, but a meaningful work.
According to the national church, which includes three-quarters of Lower Saxony, currently go around 60 pastors per year in retirement.
At the same time start around 40 graduates of a theology studies her twenty-.
In sparsely populated and peripheral regions like the resin, Emsland or Wendland could, it will be difficult to fill posts.
Burfien wants to hold study days for young people, among other things, and will also invite celebrities who have studied theology.
The first time offers a broad education.
You can even be that Federal President.
