ESA decides on major space missions: Missions for billion
Distant planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts of the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that they want to start in the next few years.
30 proposals were to choose from, five are still in the race.
Distant worlds.
More than 1000 planet with other stars, astronomers have already found.
Whether there is life on some of them at least, nobody knows.
The selection is difficult: Are we to look for gravitational waves?
Or rather explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or search for planets within a billion years and thus perhaps discover alien life?
These questions are the leaders of the European Space Agency ESA.
For its programme "Cosmic Vision" they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that will significantly advance the research.
The budget for such "L-missions" each is approximately one billion euros.
The launch is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, the elite of the European Space Research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas were on the table, five of them are now come in the final round.
Many bodies examine the proposals, push for the researchers.
In the next few days a final decision by the scientific program committee should fall.
A total of four major issues, the ESA has selected on the missions of the programme initiated in 2007 "Cosmic Vision" to find answers.
What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life?
The exact transactions in the birth of stars from major gas clouds - and thus also the formation of planets orbiting the star - are still in the proverbial dark.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness.
And when a star has planets, under what circumstances can result in life?
To investigate this matter, is due to start in 2017, the space telescope "last" with the 500 already known planetary systems in our vicinity to be examined in detail.
The possibilities are limited, his is a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million.
With larger instruments could astronomers first step planet map and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres and search for "biomarkers": Gases that apply as an indication of biological activity.
How does the solar system?
This question, too, is ultimately intended to indicate what conditions there are for the emergence of life.
Plays an important role the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field, as well as the particle radiation emitted by him with the planetary system.
In our solar system, you can examine these events as an example.
With the "Solar Orbiter" the ESA has already approved the budget for a mission of the M-class (there is about half a billion euros) for this issue.
The probe is expected to start in 2017 and closely monitor surface and activity of the sun.
Also of great interest to the researchers are Jupiter and its moons.
They want to find out what role the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system.
For this, the ESA provides for the first of the three L-missions of the "Cosmic Vision" programme.
The probe "juice" (Jupiter icy moons Explorer) begins its journey to 2022.
Eight years later, it reaches Jupiter and is designed to study the atmosphere of the planet, as well as the icy moons Europa, Ganymede and Kallisto.
What are the fundamental physical laws of the universe?
The space offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and to investigate whether the laws we know there are still valid.
Perhaps also found discrepancies that physicists could point the way to a new theory, under whose umbrella to unite all known laws.
What is the universe created and what is it?
13.7 billion years ago our universe created by the Big Bang.
In addition to the household matter to us from the stars, planets and life as we are, there are dark matter, whose gravity holds galaxies and galaxy clusters together, and dark energy, whose work is accelerating the expansion of the universe.
So far the researchers know not what physical laws were valid in the first fractions of the Big Bang, nor what dark matter and dark energy remain.
With "Euclid," the ESA has also has already approved a M-mission, whose launch is scheduled for 2020.
With a special telescope to study the probe of the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the whole sky and allow such conclusions on the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could make the race
Only two of the 30 proposals will be left at the end of the selection process.
The best chance for a permit as L-mission, in the opinion of many experts "e-Lisa," an ambitious concept for the detection of gravitational waves.
Including physicists understand changes in the structure of the space-time that Albert Einstein had predicted almost 100 years ago.
To this day, they do not have been proven.
Elisa could do this, the scientists behind the project hope.
The mission provides for a detector of two or three probes, which is stationed in space.
He could, in contrast to plants on Earth, prove gravitational waves that have emerged from the Big Bang, and provide new insights about the formation of the universe.
Four other proposals still compete at the second L mission: A large X-ray telescope called Athena, "which, among other things, is to explore black holes," icy planets, "another mission to the outer planets of the solar system," prism, "a mission to survey the cosmic background radiation, and the" Exoplanet finder, "the first step is to detect and investigate planets.
Already eliminated include proposals for sample-return transport from the exploration of the moon, Mars, Venus and asteroids as well as solar physics.
