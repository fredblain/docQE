Coulson was a phone-hacking for checking of tips
The former News of the World editor Andy Coulson was allegedly "phone-hacking, monitoring and confrontation" in an attempt to confirm a, a false tip about an affair of the then Home Secretary Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the court in the Old Bailey heard that the News of the World had been a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke would have a relationship with his "attractive special adviser" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper commissioned the private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlbys voice mails, and pursued them, but Coulson called them and left messages, the court heard.
"In the opinion of the prosecutor is Coulson, who is now the editor of the NotW, no one who stands in front of the apartment of people and hopes to discharging, but one that people like to be confronted with a story to see their reaction," said Edis.
He said that NotW use three procedures to research stories citizen: Phone-hacking, monitoring and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows differently from the second, the monitoring, it cannot be.
What about the first?
Does he know about the phone-hacking?
He denies this, but we say: "And whether he knew about them."
Rumours of an affair Clarke's were first taken up by the NotW feature editorial, as a source who was sexually interested in Pawlby said: "Do not waste your time, together with Charles."
A band with her telephone voice mails of at least three occasions was secured in Mulcaires apartment in August 2006.
The investigators also found entries on the computer of the term, were stored on the Pawlby and her sister as "projects.
At the time the searches ran, received the grandparents of Pawlby anonymous phone calls, in which they were asked for information about them, said Edis.
Meanwhile, the former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw the monitoring of the movements of Pawlby.
On 18 June 2005 left Coulson her a voicemail with the following content: "I have a story that we want to bring out tomorrow, on which I would like to speak with Charles."
Edis explained, coul's activities in this story followed the same pattern as with other important figures, such as the former Home Secretary David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett have faced because of an affair with a married woman, as he himself with the co Rebekah Brooks "was, at the time, had been married.
Coulson and Brooks fight to have conspired with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted the phone-hacking.
