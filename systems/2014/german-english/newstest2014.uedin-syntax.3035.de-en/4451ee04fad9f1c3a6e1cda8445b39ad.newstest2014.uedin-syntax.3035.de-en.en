You could call him the Dostoyevsky of the United States.
Philip K. Dick was a god viewfinder, a meta-physicist, his novels and stories have something serial.
Amazingly the kinship in the Outer: The sharp eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And so, as Fyodor Dostoevsky M. with his massive body of work is meant as Ergründer and apologists of the Russian soul, one reads Philip K. Dick than American prophets, which is quite something in their own country.
Some titles are published in the World publishing, the Lagoon Mans-cassette with 118 stories sells two thousand one.

Dick had God experiences, his late books read like a mixture of the revelation of John and a computer manual.

He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a person from a machine, the creator of his creation.
This is the "Blade Runner" problem.
The killing.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.

And: "There is no serious criminals in our society, we have a penal camp full Pesudoverbrecher." They read time flows.
They assume that bad things happen, and will prevent the criminal idea into a reality.
Dicks narrative acts like the blueprint for the NSA's anti-terror laws and the Abhörrausch.
