A study was announced by the British government, which is intended to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd proposes, even with the start of Phase 1 of the year 2026 to achieve high-speed connections between Scotland and the north of England.
Transport minister Baroness Kramer said that the project "will be Britain closer together."
The Scottish transport minister Keith Brown said he was very pleased to work with the British government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands.
After the completion of Phase 2, there will be links to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion for the construction of the high-speed link between London and the north of England.
The British government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, instructed HS2 Ltd to look for other routes capacities and travel time improvements for the north of England and Scotland.
These include the possibility of a travel time of three hours or less of Glasgow and Edinburgh to London at the end of the day.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our aim for HS2 is a truly national network, the United Kingdom and its cities closer together."
We go ahead with HS2, because it brings enormous benefits.
Without it, we are facing a crisis of capacity in our rail network.
But it is also about the link between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will improve thanks to HS2.
The Scottish Secretary Alistair AP commented: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish Government called Keith Brown AP to use "unequivocal" for the Scottish involvement in the HS2 network.
Brown said: "The high-speed rail link has the potential of enormous economic benefits for Scotland, at the same time, but also the economic strength of Scotland an argument for fast rail links across the UK."
We are therefore pleased to work as a partner of the British government and to examine the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland, which creates benefits for all and the Glasgow-Edinburgh link added that the Scottish Government already plans.
I look forward to the investigation report with the British ministers to consider next year and work together to decide on the next steps.
