Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) had been accused of sexual offences in connection with children, before 2011 allegations were made against the child carers Jonathan Lord from Caringbah, as the Royal Commission for sexual abuse of children learned.
But at the opening statement before the Commission had declared the YMCA, we have never had anything to do with an incident of sexual child abuse "in the organization."
Managing director Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which a YMCA employees had been accused of offences with child pornography, and another in which a sports teacher of the YMCA Caringbah Hall in 1991 had been convicted of abuse him anvertrauter children.
Hare said Gail Furness, one of the Commission Assis animal lawyer that he had known of the first case, but the second was not known.
He admitted that the YMCA's opening statement to the Commission has also been inaccurate in the assertion that "there have been external reviews of the YMCA, in which the YMCA was recognized as a front line in the children's safety."
Evidence of the Commission show instead that the YMCA was informed that he was the second-lowest rating of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities (Ministry of Education) has received in August of this year.
Hare, who has started 21 at the YMCA, admitted that the management had "failed to backward" in the recruitment of Lord of me and not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report violations of the directives on child safety.
Lord, the beginning of the year had been convicted of sex offenses at 12 boys during his two-year career for the YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum of six years in prison.
Hare denied, however, that the YMCA had a cultural problem, have prevented the staff, Lords to report offences in relation to the safety of children.
The staff said that they had observed violations, among other things, that he was alone with children, they privately supported as a baby sitter, they sit on his lap was to have said that he would like, and children play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose boss Lord was and had asked for a training to child protection, because she was concerned for his behavior, said of the children's services director Jacqui Barnat, the supervisors in the YMCA Caringbah the Lords was, "very daunting and most of the time was very remote."
The CEO said that he would not accept statements of employees that they could not be trusted to reimburse message to their superiors.
Instead, he said, have affected their judgment on their friendship with Lord, why they had not reported it.
Hare said that he had informed the board of the YMCA NSW his view that the lesson to draw from the "Jonathan Lord incident" that the organization, "not the Report" by employees, according to the study, and the board voted to approve him.
Hare said, the decision to push the employees to sign non-disclosure obligations shortly after the emergence of the allegations had been made by the director of the YMCA of children's services, Liam Whitley,.
He said that the contamination of the evidence should be prevented, but was "overzealous" and poorly implemented.
The YMCA NSW is not safe for children in the time when Jonathan Lord was employed between 2009 and 2011 there have been organization, said Professor Stephen small bone of Griffith University, an expert on child sex abuse, the Commission.
He explained that there had been "serious problems" in the recruitment, screening, training, training and supervision of employees.
