Fancy ice cream that glows in the dark?
A British businessman has developed the first glow in the dark ice cream - with the help of jellyfish.
Charlie Francis, exploiting the fluorescent properties of marine animals and it created a luminous infinity.
The idea came to him after he had read a research on jellyfish and Chinese scientists have been able to convince the luminous protein artificially produce.
The ice cream responded in the consumption of the tongue, which will raise the pH value in the protein and triggered the lights.
Chris said, the ice-cream responsive to the warmth in the mouth and light - the more you so licks, the brighter it.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company "lick Me I'm Delicious," says: "The product is unbelievable, but still in a very early stage of production, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds."
The protein used in ice cream responded with the tongue in a neutral pH.
If the mouth warms the protein, the pH value rises and shines the ice.
We have tested it in recent months and it seemed ideal to bring it to Halloween on the market, because it has this wonderful contrast.
It is likely to be the most expensive ice cream, which I have ever made, because the fluorescent jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
Every ball costs me about 140 pounds.
But it tastes delicious.
Char read experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavors, which include beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his latest creation should be even more ambitious.
He says: "I would like to develop an invisible ice cream."
That is impossible in and of itself as a result of the atmosphere, which is caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream, but I suspect that we will find a way to create it.
