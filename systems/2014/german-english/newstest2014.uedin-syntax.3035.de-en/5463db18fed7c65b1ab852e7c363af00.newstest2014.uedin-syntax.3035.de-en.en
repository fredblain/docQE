The rules on electronic devices on planes remain in Australia for the time being in force
Australian airline passengers must continue to disable tablets and smartphones at launch and landing, despite efforts in the United States, to relax the rules for such devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US airlines to change their rules so that passengers can see or play on their devices during critical flight phases read e-books, videos, if they are located in the "flight mode.
While the bulk of the flight's passengers already allowed this, but many people are angry that they cannot read the launch and the landing of their e-books.
Australian companies see the decision to implement the US airlines have to do a lot of work, but have no immediate plans to change its rules.
The air traffic control authority Casa said also that we will look at the announcement, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases in Australia still apply.
"Casa currently has no specific rules on use of electronic devices on the plane," was announced.
The issue is subject to provisions requiring airlines maintain the security at all times and passengers must follow the safety instructions given by the cabin crew.
Virgin has already held talks with the Casa on a widening use of Wi-Fi-entertainment system on flights and said it is open to changes, but these should be initiated by the legislator.
"We would welcome a review of the approval of electronic devices by the Casa because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience, after we now offer (wireless entertainment) during the flight," a spokesman said.
Qantas said that it will remain in the current rules until further notice.
"Our current guidelines stipulate that electronic devices should not be used during the launch and landing, and we currently have no plans to change that," said the company.
The FAA rules apply to American carriers.
We are always interested in developments in regulations, from which passengers can benefit, and we will certainly look the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The decision has an impact on US companies vary depending on the age of the fleet.
They must prove that their planes can tolerate radio interference from mobile devices, and manuals, training materials, baggage-change programs, as well as customer instruction.
"After an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers using portable, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smart phones at every level," announced the FAA.
In rare cases in poor visibility, the crew will instruct the passengers, while landing disable the devices.
The group also recommended heavier devices in to store launch and landing safely under the seat or in the subjects on the seats.
