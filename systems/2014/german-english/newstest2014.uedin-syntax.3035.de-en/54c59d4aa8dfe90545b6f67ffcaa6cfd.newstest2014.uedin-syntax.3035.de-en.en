A persistent ankle injury threatens the use of Nicolai Muller in the Bundesliga-abroad to prevent the FSV Mainz 05 game at FC Augsburg.
Mainz bnagt for a bet by Nicolai Muller.
Tomorrow, he will try to train with the team.
So far, he was the only individual.
"We will decide on its use in the short term," said coach Thomas Tuchel.
The 40-year-old hopes to have the best scorer with six goals in this.
Because the Mainzer already have to do without the injured service provider Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
