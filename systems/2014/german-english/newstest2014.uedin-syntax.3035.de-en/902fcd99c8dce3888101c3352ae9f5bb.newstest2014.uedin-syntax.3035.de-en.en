Land Rover Rally Series announced
The interior makes racing seats and six-point belts and a free intercom.
The options range from enhanced brakes, a service package with care by Bowler-works-mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, said: "The rally customers that come on Bowler have changed."
They are not all experienced riders, but people who are looking for excitement and adventure, as well as an accessible way to world-class events.
We are pleased to be able to open this way in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens new opportunities to experience the various Rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and to prepare for newcomers to the hardships and the reality of Rally raid.
We really had fun to develop the Defender Challenge car - it will be an entertaining championship.
There is also a training and test day at the Defender Challenge in February, as well as the option to participate in desert race in North Africa and the Middle East.
