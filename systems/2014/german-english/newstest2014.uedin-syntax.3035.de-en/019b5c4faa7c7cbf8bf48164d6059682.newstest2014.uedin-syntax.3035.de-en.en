Rapist in South Africa: Twice of life imprisonment
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was sentenced to two life sentences on Friday.
It reported the broadcaster SABC.
The victim was later died from the effects of the severe injuries.
Johannes Kana had already been found guilty of the crime at the beginning of the week.
The act had caused dismay across the country.
The then 21-year-old Anene Booysen had raped in February in an industrial area in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
14 hours doctors fought for the survival of the victim, but to no avail.
The sight of young people was so appalling that the carers and nurses needed psychological assistance.
Mains had admitted during the trial, in which Tatnacht with Booysen appears to have been in a bar.
He also confessed that they had beaten and raped, but he denied being responsible for the death of the girl.
The police had initially assumed by several perpetrators, dismissed two suspects from detention, however, because the evidence against them is not adequate.
The public prosecutor also stressed during the procedure, she was convinced that Qana was alone at the time of the attack.
Rapes are part of everyday life in South Africa almost: Every year, there are some 64 000 ads for sexual violence.
That is almost ten times as much as in Germany, which has a population of 82 million people far more than South Africa (50 million).
The police and women's associations in South Africa estimate the number of unreported cases of sexual violence at between 10 and 25 times.
