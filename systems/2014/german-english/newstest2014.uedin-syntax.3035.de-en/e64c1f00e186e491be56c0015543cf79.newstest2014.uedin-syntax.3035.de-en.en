They thought that travel agencies are a thing of the past thanks to Internet?
Flight Centre seems to buck the trend.
The company has increased its profit outlook for the full year and expects record revenue of tourists in Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travel company now comes from an adjusted annual pre-tax profit of $325 to $340 million, compared to 305 million to $315 million in its previous forecast.
If the current targets are achieved, that means a growth of 12 to 17 percent compared to the record profit of 290,4 million dollars in 2011 / 12.
As managing director Graham Turner announced, reached Flight Centre in the first half of eight percent gain and achieved a strong start to the second half, especially in the Australian and British private business.
"Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries are profitable, and some of them are on the way towards the record year income before interest and taxes," he said.
These include Australia and the United Kingdom, which typically are among our strongest result winners.
In Australia, the leisure industry recovered in the second half of this year, equipped with a slightly weaker market for business trips.
It was similarly well for the leisure business of Flight Centre in Britain, while here, too, the business customers spent less.
The US business recovered from the seasonally weaker first half, so a profit for the full year is expected for the third year in a row.
Yesterday, the shares of Flight Centre rose by 3 cents to 38.20 dollars.
