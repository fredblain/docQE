An air ambulance to the coast geflogener bird, the exhausted had been found on a North Sea oil rig, was released back into the environment.
The Wasserralle was flown by a helicopter to Aberdeen last month, where she was from the Scottish SPCA animal protection organization in their rescue center in Alloa aufgep√§ppelt.
Colin Seddon, head of the centre, said: "These Wasserralle was probably a wintry migrant from northern Europe, which has been held up by the strong winds on the North Sea."
The exhausted bird apparently sought refuge on the oil rig.
He added: "He could no longer continue to fly, so we were contacted with a request for help."
In its release, the Wasserralle was fit and healthy again.
