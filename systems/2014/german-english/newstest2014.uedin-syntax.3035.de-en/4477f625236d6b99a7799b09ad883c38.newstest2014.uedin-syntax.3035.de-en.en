Court blocks decision to stop-and-Frisk directive of the NYPD
The arrangement of a judge on Thursday blocked a federal appeals court in the United States, which had called for changes to the stop-and-Frisk program ("stop and search") of the New York Police Department, and FRELIMO, the judge of the case.
The 2nd U.S. appeals court said that rulings by Judge Shira Scheindlin would be suspended, pending a decision on an appeal of the city.
The judge had ruled in August that the city goes against the Constitution with the way the program will be implemented for the stopping and questioning of people.
The city appealed against their assessment and the ordered a corrective measures, including the decision to set up a monitoring office, which should support the police in the amendment of the directive and the corresponding training program.
The appeal court heard the arguments to the required suspension on Tuesday.
The appeal report stated that the judge should be relieved of the case, since they have violated the code of conduct for American judges appointed by is that a judge is to avoid the appearance of partiality; this was founded in part with a series of media interviews and public statements, in which they had publicly responded to the criticism of the court.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, because they were inappropriately specifically targeting black and Latin American men with the stop-and-Frisk program.
They appointed an outside agency to monitor the implementation of significant changes, including reforms to policies, training and service supervision, and ordered a pilot program with the body worn cameras in districts where most checks were carried out.
In August, the city of New York is willing to put an end to the practice of storing names and addresses of people who have been released again after a check by the police.
An oral hearing on the appeal of the city is scheduled for March 14, 2014.
The stop-and-Frisk tactic was criticized by a number of civil rights advocates.
Such controls are there for decades in various forms, but increased the number of recorded controls during the term of the non-party Mayor Michael Bloomberg on an all-time high of 684.330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
2004 was developed by four men, who were all minorities, the complaint to a class action.
Advocates of changes to the stop-and-Frisk program of the NYPD say the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police and influence the way, use the scheme as other police chiefs.
Opponents are of the opinion that the changes would dampen the morale of the police, but not the crime; nor would waste money and not solve the broader problem of a police force, which is under pressure after the loss of thousands of jobs in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that they do not have the stop-and-Frisk practice that was constitutional, but the way of implementation of controls by the NYPD reformiere.
