Frankfurt parking fees should rise strongly
Parking in Frankfurt could soon be fairly expensive.
The magistrate of the city advises this morning on a template of Verkehrsdezernent Stefan Majer (Green).
Therefore, the park fees should be increased by 50 percent.
But it should not raise the prices, but the time interval of Park watches and parking ticket vending machines will be reduced from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December, the City Council Assembly must then decide.
The retail committee Frankfurt Chamber of Commerce believes that "is not a good idea."
The car park just before the business was "a not inconsiderable benefit for smaller retailers."
The Transport Club of Germany is of the opinion that an increase after two decades "entirely appropriate and is long overdue."
The public transport will be even more expensive.
