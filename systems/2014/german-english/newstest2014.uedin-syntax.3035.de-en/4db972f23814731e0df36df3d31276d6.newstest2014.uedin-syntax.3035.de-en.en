Traffic lights on Dauerrot: Pay attention to waiting
Sometimes a traffic light is simply not green.
The contact loop responded in the street, or the light signal is defective.
What can we do - go on red?
The affected has waited long enough at a red traffic light and the intersection is free, he can continue that explains the Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "motorcycle."
However, the waiting time must be "reasonable" what could be interpreted differently on a case-by-case basis.
Becker advises to wait at least five minutes, before a malfunction of the traffic light is expected.
If the trip despite Rotlichts continues, should, however, be aware that he bears the full blame for an accident caused as a result.
Who is tolerated less than five minutes, waiting may not long enough, warns Becker and points to a decision of the Higher Regional Court Hamm.
Negotiated in the case had a driver after about three minutes Dauerrot ignored the traffic lights and had to answer for a negligent red light violation.
The traffic light was not damaged, but jumped to a little later on green.
A driving ban was spared him because of the special situation - but not the fine.
