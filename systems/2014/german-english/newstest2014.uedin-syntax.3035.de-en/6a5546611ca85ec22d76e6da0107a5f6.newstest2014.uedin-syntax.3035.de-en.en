Live with good prospects
Actually lives Waltraud Ries fantastically.
Their house is in a residential area of Stuttgart, set in an old trees, nice neighbors and not too much traffic.
There are only a few minutes by public transport in the city.
"Hopefully, you have no fear of spiders?," asks Waltraud Ries and shows at a fat spider on door frames.
I am already looking for a new home for my husband and me for some time.
But you know how difficult it is in Stuttgart.
The reason is not a spider phobia, but the concern, however, in the age of the many steps to the house and no longer able to cope in the apartment, she says.
Moreover, since a meniscus tears-operation, the Mitt fifty woman has experienced what it means to move with a handicap from floor to floor.
Recently, a book published by her on 'happy living in old age - What home form is the best for me?'.
"Our home is the best example of what the age is not allowed," she begins to tell.
When they moved into the apartment with her husband more than 20 years ago, it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green.
Today, with mid-fifties, Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it.
But they also know that it is one of the few people who actually deal with the issue of 'living in old age'.
Most displace it, as long as it is.
Old are always the others', she says an enduring formative influence.
Only when the suffering is really great, do you have thoughts.
"Then it may be too late," says Ries.
In her book, the interior designer 17 residential models for a self-determined living in old age.
'What living form it chooses, is always an individual decision, "she says.
D i s solution were it not for the ages.
Even those who can afford the age retirement home in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that he could also be ill.
And: "Without a good knowledge of the language association, it is also in the dolce vita, 'the reference book author exile willing to bear in mind.
Their models are classic care models, alternative forms of housing or the oft-quoted pensioner-WG.
Everyone has the age he ticks and quirks
'For me would be a residential community but nothing, "she says with a wink.
Certainly not as in a student-WG with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
"In old age is simply his withdrawal rooms, as well as Ries.
For a senior-living community can still work, the book writer, however, cannot be ruled out.
It must then differently than in the classic student-WG.
And sometimes one simply even his calm, "she believes.
With this view, they at least in the state capital is not alone.
"Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay as long as it is in their own home, 'is also the experience of Theresa RÃ¼tten, the head of the civil service life at the age of the state capital.
The department advises people around the theme 'grow older. "
Why would just older people often inconvenience and restrictions on buying companies, only to be able to remain in their familiar surroundings, this is also the experience of the Stiftung Warentest.
There are many ways to make the house or flat barrier free today.
Ries recommends all that deal with the age just reconstruction of their house or apartment to instruct once reliable information and not the only best craftsmen.
Today is also available for the age just reconstruction specialists.
Even in the rental housing will realize one thing or another, and if it is only increase the toilet seat, clarifies the interior designer.
But the existing housing age is not always fair and thus transform barrier-free, even if it is still so beautiful.
This experience has had to make Waltraud Ries.
While one might install a stair lift inside the apartment, but the same with stairs paved way up on the apartment door would be the far greater obstacle.
It will continue to search until it has found the ideal object for themselves and her husband.
Before the parade dread it over before the spider on her apartment door.
