Children should be taught as "role models for life" of myths and legends, an author says.
The stories of Thor showed that "brutal force has no chance against clever tricks," and the Arthur legend demonstrate how important it is to have a dream.
Many of the myths are, however, "far too wild, too offensive and, in some cases, too dirty to be taught in schools," why Crossley-Holland pleaded for a "careful selection" age just works.
"I think it is wonderful that myths and folklore in America are already part of education," he said.
I have already proposed a plan for 20 years.
He added that in the case of authors and teachers were "overly didactic", children would "shut it down completely," because in entertaining stories would conveys the message "undercurrent".
Crossley-Holland, the Beowulf has translated from the Anglo-Saxon and author of the Penguin Book of Hebrew Myths and the British folk tales, explained: "You can be certain intentions, but you should keep it in the background as possible."
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author who writes for adults, and an author who writes for children, is the need to convey hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or lead to happy endings, but there is an inherent sense of good and evil.
This must be presented subliminally, explained by the story and not be revealed.
This is the old story of showing rather than telling.
