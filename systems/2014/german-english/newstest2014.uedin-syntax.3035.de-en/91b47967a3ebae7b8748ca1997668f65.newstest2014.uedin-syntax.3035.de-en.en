FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices on planes (but no mobile phone calls)
Passengers can now use their electronic devices for reading, work, games, music and the image of films from the departure to the landing, but not with the mobile phone, according to the new guidelines, which were issued on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States.
But the passengers should not expect that these changes will be implemented immediately.
How quickly they would be implemented, drawn by the respective airline, FAA employee Michael Huerta said at a press conference.
The airlines, the FAA must prove that aircraft meet the new guidelines and that they have updated the training manuals for flight crew, as well as the rules for the storage of the devices in accordance with the new rules.
The FAA said that they have already received by some airlines plans that would expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes.
Under these airlines were also Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the state of the plan we could approve the expanded use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA announced in a statement.
Currently, passengers must switch smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
They can only restart them when the plane reached an altitude of three kilometers and the captain is the green light.
Enter the landing the passengers need to disable them again and cannot run again, before the plane landed.
Under the new guidelines could allow airlines, whose planes are secured against electronic malfunctions, their passengers to use the equipment in the launch and landing on the tarmac, the FAA said.
Most new commercial aircraft and other pilots who were converted into greater heights for the use of Wi-Fi should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Professional Association of professional flight attendants, welcomed the changes.
"If the new regulation is implemented safely, and we are working closely with the airline together in this regard, both sides will benefit from it," Glading said.
We are sincerely sorry, we have to feel like watchdogs on this issue.
However, Internet connections for surfing, exchange of e-mails, text messages or downloading data still banned under three kilometres, explained the authority.
Passengers will be asked to make smart phones, tablets and other devices in the flight mode.
That is still not "Words With Friends," a scrabble extensive online game, which the actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when he had to leave an American Airlines jet high profile, because he refused to shut down the device, while the plane was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices such as laptops must continue to be stored, because there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile phone calls during the flight will also remain banned.
The regulatory competence for telephone calls lies with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not the FAA.
FAA lifts may ban for certain electronic devices during takeoff and landing on
Last month by the Transportation Security Administration, National Transportation Safety Board, Mark Rosenker said, security expert for national transport issues at CBS News, mobile phones were still seen as a risk.
"Mobile is really a problem, not only because they could cause potential problems in navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that the transfer from the air can also disrupt transmission towers," said Rosenker.
An advisory committee of the industry, which was launched by the FAA to investigate this issue, last month recommended that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, increased the pressure on the FAA to loosen restrictions on its use.
Critics such as the Democratic Senator Claire during from Missouri are of the opinion that there is no valid security reasons for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of the devices has become ubiquitous.
In some studies, mentions that up to a third of the passengers forget or ignore the closure of the device.
The FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic devices by air passengers, after reports of disturbances of navigation and communication devices by means of passengers unlocks FM radios were known at the time were the latest technology trends.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA that electronic interference account for nothing.
Airline passengers for several years already offer Wi-Fi, if the altitude is reached.
The flyer adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more insensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the increased use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices are generally much less radio radiation than previous generations.
E-reader, for example, give only minimal radiation, if one umbl√§ttert.
But when they download data or send the transfer values are stronger.
One of the advocates of an easing of restrictions on use of the devices by passengers Amazon.com.
2011 invited firm employees a passenger plane full of kindle e-reader and made a test flight to determine problems, but could not say.
Members of the FAA advisory committee expressed mixed feelings, with regard to the risk in the use of devices.
Douglas Kidd of the passenger Association National Association of Airline Passengers said that he is of the view that the disruption of the devices is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other committee members said that there were only scattered reports of pilots who spoke for a disruption of aircraft systems by the devices, and most of them are very old.
The committee recommended the FAA, however, allow pilots to order the closure of the devices by the passengers in instrument landing under poor visibility conditions.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described it as a sensible adjustment for travelers who today would comprehensively equipped with technology.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not in contradiction to safety," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
