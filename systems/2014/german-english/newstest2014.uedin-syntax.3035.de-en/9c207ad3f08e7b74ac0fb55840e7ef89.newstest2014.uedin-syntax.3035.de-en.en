Jumbo manufacturers contend in the face of large orders on seat width
It is between leading aircraft manufacturers have come to a dispute about the width of seats in economy class on long-haul flights, which sets the tone for a bitter clash at the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute revolves around the seat width, the passengers on long flights will be offered in the tourist class - not always the ones that airlines are the most, but this proven space is the key to the efficiency claims in the latest aircraft from Boeing Co. and Airbus SAS.
Airbus claimed this week an industry standard, which requires a minimum seat width of 46 centimeters (18 inches) in the tourist class, but the US Erzrivale Boeing says that the airlines should decide.
The dispute comes at a time when the aircraft builder vying to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-haul flights, and in the event of 17 to 21 November expect record orders.
As the rear part of the aircraft is structured - in particular, whether there are rows with nine or ten seats, is crucial to the economic results, which should provide the new "mini-jumbo" design.
Boeing claims that its modernized "777X" shall be 406 people in seats in economy class, which are more than 17 inches wide and so allow ten per line.
Airbus said, the competing version of the A350 car 350 people in 18-inch wide seats in economy class, and there are nine per line.
Aircraft giants share often blows on technical details by means of advertising in the trade press.
Now, Airbus before the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X with more than 100 orders is expected to make the race, appeals directly to the public.
The company recently placed an ad, which could be the start of a new ad war and donors showed a picture, in which three people squeezed sitting in a restaurant, and the title: "Would you accept that?"
"Boeing is proposing long-haul flights in seats, which are narrower than regional turbo-prop aircraft," said Airbus sales chief John Leahy.
In the face of changed eating habits are the people thicker, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined the modern long-haul travel, and the end of the century, the weight of the average American male between the ages of 40 and 49 has increased by 10 percent, according to the data of the US health ministry.
The Taillenumfang of the male average American in the 21st century, according to US health statistics 100.8 cm.
Airbus says that his rival would take a seat concept from the 1950s, when the average body was the scope of the newly baptized "Jet Set" narrow.
We have, as Airbus, the analysis showed that an additional inch (2.54 cm) per seat is lowering the quality of sleep by 53 percent.
Boeing disputes the figures to the headquarters of Airbus moderation and says that it is not at the discretion of the manufacturers to decide the balance between air fares, as airlines and interior design.
The company also said, according to research from the experience depends on the plane over the seat width.
"It is really important, airlines to provide flexibility, so that they can do this, what they have in their view, in order to be successful," explains the flight cabin expert Kent Craver of Boeing.
They do not want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, it is more elbow freedom, but for manufacturers, it is increasingly an issue that can affect sales.
Behind the dispute is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $700 billion at list prices in the coming decades, which could have a lasting effect on the export performance of the US or Europe.
As Reuters reported in July for the first time, the seat layout is the driving force behind the debate about the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing say 20 percent more efficiency per seat in its latest two-engine long-haul designs as the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER.
Boeing's statements on the results depend, in part, for the 777X is compared with its ten seats per series with the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased cost per unit are still lower than currently used machines with ten seats per line.
"Boeing squeezes therefore more seats in his plane to make it more competitive for our products," says Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort in the European Airbus.
On the other hand, say analysts, full cabins with ten seats per row with existing feature indicated that many passengers opted for the closer arrangement, which could go hand in hand with cheaper air fares.
"Eighteen-inch seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from an economic point of view, the Airbus offer controlled by the threat of the 777," said Mary Kirby, an expert for cabin no direction, founder and editor of runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing offer no seats, but a catalogue of suppliers, from which the airlines can choose.
The passenger jet salesman world have even tape measure in itself, in order to give the establishment in the competition.
Even if they advertise the comfort, but all manufacturers also offer jets with hochverdichteter design for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers a ten-seat A350 series, but has not yet sold, according to his own words.
Until recently, Airbus has stressed how important is more adaptability of cabins and offered for some jets wide seats in the corridors.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the call for a new industry standard will probably fizzle, but could distract from the wave of 777X-sales.
