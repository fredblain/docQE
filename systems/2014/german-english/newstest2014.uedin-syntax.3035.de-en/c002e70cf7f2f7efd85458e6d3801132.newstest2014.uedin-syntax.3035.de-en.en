Parents of inter-sexual children can choose "gender vague."
Germany is the first European nation, in which a third gender is recognised for children who were born with ambiguous genitals.
Newborn will no longer rigidly assigned to male or female.
Under the new law, parents must declare no more sex for such children, but can specify "vague" or "no limit" on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to take the pressure from parents, so that they do not have to make hasty decisions in terms of operations for a gender assignment in newborns, and to fight against the discrimination of inter-sexual people.
An inter-sexual person said according to the BBC years later: "I am neither man nor woman."
I stand by the patchwork, which was created by doctors, mutilated and full of scars.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children each year is not a boy or a girl to the world.
They belong to the inter-sexual, a group that fall under the diagnosis of "sexual differentiation disturbance" (DSD), an umbrella term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovary or testis) or unusually developed genitals.
Wallis Simpson was possibly Inter sexually.
The understanding of the gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts advise to do so in the United States, you should use the best available information on gender assignment, if a provision is not possible, and not wait for the psychological and physical development of the child, before you decide - if at all - for an operation.
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the issue of gender identification, said that the new German law "it for a good cause."
Inter-sexual children represent an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have life-threatening diseases that require a surgical operation, but for most children are not," he said.
We can make a gender assignment without surgery, and then to see how to develop the identity.
The scientific data about how a child ever developed its gender identity are not very accurate.
No one knows why it happens.
It is like the mystery of why people are gay.
In a report to the European Commission for the year 2011 states that inter-sexual people are different from transsexual and transgender people, because their status is not gender-related, but due to their biological constitution, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them.
These properties were in for tier sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced the inter-sexual, and transgender people in the workplace, as well as on the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice crime.
Not consistent with the image of gender boys now have a special camp.
It is now possible on official documents indicate male, female or "third sex" for adults in Australia and Nepal.
In June, Australians Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the world's first "gender-free" person, after a court had granted the lifetime maintenance of an "unspecified" gender status.
German cards have a third allocation in the future as well as M and W, X for Inter sexually, so the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighboring France are gender issues still controversial, as a news story on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French Members of the strict Catholic country signed a petition that the "gender theory" should be removed from school books.
The US Catholic Online Web site has also spoken out against the German law, on the grounds that "if the world is dragged into a new state, where the sex is a decision, but not sexual activity, then we twist two other pillars of civilization."
The mother of a newborn from Maryland told baby zone, they think it would be better if babies at birth will be assigned to a sex.
"The parents' life is stressful enough without further restrictions, especially if we do not know the sex of their child," she told the parents' website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children who were born with both male and female sex parts, were described as Hermaphroditen, after the Greek god, who had both sexes.
A decade ago, the medicine viewed the sex as something that could wipe out one and then rebuild.
But in the meantime will be questioned the ethical foundations of an operation that is now known, how complex the gender identity is, and that doctors can also are wrong, because they do not know how the child feels in upbringing with the gender allocated by them.
"In the middle of the 20th century called it a, psychiatric emergency", "Drescher said.
If such a child was born, then, is not a psychiatrist, but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory about the treatment of children with ambiguous genitals goes back to Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who took the view that the sex was malleable.
He coined the term "gender identity" and argued, social and environmental initiatives, as the parents educate a child, interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and characterized as to whether a person see as male or female.
But, in a case known as the "John / Joan" from 1966, his theories were controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis was severed in a botched circumcision, the child not to immobilised them and also to remove his testicles and then pull him as a big girl.
"Money was presented this case as a successful example of a conversion, which he is not," says Drescher.
When the boy was about 15, he moved back to the male sex and married a woman.
With 38 but he committed suicide.
According to the Drescher, there are still physicians who would practice this model.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, are survivors of this sex operations stepped to the public that "are not happy with the result."
Such as Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY-male chromosomes, but ambiguous genitals.
The doctors were not clear about whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a satisfying life as a man.
So were its external body and testicles surgically removed shortly after the birth in 1976 and he was taken as a big girl.
At the age of 12 he received female hormones.
"I knew that I am not a girl," he said on ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he should receive a vaginal plastic.
But because he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he demanded his medical records.
What he found was shocking.
I was sterilized at my birth - and no one has ever said that to me.
Bruce was born with a DSD, could not produce enough testosterone to the development of the genitals through his body.
After he had told the truth, he moved back to the male identity, received testosterone injections and was to remove his breasts.
As a result of the operation, he has become infertile.
Today he fights for others in an organization called Interface Project for sexual people are perceived as normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, managing director of the rights group based in California Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law "to stamp and stigmatize encourage" could.
"Many activists are worried that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and allocate a, not determined" to the child, "she said.
We fear that favours intervention.
We think that it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
But still, we do not know how the law will impact, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organisation support the Australian law because "it gives adults the recognition as a third sex."
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex," she said.
It is the German law on the allocation at birth.
This is not a fight, and we should force small children at this time.
When they grow up, they can decide on their bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast radio login from Pitt Castle, who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and hundreds of others in a self-help group supports, says that the German law "authorize" both parents and children.
Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete Androgenresistenz.
The goal because of faulty receptor cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
It has a vagina, but no uterus and ovaries.
Today is Katie 29 and married; she works as an assistant in the child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
While she is infertile, hopes, however, to be able to get a child through adoption or a surrogate mother.
"The law gives parents room, so they do not have to make hasty decisions," Baratz said.
It gives them the time to make various tests and to clarify things and gives them time before they write "male" or "female".
In this way, everything is fine - one draws the child in size and loves it.
It has a wonderful baby and enjoys the parental happiness.
And we must not rush to carry out an operation that cannot be undone.
"That includes the children in the decision with a and removed the fear that parents concerned about, because they are of the opinion that they would not do the right thing," she explained.
Ultimately decides the child on the sex that better suits him - and this is wonderful.
That children will be able to make the decision himself.
