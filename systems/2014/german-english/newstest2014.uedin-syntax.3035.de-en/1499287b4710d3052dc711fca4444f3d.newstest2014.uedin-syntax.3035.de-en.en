Dr. Georges Bwelle "is one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2013."
You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in the Top 10, in order to elect him to "CNN Hero of the Year".
The winner receives $250,000 to continue his exceptional work.
For 21 years looked at Georges Bwelle with, as his sick father repeatedly lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals, which do not have the means at their disposal to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon, in 1981.
First he had a broken arm, but then formed an inflammation, which is expanding on his brain and caused a Hämatom there that should affect him for the rest of his life.
"There was no neuro-surgeon in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
If we had the money, we would have released him from Cameroon.
Instead spent Bwelle years in order to accompany his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals, in order to get the treatment, which they had to offer.
"It is not easy," Bwelle commented.
You can leave the house at five o'clock in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, and it is not first.
There are a great many patients.
Indeed, some people die because they have to wait.
The situation has changed little since Bwelles's father died in 2002.
There is only one doctor for every 5,000 people in Cameroon, according to the World Health Organization.
On the other hand, the ratio in the United States lies with a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there were a doctor for them, most Cameroonians could not afford the visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of health spending in the country are private.
"The only problem they have is the poverty," says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
His father and to see so many of his compatriots are suffering caused in Bwelle mature the decision to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his voluntary team have carried out 700 free operations last year.
He was himself a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon in the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
In addition, he founded a non-profit organization called ASCO Vime who travels on weekends in rural areas and offering free medical care there.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday force he and up to 30 people in minibuses and drive with the verschnürten medical equipment on the roof on unbefestigtes terrain in the villages that need help.
Not always, everything runs smoothly.
More than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they will be greeted as heroes: A feast, singing and dancing and the best accommodation that the place has to offer.
Free medical care is really a cause for celebration in these villages and Bwelle, with his broad smile and his boundless energy, is to present at the joyful celebration.
The next morning the team then begins with the investigation of hundreds of patients.
"We treat 500 people per trip," so Bwelle.
They come from a 60-kilometre radius around the village on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Other given crutches, donated glasses or free birth certificates, a document that is required for the school, but many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, leads the team from simple operations with local anaesthetic.
The operations are usually held in a school, the town hall or a flat; after the procedure, the patient on and go in the recreation area, in order to make room for the next person.
The lighting for the op and disinfection equipment is powered by a generator of the group and so Bwelle and his volunteer work until the early hours on Sunday.
It is an arduous amount, but the village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated.
"They drum throughout the night, so that we can stay awake and continue our work," says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team then back in the city, tired but proud of the work he has done.
The group - a mixture of Cameroon doctors and medical students abroad - has 700 free operations last year and know that it makes a huge difference for people with their work, which helps them.
A man explained that the free operation of a side RAEC Mons, which he received, he will now have to work again.
"It changed the future of my family," the man said.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital works Bwelle even at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job by 60% of his charitable activity, so Bwelle; the rest come from private donations.
"I really do not know when he sleeps," Katie O'Malley says that in the second year at Drexel University in Philadelphia studied medicine and voluntarily in Bwelles group participates.
He is always either in the hospital or tried to raise money for the organization, so that he can go to these campaigns.
As O'Malley for medical and nursing students who come from the United States and Europe and Bwelle support, this is a chance to gain practical experience that they would never get at home.
"We can be in operations, where we help keep blood abzutupfen or the instruments for Dr. Bwelle," O'Malley said.
That would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
The students pay their trip to Cameroon normally itself and bring often donated medical equipment.
They are, however, only once in Yaoundé, Bwelle assumes the accommodation, transportation and guide.
"He is without a doubt a hero," says O'Malley.
He devotes his life of this organisation and his desire to help the people in Cameroon, knows no bounds.
The almost constant work is no burden for Bwelle.
To help others to a more fortunate life and to fulfill a promise that he has given his father, gives him great pleasure.
"I am so happy when I make this work," says Bwelle.
And I am thinking of my father.
I hope he sees what I do.
I do it, in order to bring people back to the laughter and to relieve the pain.
