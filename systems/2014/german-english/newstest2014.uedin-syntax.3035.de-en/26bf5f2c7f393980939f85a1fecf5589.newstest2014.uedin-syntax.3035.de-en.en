Supreme Court confirmed Obama's health law
It is a great victory for the Obama administration: The US Supreme Court ruled today that the closely associated with Barack Obama health law is constitutional.
By five votes to four, the judges ruled that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, it is forcing US citizens to complete a health insurance by 2014 or pay a penalty, is constitutional under the tax authority of the state.
The chief judge John Roberts fought on the side of the four more liberal members of the chamber, while the judge Warren, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy decided against it.
The court also upheld the remaining sections of the 2700 page law and also took the view that the imposition of the health law that states would either have to broaden the access requirements for Medicaid or otherwise removed all state Medicaid funding, is not unconstitutional restrictive.
The lawsuit against the law had been brought by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law had been firmly rejected by all the leading Republican presidential candidates, including the eventual challenger Mitt Romney, in the pre-election battle in 2012.
