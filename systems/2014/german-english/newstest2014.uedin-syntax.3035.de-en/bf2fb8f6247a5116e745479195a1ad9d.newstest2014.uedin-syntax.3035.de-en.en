U.S. border: "Super-tunnel" for drug smuggling, discovered
On the border between Mexico and the United States, investigators have discovered a "super tunnel" for drug smuggling and shut down.
As the US Customs told, the more than 500 meters long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, railway tracks and a ventilation system.
Three suspects have been arrested so, eight tons of marijuana, and seized nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine.
The tunnel, according to the data has not yet been taken into use.
"These cartels are stupid if they think they could by digging under the radar," said the prosecutor-general of the U.S. District of Southern California, Laura Duffy, at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego, where one end of the tunnel had been discovered.
Written to the drug gangs assured Duffy: "If you continue to build such tunnels and tried to use it, we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money."
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a long-term fight against the drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77 000 people in connection with the drug crime were killed in Mexico.
Designed by experts
Because of the expensive equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it was designed by architects and engineers, and that the construction took about a year to complete.
The railway track was so equipped that could be used in electric-powered cars.
On the Mexican side is the access in a building, which is 80 meters away from the border.
According to authorities, a ladder leads 20 meters in depth to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters in height and 90 centimeters in width.
He would have been suitable with it in order to encourage illegal immigration to the United States.
Two of the suspects have been arrested in connection with the cocaine-Fund.
The third party, a Mexican, was taken as a result of marijuana confiscated.
All three face a maximum sentence of life-long imprisonment, as officials said.
Since 2006 were eight such tunnels have been discovered, said at the press conference in San Diego.
But it is the first time that cocaine was found in such a slump.
Usually, cocaine smuggled in small quantities and not through tunnels.
This shows the "desperation" of the drug gangs, whose traditional routes are now cut off, said Bill Sherman of the DEA drug investigation in San Diego.
They would do everything to get to the United States.
No details have been announced to the detainees, at least one is Mexicans, they said.
They must reckon with prison sentences of up to 10 years.
