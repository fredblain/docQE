Kindergarten has found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands," says Winterlingens Mayor Michael Maier.
The former kindergarten in the garden road, the local authority has sold to a private individual.
The sale agreed to the council in its most recent meeting in the non-public part.
The building, its owner moved to a "reasonable" price.
"The community is happy," Maier said.
EUR 100 000 were scheduled in the budget.
Yet it is not clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten.
The mayor is right that the responsibility for the building before the winter winter collapse has handed over to someone else, and therefore no longer has to pay for the entertainment of the house, how to heat, looking after the garden and to clear the sidewalk.
"This effort is now gone," Maier is pleased.
