Glitzy Piepsen disturbs residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily on land.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships to the dump.
The company has several irons in the fire at the site.
In addition to the coal import, Rhenus Midgard sets, among other things, on wind plant logistics.
Black shimmer coal on the storage space in front of the dam.
Two enormous blue Haldensch√ºtt- and return chargers distribute or loaded coal here on demand.
In every movement of the handling equipment sounds a shrill warning noise over the terrain.
"The signals are used in the health and safety are required by law," says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of the Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
When the wind unfavorably is unfortunately widely to hear - and so there was already some complaints of people from the city north.
He take the complaints very seriously and have therefore in contact with the victims, says the 40-year-old.
In close consultation with the authorities, it is now in the process of keeping the warning signs with technical measures quieter.
In the future, he put on the open dialogue with its neighbours.
Because Matthias Schrell still has a lot in front at the site.
With the expansion of Lower Saxons bridge, Rhenus Midgard remain on the import of coal for power stations and is one of the Great in this sector in Europe.
Thanks to 18.5 meters deeper bath for a long time, the terminal will be cleared Cape-size bulk carrier here.
"This year we want to crack the 3-million-ton mark the envelope," says Schrell.
In addition to the local Eon-power plant is the import coal to power plants in the interior of the country.
If the GDF-Suez-power plant will still go to the net, some 5 million tons of coal imports per year are realistic.
The three ship-loaders on the bridge, as well as the second conveyor belt could create up to 10 million.
