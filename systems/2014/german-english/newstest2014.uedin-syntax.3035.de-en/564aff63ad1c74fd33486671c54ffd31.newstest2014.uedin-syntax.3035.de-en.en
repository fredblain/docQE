Serious injuries after clashes
Early Friday afternoon, on a country road close to 44 Revensdorf two drivers have been seriously injured in a head-on collision.
The police closed the road immediately completely, but could not say the accident at first.
However, if there were a number of witnesses, which should only be evaluated.
It is clear that the 19-year-old driving a VW Golf in direction Revensdorf drove and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf came forward to her with his trophy.
The two vehicles collided together, while the woman was wedged so hard that the fire brigade needed just under half an hour to free them from the car wreck.
The real cause remained unclear.
Both themes came to nearby hospitals.
The track remained fully closed for about two hours.
