Tourism: Descent to the Romans
Around 120 metres below Cologne received a sewage canal from the Roman era.
Anyone who visits Cologne, the cathedral is not over.
Some 157 meters stand the two towers in the sky and make it to the second-highest church building in Europe.
But only a few visitors who see the filigree two church towers, suspect that there is a lot to discover even under the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in the Cologne underworld.
Meeting point for his tours, the service center of Cologne-tourism in front of the cathedral.
The tour begins very unspectacular: "We start in the underground garage," says Schulze.
In the 1970s, the city fathers wanted a car-oriented city, and therefore remained from the remains of the ancient city wall only that stand, which was not too large.
Most users of the Park House rush past the Roman remains so today, just ask your car.
But if you look more closely, discovered in the parking deck D2 a separated by metal mesh rods archaeological site.
On display are about five meters high ruins from palms large stones.
"There are remains of the Roman city wall, which was built in the second half of the first century after Christ," says Schulze.
Before it comes back to the surface, the participants on the upper level was still take a look into a dark, 15 meters deep shaft.
This is the fountain of the old cathedral, which, unfortunately, is also hardly noticed.
Next stop of the tour is the Pretorian, and here the participants get back down into the depths.
Here we see the official residence of the once powerful man north of the Alps, the pre-gate of the CCAA.
What CCAA means, a visitor would like to know.
"The acronym stands for" Colonia Claudia Ara Aggripinensium, "which was" city of Roman law and the Agrippinenser city, in plain English, under Emperor Claudius at the site of the altar for the emperor worship "means."
And the Pretorian Palace is the former proconsul, the centre of power of the Roman empire on the Rhine.
A tunnel leading from the foyer of the exhibition is getting access to the Roman sewer, which is at around 120 metres.
"You can go quietly along a stretch along the so-called Cloaca maxima, if you want," encouraging Schulze guests on.
Schulze yet has a surprise.
After he has brought the key at the box office, he leads the group to a 16-metre-deep, walk-shaft.
"We are now in the mikvah, a ritual Jewish bath," he says.
The Jewish community built their bathroom deep into the ground, in order to get to the groundwater, which was essential for the Songkran.
Until today are in the lower end of the mikvah, whose origins date back to the eighth century, different water levels by varying levels of the Rhine legible.
The mikvah is part of an archaeological area on the Town Hall Square for which the construction work would begin in the near future.
Until the completion are but a few more years.
