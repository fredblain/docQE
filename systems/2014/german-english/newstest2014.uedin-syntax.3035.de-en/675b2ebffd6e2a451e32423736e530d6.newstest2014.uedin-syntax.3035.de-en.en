Pawnshops boom in Singapore, as the crisis has arrived in the middle class
In a pawn shop in the shopping centre Bendemeer in Singapore trades Janani Amir from Inga a golden thank, a ring and a pair of earrings in order to be able to pay the school fees of their daughters.
"My husband and I have just bought a house, as is all my money in it," says Amir (Inga.
Although they earn 3,000 Singapore dollars (CA 1.730 euros) every month as a government worker and her husband also work, rich in the monthly family income, they explained.
Indeed, demand in parts of South-East Asia - where the debt of households is increasing - is so large that ValueMax, where they made their exchange, this week became the third deposit house, which is listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
The pledge of jewelry is not only a faster way to get money - 1,300 Singapore dollars, as well as in the case of Janani Amir (Inga - nearly as cheap as an unsecured bank loans.
Typically require pawnshops in Singapore an effective annual interest rate of 17 percent, which is only just above the 15.4 percent, which requires the United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping mall.
Pawnshops offer but the advantage, that does not require proof of income or review of the credit rating, and loans faster than banks are possible.
For this reason turn millions of people in the region to pawnshops, after families feel the pressure by rising living costs, as well as a growing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit due to a loose monetary policy in developed economies are looking for families with low and medium incomes pawnshops on, in order to compensate for the difference in stotternder economy.
This week, the credit rating agency Standard & Poor's growing household debt, mainly by rising mortgage, as a risk factor for the credit worthiness of Asian banks.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore, according to the agency's highest household debt relative to gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia is still in 2008 with 80 percent of GDP at the top of the list, an increase of 60 percent.
Economists also worry because of the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week has just emerged from a technical recession.
On Thursday, the data showed a continuing export weakness and a weakening of consumer demand.
"In the end, it means that faced with rising costs of the people in the middle and lower segment (of the income scale) will try to supplement their income, wherever it is possible," said Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historic levels in gold prices in the past two years have reinforced the trend for pledging personal items, as the people have the opportunity to turn the family jewelry into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the pledged items are pawn shops of the city-state of gold in the 200.
The people say: "The price of gold looks good, let us pledge Grandmother's gold chain and bring back next month."
The largest Thai pawn shop operator, easy money, has seen a 20% customer growth in the last few months in its stores.
The growth in the mortgage business is so strong that ValueMax, operator of the branch in Bendemeer and 15 other wants to expand in Singapore, not only in the neighboring Malaysia, where the company operates four houses, but also outside Asia, Lee Ching yeah, Managing Director of ValueMax.
The company financed that to 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollars that it took this week with the IPO in Singapore.
While some lenders because of high interest rates were caught in the crossfire, said Yeah that pawnshops not only lower interest rates than other lenders would not directly, but also the debt increased.
"Customers a loan items that they already have, and that liquefy personal valuables do not increase the budget training," she explained.
The mortgage loan business, society is increasingly accepted as a short-term secured funding.
Also, not all people who use pawn shop, are in financial difficulties.
Rich people come from Singapore also in the branches of ValueMax to mortgage gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Customers come to us from every social class.
"These include the wealthy, something in the short term for a business or an investment loan, or small businesses, have to bridge the bottlenecks in the cash-flow," says Mitch.
Sometimes they need just money very quickly.
