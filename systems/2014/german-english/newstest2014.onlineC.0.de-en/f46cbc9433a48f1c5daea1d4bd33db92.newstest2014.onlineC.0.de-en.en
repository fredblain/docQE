Local council is happy about solid household
Always if it concerns in local council sessions the household, mayor Ralph Gerster has laugh well.
The Gemeindesäckl in stove cheeks Schönach is filled well and has known guilt the administration already since 2005 no longer.
Also that fiscal years 2012 can be booked in this sense as a full success.
This became in the presentation of the year calculation for 2012 clear.
How Andrea Rothmund clarified, the administration household with approximately 7.6 Million Euro more highly had fallen out than planned over a million Euro.
Also the excess of the administration household lies with about 1.8 million Euro round a million Euro over the extension.
To owe would be the excess above all higher business tax collections and the community share at the income tax.
Also the fortune household lay again clearly over the planned values.
Instead of the planned 1.5 million Euro, it amounted to 2.5 million Euro in the past year.
"This lies essentially at the higher conveyance out of the administration household", so Rothmund.
Because in the fiscal year 2012 less investments were handled than planned, also the reserve conveyance more highly fell out.
Altogether the general reserve could be increased around approximately 2.1 Million Euro on now altogether 4.9 million Euro.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and its team for the good work.
"Such a work shakes one not simply out of the sleeve", praised Gerster with view of the year calculation.
It and the local councils were happy evidently about the good numbers.
It paradoxically likes to sound, but exactly these good numbers the citizens could come to stand soon expensively.
Through the good financial state, the community in the past was able to forgo high assessments rates.
Through it again subsidies had been shortened however according to Gerster already often by the country.
For these subsidies out of various balance canes, there are prerequisites.
Among other things the cities and communities that apply for subsidies must, certain assessments rates share.
"The subject of assessments rates must we us regard, because in the coming years investments stand, for that we gladly subsidies would have", gave notice Gerster in this context on.
