That newly formed shines Opschlag with a new cafe.
One that invites for lingering and coming back.
One that would like to make the name to the program.
As Déjà Vu, one designates according to lexicon a psychological phenomenon that expresses itself in the feeling to have experiences or seen a new situation already once.
In the case the visit of the of the same name café at the Opschlag in the district capital Kleve in visibility expanse to the university Rhine Waal, it doesn't have to remain in the pure Déjà Vu feeling.
In the end the café with the beautiful name has exactly that as a goal: to make an actual stay not only intellectual, but rather strongly always recurring tangibly.
Because it is fun just and is simply beautiful.
A view into the thoughts and feelings at the Opschlag 8 gives the spectator on attempt a good feeling.
The ultra-modern, but not cool café ambience looks like a place to the Wohlfühlen.
Here the team with the founders Mirjam van of the Stelt and Daniel Büttner pampers at the tip the guest with most varied coffee variants or cocktail variants.
In addition there are precious cake or individually covered fresh Baguettes.
The proprietors, both 33 years old, made itself already before the opening of the jewelry café at the Opschlag as gastronomers a name: In crane castle, they led the "type Lounge".
Of the move after Kleve at the Opschlag, the sympathetic café lovers hope for themselves more audience.
Not finally also through the university.
"Where we no certain target group have", emphasizes Daniel Büttner.
Rather would like to address both student young here just as like seniors and all age-groups in between.
Apropos café lover.
The sympathetic proprietor couple stands behind the coffee enjoyment.
The smelling hot brew in the most varied variations themselves enjoys.
Expressofan
Daniel Büttner is sooner the Expresso fan and Mirjam van of the Stelt the cappuccino drinker.
"In addition a Baguette - that is my thing", betrays it the NRZ.
There were two Events also already in the bright café.
Better said one.
For the harbor festival found sooner outside instead of - the café Déjà Vu profited not therefrom.
But there was also the Ringelnatzabend.
"Beautifully, successfully and witty", found both 33-Jährigen.
But just not everyone man thing.
Perhaps Daniel Büttner is also therefore no outspoken fan of Event evening: "One cannot make" it now once all right.
And with an Event, I address always only that, that are interested also in the special Event.
Therefore Events will be sooner the exception here.
"We would like to disturb" the entirely normal business so few how possible.
Should be named: Déjà Vu stands also for dependability.
With regard to the quality of the products, that are offered here just as, like on the team and the beautiful environment at the Opschlag in Kleve.
The street that develops more and more to a gastronomy mile.
To the joy of many Klever, that guests from far and wide and the students who discover the Gastromeile and therewith also the café Déjà Vu for itself.
