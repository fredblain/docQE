The new fee applies are to carry-on luggage in the baggage specialty over the seat, small pockets further free under the seat.
Frontier explained, calculate 25 U.S. dollars if the fee would be paid in advance, and 100 U.S. dollars with traveler, who paid first at the gate.
Frontier speaker Kate O' Malley said to move the fee of 100 U.S. dollars would aim on that off, traveler, to attend in the forefield to the payment.
"We would want this sum do not calculate", explained it.
Airlines began 2008 therewith to demand fees for the first and second abandoned baggage piece.
Passengers that tried to go around this, so much plugged therefore like possible into the carry-on luggage, what has as a consequence, that the baggage specialties frequently is overfilled over the seat.
Fees are a possibility to move passengers in addition, to take fewer with on board.
O' Malley said, would go in the new fee it not really therefore to earn money.
It concerns the most faithful customers of Frontier, who would have expressed clearly, that it would become more heavily and more heavily to find place in the specialty over the seat.
Passengers, that buy your tickets on the websites of the airline, don't have to pay.
That means that a passenger may bring a baggage piece at the gate of Frontier under circumstances free of charge, that next person must pay however 100 dollars for a comparable baggage piece.
O' Malley explained, that changed would become website of Frontier and the Check-in-procedure, so that the passengers would be informed about the fee, before they would come to the gate.
The new carry-on luggage fee of Frontier steps not until the summer effective, gives an exact date it not yet.
Passengers scold frequently over baggage extra charges and other fees, but airlines grasp gladly on that back.
They argue that the carrier of the baggage money would cost and passengers should pay these services, if they wished it.
Many at the Wall Street regard the new baggage fees as a sign that the airline enough money take in in order to cover after years the losses the costs of flight trips.
That let until now however the fingers of fees for carry-on luggage.
Spirit airline inc. demanded three years ago as the first fees for carry-on luggage and later followed Allegiant Air, also a no-frills airline.
Let the only other airline with such a fee be the Hungarian Wizz Air, explained the airline adviser Jay Sorensen that the addition fees pursues attentively.
It appreciated in a report from December 2011 that the carry-on luggage fee Spirit would bring in annually 50 million US dollar.

I expected, ZÃ¤hneknirschen and hand grasp would laugh to see discussions at the gate.
"The airplane was full", declared it, "and the Boarding ran how greased".
Frontier follows Spirit also in the 2 dollar, that are demanded for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The business explained that passengers that bought lemonade or juice, that would be allowed to retain entire can and would be filled coffee free.
Water is further free.
US Airways had tried 2008 short-term to demand for refreshment drinks money, made this however seven months later again annulled after passengers had burdened themselves and no other large company was done likewise.
Frontiers step to raise fees for the carry-on luggage if passengers do not buy directly in the airline, is the youngest initiative, with which customers on the own websites directed will should.
Airlines pay Online travel agencies such as Orbitz 10 to 25 U.S. dollars per sold ticket.
That delivers a stimulus to move passengers to the direct purchase with them instead of over an Online travel agency to all companies.
Frontier went in this area to be sure furthest.
In September the business began therewith to forgive only half so many much flyer miles in entry over an Online travel agency.
On Wednesday the miles were shortened once again to 25 percent the flight stretch.
A flight trip booked in a third-party provider with Frontier over 1000 miles brings in customers therefore only 250 miles.
Passengers can reserve also exclusively in the direct purchase on the websites of Frontier places.
Frontier controls a faithful regular clientele at its seat in Denver, but the business shrinks and loses the business money.
The proceeds returned around 9 percent and the flight capacity shrank nearly 13 percent in the first quarter how in the finance report to read is, that was published on Wednesday by the mother group, Republic Airways holding inc.
Republic tried to got the finances of Frontier in the frame of the sale of the company into the handle.
