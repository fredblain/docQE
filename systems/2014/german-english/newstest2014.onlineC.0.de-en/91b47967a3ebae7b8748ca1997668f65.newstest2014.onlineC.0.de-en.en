FAA: Passengers can use now electronic devices in airplanes (however no mobile phone conversations lead)
Flight travelers can hear now its electronic devices from the take-off to the landing for reading, works, games, music and can use the appearance of films, telephone not however with the mobile phone, so the new guidelines that were published on Thursday by the Federal Aviation administration (FAA) in the USA.
Yet the passengers should not expect that these changes are transferred immediately.
How quickly they would implement, would depend on the respective airline, explained FAA colleague Michael Huerta on a press conference.
The airlines must prove the FAA that airplanes correspond to the new guidelines and that they updated the training handbooks of the flight personnel as well as the regulations for the stowing of the devices corresponding to the new directions.
The FAA explained, it had received already of some airlines plans, that would like to expand the use of portable electronic devices in airplanes.
Under these airlines, also delta and JetBlue were.
"According to condition of the plan could we the expanded utilization of electronic devices very soon approve", announced the FAA in an announcement.
Presently passengers must disengage Smartphones, Tablets and other devices if the airplane doors are closed.
They may start it first then again if the airplane reached a height of three kilometers and the captain gives green light.
In the entrance in the country approach, the passengers must disengage it again and may start it not again before the airplane landed.
After the new guidelines, airlines, whose airplanes against electronic interferences would be certain, could to use its passengers permit, the devices also in start, landing and on the roll field, explained the FAA.
Most new traffic airplanes and other flyers, who were converted for the use by Wi Fi in larger heights, should correspond to the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the occupation association of professional flight companion, welcomed the changes.
"If the new regulation certainly transferred is – and we work relating to this closely with the airline together –, become both side therefrom profit", commented on Glading.
We honestly are said it sorrow to have to feel at this subject such as overseer.
Nevertheless Internet connections for surfing, exchanges of e-mails, text messages or downloading of data remained forbidden under three kilometers further, clarified the authority.
Passengers are requested, Smartphones to transfer Tablets and other devices in the flight mode.
Therefore still no "Word With Friends", that Scrabble resembling Online game, that the actor Alec Baldwin 2011 played on its Smartphone, when he had to leave public effective a jet of American airlines, because he refused to disengage the device while the airplane was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices such as laptops must be stowed also further because here an injury danger exists, if they fly by the cabin.
Mobile phone conversations during the flight remain forbidden also further.
The regulation competence for telephone conversations is not about the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), in the FAA.
FAA cancels possibly ban for certain electronic devices in start and landing
Mark Rosenker of the traffic security authority said last month nationally Transportation Safety Board, security expert for national traffic questions on CBS News, mobile phones would be regarded yet always as a risk.
"Mobile phone are actual a problem, not only because it potentially interferences in navigation devices cause could, but rather because we of the FCC know, that the transmission out of the air also envoy mast disturb can", so Rosenker.
A consultation committee of the industry, that was called by the FAA to the investigation of this subject into life, recommended last month that the government would permit a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In the last years, the pressure increased to the FAA to relax restrictions for the use.
Critic such as the democratic senator Claire McCaskill out of Missouri represent would be the view, there no valid safety reasons for the ban.
The restrictions are to be put through also increasingly more heavily because the utilization of the devices became omnipresent.
In some studies, the speech, that forgets or ignores to one-third of the passengers the disengaging of the device, is therefrom.
The FAA began 1966 to restrict the utilization of electronic devices through flight traveler after reports had become on interferences of navigations and communication devices through UKW radios carried by passengers well known, that at that time the newest technology trend represented.
New airplanes are by far more dependent on electric systems as earlier generations of aircrafts, but they are constructed also so and approves by the FAA that them electronic Interferenzen settle nothing.
Airlines have offered already for some years Wi Fi to passengers if the altitude is reached.
The flyers adapted at Wi-Fi-systems are also more insensible vis-à-vis Interferenzen.
The predominant majority of the passenger airplanes should be suited for the stronger use of electronic devices after the new guidelines, said Huerta.
The current electronic devices give in general substantially less radio radiation from than earlier generations.
E Reader for example deliver only minimal radiation if one turns over.
Yet in the downloading or sending of data, the transmission values are stronger.
To the advocates of a loosening of the restrictions for the device utilization through passengers, Amazon. com counts.
2011 loaded firm colleague of Kindle E Reader full a passenger airplane and made a test flight in order to determine problems, were able to assess however none.
Members of the FAA consultation committee expressed mixed feelings what concerns the risk in regards to the utilization of devices.
Douglas Kidd of the passenger association nationally Association of airline Passengers said would be would be, it the view, the interference through the devices real, also if the risk would be minimal.
Other committee members said, there would be would be only isolated reports of pilots, that would speak for an interference about airplane systems through the devices, and that therefrom very old.
The committee recommended the FAA to be sure to permit it pilots, to arrange the disengaging of the devices in instrument landing under bad visibility ratios through the passengers.
A grouping out of the trip industry welcomed the changes and designated it as a sensible adaptation for traveler, who would be equipped today extensively with technology.
"We please us, that the FAA recognizes, that a comfortable passenger experience not in the contradiction to the security stands", said Roger Dow, CEO of that Travel Association U.S.
