It was whistled offered itself an unaccustomed, almost already ghostly acoustics, that until shortly before that at the national league game between the German vice master Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the signal Iduna park to the spectator.
To hear were the guest fans with its songs predominantly.
The south platform on the other hand where the most faithful of the faithful - and loudest - BVB fans stand, presented itself first of all extraordinarily quietly: No songs, no battle calls.
The podium of the Capo that otherwise the joint Anfeuerung coordinates remained unoccupied.
And in front on the platform, a large flag with inscription "section stadium ban" blew solitarily.
Only as goalkeeper novel meadow fur such as always as the first BVB player the place entered, surged short-term jubilation up.
When its team colleagues followed, there were loud song and blowing scarves - however by far everywhere.
In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the south platform, did nothing move.
Also that stadium speaker Norbert Dickel itemized once again the positive experiences of the last days - Derbysieg, victory over arsenal, contract extension of trainer JÃ¼rgen Klopp -, did not provide for celebration mood.
