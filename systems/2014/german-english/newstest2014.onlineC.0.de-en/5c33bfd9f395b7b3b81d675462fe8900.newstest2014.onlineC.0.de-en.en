Scientists were able to throw more light on that, in which context stands that tail fronds of a dog with its mood.
Earlier researches had shown that happy dogs with the tail was more to the right wedelten (from the viewpoint of the dog), while it with nervous dogs the left side.
Yet now scientists say that other dogs can perceive these subtle differences and can react on that.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist of the university Trient, said: "in humans is well well known, that the left and right side of the brain differently on stimuli react, the positive or negative emotion evoke".
Here we tried to look at this in other species.
It noted moreover that with dogs exactly like in humans the right side of the brain for the movement of the left side responsibly would be and reversed, and that both hemispheres different rolls played in the feelings.
In order to learn more about that how dogs react to the tail fronds lateral of its members of the same species, supervised the researchers the animals while these films of other dogs looked at.
They measured the heart frequency of the quadrupeds and analyzed the behavior.
Probably we will understand soon why the tail moves once in the one, once into the other direction
Professor Vallortigara said: "we have the dogs films with dogs shown – either a nature loyal version or a silhouette, around distracting other aspects to eliminate, and we could therewith the movement of the tail more to the left or to the right drive".
If the animals saw, like an otherwise inexpressive dog the tail to the right moved has (of the perspective of the wedelnden dog out of seen), remained relaxes it totally.
The tail inclination was however especially to the left (again out of perspective of the dog, the wedelt), its heart frequency and it got out saw restlessly.
In the opinion of professor Vallortigara the dogs do not communicate intentionally together through these movements.
It is not convinced rather that the dogs would have learned from experience, in which movements they should worry, and when.
It said: "if one different encounters with other dogs has and that fronds with the tail into a direction sooner with friendly behavior connects is and the right side sooner a less friendly behavior produces, reacts one to basis of these experiences".
The researchers say that the insights could help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers to a better understanding of the emotions of its animal.
John Bradshaw, expert for dog behavior and guest scholar at the faculty for veterinary medicine of the university of Bristol explained, this had not been the first study, with which examined became, whether to the left and to the right for dogs would be important.
Last year found out a team of the university of Lincoln that dogs turn the head to the left, if they look at an aggressive dog, and concerns to the right, if it a satisfied dog.
In another research project at the university of Victoria in Canada following did not stand: "dogs go sooner on a robot dog to, if be, tail' to the left of wedelt and to the right to become instead of restless – exactly the other way around as in the Italian study".
According to its statements, the differences could stir therefore that the dogs in the different studies did not interpret the animals in the films and/or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study how dogs react to real dogs, could help, explained it.
"To be sure gives it considerable records for many different mammals, that both sides of the brain for different purposes uses become, but must many of the details yet determines become – and dogs form there no exception", so Bradshaw.
Because its behavior however simply could be recorded, it would last probably not long until we understand, why the tail moves sometimes in the one, sometimes into the other direction.
