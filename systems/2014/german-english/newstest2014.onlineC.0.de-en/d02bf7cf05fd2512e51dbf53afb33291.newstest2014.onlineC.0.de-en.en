A Blackbox in the car?
US American street plans is believe found in search of a money source in order to repair the decaying Highway system, and the solution in a small black box to have, that in the instrument panel of each car place finds.
The devices, that record every gone kilometer and report the information at the authorities, to revise are essential point of a controversial attempt of Washington and the planning offices of the states, the obsolete system of streets US American to the financing.
The zone rather boring normally of the street planning has kindles suddenly an intensive debate with colorful alliances.
Libertarian allied and speak itself with environment groups itself for that from that the government can use the small boxes for recording the gone kilometers – and possibly also, where it gone became – and can use the information then for the calculation of tax modest.
The Tea party is appalled.
The American civil right union (ACLU) is provided also deeply and expresses a row of data protection objection.
Yet during one in the congress on an action do not agree can, wait several states not more long.
They test presently how they can change in the course of the next ten years to a system, with which drivers pay per gone mile.
Thousands of drivers already tested the tachographs, of which some with GPS supervision are equipped.
That is must actual a for our country.
"It is nothing, that we only possibly use become", said Hasan Ikhrata, manager of the Southern Californias Assn. of Governments, that plans a record of the gone miles at all Californian drivers in the state from 2025.
The type and manner how we pay these taxes, will change.
The technology for that is there.
The initiative comes at a time because the Highway trust finding that is financed out of the taxes is, that US Americans pays at the gasoline pump, broke.
Yet in America, so much is refueled no longer like earlier.
Cars consume less gasoline.
The national mineral oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 Euro cents per liter) did not climb for 20 years.
Politicians do not venture in high Spritpreisen to raise the tax also only around a cent.
"The gasoline tax is simply not future capable", so lee Munnich, an expert for traffic legislation at the university of Minnesota.
Its state equipped recently 500 cars with tachographs, with which a mile been based pay system is supposed to be tested.
"That places the long-termed most meaningful alternative there", said it.
Bureaucrats designate it as a mile been based user fee.
It do not surprise that the idea finds in municipal liberal accord, for the tax could be used for example in addition to influence the driving behavior so that obstruction and climate harmful exhaust fumes are reduced.
The Californian plans set on the system in the elaboration of strategies, with which the ambitious, legally anchored goals of the state are supposed to be reached to climate change.
Yet the republican Bill Shuster out of Pennsylvania, chairperson of the House Transportation Committee, explained also that he would see therein the most passable long-term alternative.
Also the free marketers of the Reason Foundation are done of the idea let pay driver after traversed stretch.
"That is no tax, that in a black hole disappears", explains Adrian bogs, vice president for guidelines in Reason.
The people pay directly for that, what they get.
The movement is supported also of two earlier American transportation ministers, who had requested the congress in a report in 2011, to move toward mile been based statement.
Year approved last the US senate a pilot project expensive 90 million dollars that would have comprised 10,000 cars.
Yet the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the attack and reacted therewith on the objections of delegate out of rural zones, that people represent, who must traverse many miles in the everyday life often on the way to the work or into the city.
Several states and cities move nevertheless independently into this direction.
Most engagly Oregon, that presently 5,000 drivers recruits for the largest experiment of the country, is.
These drivers will pay soon the mile fees instead of the mineral oil tax at the state.
Nevada locked already a pilot project.
New York city considers also such a.
Illinois tests it in restricted mass with truck.
And the I-95-Koalition, to which the transportation ministries of 17 states belong at the east coast, examines presently how one could introduce the change.
The draft is no universal hit.
In Nevada where recently 50 volunteers with the devices were equipped, were driver sceptical in the thought, the government could pursue each of its movements.
"Consider against Big Brother and such things were a large problem", explains Alauddin Khan, leader of the strategy management and result management in the transportation ministry of Nevada.
The people did not want it.
When the test started, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its websites: "it would be relatively simple, the tachographs into fully grown supervision devices to change".
There was no necessity to construct a gigantic, bulky technological infrastructure, that would become inevitable in addition relatedly to grasp data over the daily movements of individual.
Nevada does not belong to a row of states, that hold now after affordable technology lookout, with which the country can grasp the gone kilometers, but exactly when and where.
Therewith, so Khan, would be also the public more calmed.
The hunt after this technology led some authorities to a small Startup business by the name of True Mileage in California.
The firm not originally is begun in order to help states in the taxation of drivers.
Rather it was its goal of getting an in a soaring market for motor vehicle insurances foothold, with which drivers should pay on base of the gone miles.
Yet that of its devices of tested are not work also for the street plans interesting, for it with GPS and deliver only limited information that become high loaded regularly per modem.
"The people are rather ready, itself on that to involve, if its speed and locations not recorded become", explained Ryan Morrison, manager of True Mileage.
In some of these public pilot programs, large mistakes were made.
There are substantially cheap and less intrusive possibilities to transfer this.
In Oregon, the plans experiment therewith to give drivers a row of choices.
They can for a device with or without GPS decide.
Or they select generally no device and pay instead a flat rate on base of the miles gone on the average by all inhabitants the state.
Other places hope to be able to sell the draft of a distrustful public in that they equip the devices with more functions than with wenigeren.
In New York city traffic officials want to develop a device to the taxation, pays will must, with which also parking fee can be paid, an insurance only for gone kilometers and raised become speed data by other vehicles in real time, avoid can driver thanks to those obstruction.
"Driver would become through that value-added the advantages, that the system offers, the participation motivates", is named it in a planning document of the city.
Some traffic plans ask themselves to be sure whether the entire talk would be over the paying per mile not only a gigantic diversionary tactic.
The problem of the bankrupt Highway trust finding could solve official declared in the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the zone the San Francisco Bay, the congress simply by increase of the fuel tax.
An additional unique fee or an annual duty could be imposed drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles who consume little gasoline, so that also these pay a fair share.
"It gives no reason for an operation, if an aspirin also suffices", clarifies Randy Rentschler, the leader for legislation and public matters of the commission.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers make provide itself over its privacy and numerous other things.
