Despair scream of an Obama voter
I selected president Obama twice in the hope on that that variation would be possible
It says, Obama had undertaken commendable efforts, that had been thwarted of the blockade tactic of the republicans
The blockade politics does not excuse the websites problems of Obamacare, the drone attacks
Let Obamas memoirs over the campaign 2008 be a sad memory of that what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is student in the second year at the Harvard Medical School.
I read presently a terribly sad book.
It is a book of which I believed, it would become during the gloomy second year of my medical studies aufheitern and me again hope give me.
It is named "The Audacity to Win" (courage to win) and describes the memoirs Barack Obamas to the presidential election 2008.
If I am evenings with my patient written records ready and go to bed, me the keep the books back into a time when the politics was able to steal millions inspired and a speech the breath.
The choice perceived held to a landslide victory and newscaster in order to bring to the attention of the historic meaning of this hour.
My classmates cried gathered before joy and my parents all newspapers that were able to find it.
A young team of visionary was was on the way into the white house and the nation ready for variation.
When at that time 2008 Obama changed into the office, it had approval value of 82%.
And then latch I the book.
To shift again on the present an evil awakening is as if one is torn out of a dream.
It falls heavily to remember these optimistic times – it seem to be one vaguely memory, a sad admonition at missed possibilities.
In the years since I delivered for the first time my voice, changed actually something.
But it is simple nothing what I would have been able to introduce me.
I acknowledge the magnificent and multilateral things, that Obama reached, of the dismissal of the Affordable Care Act for health insurance to the military deduction out of Iraq, the end of the forced concealing of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
Also I am the view that the party-political blockade tactic had tipped over too many strivings, with which our nation should be brought forwards: Immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closing of Guantanamo Bay in order to name only some.
Yet after I defended countless times the Obama government vis-à-vis colleagues and acquaintance, I arrived with my explanation attempt at the end.
I reached a point of political despair.
The republican blockade politics cannot explain why one allows the monitoring of foreign country chief or the killing of innocent children through drones in overseas.
It cannot explain why that gathers nationally Security Agency data over the private life of Americans and why Whistleblower are punished, that disclose national false behavior.
It cannot explain why Anwar al Awlaki, a US American citizen was murdered, without procedure, yet why the public financing boundaries and edition boundaries during the presidential elections gone around become.
It does not justify the results of a report in which it is named, let the exertions of the white house to the immobilization of the media be that "most aggressive... since the Nixon government".
And jüngstens cannot excuse it the inability to sketch a simple website in the more than three years since the dismissal of the Affordable Care Act.
I do not know whether it is that, what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood with 18, that the government work could contradict that its campaign preceding political.
The delegate office is obvious no foreseeable course because an opposition party and accidental events such as the Newtown massacre stamp the public discussion.
Yet if I look at the examples named above, they seem selected extensively by the government itself to be.
And that disturbs me most.
I selected 2012 again Obama, not because I was enthused over its candidacy.
If Romney avoided placed a confusing and unausgegorene alternative there, it did not seem determine its direction and positions to can.
I had, freely of the pressure of future choices, would fulfill the impression, a second tenure for Obama the hope, belong had we of that already so long.
Yet with the sinking of the approval values for Obama on less than 45% this week the return became into the year 2008 through this book the harder.
It wakes the longing in me after the many promises, that broke up in air.
I read this week a section in the book that describes, how Obama had to put away a heavy loss against Clinton in the areas codes in Pennsylvania.
In a meeting with the choice helpers after the decision, he said would have to come, it back on course to its colleagues and follow the purpose of its thing.
"I would like, that we our magic regain", said it.
We must remember on that, who we are.
Five years are later, Mr. President, and I not more strongly could agree with you.
