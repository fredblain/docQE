Halloween 2013: In numbers
When I was small, Halloween had something magic.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, late might stay up and disguise us for the neighborhood.
Today I became sooner the Halloween Muffel.
In the last two years, I did not explain myself ready to distribute of my dwelling out of candy, and it would not do probably also this year.
But according to statistics, I am a black sheep what concerns Halloween.
The majority of the Americans – 158 million, around exactly to its – celebrate this year Halloween and give at the same time altogether 6.9 billions of U.S. dollar for candy, costumes and decoration from, so the US American association of the retailers (NRF).
The trend values are a thing on which I please me each Halloween then yet again.
The costumes will settle about 1.2 billions of the 6.9 billions of issued U.S. dollar, so the NRF.
This year inciting inanimate objects are the last scream.
Women must wrap themselves no longer in sexy clothing, they can embody now also seductive meal such as about pizza, Hamburger or carrot.
I expect what men concerns, a lot of Zombies thanks to The whale King Dead, and I bet, the Daft-Punk-space men will create it this year into the that day ram Feeds.
According to Google, the usually sought costumes are Zombies, Batman, pirate and witch.
I assume, it is associated nothing at tradition.
We disguised last year our dogs and were therewith not alone to my astonishment.
Actually Americans issue 330 million dollars this year for costumes of its pets, so the NRF.
Those are a quantity "Hot Dogs".
We are not what concerns candy, prim.
Americans will issue this year 1.9 billions of dollar for that, so The Nielsen company.
Those are about 270 million kilograms at chocolate bars, lollipops, sweet and Gummi Bear.
Therefore good messages for that according to US trade ministry 41 million people that pass "sweet or sour" with the saying through the quarters.
Actually we will buy and – make we us nothing before – eat chocolate over 40 million kilograms for Halloween.
The only what we would not like to consume, the sugar sweet Candy Corn is; nevertheless become 15 million kilograms therefrom around Halloween sold, so the national association of the candy manufacturers.
Those are about nine billions of grains of corn.
It is a riddle that I was not able to solve yet.
Does nothing belong more to Halloween than houses, in which it spukt.
They have magnificent names such as "terror Behind of the rampart" (what by the way in a real prison stands), „Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
There are officially acknowledged closes actually 1,200 Spukhäuser in the United States that obtain 500 million dollars proceeds, so America Haunts, and that the wonderful photos on, on which one pees himself just into the pair of pants and the friends place then on Facebook, where one does not get rid of it again, and one then the type on which one stands, a commentary leaves behind like "nice expression".
But let's come finally to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown made with the large pumpkin trusted to us when we were children, and the carving of a pumpkin lantern is like the decorating of the Christmas tree – something, that we of small on made have.
Fortunately began the "babies in the pumpkin" -trend year first last thanks to Pinterest so that that of us grew up therewith, the pumpkin carve right and to not to sit, therein.
This year Americans will issue about 106 million dollars for pumpkins, so that US Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lantern, that decays slowly in the before garden, comes probably from Illinois where this year were harvested 245 million kilograms of pumpkins.
If you would want correctly points, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and carve you something pretty out of its 921 kilogram pumpkin.
