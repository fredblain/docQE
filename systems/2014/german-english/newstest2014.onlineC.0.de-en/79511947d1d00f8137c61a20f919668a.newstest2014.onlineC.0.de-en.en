Ben Greenman: Ten years New York Comedy festival: The New York
One could say that New York is city the birth site of state up Comedy in America: Before almost hundred years, the Varietekünstler Frank Fay, that worked as a Conférencier in the Palace Theatre at the Broadway, began, therewith to tell the quantity directly jokes in form of a conversation.
In the course of the years, Fays innovation was expanded, so like finally on the New York Comedy festival.
Into life called and led of Caroline deer, the founder of the state-up-institution Carolines, celebrates be the festival this year ten-year anniversary with more than sixty shows in small club and large theaters.
"That of this Headliner caught in Carolines on and became then always more successfully, until it sometime too well known were, around in a club to appear", said deer.
We conceived this festival so that we can work further with them.
In this year's organization, there is entrances of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher as well as also of "state Up for Heroes", an annual music for and Comedy Benefizveranstaltung for army veteran in the Madison Square corps, with which among other things Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill appear Cosby.
With the festival, also the world of the Comedy grew.
A row of the Comedians, that participate this year in the festival, became over rather unorthodox ways well known, like for example shipments on smaller TV canals such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Kroll nod became with a Sitcom in cable television well known (the ironically slippery Fantasy-series of Football "The League" on FXX) and has now its own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was both in "Saturday Night live" and in "parks and Recreation" part of the occupation although it is the best known for its viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Both Kroll and Slate and other young Comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, on race subjects concentrated W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of the American Comedy.
To the largest visitor magnets of the festival, an interview belongs: David stone mountain speaks with Larry David.
Stone mountain began as a state up Comedian, developed however to an esteemed TV director and film director as well as to an unofficial Comedy historian.
Of 2005 to 2007, it moderated a telecast with the title "Sit Down Comedy with David stone mountain" in TV country.
The meeting takes place in the Town hall in the middle of Manhattan.
"The city is definitive in the Comedy DNA of Larrys of entire work", said stone mountain.
It told me if it is here, would go it sometimes by the lane between two buildings and thinks itself: Hey if I lose all of my money, live I perhaps here.
