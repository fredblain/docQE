Frankfurt parking fee strongly should climb
Parking in Frankfurt could become soon sensitively more expensive.
The magistrate of the city advises today morning over a model of Verkehrsdezernent Stefan Majer (green).
Accordingly the parking fee are supposed to be raised by 50 percent.
For that the prices are not supposed to be raised however, but rather should shorten become the time interval by parking meters and park certificate vending machines of 30 on 20 minutes.
In December then yet the town councillor meeting must decide.
The retail trade sow shot of the IHK Frankfurt considers that "to be no good idea".
The park possibility direct before the business would not be "a to underestimating advantage for smaller specialist suppliers".
The traffic club Germany is of the opinion that an increase is "thoroughly appropriate and actually a long time overdue" after two decades.
The public local traffic becomes also more expensive.
