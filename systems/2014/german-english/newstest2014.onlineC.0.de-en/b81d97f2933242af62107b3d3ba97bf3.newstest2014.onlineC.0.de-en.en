Clive Palmer maintains, prime minister Tony Abbott would have conflict of interest in the parents vacation
The billionaire and delegate Clive Palmer says, prime minister Tony Abbott would stand in a conflict of interest in its plans to the parents vacation because its daughters could become pregnant and could profit therefore therefrom.
The mining magnate, that is in a judicial discussion over the payment of 6 million dollars at CO2-Steuer, set up the statement when he wanted to wipe questions of the table, whether he would be in a conflict.
The Palmer united party could control up to four voices in the senate, that are important to the decision, whether the CO2S are painted or shortened- and mining tax.
Yet Palmer maintained that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and the daughters would profit from Abbott personally of the laws.
"He is in a large conflict of interest, if it around paid parents vacation goes, for if one its daughters pregnant becomes, has he a direct interest on that, whether it vacation receives or not", said Palmer.
The choice commission Palmer with 53 voices explained two months after the choice advantage after the new counting officially to the winner of the Sunshine-Coast-seat of fair fax.
Palmer demanded a revision of the process to the voice counting so that this would proceed faster.
Tony Abbotts daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these choices be decided two months after the end of the voting?
"We need a better system", said it.
Why should we have no system, input with which one marches in here, the data into a computer, selects immediately and has then the result around 6:30 clock evenings?
Palmer criticized also the use of pencils in the marking of the ballot.
Does one use it because one can rub out then the results, if they not please one?
To vote nowadays with pencils is incredible.
The choice commission tested the option for an electronic choice and published recently a joint legal proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, explained that to its politics an international airport would belong for the Sunshine Coast and that it would become "very seriously" take its new office.
In a public office, it concerns the service at the public.
"We strive after no reward except that of the story, namely, that we in a critical time of this partnership serve can", said it.
