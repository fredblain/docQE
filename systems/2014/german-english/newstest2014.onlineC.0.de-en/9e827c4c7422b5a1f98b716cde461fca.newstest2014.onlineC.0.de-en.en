The Veganismus is imputes according to lexicons the Vegetarismus, differs of this however yet on entirely considerable manner.
For during vegetarian permit itself the consumption of creme pie, ice or a strong Edamer, stand these feast eggs not on the menu of a vegan.
Milk, cheese, egg, next to the renunciation of meat and fish the vegan of the product animal all consumption lets from - also honey is denied.
One likes to ask himself what remains,, but in nearer view, the vegane nourishment world draws itself through a notable ingenuity from.
"Spreads are very chooses", explains Ute handle man, that proprietor of the local health food shop, who has ready a multitude of special products for vegan.
Also Proctor rubbed visits the store in the cathedral lane gladly.
For 13 years the native New Zealander vegan lives finds, in Lampertheim he (almost) all before, what he needs for life. I shifted "1997 my nourishment and became vegetarian".
Around the century turning point resulted then the next step and I vegan became.
"The conviction came however not only because of the nourishment, but rather based on the shoe choice", says Proctor, that art leather prefers leather normal.
It recognized that it goes also in other daily concerns without animal products.
Primarily vegan is its ethics one.
"I wants not, that animals for me die must", speaks Proctor the maxim of the vegans from, that extends on the entire consumption behavior.
Mourn afterwards instead of castles, scrambled egg or Gummi Bears, had discovered climbed the vegan products quickly entirely new, the enthusiasm on.
"It is a double bonus", says Proctor today, "actually places vegan its no renunciation, no asceticism there, but rather it is an enrichment". The acceptance that one would reduce the selection with the nourishment transposition at food option, attributes Proctor sooner to the power of the habit.
And exactly these conditionings let fail also many a yet so well meant attempt.
"The Suchtfaktor is an entirely decisive factor, that many quickly abandon lets, similarly in the smoking", places Proctor a comparison up.
And objects: "Certain Geschmäcker are not to be fastened" at the animal.
Often the spices or the type of the preparation that settle the taste are it.
"One can however also in other manner the same effect produce", clarifies the vegan.
To a grill festival, Proctor brings along for example eggplant, mushroom and also a couple Veganwürste.
It pays attention to a well-balanced, varied nourishment, with which it thoroughly also once heftily should taste.
Naturally one would like to have something between the teeth, is that legitimate.
"It should taste, but that is not only on animal nourishment to reduce", so Proctor.
Health damages up to eating disorders, a further widespread acceptance, had not suffered it.
For me, the transposition had a positive aspect.
I receive no strange cholesterol and have an increased vitamin share.
There are high performance athletes who eat excluding vegan.
"My blood values are best, I let me often check", betrays Proctor.
Especially before the lack of vitamin B12, many Vegansimus critics warn.
"There animals with lining means nourished become, instead of on the meadow grasses, is it questionably, whether in the meat, that one in the cool trunk buys, the Vitamin-B12-Anteil is high", finds Proctor.
For vegan, there is moreover the possibility to take the Coenzym in the form of tray to itself.
"My B12-Werte are in order", explains it.
Proctor didn't have to go far ways for the food procurement.
There is reason food in the end everywhere and every supermarket has meanwhile soya bean milk and other products.
All what I need, I find on the spot.
Only off and at I buy something special.
"Many people survey that just only the finished products are expensive, but so it behaves in" usual" finished products of course also".
Anyway let the preparation be vegan of courts by far more favorable and less time-consuming when commonly supposed.
"In the house kitchen gives it much to discover, with a couple of small pinched can one good, if not partially better results obtain", says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, somewhat more baking powder and carbon dioxide instead of egg, with its veganen cheesecakes Proctor was able to bring also its Schwiegereltern for marveling.
The vegan lends would spice family festivals a new.
That has dynamics if one cooks together, has the one new status.
"The situations, that at the same time emerge can, are as different as the people themselves", says Proctor.
Naturally scepticism was offered it however also already.
Does my meal taste you no longer?
Should I "now badly feel because I drink" milk? - In questions such one had to act as a vegan with fingertip feeling.
"I lean the people not off, I am part of this company", would like Proctor no enclave existence time periods.
And more exactly observed the everyday life world appears then not at all so veganfremd such as assumed - and the vegan not so in the everyday life restricted supposed how commonly.
Also almost Food is permitted.
There is fry everywhere!
"Many Dönerläden offer Falafel on, or just a vegetarian Yufka", says Proctor.
In a pizzeria, it switches over to Pastagerichte, or a pizza without cheese, all one question of the habit orders just.
The restaurants adjust themselves so slowly on that.
"As I 13 years ago begun still would have, me vegan to nourish, was all much more hard", foundly can make the New Zealander a development: "One must speak with the people, make" it aware.
"If sufficient demands come, are it perhaps in addition tended, the menu to supplement", hopes it.
Vegane restaurants develop, like for example the Kombüse in Mannheim or the café bird free.
Proctor cultivates the wish that also other restaurants have stand at least a veganes court on the menu.
In the reason taken are vegane courts for everyone there.
Everyone can eat it, they are therefore exactly the opposite of exclusive.
"Meat courts are on the other hand exclusive, and to be sure in the truest sense of the word, for it conclude other from", places Proctor firmly.
"If one groceries scandals avoid wants, is certain Veganismus a way, the very largest part from the start impossibly to make", says Proctor.
The purchase vegan products could be somewhat difficult however at the beginning.
Especially if one learns to understand, the additive animal also into peanuts as a color giver his contain can, seems to leave one with the compliance with the ethics in so many hurdles and falling quickly the courage.
Not only therefore have rubbed Proctor and Lars Thomsen a book written: "Veganissimo - animal ingredients and its alternatives" explains the many ingredients that are buried food however also cleaner.
"Gradually one develops a scanner view and knows has" is to be done to pay attention to which signs and Logos one it sometimes better small steps as to stumble remain standing or", knows Proctor.
The Veganismus, it an important moral tip-off that strikes on the consciousness is.
Perhaps it does not create it entirely that one discards its habits, but it at least can teach the consumer to examine its habits critically.
