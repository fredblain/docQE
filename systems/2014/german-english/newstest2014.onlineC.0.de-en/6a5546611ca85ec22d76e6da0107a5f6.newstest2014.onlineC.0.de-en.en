Living with future perspective
Actually Waltraud lives raced dreamlike.
Your house lies in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with much green, an old tree existence, nice neighbor and also not all too much traffic.
Into the city are it only a few minutes with public transportation.
Do "you have hopefully no fear of spiders"?, asks raced and shows Waltraud on a fat spider at the door frame.
I have sought myself already for some time a new dwelling for my husband and.
But you know yes how difficult that in Stuttgart is.
The reason is to be sure no spider phobia, but rather the worry to be able to master in the age the many stairs to the house and in the dwelling no longer, explains it.
Moreover: Since a Meniskus operation, the Mittf√ºnfzigerin learned must at the own body, what means it to move with Handicap from floor to floor.
Did recently first a book of it appear 'happily live to the subject in the age - which accustomed form is the best for me'?.
'Our dwelling is the best example for that, what in the age not at does all go', begins it to tell.
When it pulled before more than 20 years with its man into the Maisonette dwelling, it was simply only a beautiful dwelling middle in the green.
Today with middle fifty Waltraud thinks raced differently about that.
It knows however also that it belongs to the few people, who explain himself generally with the subject 'living in the age'.
That displace it as long as it goes.
Old always only the other become', says it smiling.
First if the sorrow pressure is really large, would make one himself thought.
'Then can it be however also already too late', raced.
In its book, the interior architect introduces 17 accustomed models for an even certain living in the age.
'Which accustomed form one however selects, is always an Individualentscheidung', explains it.
There is not D i e solution for the age.
Even who the age quiet seat in the Tuscany or the Bretagne afford could, always should consider that it could become also sick.
And: 'Without good knowledge of the national language become isolated also in the Dolce Vita,' gives the reference book author of evacuation willing to consider.
Under its models, classic care models, alternative accustomed forms or the often quoted pensioner WG are found.
In the age, every has so its tics and quirks
'For me would be so a shared apartment however nothing', means it with a wink.
Already not at all like in a student WG with a joint bath and a kitchen.
'In the age needs one simply also its withdrawal rooms', raced.
The book author does not want to exclude that a senior shared apartment can function nevertheless, nevertheless.
That had to pass then however differently as in the classic student WG.
And sometimes one wants simply also only its quiet, believes it.
With this opinion, it does not stand there at least in the country capital alone.
'Most old people in Stuttgart want so long it goes in its own dwelling remain', also the experience of Theresa is would rescue, the leader of the citizen service life in the age of the country capital.
Your office advises all around the subject 'more old become' people.
Therefore would take just older people frequently also inconvenience and restrictions in purchase to be able to remain only around in its accustomed environment, that is also the experience of the Stiftung Warentest.
At the same time there are today many possibilities to form the house or the dwelling barrier-freely.
Raced recommends all, that are concerned with the age-appropriate reconstruction of its house or its dwelling, to inform itself first once thoroughly and to not to delegate the first best workman.
Today it gives also for the age-appropriate reconstruction specialist.
Even in the rent dwelling, the one or others could be realized, and if it is only the toilet seat increase, the interior architect clarifies up.
But always the existing dwelling not -freely can be reshaped age-appropriately and therewith barrier, also if it yet so beautifully lies.
This experience must raced make Waltraud.
To be sure one could install within the dwelling a stairway elevator, would be the way paved also with stairways up to the dwelling door however the by far larger hindrance.
It becomes expanse request until it found for the ideal object itself and its man.
Before the move, it dawns its more than before the spider at its dwelling door.
