Pawnshops boom in Singapore because the crisis arrived in the means layer
In a pawnshop in the shopping center Bendemeer in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a golden bracelet, a ring and a couple earring in order to be able to pay the school fees of its daughters.
"My husband and I have just a house bought, there sticks all of my money inside", says Amirthalinga.
Although it would earn every months 3,000 Singapore dollar (ca 1,730 Euro) as an administration colleague and its man would work also, rich the monthly family income not from, clarifies it.
Actually the demand in parts of south east Asia – where the indebtedness of the households increases – is so greatly that ValueMax undertook, where it its exchange, this week the third pawnshop became, that is listed at the singapurischen stock exchange.
The pawning of jewelry is not only a fast way to got around money – 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga –, but rather also almost so favorably like an unsecured bank lending.
Characteristically pawnshops in Singapore demand an effective year interest of 17 percent, that lies only just over the 15.4 percent, that demands the united Overseas bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping center.
Pawnshops offer however the advantage that here no examination of the credit worthiness or income proof are required, why loans are possible more quickly than in banks.
For this reason millions of people in the region turn to pawnshops after families sense the pressure through increasing cost of living as well as an increasing household indebtedness and consumer indebtedness.
After five years robust growth since the global finance crisis and cheap credit based on a loose fiscal policy in that developed seek economic regions families with slighter and middle income pawnshops up in order to balance so in stuttering economy the difference.
This week designated the Rating agency standard & Poor's it growing household indebtedness, mainly through increasing mortgages, when a risk factor for the credit worthiness of Asian banks.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household indebtedness in Asia in the relation to the gross domestic product after estimation of the agency.
Malaysia stands with 80 percent of the GDP at the tip of the list, a climb of 60 percent yet in the year 2008.
People economists provide himself also because of the high consumer indebtedness in Thailand, that came out this week tightly out of a technical recession.
On Thursday the data showed an export weakness existing further and a diminishing of the consumer demand.
"In the end effect means that, that in view of increasing costs the people in the middle until lower segments (the income scale) try become, its income to supplement, wherever that is possible", says song Seng Wun, economist in CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historic record levels in the Goldpreisen in the last two years yet reinforced the trend of objects personal to the mortgaging because the people use the opportunity to change the jewelry of the family in cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the pawned objects in the 200 pawnshops of the city state are it gold.
The people say themselves: "the gold price sees well from, lets us grandmothers gold chain pawn and next month get back".
The largest Thai pawnshop operator, EasyMoney, experienced a 20-percent customer increase in the last months in its branches.
The growth in the seize business is so strong that ValueMax, operator of the branch in Bendemeer would like to expand and 15 further in Singapore, not only into the neighboring Malaysia – where that businesses four of houses operates –, but rather also outside of Asia, so Yeah lee Ching, manager of ValueMax.
The business finances that with 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollar that took in it this week with the stock exchange listing in Singapore.
While some lenders had run because of high interests rates into the crossfire, Yeah explains that pawnshops would offer not only more favorable interests than other lenders, but rather also not directly the guilt of increased.
"Customers loan on objects, that it already possess, and the Verflüssigen of personal valuables enlarges not the Haushaltsverschulung", clarifies it.
The seize lend business is accepted socially increasingly as a short-term, protected financing.
Also all people who use pawnshop are not, in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore come also into the branch of ValueMax in order to pawn gold bullion and Rolex clocks for what they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
To us come customers out of every social layer.
"In addition belong wealthy, that short-termed something for a business or an investment lend, or small businesses, the bottlenecks in the cash Flow bridge must", says Yeah.
Sometimes they need also simply only very quickly money.
