Advice takes track plants into the visor
Is the train transition costly supposed to be rebuilt "at the deer" in order to increase the traffic security?
Yes, the local councils concluded.
Schiltach must take for that 220,000 Euro into the hand.
The Germans train the Kinzigtal track wants to improve in the coming year.
Especially the security is supposed to be increased at the same time at train transitions - regularly comes it nationwide to collision of trains with other vehicles.
If the communities agree the reconstruction measures, they must be involved with one-third in the costs, divide the remainder itself train and alliance.
Schiltachs city master builder Roland Grießhaber clarified the local council the peculiarities of the Bahübergangs "at the deer".
There the city plans to construct an Ausbuchtung in height of the tunnel mouth there west of the tracks.
There also larger vehicles, for example such that transport long wood could stand, in oncoming traffic without having to block the tracks.
Grießhaber proposed therefore to construct a required support wall so that the city could the subsequent street to given time distributors in order to guarantee a smooth traffic river.
This controversially was discussed in the local council, pulled there some Räte the necessity of a street distribution in doubt: Thomas slag heap brought the mood of the critics with its remark on the point: Must we "take" so much money because of so few vehicles into the hand?
Mayor Thomas Haas contradicted: The train transition "deer" would be used regularly for long wood carriers.
Even wood out of the area "cow stream" would be transported partially over this stretch because that could not use the stretch until vehicles long to 20 meters at the Häberlesbrücke, because they could not turn there into the main street.
In addition the stretch serves as an Umleitungfür those vehicles that may not use the tunnel, if the main street is blocked, Haas argued.
To see there be that Kirchberg- and lock mountain tunnel rebuilt and rehabilitates become must how this is presently in Wolfach the case, could approach the train transition "at the" deer" also for a longer period an important traffic meaning.
The Räte agreements let examine, which would cause costs the angedachte widening of the street.
Without regard to its was agreed by a majority with the standard that the required support wall is constructed so, with the reconstruction of the train transition that the city could expand the subsequent street direction "railway station street" if necessary for encounter traffic on approximately 5.5 meter.
The reconstruction of the train transition in the tannery Trautwein could stretch on the other hand an entirely other problem after, concerns that the driveway into the strongly increasing "Geroltzhäuser way".
The administration had examine let the reconstruction plans of the train of the engineer office Breinlinger because it had doubt on that, whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser of way would be further possible then yet without.
The investigation concluded that not to exclude would be, that the inclination ratios of the street could lead in addition, that longer vehicles rest.
The responsibility for this carries again the city as a road construction load carrier.
The reconstruction could stretch accordingly liability disputes after.
Because both the wood removal and the turning in the current extension condition functioned, one should not agree with the reconstruction of the train transition, argued Haas.
Also let the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle standing on the transition be here clearly slighter than at the other train transitions because directly beside it the stop point middle would be, to which a good line of sight would exist.
Even trains of the central station here should have been braked here already so far that no collision would threaten.
By a majority the approval was denied the reconstruction of this train transition because the city Schiltach could withdraw the problem with resting vehicles "bathe from must", so the Räte, because the train after conclusion of the structural work out of the responsibility.
As unproblematic observed the group that rebuilt at the train transitions "before hay stream" and "before cow stream", for which already intersection agreements with the train were encountered.
