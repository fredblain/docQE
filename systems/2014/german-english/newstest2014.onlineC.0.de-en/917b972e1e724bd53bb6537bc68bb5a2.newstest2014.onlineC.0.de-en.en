George Kerevan: European divestiture gives the scot the choice
A new day, a new fright story to the independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required in order to join the Schengen room as a condition for the EU membership.
That delivers the cue for stories over passport inspection in Berwick and one with barbed wire secured boundary along the Hadrianswalls.
In the deed was referred in the Strathclyde model to the possible economic advantages, played, that would bring more trip freedom in the remaining Europe with itself, but this – as expected – in the headlines no role.
Also no one mentioned that the EU member countries bend right themselves frequently its strict rules, if it more favorably is for it.
Because Scotland does not belong presently to the Schengen room, the continued non-observance would be for Brussels only a small concession in return for that, what one wants really of the scot.
Therefore actually no story.
And a, that came already so in the years, that it is similar to already a fossil: I heard the first time the "independence meant passport inspection" -duck before at least 40 years.
At the same time an interesting point gets lost in the permanent repeating of this age old story.
Why should one expect of an independent Scotland that it dances after the European pipe?
Why do the Londoner yoke against that of Brussels exchange, especially now?
Those are the actual European novelties: The large after which war run is plan calm to the union of Europe into the coring.
With the Euro crisis, the project Europe officially died.
Everywhere in the EU, parties win at ground, that EU hostily are or would like to throw the Euro as a common currency over board.
Even in Germany, the Euro sceptical party was able to manage to grab alternative for Germany – first this year established – tightly five million voices in the Bundestag election in September for itself and was able to banish therewith effectively the free democrats (that equivalently to the British liberally Democrats) out of the Bundestag.
There was already always domestic resistance against the plan, to create a federalist Europe.
The current economic crisis turns out to be sure as a turning point.
Because of the cost-cutting policy imposed severe by Berlin and the European central bank in connection with the compulsion jacket, in which the respective national economy is compelled by the adherence to the joint currency, are many people of the view, the project Europe would be to far gone.
The crisis of the Euro has to do few therewith that national governments cause excessive budgets deficits – that was only in Greece the case.
Instead the Euro system nailed its members on exchange rates, advantageously are that for German exporters – and that would like to let German politicians gladly so.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the local currency, southern Europe with an incorporated productivity disadvantage regains itself vis-à-vis Germany.
The single possibility exists therein to shorten wages and public editions – encouraged of Berlin.
Behind the current budget problems and currency problems, a deep going European productivity problem lies.
As a consequence of the energy guidelines decreed "green" by Brussels – a code for the subsidizing More french and German energy businesses at the expense of consumer –, the European industry pays compared the double for electricity and the fourfold to the United States for gas.
That is some paralyzing costs disadvantage how we were able to see already in Grangemouth.
All wage festival spellings of the world do not protect the European petrochemical industry before that to be pressed of cheap American slate gas into the corner.
As a consequence, a revolt pulls up, especially in France, the former Cheerleader of the EU.
After the war, the political elite of France saw the EU as a vehicle, with which one hold Germany in chess and Paris was able to lift at eye level with Washington.
Yet Berlin needs Paris no longer as a gate to the political authorization and pressed Europe its own economic policy wherewith the marred French economy has to fight.
The result: Navy Le Pens of to the right arranged, EU hostile front nationally won just a decisive after choice and referred therewith the reigning socialists to place three.
The front the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the votes nationally is now – a timely warning for the British Labour party that it cannot assume, a split in the right spectrum would mean automatically advantages for the left.
What does Le Pen make with its newly won popularity under the white Frenchman of the worker class?
It would like to use the EU choices next year in addition, an Anti EU-to forge Anti common currency block in the European parliament.
If the Anti-EU-parties in these choices well cut off – and that is very well possible –, could dominate for the first time such a block the European parliament.
This is the point on which I want out: In not all too furthermore future, the growing resentment against the EU and the joint currency will meet itself to the abolition of the Euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will become sooner something akin to the "Europe of the (sovereign) nations", that general favored de Gaulle.
Germany and a couple of its satellite economies hold perhaps at the Euro firmly, but France and southern Europe will return to its own currencies.
I expect that Great Britain of this project dissociates itself in the hope to ingratiate myself in the USA.
To be sure interest growing in the Pacific room suggests Washington that Great Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where does Scotland remain in all that?
We can decide to be a region of (in last consequence) small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – why also belonged to say Berlin and Brussels, what they can stick there itself where.
I assume, Scotland could go in a looser European association very well as far as we retain our own currency.
The cooperation with other, similarly thinking countries is simpler in a not federate Europe of the nations.
Otherwise we should consider, should retain it Norway gleichzutun and our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – remarkable would prove – the most successful political movement against the cost-cutting policy in Europe and won 2011 a spectacular majority based on the rejection of the proposed (and undertaken) abridgments, that the Labour treasury Ministers had to take responsibility for Alistair Darling and the following Tory Lib the coalition.
It would be for Scotland laughable to decide now on an independence, to got forced only around then of Berlin and Brussels a cost-cutting policy.
