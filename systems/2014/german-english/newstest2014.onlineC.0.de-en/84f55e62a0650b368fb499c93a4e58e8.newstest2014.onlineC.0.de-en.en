Coulson used telephone Hacking for the reviewing of a tip
The earlier News of the Word publisher Andy Coulson used nominally "telephone Hacking, supervision and confrontation" in the attempt to confirm an incorrect tip over an affair of the at that time Secretary of the Interior Charles Clarke.
District attorney Andrew Edis QC declared the court in the Old Bailey, News of the world an incorrect rumor had heard in May 2005 indicating that Clarke would have a ratio with its "attractive special adviser" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper delegated the private detective Glenn Mulcaire therewith to hoe Pawlbys Voicemails, and pursued it, but Coulson it called also and left behind messages how the court learned.
"According to concept of the district attorney's office is Coulson, that now publisher of the NotW is, no one, that before the dwelling of people stands and hopes, it in the act to catch, but rather one, that people gladly with a story confronts, around its reaction to see", explained Edis.

The publisher is involved personally in the third method.
Obviously it does not know can be of the second, the supervision, differently it.
How does it look with the first?
Does it know over the telephone Hacking?

A volume with Voicemails of its telephone of at least three occasions was guaranteed in August 2006 in Mulcaires dwelling.
The investigators found moreover entries on the computer of the detective, on which Pawlby and its sister were stored as a "projects".
At the time, when the investigations ran, the grandparents received of Pawlby anonymous calls, in which they were asked about information about it, Edis explained.
Meanwhile the former boss reporter Neville Thurlbeck and the earlier reporter James inspected Weatherup the supervision of the movements of Pawlby.
On the 18th of June 2005, Coulson left behind a Voicemail with following contents: "I have a story, that we tomorrow bring out want, over that I gladly with Charles speak would like" to it.
Edis explained, followed Coulsons activities in this story the same pattern such as at other important personalities, about the earlier Secretary of the Interior David Blunkett.
The sworn heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett had confronted because of an affair with a married woman, when he himself was allied with the codefendants Rebekah Brooks, who had been at that time married.
