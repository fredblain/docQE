Dr. Georges Bwelle belongs to the Top of 10 the "CNN Heroes of 2013".
They can vote for it or one of the other heros in the Top 10 in order to select it to the "CNN Hero of the Year".
The victor receives 250,000 dollars to the continuation of its extraordinary work.
For 21 years saw be lost Georges Bwelle with on, how sick father again and again the consciousness and traveled to hospitals, that did not control the means in order to help it.
Jamef Bwelle became 1981 in a car accident in the vicinity of Yaoundé, that injures capital of Cameroon.
First it had only a broken arm, but then an inflammation, that expanded on its brain and caused there a hematoma, that should impair it for the remainder of its life, formed.
"It gave no Neurochirurgen in Cameroon", so Georges Bwelle.
We would have brought out it from Cameroon if we had had the money.
Instead spent Bwelle years therewith, its father in overfilled to accompany clinics and hospitals, in order to get there the treatment, that they had to offer.
"It is not simple", comments on Bwelle.
One can leave at five o'clock mornings the house and race is to the hospital in order to be the first, and yet not first.
There are very many patients.
Some people die even because they must wait.
The situation did hardly change since Bwelles father 2002 died.
In Cameroon, there is only a physician for 5,000 people apiece, so the world health organization.
On the other hand the ratio in the United States is about a physician for 413 people.
Yet even if there would be a physician for it, most Kameruner could not afford the visit.
Two of five people in the country live beneath the poverty line and almost three quarters the medical expenses in the country are private.
"The single problem, that it have, is poverty", says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossibly to enjoy life.
To see suffer its father and so many of its compatriots let ripen in Bwelle the decision to undertake somewhat on the other hand.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and be carried out volunteer team in the last year 700 free operations.
It became even physician and works as a container surgeon in the Central hospital in Yaoundé.
Moreover it established a public-spirited organization by the name of ASCOVIME that travels at weekends into rural areas and offers there free medical provision.
Since 2008 it and its volunteer group helped nearly 32,000 people.
He would force himself nearly every Friday and up to 30 people in small penance and go tied up with that medical equipment on the roof over unfortified grounds into the villages, that require aid.
Always all does not pass smooth.
They had to push already more than once the vehicles through rivers and mud.
Yet if they arrive, they will receive like heros: a banquet, song and dance and the best lodging that the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical provision is is actual a reason for the celebrations and Bwelle – with its wide smile and its boundless energy – gladly in the cheerful celebration there.
At the next morning, the team begins then with the investigation of hundreds of patients.
"Per trip treat we 500 people", so Bwelle.
They come out of a vicinity of 60 kilometers around the village – and that on foot.
Each of this Wochenendkliniken offers medical provision in a row of areas.
Many people are treated because of malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasite and sexually transferable illnesses.
Others receive crutch, contributed glasses or free birth documents – a document that is required for the school, however many poor families simply do not afford can.
Evenings the team carries out operations simple with local anesthetic.
The operations take place normally in a school, the city hall or a dwelling; after the intervention, the patients rise and go into the recovery area to make around place for the neighbors.
The illumination for the OP and the disinfection equipment is fed of the generator of the group and so Bwelle and its volunteers work into the early morning hours on Sunday.
It is a strenuous stint, but the village musicians help normally to hold the team motivated.
"You drum the entire night, so that we awake remain and our work continue can", says Bwelle.
On Sunday the team will go then back into the city, tiredly, but proud of the performed work.
The group – a mixture out of kamerunischen physicians and foreign medicine student – carried out free operations in the last year 700 and knows that she causes an enormous difference with its work for the people, whom she helps.
A man explained that the free operation of a strip breach that he had received would enable it now to work again.
"That changes the future of my family", meant the man.
Next to the Wochenendkliniken and its work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle works also at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job, it finances 60% of its public-spirited activity, so Bwelle; the remainder comes from private contributions.
"I knows really not, when it sleeps", says Katie O' Malley that studies in the second year at the Drexel University in Philadelphia medicine and cooperates voluntarily in Bwelles group.
It is always either in the hospital or tries to raise money for the organization so that it can go on this campaign.
For medicine students and nursing students such as O' Malley, that come out of the USA and Europe and support Bwelle, is this a chance to gather practical experiences, that never would get it at home.
"We can in operations at the same time be, where we help, blood to dab away or the instruments for Dr. Bwelle hold", explains O' Malley.
That never would be in America possible as a medicine student in the second year.
The students pay its trip to Cameroon normally even and bring frequently contributed Sanitätsmaterial with.
If they are however first once in Yaoundé, Bwelle receives the lodging, the carrier and the instructions.
"It is entire without doubt a hero", says O' Malley.
It dedicates its life of this organization and its wish to help the kamerunischen people, knows no boundaries.
For Bwelle, the nearly permanent work is no load.
To help other to a happier life and to fulfill therewith a promise, that it gave its father, large joy prepares it.
"I am so happy, if I this work would make", means Bwelle.
And I think of my father.
I hope, it sees, what I do.
I make it in order to bring people again for laughing and in order to mitigate the pains.
