Parents of a teenager out of Georgia, that died in tragic accident, believe in murder
The parents of the teenager, whose corpse in a rolled up wrestler mat in the gymnasium of its High School was found, are convinced that its son was murdered, explained the lawyer of the family on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson out of Valdosta in the US American state Georgia was found on the 11th of January in an uprightly set up mat, that stood behind the platform in the school gymnasium.
The investigation officials of the sheriff of Lowndes County came to the end that Johnson died in a tragic accident, what the family of the 17-year-old disputes however.
"You are therefrom convinces, that its son murdered became", explained Benjamin Crump, the lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, vis-à-vis FoxNews. com.
You never would have believed, it had died so how it had concluded the sheriff.
"You are the view, that it every logic would do without, against the laws of physics such as against the healthy common sense would offend", so Crump.
Rather they would be convinced, the truth would be glossed over in order to protect the person or people, who would be responsible for death of its son.
"Your son went for learning into the school and came in the corpse sack back", comments on he.
US district attorney Michael bogs said on Thursday, there would be a formal ascertainment to death Johnsons because a row of important questions would be yet unexplained.
What was the cause of death?
Its death is to be attributed to a crime?
The declared bog in a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts in which direction they lead also.
It that out to find truth is my goal.
"I represent the view, that a sufficient base for a formal ascertainment exists", said it.
Bogs explained vis-à-vis reporter, the initial autopsy points on that there that Johnson would be deceased at the consequences of a "position of contingent asphyxiation".
A second autopsy had yielded to be sure another cause of death, so bogs.
"It gives a row of questions, that answers or confirmed will must", said it.
Bogs added if there would be sufficient proofs of a criminal or civil law investigation to death Johnsons, would delegate it the FBI with the execution of the ascertainments.
A representative of the authority of the County sheriff was on our inquiry on Thursday there not immediately ready to a commentary.
A court in the south Georgias arranged on Wednesday that the authorities must release all supervision videos, that the investigators reviewed.
The parents of the teenager said, they hoped that the video records of references contained on that, how he had died.
