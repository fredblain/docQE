Does desire on ice cream, that illuminate in the dark?
A British entrepreneur developed the ice illuminating not until the dark – with the help of by jellyfishes.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescing characteristics of the marine creatures and created from that an illuminating delicacy.
The idea in addition came it after it had read a research project over jellyfishes and was able to convince Chinese scientists to produce the illuminating protein artificially.
The ice cream reacts in the consumption with the tongue by what means the pH is raised in the protein and the illumination is released.
Chris explains, that on the warmth in the mouth would react food ice, and would illuminate – the more one licks therefore, the more brightly becomes it.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream firm "Lick Me I' m Delicious", says: "the product is incredible, but yet in a very early production phase, and so gets one two grams therefrom for 200 pounds".
That in the ice cream used reacts protein with the tongue in a neutral pH.
If the mouth heats the protein, the pH and the ice climbs illuminates.
We tested it in the last months and appear it ideally to ourselves to bring it at Halloween on the market because it has this wonderful lamp effect.
It is is probable the most expensive ice cream that I ever produced, for the jellyfish lamp material four times more expensive than a gold.
Each ball costs me about 140 pounds.
But for that it tastes deliciously.
Firm experimental Charlies with seat in Bristol is famous for its unusual taste directions, to which beer, cheese, beef and leaf gold belong.
Yet its newest creation should become even more ambitious.
It says: "I would like gladly an invisible ice cream develop".
That is on and for itself impossibly based on the refraction, that is evoked by the ice crystals, out of which ice cream exists; but I assume, we find a possibility to create it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescing characteristics of a jellyfish that artificially are produced by Chinese scientist
