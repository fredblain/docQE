Excellently the battle mastered
Horst Janson is cut the roll of the Santiago, the old man in Hemingways novel "the old man and the sea", on the body.
Janson is even an old rabbit in its profession, the drama.
The old man Santiago can show no in the fishing somewhat.
So supplement itself both simply magnificently.
One means almost, the folds in the nape of the old man, of which the fisherman boy Manolo speaks, to be able to see.
If Santiago sits bended tiredly of life on the chair, that is real in Janson.
Beside it the roll of the old fisherman is through and through a character roll, that excellently masters Janson.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a courageous man that does not abandon and wins in the end the battle against the fish through its knowledge and also its will strength.
Janson is in far stretches as an alone performer on the stage.
It creates it, that to focus attention of the audience on itself, so that its monologues are boring no moment.
Its exertions to pull the fish finally at the surface of the water, are so really that the spectators forget, that the sea consists yet only of blue illuminated water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann lets act the old man in the boat before the fisherman village.
In the course of the performance, it sets the respectively active scene into the light: The cottage of Santiago, the bar of the singer Marie Luise favor, that with its songs and its lovely voice the awareness of life Kubas besingt.
The four musicians play Kubas rhythm in addition and are at the same time guests of the bar.
