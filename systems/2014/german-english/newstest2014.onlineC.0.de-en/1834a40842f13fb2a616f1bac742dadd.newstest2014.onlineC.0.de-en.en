Pope Franziskus appoints in February first cardinals
Pope Franziskus would call new cardinals of the Catholic church on the 22nd of February for the first time how the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are are the around highest clerics in the Catholic church after the pope and it it also, the one popes select so that Franziskus therewith the first group will appoint of men, who will co-operate in the end in the choice of its successor.
Presently there are 201 cardinals.
However a cardinal, who reached an age of 80 years, can participate, no longer in the pope choice – that falls a group of 120 "cardinals" entitled to vote to.
In an explanation, in which the message was announced, father Federico Lombardi, a speaker of the Vatican said would take place, it a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony would be held off to the appointment of the new cardinals, that would be well known also as a Konsistorium.
"Pope Franziskus concluded, its decision to the summoning of the Konsistoriums in February in advance well known to give, so that other meeting, that the participation of cardinals out of all world require, planned will can", said Lombardi.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of the cardinals entitled to vote probably would have sunk until February.
He explained, a pope appoints normally so many cardinals such as compel so that the number of the cardinals entitled to vote again 120 would amount to, and so many cardinals would like over 80, how he.
Let the Konsistorium in the next year be therefore significant because it would be the first since the choice of Franziskus in March these years, so Valero.
Presently there are one certain overhang on the part of Europe and especially Italy.
"It becomes interesting be to see, whether the new pope of cardinals out of the remainder of the world appoint becomes, around the balance to restore", said he.
Forty percent of the Catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
The cardinals will be also the first, that are called since the development of the advice established by Franziskus of the cardinals, a group of eight cardinals out of the entire world, that have the order to find possibilities to the reformation of the church.
In the past, the pope of all decided alone.
"Now has Franziskus these eight cardinals selected, that it help should", said Valero.
It explained, let it be "well possible" that Franziskus the cardinals around advice please.
Yet previously we were not in this situation – that is all entirely new.
Valero said that characteristically the bishops would be called out of large places to cardinals, but Franziskus of "full surprises would stick – we do not know therefore, whom he appoints".
