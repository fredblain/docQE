Country church largest Germany has an Offensivegestartet in order to advertise for the occupation of the pastor.
Background is a possible minister deficiency: The Protestant lutherische country church Hanover calculates therewith that the number its approximately 1,800 pastors and pastors will halve themselves to present situation presently until 2030.
For young people of today, let the occupation be very attractive and would offer good future outlooks, said pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in the conversation with the Protestant press service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the works and routine itself.
With Burfien, the country church delegated for the first time a pastor on a full place to enthuse young people for the theology study.
Currently always less young people decide after the graduation examination, to study theology.
Burfien attributes this to the process of the Entkirchlichung: "God voice is is quiet, the world loud".
At the same time the occupation of large freedom and variety would be stamped.
I am gentleman of my appointment calendar and can set there my focal points where it is important to me.
Pastors could be as a Seelsorger entirely near at the people.
They earned so much like teacher and could live well therefrom.
Certainly would be paid would have more in the free economy, but for that theologians a certain employer.
That comes the young people of today toward, whom it would concern not only career, but rather around a sense fulfilled work.
According to the country church, that comprises three-quarters of Lower Saxony, approximately 60 pastors go presently per year into the retirement.
Simultaneously about 40 graduates of a theology study begin its Vikariat.
In thinly populated outskirtss such as the resin, the Emsland or the turning point country could become future it heavy to occupy places.
Burfien wants to arrange among other things study day for young people and wants to invite in addition also prominent, the theology studied have.
The theology study offers a wide education.
One can become therewith even President of the Federal Republic.
