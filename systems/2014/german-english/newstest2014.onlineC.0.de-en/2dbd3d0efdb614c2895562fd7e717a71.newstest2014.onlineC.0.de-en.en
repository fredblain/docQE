Gutach: Yet more security for pedestrian
They stand removes no 100 meters from one another: On Tuesday the new B 33 was taken in Gutach-pedestrian traffic light at the village parking lot in operation - in visibility expanse of the older city hall traffic light.
Two plants so closely together: Intention or sign citizen stroke?
Gutachs mayor clearly answered this question yesterday.
"The city hall traffic light is certain at that time installs become, because this the school way", clarified Eckert yesterday.
The Kluser traffic light secures both cyclist and bus passengers and the Bergle inhabitants.
Let the plant official in operation taken yesterday be important to the intersection area Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße.
We have 'dug' the museum, two churches, cure park, the bus stop, a physician and a bank as well as the traffic river out of the residential area.
"In the high traffic recovery and pedestrian recovery must to its security a further traffic light here", so Eckert.
Also Peter Arnold of the mayor velvet confirms this open castle.
"According to current measurements pass through on the B 33 daily about 12,000 vehicles the community Gutach, therefrom are about ten percent heavy harvest traffic", emphasizes Arnold.
Therefore let the building of a further traffic light be more than necessary: "Security goes here simply before", so Arnold.
Altogether four traffic shows had been carried out, also a circle traffic was rejected angedacht, to be sure because of the narrow in the intersection area Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße again.
All was tested from according to Arnold in the location choice of the traffic light mast before: "By means of one extra for us with especially long wood tribes of loaded vehicles we have ausgestestet whether these vehicles can pull out out of the Sulzbachweg on the B 33 without snapping" the traffic light mast.
Traffic light plant expensive the round 15,000 Euro itself is that "most modern, what it presently on the market gives", clarified Arnold.
The plant is equipped with colored LEDs, that so strongly illuminate that the lights of the drivers are to be recognized for example also in depth standing sun well.
It is and thrifty also: The older lighting systems consume about 100 watts, the new just once eight watts.
Per direction, there are three lighting systems.
Arnold explained the technology of the new plant: This is equipped with two radar sensors.
If the pedestrian presses the traffic light button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation.
If the street is free, green comes directly for the pedestrian if not, lasts it about 15 seconds.
A radar sensor further tests whether the green phase can be concluded for the pedestrian.
"Should a group or gehbehinderte people over the street go, becomes the green phase extends, it comes therefore every certainly over the roadway", explained Arnold.
Naturally the driver had to follow here as a partner and had to observe the roadway.
This was not yesterday the case: Hardly the traffic light showed for pedestrian green, rustled an upper class vehicle through - in illuminating red.
