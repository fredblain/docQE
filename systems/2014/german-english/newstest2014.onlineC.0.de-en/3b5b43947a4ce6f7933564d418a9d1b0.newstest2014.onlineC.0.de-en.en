When the horse shows experts in multitudes in Cardiff appeared themselves, around the horse of the year to cures, was was aware, that a hard competition forthcoming for for them.
Yet none was prepared for the three years of old Fenton Kirkland.
The whippersnapper, that is not yet once in the kindergarten and made first a few months ago its first steps, and its Shetland pony Toffee trotted round and got loosely through the three the first price – where it 30 adult opponents behind itself let.
The inseparable couple, both equally largely, were praised because of its appearance, behavior and style in the annual competition, that is arranged by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
In its entrance in competition against men and women with elegant melons, he had mounted its plate cap in an impudent angle and led the two years of Toffee old through the ring.
Fenton was praised of the Juroren for its natural capacities in the contact with the pony, that would lie far over its age.
And Toffee received best note for its appearance and its personality.
Fenton had got Toffee last March as a gift to its third birthday and had practiced since then every day with the Shetland pony.
Its mother, Donna, 30, said: "Fenton and Toffee are a magnificent team".
They had to begin and went against the entire participant field with gold cup and Rosette of the place.
It was first the second time that it had participated with Toffee in a competition, and we were enthused everyone when it won.
Perfectly strange in the arenas considered it to be so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with it.
The boy small out of the village Nantyglo in the vicinity of Ebbw Vale, South whale, follows in the footprints of its aunt Sharon Howells that for more than ten years horses has shown.
Howells told: "the entire audience was how galvanizes and everyone have it fired up and geklatscht".
It ran on sand the entire length of the arenas and although it looked so minutely, performed it fantastic work.
Fenton is crazy after animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens around which he is concerned.
So how it is started, it will not last long, is until it on the "horses of the year" -show – and I am certain me that it will do well.
A speaker of the annual horse show said: "Fenton is first three, but he knows, like he with its pony go around must".
Together they are a crazy team.
The Juroren valued Fenton and Toffee after that how well they would have struck itself and would have presented in the show ring.
They pay attention to good collaboration between pony and leader – and there were Fenton and Toffee the best in the ring.
I am certain that Fentons contributed sweet clothing its part in addition, that fit really perfectly to the occasion.
