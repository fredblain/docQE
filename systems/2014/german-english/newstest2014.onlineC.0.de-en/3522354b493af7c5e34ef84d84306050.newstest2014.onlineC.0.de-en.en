Kindergarten found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands", says Winterlingens mayor Michael Maier.
The community sold the former kindergarten in the garden street at a private person.
The local council in its youngest session in the not public part agreed the sale.
The building changed its owner to an "appropriate" price.
"The community is satisfied", emphasizes Maier.
In the household, 100,000 Euro were prepared.
Yet clear is not how the new owner wants to use the earlier kindergarten.
It is the mayor right that Winterlingen delivered the responsibility for the building before the winter at someone to others and must arise therefore no longer for the support of the house to heat how, to view after the garden and to clear the sidewalk.
"This expense is now away", is happy Maier.
