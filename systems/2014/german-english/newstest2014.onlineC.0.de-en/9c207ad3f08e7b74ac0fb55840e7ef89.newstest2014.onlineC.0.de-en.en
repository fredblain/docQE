Jumbo manufacturers fight in the face of large orders over seat width
Between leading airplane manufacturers, it came to a discussion over the width of seats in the tourist class in long-range flights, what indicates the tone for a bitter collision on the Dubais Airshow this month.
The dispute revolves offered becomes around the seat width, the passengers in long flights in the tourist class – always that around which airlines strive most, but this expelled room does not place SOW the key for the efficiency statements in the newest airplanes of Airbus and Boeing Co. there.
Airbus demanded says this week an industry standard, that prescribes a seat width of at least 46 cm (18-inch) in the tourist class, but the US American archrival Boeing, the airlines should decide that.
The discussion comes at a time because the airplane manufacturers to sell therefore rivalries, even larger versions of its zweimotorigen long-range flyers, and expect at the organization of that 17th until 21st of November of record orders.
How the rear part of the airplane arranged is – especially whether it rows with nine or ten seats gives –, is decisively for the indicated economic results, that should deliver the new "mini jumbo" -to design.
Boeing maintains, its modernized "777X" would grasp 406 people in seats in the tourist class, that extend are over 17-inch and permit so ten per row.
Airbus explains, the competing version of the A350 conveys 350 people in 18-inch wide seats in the tourist class whereby there are nine per row.
Airplane giants distribute frequently blows over technical details by means of advertising in the specialty press.
Now Airbus appeals before the Dubais Airshow where the 777X with more than 100 orders will make presumably the race, directly at the public.
Did recently the business introduce a notice, that could be the start of a new notice war and showed financier a picture, in which three people sit bruised together in a restaurant, and in addition the title: "would become you that accept"?
"Boeing strikes long-range flights in seats before, that are narrower than regional Turbo Props", says Airbus sales and marketing boss John Leahy.
In view of changed eating, habits become the people thicker, but airplane seats did not change radically.
Between the early 1970ern when the Boeing 747 defined the modern long-range trip, and the end of the century the weight of the masculine average American between 40 and 49 years increased around ten percent, so the data of the US health ministry.
The waist circumference of the masculine average American in the 21st century amounts to 100.8 cm according to US American health statistics.
Airbus says, its rival would comply with a seat draft out of the 1950ern when the average body circumference of the freshly baptized "jet Set" more narrowly was.
Have, so Airbus, investigations carried out, that covered, that a (2.54 cm additional customs would increase) per seat the sleep quality around 53 percent.
Boeing challenges the numbers of Airbus to the seat measures and says, it stands to not to decide in the estimating of the manufacturers how airlines form the balance between flight tariffs and arrangement.
The business explains would hang also, according to investigations the experience in the airplane of more than the seat width off.
"It runs really on that out, airline flexibility to give, so that it that do can, what it in its opinion must, around successful to be", clarifies the flight cabin experts Kent Craver of Boeing.
They would not want that we dictate them, what makes it profitable.
They know its business better than every other.
For passengers, it concerns more elbow freedom, but for manufacturer, it becomes in increasing mass of a subject, that can affect the revenues.
Behind the discussion, a race stands around airplane orders with an appreciated volume of at least 700 billion U.S. dollars after Listenpreisen in the coming decades, what could affect persistently the export balances of the USA or Europe.
How Reuters reported in July for the first time, the seat layout is the driving power behind the discussion around the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing maintain 20 percent more efficiency per seat in its newest zweimotorigen long-range designs than the market leader in this segment, that 365-sitzige Boeing 77-300ER.
The statements Boeings on the results depend partially therefrom that the 777X with its ten seats is compared per row to the original design by nine seats in the 777.
The increased costs per unit are always even slighter than in presently related machines with ten seats per row.
"Boeing bruises therefore more seats into its airplane, around it more competitive to our products to make", says Kevin Keniston, leader for passenger comfort in the European Airbus.
On the other hand analysts, full cabins with ten seats say pointed per row in available 777s on that there that many passengers decided on the narrower arrangement, what could walk with cheap flight tariffs.
"Eighteen-inch seat width would be crazy for passengers, but the reality is: of an economic viewpoint out of is the Airbus offer of the threat through the 777 driven", says Mary Kirby, expert for cabin arrangement, founder and publisher of Runway Girl network.
Airbus and Boeing offer no seats, but rather a catalogue of supplier out of which the airlines can select.
The world traveling jets salesmen carry even tape measure with itself, around which to check arrangement in the competition.
Even if they extol the comfort, all manufacturers offer yet also jets with highly condensed arrangement for cheap airline and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with zehnsitzigen rows, sold however yet none according to own statements.
Until recently Airbus emphasized how importantly more Anpassbarkeit of the cabins would be and offered for some jets wide seats at the gears.
Without the support of the only jet large modern other manufacturer, experts say that the call probably would explode after a new industry standard, but could distract by the wave of 777X-Verkäufen.
