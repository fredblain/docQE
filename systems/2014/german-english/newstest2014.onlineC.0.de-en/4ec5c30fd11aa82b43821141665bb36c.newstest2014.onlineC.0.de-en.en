Published bomb with seat in Montreal also no flight test data for its brand-new airplane of the CSeries and delivered no new information about whether the airplane could go in accordance with the ambitious timetable in the next September into the commercial utilization.
On the boy distance flight of the test airplane one and a half months ago only three further starts followed until now what lets questionably appear it, whether the test phase passes planned how.
The results remained behind the prognoses back and led to a stock market crash of more than eight percent at the stock exchange of Toronto.
Cameron Doerksen, analyst in nationally bank financial, sank to on Thursday its estimation of "outperform" "sector perform" in the regard on that that the share in the next between one and two quarters possesses a limited course potential.
"To be sure became weaker delivery numbers in airplanes most extensive expects, but of the margin development in the carrier area are we very clearly disappoints", said Doerksen into a customer letter.
We are the view that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries, if the test program yelled at before for the airplane.
If to be sure in the coming months no new orders are announced, let's expect that the market becomes vis-à-vis the program more sceptically.
Bomb hopes that the airplane row of the CSeries can catapult the business into the lower market segment, that is dominated presently by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test airplane was introduced in March the public and flew to month-long delays for the first time in September.
Yet previously binding orders are for the CSeries with 177 moderate because potential buyers would like to wait and see for the results of the flight tests, whether the statements of the business are with respect to fuel efficiency and Kosteneinsparpotenzial of the new nozzle traffic airplane correct.
Presently there are altogether 403 orders and promises of 15 customers and companies.

"The test airplane more long on the ground remained than expects", Beaudoin did not say in a telephone conference and joined had been thereto, during the standing time of the airplane ground tests and software updates prepared.
Every manufacturer plans differently.
We concluded to undertake a first flight and to suspend then a revision period, what we did also.
That happens during the entire flight program.
The second of five test airplanes would start presumably in the next weeks, the remaining shortly after that, was named it of business side.
Nevertheless analysts remain sceptical whether twelve months after the boy distance flight the first customer can take an airplane of the CSeries in operation.
Bomb explained, would review it the planning for the starting (ICE) and would update this in the next months.
"The slow ahead step the flight test – also if it obviously Bombardiers of internal planning correspond – strengthens our view, that itself the starting on the first quarter 2015 shifts", said Doerksen.
