Tourism: Descent to the Romans
On approximately 120 meters length is beneath of Cologne a sewer out of the time of the Romans received.
He who visits Cologne, does not pass by at the cathedral.
Approximately 157 meters jut both towers into the sky and make it to the second-highest church building of Europe.
Yet only a few visitor who marvel at both delicate steeples, suspect that there is to be discovered a quantity also under the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is expert in things Cologne underworld.
Meeting place for its leaderships is the service center of Cologne tourism direct at the cathedral.
The tour begins very unspectacularly: "We catch in the underground garage at", says Schulze.
In the seventies, the city fathers wanted a car just city, and therefore only that remained stand of the remainders of the old city wall, what was not too large.
Most users of the park house hurry therefore today also at the Roman remnants past and turn down only its car.
Yet who more exactly views there, discovers a finding place detached archeological by metal bars in the park cover D2.
To see are about five meters ruins high out of handtellergroßen stones.
"It are remainders of the Roman city wall, that in the second half of the first century after Christ built became", tells Schulze.
Before it goes again back at the daylight, Schulze lets throw the participants on the upper park plain another view in a dark, depth of 15 meter of shaft.
That is the well of the old cathedral that unfortunately also is hardly perceived.
Next station of the tour is climb the Prätorium, and here again down the participants into the depth.
We experience here the seat of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the Prätors of the CCAA.
A visitor would like to know what means CCAA.
"The abbreviation stands for" Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium", what on well Germans so much like "city of Roman to the right and city of the Agrippinenser, established means under emperor Claudius at the place of the altar for the emperor cult"".
And in the Prätorium, it concerns the former governor palace, the power center of the Roman empire at the Rhine.
A tunnel access to the Roman sewer, that leads received is here on approximately 120 meters length by the lobby of the display.
"You can quietly a piece along the so-called Cloaca maxima go along, if you want", muntert Schulze the guests up.
A surprise still has Schulze.
After it got the key at the cash register, it leads the group to a depth of 16 meter, accessible shaft.
"We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath", explains it.
The Jewish community constructed its bath deeply into the ground in order to come at the ground water, that was inevitable for the ritual washings.
Until today are in the lower end of the Mikwe, whose origins into the eighth century return, different water levels through changing levels of the Rhine readably.
The Mikwe becomes part of an archeological zone on the city hall place, for which the structural work should begin briefly.
To the completion will pass however a few more years.
