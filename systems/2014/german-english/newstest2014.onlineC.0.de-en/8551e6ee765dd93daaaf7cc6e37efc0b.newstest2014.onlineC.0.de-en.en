Early puberty: Faster adult become
Afroamerikanische and hispanische girl tend to reach sooner puberty than its white age comrades how investigations show.
Physical variations do not mean yet directly puberty
There is no record that hormone or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe, the epidemic obesity would be a trigger of the early puberty
The trend to the early puberty is stamped fewer with boy
The earlier CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specialized in child health and family subjects.
Should a mother be provided if its daughter already in the age of seven or of eight years breasts and shame hairs grow?
In the annual conference of the pediatrician association American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, explained the pediatric Endokrinologe Dr. Paul Kaplowitz that these early physical variations would be relatively normally under American girls and represented a new standard.
"I spend much time therewith, parents to calm – normally is that no sign, that now quickly puberty enters", clarified Kaplowitz.
Obvious notices of the development how for example growing breasts, shamed hairs and shoulder hairs as well as body smell, appear with girl earlier.
Nevertheless there was only an easy postponement in the age of the Menarche (appearance of the first rule hemorrhage) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is about 12.5 years, something less than 12.75 in the year 1970.
"If the development of the breasts begins, takes it longer at least two to three years to the Menarche", said Kaplowitz, also author of the book "early puberty with girl: The essential counselor to the contact with this frequently appearing problem".
Time is the most exact test how puberty yelled at before.
It is disputed, what represents actually the start of puberty, but it counts "precocious" if the breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth spurt before an age by eight years.
In most cases, the process slows down or stagnates – something, that a pediatrician exactly supervise can.
In faster ahead step, tests could be indicated by an Endikronologen so that serious problems such as Tumore or cysts can be excluded.
There are treatment methods for delaying an early menstruation and the defense another consequence: the premature aging of the bones that can lead as an ultimatum to growth inhibition and therewith small body growth with adult.
The recommendations for a medicinal or hormonelle therapy orient themselves towards the age of the child, the development speed, the growth rate and the emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is reservedly, what concerns medicines, but it clears: "the suppressing of puberty can behavior problems and the feelings of girl soften, unlike its age comrade to be".
The other large problem is intelligible: Parents would not want simply that its very young daughters have the period.
"You provide yourself because of the pregnancy risk or about, like it the hygienic side handle", said Kaplowitz.
"It was a shock", remembers a woman whose daughter with ten got its days.
Also if there were first signs and had spoken we over menstruation, emotionally was not prepared it.
It came frightens and excited of the school home because it was that not until its circle of friends.
There are many comprehensively published theories over the causes of premature puberty.
No conclusive proofs exist yet for that that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media would be causal.
Boy come similar to girl earlier into puberty.
Kaplowitz is convincing would be the view, that premise the epidemic of the obesity.
It supported the execution of a study in 2001 over girl in the age of six to nine years, who produces a context between body fat and the entrance into puberty.
Other investigations support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, afroamerikanische and hispanische girl reach tendency sooner puberty than its white age comrades.
There are for that different explanations.
Globally an early puberty of all possible things seems influenced to be, of economy conditions over the climate to the genes.
A further riddle: Although boy the face hair and shame hair already earlier are awake, the trend to a complete earlier puberty is not stamped so like with girl.
Other physicians on the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the subject.
The emerging of Akne and pubic hair is spread even in baby and infants.
"We must be careful, like we the true start of puberty identify", said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric Endokrinologe at the Goryeb Children's it hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to be advised of its pediatrician how they should speak with its child.
"That can mean, that one earlier than an expected a conversation lead must", advised Kaplowitz.
If one remains quiet, the child reacts normally good.
Girl, who early erblühen, need the insurance, that is the process a normal part of life, even if it enters thought earlier than.
