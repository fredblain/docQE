Security objection in Mozambique grow in view of of collisions between influential personalities
Thousands people of met itself in the center Maputos under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the country founder and first President Mozambique in order to tune in a rare public demonstration peace call.
"We want again peace, we want stability", said Vanessa de Sousa, manager of an Investment business.
Out of anxiety around the future of the country, it has demand exchanged its business clothing against a T Shirt with the inscription "we security" on Portugese and joined on Thursday the quantity on the independence place of the capital.
For two weeks there has been nearly daily report on collisions between government powers and Renamo, that are among the worst combats since the peace agreement before more than 20 years.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, that became initial of that of white reigned Rhodesia and later the Apartheitsregierung of South Africa supported in the exertion, to destabilize the independent government of the country.
After the peace contract of 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts consider it to be unlikely that the country fall back again into a fully grown conflict, but the youngest events disturbed foreign investors and domestic.
For the quickly growing economy, much stands could on the game, for the discovery of gigantic gas occurrence before the coast and coal warehouse in the northwest investments of more than 50 billion U.S. dollars of firms such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil in the next years, Eni from Italy and Anadarko out of the USA into the country bring.
The reigning Frelimo party, since 1975 the dominating power, and Renamo have given itself mutually the guilt for the tensions.
Renamo maintains, the government had provoked the youngest collisions in that it on the 17th of October its members in the province Sofala, a traditional stronghold Renamos would have attacked.
That would spread escalated on the earlier rebels, attacked and tried Renamo base than a government troops to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, explained Renamos speaker vis-à-vis the Financial Times.
The government gives Renamo the guilt for the collisions and accuses the organization to have attacked soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza tried to deemphasize objection over an instability.
Opposite AFP, that French news agency, said he on Wednesday that Dhlakama would regard itself as a "loser", who wants to devote "all its yet remaining energy, in order to prove that he can" force the government its decisions.
Both Frelimo and Renamo emphasize that they would like to avoid a war.
Yet the objections increased since Mazanga was quoted with the words, Renamo gives that peace agreement of 1992 up.
It explained had meant opposite of the FT, therewith it that Frelimo would respect the agreement no longer.
"Our vision is it, again negotiations to receive and to be sure seriously", said Mazanga.
Earlier conversations between the parties contributed only few to the settlement of the tensions, that were fueled by a row of collisions this year.
"We have here two adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama), that the heads collide", means Joseph Hanlon, instructor at the opuses University and Mozambique expert.
No of them is is good in the negotiating and none ready to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo that presses on choice reforms already explained, it would boycott the municipal elections in November.
Presidency choices and parliament choices are planned for next year.
Some commentators interpreted the use of force as the attempt of a kränkelnden movement to obtain concessions and financial privileges of the government.
Renamos choice successes have shrunk since 1992 while a newer party that will improve itself of an earlier Renamo member established Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM), probably in the choices.
Mazanga maintains that Guebuza – its resignation stands, if its second tenure in the next year ends – wanted destroy the democracy of the country.
"It wants no more parties democracy, it wants no transparent choices, it wants no peace, because it the president office do not abandon wants", so Mazanga.
It is controlled unclear, which capacities Renamo, but it undertook unrest establishing attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important north-south-connection.
Most combats took place in the province Sofala, that lies several hundred kilometer north of Maputo, in which however Beira is, that harbor, that mountain construction companies such as Rio use Tinto and Vale to the export of coal.
In June Rio interrupted a month long the utilization of the railroad after Renamo had announced an attack on the stretch.
Mazanga answered reservedly on the question whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted "the international partnership warn, that the things in Mozambique not well stand", said Mazanga.
The instability yet had increased the frustration over the government, says Fernando Lima, leader of Mediacoop, an independent medium business, for many people provided themselves already because of the corruption, the dragging progress in the development and one recently kidnapping wave.
"The people think, that the government and the president for the future of the country are responsible and he that one be should, the solutions for the problems finds", explains he.
Omar sultan, a demonstrator, said, the people wanted simply only stability.
"None interest Renamo and Frelimo, it want simply only again peace and usable streets", explained it.
