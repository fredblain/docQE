Also if the SG Achim/bathing has been for four days of play without victory, good mood rules in the hand ball Oberligisten further.
On that trainer Tomasz Malmon lets generally no doubts.
Everyone fully is motivated further in the thing.
Nevertheless I hope that we win finally also once again.
"For I knows already not at all more, like such a victory tastes", expects Malmon a sense of achievement of its team in the VfL Fredenbeck II.
Also if the third league reserve pulled out up-to-date yet no trees out of Fredenbeck, Malmon in the forefield lifts warning the index finger.
I trained many players self yet in the A youth.
They will be motivated against its former coach certainly very especially by therefore.
"Moreover counts it to await, whether then yet strengthening out of the first at the same time is", clarifies the SG coach.
In order to return finally again into the success trace, the Malmon team in comparison with the past entrances must increase in any case.
First and foremost in the cover work and in the shift game, it lacked finally yet powerfully.
Also the chance utilization must become definitively better.
Therefore I hope that my players freely got the head during the short recess finally.
