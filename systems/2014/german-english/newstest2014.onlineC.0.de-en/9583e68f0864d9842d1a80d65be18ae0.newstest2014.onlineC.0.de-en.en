Joy city: Hosts take by surprise fast actions
With a narrow Kader, the Mr. I of the TSV joy city in the Schiller school gymnasium in Reutlingen against the TG Gönningen of the Swabian Alb had to begin.
The Älbler stood to be sure with a learned team on the other network side.
Soon appeared however that they not entirely were able to keep up, also age-related, with the fast actions of the joy city-dweller.
With the hard and placed had trouble impacts the Gönninger extremely.
Repeatedly they missed the passports passed by Simon tavern and Eduard Schulz cleanly over the network middle and attacks and were in the block defense not to the place.
Two high first sentence profits expressed clearly the superiority of the joy city-dweller in all concerns.
In view of this earth moving and game certain achievement, the third sentence was won then somewhat lax and listless to the 3:0-Endstand (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
Because on the 2nd of November with the TV Baiersbronn becomes, that clearly was able to prevail in Nagold, an opponent more high-performance substantially on the field stand.
TSV joy city I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon tavern and Eduard Schulz.
In the B class, the second teams stood themselves in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn out of Baiersbronn and joy city vis-à-vis.
They delivered a hard fought over two-hour-Match.
Nervousness on both sides caused above all in the ball acceptance mistake and point gifts; also in the passports was the precision sometimes scarce commodity and in some critical game scenes prevented of the overzealousnesses the view for possible point profits.
In this achievement moderate very balanced encounter, the large physical use and a pleasant engagement of both teams agreed in the TSV team of Marcus Blasutto however throughout.
