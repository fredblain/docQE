Traffic light on duration red: Pay attention to wait
Sometimes a traffic light becomes simply not green.
The contact bow in the street does not react, or the light sign is defective.
What should one do then - should go in red?
A concerned long waited enough at a red traffic light and is the intersection free, it can continue, explains the Stuttgarter lawyer Ralf Becker in the periodical "motorcycle".
The wait had to be however "appropriate", what differently could be displayed from case to case.
Becker advises, at least five minutes await from before of a malfunction of the traffic light to go out is.
He who continues the trip in spite of red light, had to be itself however in the clear about the fact that it carries for an accident caused through it the full guilt.
He who tolerated himself less than five minutes, does not wait under circumstances long enough, warns Becker and refers checked to a decision of the federal court.
In the negotiated case, a driver had ignored and had to answer after about three minutes duration red the traffic light for a careless red light offence.
The traffic light was namely not defective, but rather burst little later on green over.
A load ban remained it because of the special situation saved - the fine however not.
