Johanna Rahner wants to investigate in the forum of the question how then today the people classify the "last things" after death.
If the people in the past centuries had known therefrom too much and had set at the same time on those pictures of sky and hell, "that until today our presentations stamp", would draw themselves the contemporary prophetic apprenticeship of the hopes for completion sooner through a certain embarrassment or quite speechlessness from.
"The larger hope is Christians and Christians through the religion criticism proper expelled become", says the advisor.
It had furnished "us with so many question marks, come seem" that the exclamation points missing to its to us.
Johanna Rahner says further: "But the decisive challenge remains the annoyance of death".
Therewith connected would be that ask about that longing, "that therefrom dreams, that at the end all well its would like".
