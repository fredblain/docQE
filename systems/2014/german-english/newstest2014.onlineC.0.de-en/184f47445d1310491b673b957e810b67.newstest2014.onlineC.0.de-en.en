Are elite Europe ready to make with Great Britain of businesses?
Business for Britain was started in April with the intention to bring and to define the economy at a table, what that would like to change, that provide in Great Britain for prosperity and work, at our relations to the EU.
To this purpose, we gave the largest and most comprehensive survey under British business leaders in order and asked it, what it over Great Britain, that think economy and the EU.
YouGov questioned over 1,000 managements out of the economy, that portray into about the British business sizes, -sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We found out that the predominant majority of the businesses exports outside of Europe in the meantime and concentrates on countries, that modernize and grow, while the countries stagnate in the EU.
They wish for that by government side new trade connections with countries such as China, India and Brazil are favored instead of staying with the long and strenuous process, to reform the obscure EU institutions.
Ask about its view to certain legally regulated subjects – of the cartel right to the product legislation – is the majority the business leaders the view that become should gotten back control of these key competences after Westminster.
General discontent ruled over the domestic market because according to statements of the businesses the costs of that would predominate Brussels directions in the meantime the advantages to be part of Europe trade zone – even 40 percent of the large firms agreed that to, that are traditional at the Europe friendliest.
In the end, and that says probably most, yielded our inquiry of business leaders that a clear majority wishes for of Great Britain a course toward variation of the agreement and a relation to the EU that is based on trade, not on politics.
This insight, that is found in business of all sizes and leading groups, shows that the economy presses on a "meaningful variation", that brings the notebook of the actions again to Great Britain.
It concerns much – a change of the agreement and better conditions for Great Britain would lead in 16 percent to an opinion change for the benefit of the whereabouts in the EU in a referendum.
The prime minister should have no doubts: This survey shows that the British economy stands behind its plan for the renegotiations of the British conditions for the EU membership.
It shows also that the businesses of a renegotiation expect a clear postponement of the power ratios back to Great Britain.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and in increasing mass necessary after the Eurozone moves now toward a narrower economy and Fiskalunion.
Jobs and growth in Great Britain must be the priority how the result of our survey shows, what means for business a reinforced attention on trade and a fundamental variation in that Brussels extension for directions.
