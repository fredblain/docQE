Of the British government, a study was announced, that should increase the advantages of the HS2-Eisenbahnprojekts for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd is proposed to realize already with start of phase 1 in 2026 high speed connections between Scotland and the north of England.
Transportation minister baroness Kramer said, the project "more closely will join" Great Britain.
The Scottish transportation minister Keith Brown explained, he would be delighted very to work with the British government at this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high speed train connection between London and the west Midlands.
After conclusion of phase 2, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June the government corrected the appreciated costs for the building of the high speed street between London and northern England of 32.7 billion pounds on 42.6 billion pounds.
HS2 Ltd the British government, that stands into conversations with carrier Scotland, delegated to search for further stretch capacities and trip time improvements for northern England and Scotland.
In addition the possibility of a trip time of in the end three hours or fewer of Glasgow and Edinburgh belongs to London.
Baroness Kramer said: "our goal for HS2 is a really national stretch network, the Great Britain and its cities more closely joins".
We precede with HS2 because it entails enormous advantages.
Without it, we stand before a capacity crisis in our train network.
Yet it concerns also the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, that is improved thanks to HS2.
The Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented on: "the current announcement is a good message for Scotland".
In the name of the Scottish government, Keith Brown Carmichael requested to support "unmistakable" the Scottish linking into the HS2-Netzwerk.
Brown said: "the high speed train connection rescues the potential of enormous economic advantages for Scotland, simultaneously delivers however also the economic strength of Scotland an argument for fast train connections throughout Great Britain".
Therefore we are delighted when partners of the British government to work and to examine the option for a high speed train connection in Scotland, that creates advantages for everyone and supplements the connection Glasgow Edinburgh, that the Scottish government already plans.
I am happy on that to test the investigation report with the British ministers in the next year and to conclude jointly the next steps.
