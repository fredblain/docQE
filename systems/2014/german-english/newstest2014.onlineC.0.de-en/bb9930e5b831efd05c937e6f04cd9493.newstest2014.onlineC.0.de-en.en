Esa decides over large space missions: Missions for billions
Distant planets, gravitation waves or black holes - experts of the European space flight agency must agree now on two large projects, that want to start it in the next years.
30 suggestions stood are to the selection, five yet in the race.
Distant worlds.
More than 1000 planets in other stars already found astronomer.
Whether there is life at least on some of them, knows no.
The selection falls heavily: Should one search for gravitation waves?
Investigate or rather the origin of the cosmos?
Search or after earth similar planet and discover therewith perhaps extraterrestial life?
These questions stand just the responsibles of the European space flight agency Esa.
For its program "Cosmic vision" they seek ideas for two large space flight projects, that should advance the cause of the research decisively.
The budget for such "L missions" is respectively about about a billion Euro.
The start will be presumable 2028 and 2034.
Beginning of September met in Paris the elite of the European space research in order to discuss suggestions for such missions.
30 ideas were came up for debate, five therefrom now into the narrower choice.
Numerous groups appraise the suggestions, hook at the researchers after.
In the next days, a final decision should fall through the scientific program committee.
The Esa selected altogether four large questions, on which the missions of the 2007 initiated program "Cosmic vision" answers should find.
What are the conditions for the origin of planets and life?
The exact processes in the origin of stars out of large gas clouds - and therewith also the origin of planets, that these stars circle - lie still in the proverbial dark.
A large infrared telescope in that all this darkly could permeate.
Does and if a star planets possess, under which circumstances life can emerge there?
In order to investigate this question, the space telescope "Cheops" should start 2017, with which 500 already well known planet systems in our nearer environment more exactly are examined.
The possibilities are limited however, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million Euro.
With larger instruments, the astronomers could portray earth similar planets and could analyze even the composition of its atmospheres and search so for "organic markers" : Gases that apply as an indication to biological activity.
How does the solar system function?
Also this question should give last of all information about that, which prerequisites there are for the origin of life.
An important roll plays the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field as well as the particle radiation outgoing by it with the planet system.
In our solar system, these processes can be examined in an exemplary manner.
With the "solar Orbiter", the Esa allowed already a mission of the M class (there is the budget about about a half billion Euro) for this question.
The probe should start 2017 and exactly should observe surface and activity of the sun.
Of large interest for the researchers, also Jupiter and its moons are.
They want to find out, whom roll played the giant planet in the development of the solar system.
For that the Esa plans the first of the altogether three L missions of the "Cosmic vision" -program.
The probe "Juice" (Jupiter Icy Moons explorer) begins its trip presumably 2022.
It later reaches eight years Jupiter and should examine the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy moons Europe, Kallisto and Ganymed.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The universe offers many possibilities to study matter under extreme conditions and to examine so, whether that confessed nature laws there still validly are to us.
Perhaps also deviations, that could the physicists the way to a new theory of wise, are found, under whose roof all well known nature laws can be united.
How did the universe emerge and from where it exists?
Before 13.7 billion years, our cosmos was caused by the Big Bang.
Next to matter familiar us, out of the stars, planet and living thing how we exist, gives it dark matter, whose gravity holds together galaxies and galaxy pile, and dark energy by whose causing the expansion of the universe speeds up.
Until now the researchers know exist neither, which physical laws in the first fractions of a second of the Big Bang were valid, yet from where dark matter and dark energy.
With "Euclid", the Esa allowed also here already a M mission, whose start is planned for 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe should examine the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time at the entire sky and should enable so conclusions on the state of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could make the race
Of the 30 suggestions will remain at the end of the selection procedure only two remaining.
The best chances for a permission as a L mission "E Lisa", a demanding draft to the proof of gravitation waves has in the opinion of many experts.
Under that physicists understand changes in the structure of the room time that Albert Einstein had predicted before almost 100 years.
Proved became it until today not.
Elisa could create that, hope the scientists behind the project.
The mission plans one out of two or three probes existing detector, that becomes all stationed in that.
It could prove in contrast to plants on the earth also gravitation waves, could deliver that emerged in the Big Bang, and so new insights over the origin of the cosmos.
Four further suggestions compete yet around the second L mission: a large x-ray telescope by the name of "Athena" that should investigate among other things black holes, "Icy planet it", a further mission to the external planets of the solar system, "Prism", a mission to the measurement of the cosmic background radiation, and that "exoplanet Finder" that earth similar planets should track down and examine.
Already eliminated are suggestions to the rehearsing back carrier of Mars among other things, to the investigation of moon, Venus and asteroid as well as to sun physics.
