Security concerns in Mozambique grow amid clashes between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered in the center Maputos under the watchful eyes of the statue of the founder and first president, Samora Machel of Mozambique to sing in a rare public demonstration calls for peace.
"We want peace, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, director of an investment company.
Fear for the future of the country, their business attire for a T-shirt with the words "we demand security" traded in Portuguese, and on Thursday joined the crowd in Independence Square in the capital.
For two weeks, there are almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, which are among the worst fighting since the peace agreement over 20 years ago.
RENAMO was formerly a notorious rebel movement that was initially supported by the white government of Rhodesia and later of the Apartheit government of South Africa in a bid to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the 1992 peace treaty, she became an opposition party.
Analysts consider it unlikely that zurueckfalle the country back into a full-blown conflict, but recent events have alarmed foreign investors and locals.
Much is at stake for the rapidly growing economy, because the discovery of huge gas reserves off the coast and coal camps in the northwest could invest in the next few years to more than $50 billion from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the US.
The ruling FRELIMO Party, the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo are blaming each other for the tension.
RENAMO claimed that the government was provoked by the recent clashes on October 17, its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold of Rena Mos, would have attacked.
The escalated attacks on the former rebels, as government troops tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama and Renamo - bases attacked, leader of the group, said Rena, spokesman for the Financial Times.
The government has accused Renamo of blame for the clashes and the organization that attacked soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to downplay concerns about instability.
Compared to AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama regard themselves as "losers" who "wants to use all of its remaining forces to prove that the government can impose its decisions."
FRELIMO and Renamo both stress that they want to avoid a war.
But the concerns have increased since Maza Nga was quoted as saying that Renamo was the 1992 peace agreement.
To the FT he declared that he meant that FRELIMO does not respect the agreement.
"Our vision is to resume negotiations and seriously," said Maza Nga.
Previous talks between the parties have contributed little to resolving the tensions that have been fueled by a series of clashes this year.
"Here we have two adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama), who heads collide," said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and an expert on Mozambique.
None of them is good in bargaining and no one is willing to make the necessary concessions.
RENAMO, which is pushing for electoral reforms, has already stated that it will boycott the local elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt to ailing movement, concessions and financial concessions from the government.
Rena's electoral success since 1992, while a newer party shrink from a former Renamo member, Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM), probably will improve in the elections.
Maza Nga said that Guebuza, whose resignation comes when his second term ends next year - wants to destroy the democracy of the country.
"He does not want a multi-party democracy, he wants no transparent elections, he does not want peace, because he does not want to give up the presidency," said Maza Nga.
It is unclear what Renamo capacities, but she has made disruptive attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important North-South ties.
Most of the fighting took place in the province of Sofala, which lies a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, Beira, but finds itself in the port, mining companies like Rio Tinto and Vale for the export of coal.
In June, a month after the use of the railway after Renamo announced an attack on the track.
Maza Nga responded cautiously to the question of whether Renamo will repeat that threat.
RENAMO wanted to "warn the international community that things are not good in Mozambique," said Maza Nga.
The instability has increased frustration with the government, said Fernando Lima, Head of Media Coop, an independent media company, because many people already worried about the corruption, the slow progress in development and a recent Entfuehrungs wave.
"People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and he should be the one to find solutions to the problems," he says.
Omar sultans, a protester, said that people simply wanted stability.
FRELIMO and Renamo "no interest, they simply want to regain peace and usable roads," he said.
