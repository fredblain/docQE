Kenyan press outraged by controversial media law
"We are in an appalling situation, and we might ask: What does the parliament from tomorrow, to abolish the judicial independence?," was to read in the newspaper, which does not consider the draft law for the constitution.
"The law is draconian and very true, and we refuse," said Cyrus Kamau, executive director of the Capital Group, including Capital FM, one of the most respected independent radio stations and news websites in Kenya.
He said that the new media tribunal "will always be biased, because it is an extension of the government," and restrictions on content and advertising will damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the President listens to us and we urge him to reject this bill and send to the Parliament," he said.
According to the newspaper The Star will take the government by the new law "effectively in a stranglehold on the media." By contrast, The Standard, democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya "suffered" a severe blow, and described the proposal as "draconian."
The adoption of the law is one of a series of measures designed to enhance national security following the attacks by armed militants on the Westgate shopping mall in September.
The Kenyan media incurred the wrath of the authorities, because they published photographs of security cameras, which showed how robbing units dispatched to the scene, the luxurious shopping center.
Police chief David Kima Iyo responded with the Einbestellung two journalists and a leading media Vertreters for interrogation, even if the summons was withdrawn after an outcry from the media.
Under the new law, media companies can be punished with a fine of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists with up to a million, and the risk of losing their professional recognition or excluded from the official press accreditation.
The tribunal also has the right to confiscate the property of the people concerned, if a penalty is not paid.
According to Daily Nation "can have a single penalty most radio stations in bankruptcy."
Moreover, the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating impact on their description of "lively blogosphere" to Kenya.
If it would silence the media, politicians could do whatever they want with impunity.
"No one will ever know," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, journalist in the nation, which defines the Kenyan media as a decisive factor of control in public life.
"Politicians are left to themselves, they lead the country into bankruptcy and back to the time of hunters and gatherers," he commented.
The Kenyan legislators have already moved in the past, the public anger.
In May, they agreed to make the cuts ordered by the national Verguetungs Commission and put their hearty tax-free salaries of about 532,000 shillings per month reinstated - they are among the world's highest.
