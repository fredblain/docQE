Profit at Bombardier after decline in supply figures and contracts
The Canadian plane and train manufacturer Bombardier Inc on Thursday reported a 15 percent decline in net profit, after he was advised by declining orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and contract problems in the rail sector under pressure.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, a flight test data for his brand-new aircraft of the contract and gave no new information about whether the plane could go according to the ambitious timetable next September in commercial use.
The maiden flight of the test aircraft so far, only three other launches were followed by a year and a half months, which makes it doubtful whether the testing phase is proceeding as planned.
The results remained behind the forecasts and resulted in a drop of more than eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst with National Bank Financial, on Thursday lowered its rating of "outperform" from "sector perform" in view of the fact that the shares in the next one to two quarters a limited rate potential.
"Even though there are fewer delivery figures for aircraft detection, but clearly we are disappointed by the margins of development in the transport sector," Doerksen said in a client note.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the contract, if the test program is progressing for the plane.
But if there are no new orders in the coming months, we expect that the market is more skeptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the aircraft of the contract can catapult the company into the lower market segment, which is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was presented in March after months of delays and flew to the public for the first time in September.
But so far are binding orders for the contract with 177 moderate, because potential buyers want to wait and see the results of the flight tests whether the claims of the company in terms of fuel efficiency and cost saving potential of the new Duesen transport aircraft.
There are currently a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
CEO Pierre Beaudoin, Bombardier is confident that it will achieve its goal of 300 firm orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the jets.
Corporate governance also assured on Thursday with analysts and media, the program is in the schedule.
"The test plane is no longer expected to remain on the ground," Beaudoin said during a conference call, adding that during the life of the aircraft had been scheduled soil tests and software updates.
Each manufacturer is different.
We have decided to take a first flight and attach an Ueberarbeitungs period, what we have done.
This is happening throughout the flight program.
The second of five test planes will probably start in the next few weeks, the remaining shortly thereafter, it said on the part of companies.
However, analysts remain skeptical that it can take twelve months after the maiden flight of a plane's first customer of the contract.
Bombardier said that it checked the planning for the start-up (EIS) and will update this in the next few months.
"The slow progress of the flight test - even if they are obviously Bombardiers internal planning - reinforces our view that the commissioning of the first quarter of 2015," Doerksen said.
