One of the most sophisticated tunnel for drug smuggling between the U.S. and Mexico, which was equipped with lighting, ventilation and electrical railway operations, was now being discovered.

The tunnel, which runs in the Zickzack pattern over a length of six football fields, linking warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
In the area, there are countless unassuming warehouses, making it easier to hide trucks loaded with drugs.
The tunnel had been closed before the drugs could be transported to the authorities.
With the discovery of the tunnel had been eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine, according to the records of the court.
THREE men who worked as a driver, according to the authorities, were charged with the possession and intended sale of marijuana and cocaine.
If found guilty, he will face prison sentences of between ten years and life.

The tunnel is the eighth major passage, which was discovered in 2006 in San Diego.
