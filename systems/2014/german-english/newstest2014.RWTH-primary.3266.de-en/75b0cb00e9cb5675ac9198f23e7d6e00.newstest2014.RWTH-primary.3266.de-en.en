Council takes track systems targeted
"The deers" transition to the extensive rebuilding in order to improve road safety?
Yes, local councils have decided.
Schiltach, for 220,000 euros.
Deutsche Bahn wants to improve next year, has brought forward the rail route.
In particular, to increase the safety of railroad crossings - it is regularly nationwide to collisions of trains with other vehicles.
The rebuilding of the communities, they must participate with one third of the cost, the rest share and covenant.
Schilt Achs city architect Roland Grießhaber explained to the municipal council on the specifics of the Bahuebergangs "deer."
There, the city plans to build the tunnel in Mundes west of the railway tracks a bulge.
There may be bigger cars, for example, those carrying logs, are at oncoming traffic without having to block the tracks.
Grießhaber proposed to construct a necessary supporting wall so that the city could widen the street from time to time to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This was discussed in the municipal council is controversial because some councillors questioning the need for road expansion: Thomas Kipp, the mood of the critics, saying: "We have to take so much money for so few vehicles in the hand?"
Mayor Thomas Haas disagreed: The railway crossing "deer" will be used regularly for long wooden Transporte.
Even wood from the area, in part, "Kuhbach" will be transported via this route because they could not use the vehicles up to 20 metres the track at the Haeberle bridge, because they could not turn to the main street.
Moreover, the line serves as a diversion for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is blocked, Haas argued.
It is clear that Kirch would have to be rebuilt and renovated mountain and Schlossberg tunnel, as is currently the case, the Wolf River "on" deer "also have an important traffic for a longer period.
The council agreed to investigate what's intended enlargement costs would cause the street.
Regardless of the reconstruction of the railway was agreed by a majority of transition with the proviso that the retaining wall is being built so that the city's subsequent road towards "Bahnhofstrasse" for meeting traffic could eventually expand to around 5.5 meters.
The renovation of the railway crossing in the tanning Trautwein may have a different problem, the access to the steeply rising "Geroltzhaeuser path" concerns.
The administration had to examine the restructuring plans of the railway from the engineering office Breinlinger, because she had doubts about whether the planned end of the Geroltzhaeuser way then possible.
The investigation concluded that it is not excluded that the tilt of the street could lead to "prolonged vehicles.
The responsibility for this, in turn, enter the city as a Straßenbaulasttraegerin.
The disputes could drag the liability.
Because both worked wood collection and turning in the current state of development, should they not agree to the reconstruction of the rail crossing, Haas argued.
At this point is also the risk of a collision of turn with a vehicle in the transition to much lower than in the other crossings, because is the next stop in the middle, which is a good view.
Even the streets, even at this point would have to be slowed down as far as that of a collision.
The reconstruction of this train, because the city's consent has been denied by the majority of the problem with aufsitzenden Schiltach vehicles "would have to pay," said the councils, which could withdraw the train after the construction of the responsibility.
The Panel considers as problematic the conversions of the crossings "in Heubach" and "Kuhbach," Kreuzungs agreements already made for the train.
