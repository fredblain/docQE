Firefighters managed to bring a dog to safety, which was stranded on a 15 metre high ledge in a rock wall.
The nine-month old Cocker Spaniel bitch Ruby was runaway after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone, before it was rescued on Wednesday from a quarry.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend, Becky Hall, 20, including the dog, came to the quarry Flap Pit in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to take Ruby to welcome and thank the firefighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had been searching desperately for their missing dog and published calls in social networks when it was bolted to the traffic accident in the quarry.
At approximately 14:15 p.m. on Wednesday saw a walkers who executed his dog, Ruby's stranded on a 15 -metre-high (in the quarry.
The technical rescue team rushed to the site of the Cleckheaton Fire Station and seilte themselves to save Ruby's, which was then transported in a dog crate.
Andy Clayton, a specialist of technical rescue team, said: "She was in a dangerous situation.
It was in the middle of the cliff - only 15 meters from the top and the bottom.
They did not muscle during their rescue - she was steifgefroren.
But now it is a good thing.
Then she has eaten a few dogs.
That was a pretty unusual.
The fact that the dog was found, is incredible.
Peter Lau, a specialist of technical rescue team, said: "Ruby had a giant luck."
There was the possibility that she was very seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet to investigate, but said nothing except fatigue and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "Watching the rescue was scary."
I could not believe that it was really up there.
It was wonderful to keep them back to the poor.
The veterinarian if they become too large and the exhaustion would have collapsed, they probably would have sunk.
The firemen have done a splendid job.
It was really brave what they have done.
We are just so grateful and every one of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson added: "Most Influential People, we were afraid that she would fall, but they remained at the top."
The firemen were great.
I can hardly believe, where she was.
