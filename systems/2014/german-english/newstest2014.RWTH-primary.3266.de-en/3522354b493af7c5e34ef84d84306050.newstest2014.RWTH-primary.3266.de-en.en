"The building is in good hands," says Winterlingens Mayor Michael Maier.
The former kindergarten in the municipality has sold to a private person.
The sale did not agree with the Council, in its most recent meeting in the public component.
The building, its owner at a "reasonable" price.
"The community is satisfied," said Maier.
In the budget were earmarked EUR 100,000.
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten.
The mayor is right that winter, the responsibility for the building before the winter to someone else, and thus do not have to pay more for the entertainment of the house to heat up as to look after the garden and the sidewalk.
"This effort is now gone," says Maier.
