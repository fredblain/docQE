Frontier Airlines charges for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines to require plans to $100 for passengers who want to pack in a carry-on bag.
Frontier Airlines intends to up to $100 for a piece of hand luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, even if the announcement on Wednesday that passengers would keep the whole box.
The new fee applies for hand luggage in the baggage compartment above the seat, small pockets in the seat remain free.
Frontier said that $25 be emitted if they pay the fee in advance, and $100 for travelers who paid at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O "Malley said that the fee of $100 was intended to encourage travelers to look ahead to the payment.
"We do not want to compute this sum," she said.
Airlines began in 2008, for the first and second checked baggage fees.
Passengers who tried to get around this, therefore, as much as possible in your hand luggage, with the result that the baggage compartments above the seats are crowded.
Fees are a way to get passengers to take less on board.
O "Malley said, the new fee is not really a question of earning money.
It was the most loyal customers of Frontier, which would have clearly expressed that it will be increasingly difficult to find space in the box on the seat.
Passengers who buy tickets on the website of the airline, do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger must check in at the gate of Frontier, a piece of luggage for free, but the next person must pay $100 for a comparable piece of luggage.
O "Malley said, the site of Frontier and the check-in procedures would be changed so that the passengers were informed about the fee before they come to the gate.
The Frontier's new carry-on fee will only come into force in the summer, there is not yet a specific date.
Passengers often grumbled about luggage fees and other fees, but airlines are happy to back.
They argue that the transport of luggage cost money, and passengers should pay for this service if they wished.
Many on Wall Street consider the new baggage fees as a sign that the airlines have enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
But so far most of the fingers of charges for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. three years ago, was the first to charge for hand luggage and later followed All Giant Air, a budget airline.
The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, the airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who followed the additional fees.
He estimated in a report in December 2011 that bring the hand baggage fee is $50 million per year.
Sorensen, who previously held a leadership position in Midwest Airlines, recently flown with spirit and was curious what would await him at the gate when passengers were faced with the unusual hand baggage fee of the company.
"The boarding process was a smoothly, which I have experienced in my career in aviation," he said.
I expected, gnashing and vehement discussions at the gate.
"The plane was full," he declared, "and the boarding ran as lubricated."
Frontier, Spirit in the $2, for coffee, tea, soda or juice.
The companies said that passengers who bought lemonade or juice, would keep the entire box of coffee and free.
Water remains free.
In 2008, U.S. Airways tried briefly to demand for soft drinks, but seven months later, after passengers complained and was opposed to any other big company.
Frontiers step to charge for cabin baggage if passengers do not buy directly from the airline, is the latest initiative, are to be channeled to the customers on their own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies like Orbitz 10 to U.S. $25 per ticket sold.
It provides all the companies an incentive to encourage passengers to the direct purchase of them instead of an online travel agency.
But Frontier has gone the furthest in this area.
In September, the company began to outsource bookings over an online travel agency only half as many frequent flyer miles.
On Wednesday, the miles were cut to 25 percent of the flight.
In a third party booked a flight with Frontier brings more than 1000 miles customers only 250 miles.
Passengers can also reserve exclusively for direct purchase on the website of Frontier.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in Denver, but the business is shrinking and the company is losing money.
The proceeds fell by 9%, and the flight capacity fell almost 13 percent in the first quarter, as reported in the financial report on Wednesday of the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc., was published.
Republic has tried to get as part of the sale of the company's finances from Frontier.
