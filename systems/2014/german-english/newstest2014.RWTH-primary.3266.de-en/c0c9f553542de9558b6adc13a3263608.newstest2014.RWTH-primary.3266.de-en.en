Excellent mastered the fight
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's novel "the Old Man and the Sea," cut Horst Janson.
Janson is an old hand in his profession, the Performing Arts.
The old man, no one can fool the fish.
The two complement each other.
It almost feels that creases in the neck of the old man, saith the boy Manolo, see fishermen.
If he is tired of life on the chair, is bent on Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman, and a character role, the Janson.
Hemingway told the story of a wrestler, a courageous man who does not give up and eventually wins through his knowledge and also its will to fight against the fish.
Janson is in large part as a solo performer on stage.
He manages to focus the attention of the audience, so are his monologues never boring.
His efforts to pull the last fish to the surface of the water, are so real that viewers forget that there is a sea of blue lights only bottled water.
Acting director Jens Hassel man leaves the old man in the boat above the fishing village.
In the course of the performance, he is the most active scene into the light: The hut of Santiago, the bar singer Marie Luise, who sings with her songs and her magnificent voice and life in Cuba.
The four musicians play Cuba's rhythm, and at the same time, guests of the bar.
