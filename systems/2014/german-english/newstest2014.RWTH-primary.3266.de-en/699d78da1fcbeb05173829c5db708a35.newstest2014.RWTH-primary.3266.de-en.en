A study by the British government has announced to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd is proposed, with the start of Phase 1 in 2026 high-speed rail links between Scotland and the north of England.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer, said the project "will bring Britain closer together."
The Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said that he was very pleased to work with the British government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands.
After the completion of phase 2, there will be links to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building the high-speed rail line between London and northern England by Â£32.7 billion to 42.6 billion pounds.
The British government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, HS2 Ltd, asked for more routes and travel time improvements in northern England and Scotland.
These include the possibility of an eventual travel time of three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network, which brings together Britain and its cities."
We are moving ahead with HS2, because it brings enormous benefits.
Without it, we are facing a Kapazitaets crisis in our network.
But it is also about the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will be improved thanks to HS2.
The Scottish Secretary Alistair campaign commented: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown campaign to make "absolutely clear" for the Scottish involvement into the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: "The high-speed rail link has the potential of enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but also the economic power of Scotland at the same time provides an argument for high-speed rail links across Great Britain."
We are therefore pleased to work as partners with the British government and to examine the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland, the benefits for all and completes the connection Glasgow - Edinburgh, the Scottish Government's plans.
I look forward to examining the report with the British ministers next year and to jointly adopt the next steps.
