Germany's biggest state church has Offensivegestartet, to promote the work of the pastor.
Background is a shortage of priests, the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Hannover, expects that it will halve the number of their roughly 1,800 Pasto and pastors to present situation until 2030.
For young people of today, the profession is very attractive and offer good prospects for the future, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the safety and life itself.
With Burfien instructed the State Church for the first time, a pastor at a full place to inspire young people to the program.
Currently, fewer and fewer young people choose after graduating from high school to study theology.
Burfien leads back to the process of secularisation: "God's voice is quiet, the world is."
It is the work of great freedom and diversity.
I can inform Mr my calendar and my priorities, where it is important to me.
Although pastors may be as close to the people.
They earned as much as teachers and could live well.
Certainly in the free economy will pay more, but it would have a secure employer theologians.
The young people of today, not only about career, but a meaningful work.
According to the State Church, which includes three quarters of Lower Saxony, currently receives annually about 60 pastors to retire.
At the same time, starting about 40 graduates of the Augustinian theology studies.
In sparsely populated peripheral areas such as the resin, the Emsland or Wendland could be struggling to fill posts in the future.
Burfien wants, among other things, training sessions for young people and invite the celebrities who have studied theology.
The program offers a broad education.
You can even become Federal President.
