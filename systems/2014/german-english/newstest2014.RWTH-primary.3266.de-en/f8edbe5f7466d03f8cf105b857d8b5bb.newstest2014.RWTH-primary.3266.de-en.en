Despair scream of an Obama voter
I have twice elected President Barack Obama in the hope that change is possible
He says that Obama has made commendable efforts that have been thwarted by the blockade tactics of the Republican
The blockade policy does not apologize the website problems of Obamacare, the drone strikes
Obama's memoirs about the 2008 campaign are a sad reminder of what might have been
Nathaniel P. Morris is the second year student at the Harvard Medical School.
I read a terribly sad book.
It is a book that I thought it would be sad during the second year of medical studies to liven up and give me hope.
It is called "the Audacity to Win" (gaining courage) and depicts the memoirs of Barack Obama to the presidential election in 2008.
When I'm finished with my patients, "and go to bed, then the book leads me back to a time when politics could rob millions and inspired speeches.
The election was a landslide victory and kept the news to guide the historic importance of this hour.
My classmates and my parents wept with joy, all the newspapers that they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on his way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
As Obama moved to office back in 2008, he had approval rates of 82%.
And then I close the book.
Switch back to the present is a rude awakening, as if taken from a dream.
It is hard to remember these optimistic times - they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I made my voice for the first time, something has changed.
But there is simply nothing that I could imagine.
I acknowledge the great and varied things that Obama has reached, from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for medical insurance until military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced concealment of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I also believe that the partisan blockade tactics have tipped too many aspirations that our nation should be brought forward: Immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closing of Guantanamo Bay, to name a few.
But after countless times I have defended the Obama administration to colleagues and acquaintances, brings me to my point to the end.
I have reached a point of political desperation.
The Republican blockade policy does not explain why it allows the interception of foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas.
It does not explain why the National Security Agency collects data about the private lives of Americans and why whistleblowers will be punished, the government misconduct.
It does not explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, was murdered without trial, nor why it bypassed public financing and spending limits during the presidential election.
It does not justify the results of a report stating that the White House's efforts to restrain the media are the "most aggressive... Since the Nixon administration."
And, most recently, it could not excuse the inability in the more than three years since the passage of the Affordable Care Act a simple website.
I do not know if this is what I should have expected.
If I should have understood in 18 that could contradict the government's work to their previous political campaigns.
Obviously, the parliamentarians, not a predictable rate, because of an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre public discussion.
But when I look at the above examples, then they seem to be largely elected by the government itself.
And that bothers me most.
I have 2012 elected Obama, not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and half-baked alternative, he seemed to be able to determine its direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfil the hopes that we had heard for so long.
But with the drop in approval ratings for Obama to below 45% this week, the return to 2008 by this book all the harder.
It awakens in me the longing for the many promises that have vanished into thin air.
This week I read a section in the book, which describes how Obama a heavy loss against Clinton in the primaries in Pennsylvania.
In a meeting with election officials after the decision, he said his staff, they would have to come back on track and follow the purpose of their cause.
"I hope that we will find our magic again," he said.
We must remember who we are.
There are five years later, Mr. President, and I could not agree more.
The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nathaniel Morris.
