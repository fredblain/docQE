A black box in the car?
American road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying highway system, and believe they have found the solution in a small black box, which will take place in the dashboard of each car.
The devices, which record every kilometer and report the information to the authorities, are central to a controversial trial of Washington and the state was planning to revise the outdated system of financing American roads.
The normally rather dull road planning suddenly has sparked an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Libertarian have allied themselves with environmental groups and called for the government of the small boxes to record mileage charges - and possibly, where they were taken and then the information can be used for the calculation of tax, oaths.
The Tea Party is appalled.
The American Civil Rights Union (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of privacy concerns.
But while no agreement can be reached on a course of action in Congress, several states do not wait any longer.
They are looking at how they can change over the next ten years to a system where drivers pay per mile travelled.
Thousands of motorists have the tachograph, some of which are equipped with GPS surveillance, already tested.
This really is a must for our country.
"It is not something that we will only use may be," said Hasan Ikhrata, director of the Southern California Assn. Of Governmental Movements, which has a record of a milestone for all California motorists in the state since 2025.
The way we pay these taxes, will change.
The technology is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is funded from the taxes, Americans pay at the pump is broke.
But in America is no longer as much petrol as before.
Cars use less gasoline.
The state-owned petroleum tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 euro cents per liter) has not risen in 20 years.
Politicians do not dare to high gasoline prices, raise the tax by a penny.
"The gas tax is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, an expert on commercial law at the University of Minnesota.
The federal government has recently provided 500 cars with black boxes, which are designed to test a meilenbasiertes payment system.
"This is the best option in the long term," he said.
Bureaucrats call it meilenbasierte user fee.
Not surprisingly, the idea of urban liberals, because, for example, the tax could be used to influence the behaviour to reduce congestion and greenhouse gases.
California's planners are counting on the system in the elaboration of strategies that are to be achieved, ambitious, statutory objectives of the federal government on climate change.
But the Republican Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also declared that he is the most viable long-term alternative.
The free marketers are taken with the idea of the Reason Foundation, drivers pay according to a pre-arranged route.
"This is not a tax that disappears into a black hole," said Adrian Moore, vice president for policy at the Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two previous American transport ministers, who had urged in a report to Congress in 2011 to move toward meilenbasierter reckoning.
The U.S. Senate last year approved a $90 million expensive pilot project that would include 10,000 cars.
But the majority in the House of Representatives, the thrust and responding to the concerns of MPs from rural areas who represent people who often have to travel many miles in everyday life on the way to work or in the city.
However, several states and cities move on their own in this direction.
The most active is Oregon, which enlists 5,000 drivers for the greatest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of the mineral oil tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City also is considering.
Illinois is testing it in a limited way with lorries.
And the I- 95 Coalition, which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), are currently investigating how to introduce the change.
The concept is not an universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers have been recently equipped with the devices, motorists were skeptical at the idea that the government could pursue each of their movements.
"Concerns about Big Brother and such things were a big problem," said Alauddin Khan, director of strategy and product management in the Ministry of Transport of Nevada.
The people did not want it.
When the test started, warned the ACLU of Nevada on their website: "It would be relatively easy to transform the tachograph in full-blown surveillance devices."
There was no need to build a huge, bulky technological infrastructure, which would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for more affordable technology that can capture the state mileage, but not exactly when and where.
Thus, Khan, the public would be unlawful.
The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small start-up company called True Mileage in California.
The company is not originally taken to help states in the taxation of motorists.
Rather, it was their goal to be in an emerging market for car insurance, which involves paying drivers based on miles driven.
But the devices tested on the road planners are also interesting, because they do not use GPS and provide only limited information that will be uploaded regularly via modem.
"The people are more willing to participate, if not record their speed and locations," said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
In some of these public pilot programs were made big mistakes.
There is much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this.
In Oregon, the planners are experimenting with it to give drivers a number of choices.
You can opt for a device with or without GPS.
Or they do not choose equipment and instead pay a flat fee based on the average of all the inhabitants of the state driven miles.
Others hope to be able to sell the concept of a skeptical public by providing the devices with more functions than smaller.
In New York City transit officials want to develop a device on taxation, will also pay the parking fees, insurance must be paid only for driving distances and speed data are collected by other vehicles in real time, thanks to which drivers can avoid congestion.
"Motorists would be the added value of the benefits of the system, motivated to participate," it said in a planning document.
But some transport planners wonder whether all this talk about paying per mile is not only a huge red herring.
The Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the area of the San Francisco Bay officials declared that Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund through tax on fuel.
An additional one-time fee or an annual levy could motorists with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that use little gasoline, are imposed, so that they pay a fair share.
"There is no reason for an operation if there is an aspirin," said Randy aero-engine, director of legislation and public affairs of the Commission.
If we do, hundreds of millions of motorists worry about their privacy and many other things.
