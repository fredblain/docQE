ESA decides on major space missions: Missions for billions
Distant planets, black holes, gravitational waves or experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that they want to start in the next few years.
30 proposals were available, five are still in the race.
Distant worlds.
More than 1000 planets around other stars, astronomers have found.
If there is at least some of them, no one knows.
The selection is difficult: Should one look for gravitational waves?
Or prefer to explore the origins of the cosmos?
Or discover earth-like planets and to search for alien life, perhaps?
These questions confront the leaders of the European Space Agency ESA.
For their program "Cosmic Vision" they are looking for ideas for two major space projects to advance the research.
The budget for such missions, "l" is about one billion euros.
The launch is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
The elite met in Paris in early September, the European space research to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas were discussed, five of them are now in the final round.
Many bodies on the proposals, tick with the researchers.
A final decision is expected to fall in the next few days by the scientific program committee.
A total of four big questions that Esa has selected the missions of the 2007 "program" cosmic vision "to find answers.
What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life?
The exact processes for the emergence of stars from large gas clouds - and hence the formation of planets that orbit these stars still lie in the proverbial dark.
A large infrared telescope in space could pierce the darkness.
And if a star has a planet, under what circumstances can arise there?
To investigate this matter, "dynasty," launching the space telescope in 2017, will be investigated with the 500 known planetary systems in our vicinity.
But the possibilities are limited, Khufu is a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million.
With larger instruments, the astronomers and even the composition of their atmospheres analysed organic-rich fine fraction of planets and to search for "biomarkers": Gases, which are seen as sign of biological activity.
How does the solar system?
Ultimately, this question is to give information about the conditions for the emergence of life.
The magnetic activity plays an important role of a star and the interaction of their magnetic Felds, as well as its continued particle radiation with the planetary system.
In our solar system to study these processes.
With the "Solar Orbiter" Esa already has a mission of the series (the budget is around half a billion euros) approved for this question.
The probe will start in 2017 and observe surface and activity of the sun.
The researchers are also of great interest to Jupiter and its moons.
You want to find out what role played in the development of the giant planet of the solar system.
This is the kind of the first of the three L - the "cosmic vision" missions - programme.
The probe "juice" (Jupiter Icy moons Explorer) begins its journey in 2022.
ACHT years later they reached Jupiter and the planet's atmosphere and the icy moons Europa and Ganymede, Kalli Sto.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The space offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and thus whether the known laws of nature are still valid.
Maybe there are also variations that could point the way to a new theory, the physicists can come together under the umbrella of all known laws of nature.
As the universe was born, and what is it?
The Big Bang created our universe 13.7 billion years ago.
Besides the material from which stars, planets and creatures bombarded as we are, there is dark matter, whose gravity holds galaxies and clusters of galaxies, and dark energy, accelerated by the actions of the Universe.
The researchers do not yet know what physical laws were in the first seconds of the CMB, which are still dark matter and dark energy.
With "Euclid" already approved by the Esa here a M- 2020 mission, scheduled to be launched.
With a special telescope to probe the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the whole sky, and thus allow conclusions on the nature of Dark Matter and Dark Energy.
Who could make the race
Of the 30 proposals at the end of the selection procedure will remain only two.
The best chances of approval as a mission, according to many experts, "Lisa," a sophisticated concept for the detection of gravitational waves.
Including physicists understand changes in the structure of space-time that Albert Einstein had predicted nearly 100 years ago.
They have been proven to date.
Elisa could succeed, the scientists behind the project hope.
The mission is one of two or three probes existing detector that will be deployed in space.
He could prove that unlike plants on Earth and gravitational waves that have emerged during the Big Bang, and thus provide new insights into the origins of the cosmos.
FOUR more proposals to compete for the second L mission: A large X-ray telescope called "Athena," is to explore the black holes, among other things, "icy planets," another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism," a mission for the measurement of the cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder," is to identify and investigate the organic-rich planets.
Among other proposals are already resigned to the samples - returning from Mars, Venus and the exploration of the moon, asteroids and solar physics.
