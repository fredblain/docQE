As the horses - experts met in droves in Cardiff to choose the horse of the year, they knew that we were facing a tough competition.
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The kid, not even in kindergarten, and has made his first steps only a few months ago, and his Shetland pony toffee came loose from the three rounds and won the first prize - the 30 adult opponents.
The inseparable pair, both of the same size, were praised for their appearance, behavior and style in the annual contest, which is organized by the Sunny Bank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
During his appearance in competition against men and women with elegant melons he had donned his plate Muetze in a cheeky angle and led the two year old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jury for his natural skills in dealing with the pony, which are far beyond his age.
And toffee received top marks for his appearance and his personality.
Fenton had toffee as a gift for his third birthday last March and since then has practiced every day with the Shetland pony.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: "Fenton and toffee are a great team."
They were matched against the entire field of participants and went with Gold Cup and rosette.
It was only the second time that he had taken part in a competition with toffee, and we were all excited when he won.
Complete strangers in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that it wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, following in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who performed for more than ten years.
Howells said: "The whole audience was $and all who cheered and applauded him."
He went on to sand the entire length of the arena, and although he looked so tiny, he has done a fantastic job.
Fenton is crazy about animals - he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens that he cares.
As it is launched, it will not be long until he is on the "horse of the year" - actor - and I am sure that he will do well.
A spokesman for the annual horse said: "Fenton is only three, but he knows how to manage his pony."
Together, they are a great team.
The jury considered Fenton and toffee according to how well they are beaten and had presented in the Vorfuehr ring.
They pay attention to good cooperation between pony and leaders - and Fenton and toffee, the best in the ring.
I am sure that has contributed its part Fent's sweet clothes that really fit perfectly.
