The options range from enhanced brakes, a service package with care by Bowler Works - mechanics and logistical support to vehicle Einlagerung between events.
Drew Bowler, CEO of Bowler Motorsport, said: "The Rally - customers who come to Bowler, have changed."
They are not all experienced cyclists, but people who are looking for excitement and adventure, as well as a possible way to world-class events.
We are happy to believe this path in partnership with Land Rovers and opening of the MSA and the format that opens up new opportunities, the various rally disciplines in Britain and abroad, and newcomers to the hardships and the reality of Rally Raid.
We had really fun to develop the Defender Challenge - car - which is an entertaining championship.
Moreover, there is the Defender Challenge, training and test day in February, as well as the option of desert race in North Africa and the Middle East.
