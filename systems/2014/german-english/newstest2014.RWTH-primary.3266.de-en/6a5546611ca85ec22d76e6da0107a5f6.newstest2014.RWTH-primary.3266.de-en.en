Live with future
In fact, Waltraud Ries.
Their house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart, an old trees, friendly neighbors and not too much traffic.
In the city, there are only a few minutes by public transport.
"They have hopefully not afraid of spiders?" Asks Waltraud, and shows a big spider on door frames.
I am looking for some time now, a new apartment for my husband and me.
But you know how difficult that is in Stuttgart.
The reason is, however, no spider phobia, but the concern, at the age of the many stairs to the house and not being able to accomplish in the apartment, she says.
Moreover, since a meniscus operation has experienced the Mittfuenfzigerin first-hand what it means to move with a handicap from floor to floor.
Recently, she published a book on the subject of happiness in the age - What residential form is the best for me? ."
"Our apartment is the best example of what is not aged at all," she starts to tell.
More than 20 years ago, when she moved with her husband in the duplex apartment, it was simply a beautiful apartment in the middle of the Greens.
Today, with Waltraud Ries in mid-fifty, thinks differently.
They also know that it is one of the few people who, with the theme "living in old age."
Most of it, as long as it is.
Old buildings are always only the other, "she says humorous.
Only when the suffering, do you really think.
"Then it can be a bit too late," said Ries.
In her book, the interior designer 17 residential models for a self-determined lifestyle in old age.
"What a living form, however, is always an individual choice," she says.
D i e solution is not for old age.
Even those who could afford the residency in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that he could be ill.
And: "Without good knowledge of the language vereinsame in Dolce Vita," warns the book Autorin Aussiedlung Willi gene.
Among their models are classic forms of childcare models, alternative housing or the oft-quoted pensioners - WG.
At the age of each of his ticks and quirks
"For me it would be nothing but a residential community," she says with a wink.
Certainly not like in a student house with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
"In the age simply takes its retreat," said Ries.
A senior residential community that can work, however, do not want to exclude the book author.
But then it must be different from the classic students - WG.
And sometimes you just want only his rest, "she believed.
She is hardly alone, at least in the state capital.
"The majority of old people in Stuttgart will remain as long as it is in their own apartment," is also the experience of Theresa Ruetten, the head of the civil service life in the age of the provincial capital.
The department advises people about "age."
So often, elderly people would just take inconveniences and restrictions, only to be able to stay in their familiar surroundings, which is also the experience of the Stiftung Warentest.
Today, there are many ways to make the house or the apartment buildings.
Ries recommends that all those who deal with this conversion of their house or an apartment to find out not only to hire the best craftsmen.
Today, there are specialists for this transformation.
Even in the rental apartment will be realized one or the other, and if it is only the toilet seat increase, clarifies the interior designer.
But not always, reconstruct the existing flat age and thus accessible, even if it is still as beautiful.
Waltraud Ries had to make this experience.
While you could install a stair lift, which is also in the apartment with a cobblestone path to the door, but the far greater obstacle.
It will proceed until it has found the ideal property for herself and her husband.
Before the parade will hate it more than before the spider on their front door.
