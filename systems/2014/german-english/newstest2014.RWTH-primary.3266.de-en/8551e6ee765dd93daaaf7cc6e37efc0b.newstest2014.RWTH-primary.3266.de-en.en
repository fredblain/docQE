Early puberty: Up Fast
African-American and Hispanic girls reach puberty tend to be more likely than their white age mates whom studies show.
Physical changes do not mean immediately puberty
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe the epidemic of obesity is a trigger for early puberty
The trend of early puberty is less pronounced in boys
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family issues.
A mother should be worried if her daughter at the age of seven or eight years to grow breasts and pubic hair?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics Medical Association children this week in Orlando, Florida, declared the paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz that these early physical changes among American girls are relatively normal and a new norm.
"I spend a lot of time to reassure parents - normally there is no indication that now the puberty," Kaplowitz said.
Obvious indicators of development, such as growing breasts, shame and Achsel hair and body odor, among girls.
Nevertheless, there was only a slight shift in the age of menarche (the onset of first menstruation) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age at 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
"If the development of breasts, it takes at least two to three years to menarche," Kaplowitz said, also author of the book "early puberty in girls: The essential guide to dealing with this problem often encountered."
Time is the most accurate test of how the pace of puberty.
It is a controversial issue, which is indeed the beginning of puberty, but it is "precocious," if the breast augmentation is accompanied by a growth spurt at the age of eight years.
In most cases, slowing down the process or - something that can monitor a pediatrician.
For faster progress could be shown by an Endikronologen tests in order to prevent serious problems like tumors or cysts.
There are treatments to delay an early menstruation and the defense of another consequence: The premature aging of the bone that can ultimately lead to growth and thus Hemmung small body size in adults.
The recommendations for a drug or hormonal therapy based on the age of the child, the speed of development, the growth rate and the emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is reticent about drugs, but he admits: "The suppression of puberty can lessen behavioral problems and the feelings of girls to be different than their age."
The other major problem is understandable: Parents simply do not want to see her very young daughters of the period.
"They are worried about the Schwangerschafts risk or how they handle hygienic side," Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter was with her in ten days.
Even if there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation, they were not prepared emotionally.
She was scared and excited by the school home because she was the first in their circle of friends.
There are many fully published theories about the causes of early puberty.
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other food, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media.
Young girls are similar to those used in puberty.
Kaplowitz believes that the most compelling premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported a study of the 2001 girls aged six to nine, which establishes a connection between body fat and the transition to adolescence.
Other studies support that conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls reach puberty tend to be more likely than their white peers.
There are different explanations.
Global seems influenced by all sorts of things to be an early adolescence, from economic conditions on the climate to the genes.
Another conundrum: Although a growing boy's face and pubic hairs earlier, the trend is not so strong as to a full earlier puberty in girls.
Other doctors on the Piezon Â® - Conference stressed the complexity of the issue.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is widespread even among babies and young children.
"We must be careful how we identify the true beginning of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to seek advice from their pediatrician, how they should talk with their child.
"This may mean that you must hold a meeting sooner than expected," advised Kaplowitz.
If you stay calm, normally the child responded well.
Girls who bloom early, need the insurance, which is a normal part of life, even if it happens earlier than thought.
