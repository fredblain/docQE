Anger over sentence for Bali bomber
Survivors and relatives of the 202, 2002 people who were killed in the bombing in Bali, were angered by the verdict for the last of the instigators, who was brought to justice, as Umar Patek, in their view, should be shot without allowing them.
Patek, who was nearly ten years as one of the most sought-after people in Southeast Asia on the run, was sentenced yesterday for his role in the construction of explosives for the bombing to 20 years in prison.
With the suspension, he could be released after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, in which 202 people died, including 88 Australians, have been injured and many more.
A guilty verdict was also in a number of terrorismusbezogener charges, which included a wave of bomb attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors had demanded a life sentence, even if it is the man who, because of his reputation as a wordless bomb maker known as "Demolition Man," could have requested the death penalty.
The decision has aroused painful memories in June Cort Een, a mother from Perth, which lost its 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the Patek and his Mitverschwoerern devastation caused almost ten years ago.
Fighting back tears, she said, Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I mean, he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
"We should put him in front of a firing squad," said Cort Een to AAP.
I have to live with every day that I will not get another grandson and I will never see my daughters.
The Sari Club has been razed to the ground, and exploded on 12 October 2002, shortly after 23 pm a huge bomb in a small truck that was parked in front of the nightclub.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar, where only 20 seconds earlier, a suicide bomber exploding a backpack filled with explosives.
He fell into a coma after the attack for a month and "died" thrice, while he was on a life support system.
Hughes said that Patek have deserved the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah, Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samu Dra - who were responsible for the bloodbath and executed four years ago.
Really, this guy should have before any other to the death penalty.
To keep him alive - no, there is no reason to keep him alive.
To get in 20 years after he killed 202 people and many hundreds injured, is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers, who was in court.
He eluded almost a decade after the arrest, but was picked up in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. forces nearly four months later, the former al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden killed.
During the negotiation of a FBI agent said that intelligence reports had provided the reference that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of the connection between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al Qaeda.
"He has not arisen," said Cort Een.
Until recently, he has shown no remorse for how much pain he has inflicted on other people.
The verdict came before the tenth anniversary of the attack this year, which will be celebrated with commemorative ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"There will be many tears this year," said Cort Een.
Patek can still appeal against his sentence.
