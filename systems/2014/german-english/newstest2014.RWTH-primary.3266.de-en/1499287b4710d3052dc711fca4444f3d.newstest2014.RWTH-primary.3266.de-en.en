For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched on as his sick father repeatedly lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was founded in 1981 in a car accident near Yaounde, the capital of Cameroon, injured.
First, he had a broken arm, but it was an inflammation of the brain, and caused a haematoma that should affect him for the rest of his life.
"There was no neuro-surgeon in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
We have released him from Cameroon, if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment that they had to offer.
"It is not easy," Bwelle commented.
You can leave the house at five o "clock in the morning and go to the hospital to be the first, and is not the first.
There are very many patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwelles father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
On the other hand, the ratio in the United States with a doctor for 413 people.
But even if it were a doctor, could afford most Cameroonians to visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and almost three quarters of health spending in the country are private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," Bwelle said.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
His father and to see so many of his countrymen suffer ripened in Bwelle decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers have carried out 700 operations last year.
He was himself a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaounde.
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, who travels on weekends in rural areas, and it offers free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people in minibuses and drive with the helpless medical equipment on the roof of unprerpared terrain in the villages who need help.
Not everything runs smoothly.
More than once they had to push vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they are welcomed as heroes: A feast, singing and dancing and the best accommodation, the place has to offer.
In these villages is free medical care is a reason to celebrate and Bwelle - with his broad smile and his boundless energy - is the joyous celebration.
The next morning, the team begins with the examination of hundreds of patients.
"We are treating 500 people per trip," Bwelle said.
You come from a 60 mile radius of the village - and on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics provide medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are due to malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Other crutches donated glasses or receive free birth certificates, a document that is required for the school, but many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team simply operations with local anaesthetic.
The operations are normally held in a school, town house or an apartment, after the procedure, patients on and go in the recreation area, in order to make room for the next person.
The lighting for the surgery and the Desinfektions equipment is powered by the generator of the group and Bwelle and its volunteers are working until the early hours on Sunday.
It is a very exhausting work, but the village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated.
"They drum throughout the night, so that we remain awake and continue our work," Bwelle said.
On Sunday, the team goes back to the city, tired but proud of the work.
The group - a mixture of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students know last year - has carried out 700 operations and that they had to work a huge difference for the people it helps.
One man said that the free operation RAEC Mons, which he had received, he is allowed to return to work.
"That changed the future of my family," said the man.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital works Bwelle at night in private clinics in Yaounde.
With this second job finance 60% of its charitable activities, Bwelle; the rest come from private donations.
"I really do not know when he is asleep," says Katie O "Malley, who for the second year at the Drexel University in Philadelphia studied medicine and voluntarily participates in Bwelles group.
It is always either in hospital or trying to raise money for the organization, so that he can go to these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students such as O "Malley, who come from the U.S. and Europe and support Bwelle, this is a chance to gain practical experience they would never get at home.
"We can be in operations, where we help, blood abzutupfen or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwelle," explains O "Malley.
That would be in America as a medical student in the second year will never be possible.
The students typically pay for their trip to Cameroon and bring often donated medical equipment.
However, they are in Yaounde, Bwelle accommodation, transportation and guide.
"He is without doubt a hero," says O "Malley.
He devotes his life to this organization and its desire to help the Cameroonian people, knows no borders.
For Bwelle is the almost constant work, not a burden.
Others to give to a happier life and a promise that he made his father, he is a great pleasure.
"I am so happy when I make this work," Bwelle said.
And I am thinking of my father.
I hope he sees what I do.
I do it to get people to laugh and to alleviate the pain.
