Jumbo manufacturers are arguing in the face of large orders on seat width
Between leading aircraft manufacturers has given rise to an argument about the width of seats in economy class on long-haul flights, which set the tone for a bitter clash at the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute revolves around the seating width offered to passengers during long flights in economy class - not always the ones to make airlines, but most of these designated areas is the key to efficiency claims with the latest aircraft from Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for an industry standard that a seat width of 46 cm (18 inches) in economy class, says the American rivalry between Boeing, the airlines should decide.
The controversy comes at a time when the aircraft manufacturers are vying to sell bigger versions of its twin-engine long-haul planes, and at the event from 17th to 21th November expect record orders.
What is the structure of the rear of the aircraft - especially if there are nine or ten rows of seats - is crucial to the economic results that the new "mini Jumbo" is supposed to provide.
Boeing claims its new "777 X" will be 406 people in seats in economy class, about 17 inches wide, and ten per series.
Airbus said that the competing version of the A350 astutely 350 persons in 18 -inch wide seats in economy class, where there are nine per series.
Aircraft giants often share blows over technical details through advertising in the press.
Airbus now calls before the Dubai Airshow, which will make the 777 X with more than 100 orders for the race, directly to the public.
The company recently unveiled an ad that the beginning of a new ad war, donors could and showed a picture, in which three people are squeezed in a restaurant, and the title: "Would you accept that?"
"Boeing is proposing long-haul flights in seats that are more than regional turbo props," says Airbus sales chief John Leahy.
People with different dietary habits are thicker, but plane seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747, and the end of the century defined the modern long-haul travel has increased the weight of the average American males between 40 and 49 years by ten percent, according to the data of the U.S. health ministry.
The waist circumference of the male average American in the 21th century, according to U.S. health statistics 100.8 cm.
Airbus says that his rival is a seat concept in the 1950s, when the average body size of the newly baptized "jet set" was narrow.
We have, Airbus, investigations that documented that an extra inch (2.54 cm) per seat will sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing disputed Airbus says the numbers on the seat Ma√üen and that it is not up to the discretion of the manufacturer, as airlines make the balance between flight tariffs and establishment.
The company also stated that the experience in the aircraft, according to research by more than the seat width.
"It is really intended to give airlines flexibility, so that they can do what they think they need to be successful," says the flight cabin expert Kent Craver of Boeing.
They do not want to dictate to them what makes them profitable.
You know your business better than anyone else.
For passengers is about more elbow, but for manufacturers, it is increasingly an issue that can affect sales.
Behind the confrontation is a race for plane orders with an estimated volume of at least $700 billion at catalogue prices in the coming decades, which could have a major impact on the export performance of the U.S. or Europe.
As Reuters reported in July for the first time, the Sitzlayout the driving force behind the battle for new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing are 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest twin-engine long-haul designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365 -seater Boeing 77 - 300 ER.
Boeing's statements on the results depend in part on the 777 X is compared with their ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in 777.
The increased costs per unit are still lower than currently with ten seats per row.
"Boeing squeezes more seats on his plane to make it more competitive for our products," says Kevin Keniston, director for passenger comfort in the European Airbus.
On the other hand, say analysts, full cabins with ten seats per row in the 777s indicated that many passengers have opted for closer arrangement, which could be accompanied by cheaper airline fares.
"Eighteen inches of legroom would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from an economic point of view from the Airbus offer is controlled by the threat of the 777," said Mary Kirby, an expert on cabin interior, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing offer no seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which to select the airlines.
The world-travelling jet salesman with a tape measure even contribute to the establishment of the competition and gherkins.
Even if they extol the convenience, but all manufacturers also offer jets with hochverdichteter design for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with zehnsitzigen ranks, but sold by his own account, not yet.
Until recently, Airbus has stressed the need for greater adaptability of the cabin and offered some jets wide seats on the corridors.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets that experts say will evaporate the call for a new industry standard, but probably could distract from the wave of 777 X - sales.
