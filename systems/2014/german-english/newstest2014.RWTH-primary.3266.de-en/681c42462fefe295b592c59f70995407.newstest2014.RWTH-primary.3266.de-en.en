Rangnick States-bashing for Schiris: No pig albums on King
Ralf Rangnick is satisfied with the current high form of Bundesliga table leaders Red Bull Salzburg, disappointed, the sporting director of the "bulls" of the umpires.
"There is currently a dangerous trend that pushes manege and Alan in the category of" Kings, "he took the two Offensivwirbler on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg.
The recent rise in rank Nicks criticism was yellow for rings at the 3:0 against Groedig last Sunday, when the Senegalese was an alleged play-acting undoing - but that was not how the TV pictures showed.
"A gross error," said Rangnick, the referee Harkam as "inadequate."
Harkam would also have "its share" contributed to the escalation between Salzburg coach Roger Schmidt and Groedig - coach Adi Huetter after the game.
He determinedly defended his German compatriot: "I would behave in each situation the same way as Roger Schmidt."
Schmidt himself wants to have had no contact with his colleagues after the skirmishes with Huetter.
I do not know why.
"Because I am the one who has been insulted," said the 46 -year-old.
Given the success of Laufs agreed with Rangnick but an eulogy.
"There are only two words: Good correction," he stated.
There is little to criticise.
Above all, the way the team plays, is impressive.
This is gone.
The changes in the winter transfer period will give it.
There is no great reason to make a difference.
"Unless a player comes up with the demand that he wants to leave the club," said Rangnick.
