Learn instead of unemployed: Pilot project for unskilled tourism
On the lakes of Mecklenburg startetheute a pilot project for the tourism industry.
Under the leadership of the Federal Employment Agency are 49 women and men who are already working as unskilled workers in the industry, more than three professionals to winter time for hotels and restaurants.
"That is the end of courses with diplomas," said Carmen Neubrandenburg, the labour agency.
The utility is manifold: Entrants would not work, the companies would be trained professionals who are increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants, and the agency does not have to finance unemployment.
In the project, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Neubrandenburg, as well as the German hotel guests (Mecklenburg-Vorpommern).
