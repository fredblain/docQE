Halloween 2013: In numbers
When I was a child, Halloween was something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, late allowed and dress for the neighborhood.
Today, I have become more like a Halloween muffle.
In the last two years, I have not declared ready to distribute candy from my apartment, and it will not do so this year.
But according to the statistics, I am a black sheep for Halloween.
The majority of Americans - 158 million, to be precise - celebrate Halloween this year, a total of $6.9 billion for candy, costumes and decorations, according to the American Association of Retailers (simultaneously).
Another thing that I am pleased every Halloween, but again, the trend values.
The costumes will account for about 1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the simultaneously.
This year, provocative inanimate objects of rage.
Women must no longer remain in sexy clothes, they can now also tempting food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I expect a lot of zombies, thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet that Daft Punk - space men will manage this year into the Insta Gram feeds.
According to Google, the most sought-after costumes zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I suspect that there is nothing wrong with tradition.
Last year, we have covered our dogs and were not alone in my amazement.
Indeed, Americans give $330 million this year for costumes of their pets, which simultaneously.
There are a lot of "hot dogs."
As for candy, we are not squeamish.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, according to The Nielsen Company.
That is about 270 million kilograms of chocolate bars, lozenges, candies and gum.
That is good news for the 41 million people, according to U.S. Department of Commerce, with the slogan "trick or Treat" move by the district.
Indeed, we will buy more than 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and - let us not deceive ourselves - eat.
The only thing that we do not want to consume, the sweet Candy Corn; nevertheless sold around 15 million kilograms of Halloween, according to the National Association of confectionery manufacturer.
That is about nine billion maize grains.
It is a mystery that I still could not resolve.
Halloween is nothing more than houses where it haunts.
They have great names such as "terror Behind the Walls" (which, incidentally, in a real prison), "howl - O - Scream" and "House of Shock."
There are actually 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States who make $500 million proceeds, America Haunts, which includes the wonderful photos, on which they soon into the trousers and the friends on Facebook, where it will not be rid of them again, and then the guy, which is to leave a comment like "nice expression."
Finally, we come to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown made us familiar with the Great War, when we were children, and the carving a pumpkin lantern is like decorating the Christmas tree - something that we have made.
Fortunately, the "baby" trend in the pumpkin only last year, thanks to Villepinte rest, so that most of us have grown up with it, not the pumpkin zurechtzuschnitzen and to sit in it.
This year Americans will spend about $106 million for pumpkins, the U.S. Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lantern, the slowly rotting in the front yard, in Illinois, where they were harvested this year, 245 million kilograms of pumpkins.
If you want to score correctly, please call Tim and Susan Mathis Don in Napa, California, and convert them to carve its 921 kg pumpkin.
