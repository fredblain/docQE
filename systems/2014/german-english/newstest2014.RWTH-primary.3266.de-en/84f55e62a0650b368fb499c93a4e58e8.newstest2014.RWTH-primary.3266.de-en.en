Coulson, phone hacking tips for checking of a
The former News of the World editor Andy Coulson, supposedly "phone hacking, monitoring and confrontation" in an attempt to confirm a false tip about an affair of the then Home Secretary Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the court at the Old Bailey, the News of the World in May 2005, heard a false rumor that Clarke had a relationship with his "special adviser" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper commissioned the private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to chop Pawlbys voice mails, and they followed, but Coulson also called and left messages, such as the court was told.
"According to the prosecutor, Coulson, who is now publisher of the NotW, no one is above the apartment of people and hopes to catch them red-handed, but one that faced with a history of people like to see their reaction," said Edis.
He said NotW use three methods to investigate stories citizen investigators: Phone hacking, monitoring and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows from the second, the surveillance, it cannot be changed.
What about the first?
He knows about the phone hacking?
He continues to deny this, but we say: "And if he knew about it."
Clarke's rumours of an affair were first taken up by the feature editors of NotW, when a source that was sexually interested in Pawlby, said: "Do not waste your time, it is with Charles."
A band with voice mail from their phone has been secured by at least three occasions in August 2006 in Mulcaires apartment.
The investigators also found entries on the computer of the detective, Pawlby and her sister as "projects" were saved.
When the research, the grandparents of Pawlby anonymous calls in which they were asked for information about them, said Edis.
Meanwhile, the former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck, and former reporter James Weatherup monitoring the movements of Pawlby.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left a voice mail with the following content: "I have a story that we want to release tomorrow, I would like to speak with Charles."
Edis said, followed the same pattern as in other important personalities, such as the former Home Secretary David Blunkett Coulsons activities in this story.
On Thursday, the jury heard that Coulson Blunkett was confronted with an affair with a married woman, when he was stable even with the co-accused Rebekah Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks argue that to have conspired with others, between October 3, 2000 and 9. August 2006 to hack phones.
Weatherup and Thurlbeck and Mulcaire have admitted the phone hacking.
