TSV shows after six match days still without a point in the handball Association League.
Right now, it is for the team by Ingo Ehlers tomorrow to Derby against TSV Daverden, which last weekend celebrated its first victory.
With this game, the season starts for us.
"I hope that we have finally clear the mind," Ehlers makes quiet optimism.
At the same time, he took a long time, with the exception of the dauerverletzten Hendrik Blohme, his complete squad available.
The Daverden continues as we play at pace.
We must therefore consider our error rate is low.
Primarily, however, it is important to increase in the coverage that has left most recently far from safe.
There is much more relaxed, Daverdens coach Thomas Panitz after the first season victory against North Horn.
The game was, of course, a number.
But so far we are not the favorite, because everything can happen in the Derby.
Nevertheless, Panitz now wants to beef up Morsum, to start a series.
Jan Malte iodate will be missing.
It celebrates the youths Joost Windßuß, who is with double game right at the A - youth - Bremen in the Federal Republic, his season debut.
Anyone who is not a game, should remain at home.
