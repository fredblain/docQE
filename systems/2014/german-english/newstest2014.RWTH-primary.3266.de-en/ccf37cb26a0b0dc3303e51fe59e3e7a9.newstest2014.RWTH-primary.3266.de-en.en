Oil prices have continued to up to 96 USD per barrel
The price of oil has fallen even further on Friday after a report that has been overshadowed concerns about a high supply of energy-hungry China's manufacturing sector.
The Referenzrohoelsorte for deliveries in December had fallen in Europe in the late morning in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel.
The contract fell 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a price drop of 5.8 percent in October.
The large supply of crude oil prices have charged in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy on Wednesday declared that the U.S. supply had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over the course of five weeks, the offer was increased by 25 million barrels.
But on Friday, there were signs of stronger demand by two reports of an increase in Chinese manufacturing activity.
This points to a continued recovery of the Chinese economy, whose growth had increased to 7.8 percent in the third quarter, after it was reached in the previous quarter, the lowest level in two decades.
The kind of Brent crude oil, a reference value for international crude oil, which is also used by American refineries, fell to the ice Exchange in London at 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel.
