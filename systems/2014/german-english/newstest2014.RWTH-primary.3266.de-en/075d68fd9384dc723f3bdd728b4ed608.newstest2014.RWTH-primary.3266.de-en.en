Intelligence whistleblower Edward Snowden is always ready to talk with German authorities.
But first he wants to clarify his situation.
It was not clear what the United States wanted former NSA employees in a letter addressed to the rotating Hans-Christian Stroebele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and published by the federal government, has forwarded the Bundestag and the Attorney General.
The letter, according to a translation by Stroebele used the following wording:
To the people in charge
I was asked to write to you about your investigation to mass surveillance.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and was used by contract or a direct job as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
In the course of my employment in these institutions witnessed systematic violations of my government that led me from a moral duty to act.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I saw I was exposed to a serious and persistent agitation that forced me to leave my family and my country.
I live in exile and enjoy temporary asylum, which gives me the Russian Federation in accordance with international law.
I am encouraged by the response to my political action, both in the U.S. and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world and also high officials - including the United States - have the revelations to a system of mass surveillance that is accountable to nobody, as does a public service.
These spy revelations, many proposals for new laws and directives, justified by the formerly concealed abuse of public trust.
The benefits to society from the knowledge gained is becoming increasingly clear; at the same time, reduces the risks taken on board.
Although evidence was the result of my efforts, my government treated dissent as a breach of loyalty and seeks to criminalise political expression and to put on trial.
Still, there is no crime to speak the truth.
I am confident that will give the government of the United States with the support of the international community this prejudicial attitude.
I hope that, if resolved the difficulties of this humanitarian situation, will be able to good clarification of the facts concerning the statements made in the media, especially in terms of truth and authenticity of the reports, appropriate and gesetzesgemae√ü.
I look forward to a conversation with you in your country, as soon as the situation is clarified, and I thank you for their efforts to uphold international law that protects us all.
