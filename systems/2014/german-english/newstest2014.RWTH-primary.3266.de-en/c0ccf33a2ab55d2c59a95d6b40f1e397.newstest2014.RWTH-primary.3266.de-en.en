Appetite for ice cream, which glows in the dark?
A British businessman has developed the first luminous ice in the dark with jellyfish.
Charlie Francis, the fluorescent properties of marine animals and created a luminous bounties.
The idea came to him after he had read a research work on jellyfish and could convince Chinese scientists to produce the luminous protein.
The consumption of ice cream responds with the tongue, thus raising the pH in the protein and the lights.
Chris explained that ice lights respond to the heat in the mouth and so the more you lick, the brighter it is.
Charlie, founder of Lick Me I'm Delicious ice cream company, "says:" The product is incredible, but still at a very early phase of production, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds. "
In the ice cream protein reacted with the tongue with a neutral pH value.
If the mouth warmed up the protein, the pH and the ice.
We have tested it in recent months, and it seemed ideal to bring it to Halloween on the market, because it has this wonderful luminous.
It is probably the most expensive ice cream that I have ever made, because of the jellyfish light fabric is four times more expensive than gold.
Each bullet costs about 140 pounds.
But it tastes delicious.
His experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavors, including beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his latest creation is to be more ambitious.
He says: "I would like to develop an invisible ice cream."
This is not, in itself, impossible due to the refraction of light, which is caused by the crystals that make up ice cream, but I suspect that we will find a way to do it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish, which are made by Chinese scientists.
