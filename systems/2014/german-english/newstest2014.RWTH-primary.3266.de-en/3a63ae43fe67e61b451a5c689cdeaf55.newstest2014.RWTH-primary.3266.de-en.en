Tripodi denies to have been influenced by Obeid
The Labor Party against the former minister Joe Tripodi from New South Wales is initiated an investigation by the state anti-corruption supervision.
The disputed former NSW minister, changed the rules to the Tim Verpachtung at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden stakes in three plots of land controlled by the state.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC (Independent Commission Against Corruption) on Friday has extended its investigations on the question of whether Obeid has influenced a number of government ministers to leases at Circular Quay, where the Obeids two restaurants and a cafe, without prolonging tender after their expiration in August 2005.
It is now investigating the allegation, Tripodi knew from Obeids concealed interest in the land, after former deputy chief of staff, Lynne Ashpole Tripodis testified on Thursday.
In years of talks, which began in 2005, had urged the government to public tenders for the leases.
Tenants were opposed, and also wanted a longer maturities.
In 2009, the leases for the company at the Circular Quay, which provided the Obeids $2.5 million a year, without a public tender.
Tripodi, who was from February 2006 to November 2009 port minister, had previously argued for public tenders.
But he denied that the changes made at the request of Obeid and Tripodi, who confirmed that the government had been pressing for a review of the lease arrangements.
One of the ICAC's telephone conversations from August and September 2007 showed the characters between Obeid and Tripodi, Steve Dunn, a senior official who was changed into the Ministry of Port, after he had worked in the fishing authority under Obeid.
"Was the issue discussed in these phone calls the development of commercial Verpachtung rules?" Asked the deputy commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
"No," Tripodi said.
I do not remember what was discussed, but it was not.
Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid.
