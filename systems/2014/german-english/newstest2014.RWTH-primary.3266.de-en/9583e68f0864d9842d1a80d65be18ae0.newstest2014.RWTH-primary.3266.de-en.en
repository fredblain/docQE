The city hosts: Fast actions surprise
With a small cadre of the gentlemen I TSV Freudenstadt in Schiller - school gym in Reutlingen against the TG Goenningen of the Swabian Alb.
The Aelbler, faced with an experienced team on the other side of the net.
But it soon became apparent that they, too, could not keep up with the quick actions of the Staedter joy.
The Goenninger is placed with the tough and extremely difficult.
They repeatedly missed by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz cleanly through the net in the middle of second-hand passports and attacks and were not on the block defence.
Two high profits in the first sentence of the joys Staedter in all aspects.
In the face of this suffocating and spielbestimmenden performance then became the third sentence somewhat lax and listless at 3:0 - Endstand (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
Since November 2, with the TV Baiersbronn, who prevailed in Nagold, are a much more powerful opponents on the field.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik BÃ¤uerle, Neue Buechle, Sebastian Doel Ker, Felix Paelchen, Stefan Raeller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B class stood in the Murg valley in Baiersbronn Freudenstadt and Baiersbronn in the second teams.
They provided a competitive two hour match.
Nervousness on both sides, especially with the ball passing errors and points gifts; sometimes the precision of the passports was scarce, and in some critical game scenes prevented the eagerness to look for possible point gains.
In this very balanced encounter was a testament to the TSV team by Marcus Blasutto but all the great physical effort and a high level of commitment from both teams.
