Pope Francis appoints first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will for the first time on February 22, appointed new cardinals of the Catholic Church, the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the senior clerics in the Catholic church after the Pope and they are the ones who choose a Pope Francis, in order to nominate the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached the age of 80, no longer participate in the pope's election, a group of 120 "cardinals" to voters.
In a statement in which the news was known, said Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, it will be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony will be held on the appointment of the new cardinals, who is also known as a consistory.
"Pope Francis has decided to give its decision in February to convene the projects run by known in advance, so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from around the world, can be planned," said Lombardi.
Jack Valero, from Catholic Voices said that the number of eligible cardinals will be dropped until February.
He explained that a pope usually take as many cardinals as necessary so that the number of voting cardinals in 120, and so many cardinals over the age of 80, as he wants.
The consistory next year is so important because it is the first since the election of Francis in March this year, Valero.
Currently, there is some overhang on the part of Europe and especially Italy.
"It will be interesting to see whether the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance," he said.
Forty% of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
The Cardinals will also be the first to be appointed since the formation of the Council, founded by Francis to cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world who have the mandate to find ways to reform the church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.
"Francis has selected these eight cardinals who will help him," Valero said.
He explained that it was "quite possible" that would ask Francis to cardinals for advice.
But so far we have not been in this situation - that is all very new.
Valero said that the bishops would typically refer to great places to Cardinals, but Francis was "full of surprises - so we do not know whom he appoints."
