Children should be myths and legends as "role models for life," taught an author.
The stories of Thor showed that "brutal force against clever tricks," has no chance to do that and the Arthurian legend, how important it is to have a dream.
But many of the myths are "far too wild to be offensive, and in some cases, to be taught in schools," which is why Cross Ley - Holland for a "careful selection" pleaded school-relevant works.
"I find it wonderful that myths and folklore in America are already part of education," he said.
I have already proposed a plan for twenty years.
He added, with authors and teachers, the "overly didactic," children "would be completely shut down," because "subliminal" messages in entertaining stories would be conveyed.
Cross Ley - Holland, has translated the Beowulf, the Anglo-Saxon and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, explained: "We can pursue certain intentions, but we should keep them in the background as soon as possible."
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author who writes for adults, and an author who writes for children, is the need to give hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or lead to a happy ending, but there is an intrinsic sense of good and evil.
This must be represented by the undercurrent of history not be revealed and explained.
This is the old story of the show instead of tell.
