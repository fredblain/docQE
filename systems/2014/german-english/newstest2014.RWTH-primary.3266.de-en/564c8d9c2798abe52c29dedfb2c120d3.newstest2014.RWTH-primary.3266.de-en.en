British police represents Assange to an extradition decision
Today, the British police has passed a decision on extradition of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and has applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said that it was the 40-year-old Australian delivered a "call to" ask him to appear in a police station, and added that he should not assume that his arrest.
Assange is facing extradition to Sweden because of the indictment in a sex Delikt after having exhausted its possibilities under UK law, since the Supreme Court rejected his appeal against extradition earlier this month.
Because he feared, Stockholm will extradite him to the United States, he had on June 19, sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and asked for political asylum in the South American country.
"Scotland Yard has sent a 40-year-old man in an invitation to meet at whatever time we choose at a police station," a spokesman said.
He continues to violate the conditions of his release on bail.
The message was no comment on the delivery of police request.
Assange fears that he would be extradited from Sweden to the United States and prosecuted there for possible espionage charges after he had published more than 250,000 diplomatic messages to the investigative website WikiLeaks.
