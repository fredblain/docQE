FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices on planes (but no cell phone conversations) 
Passengers can now from departure to landing their electronic devices to read, listen to music, games, activities and use the prestige of films, but not with your mobile phone, according to the new guidelines, which on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) published in the US.
But passengers should not expect that these changes be implemented immediately.
How fast they were implemented, would depend on the respective airline, Michael Huerta, FAA employees at a press conference.
The FAA, the airlines must demonstrate that aircraft meet the new guidelines and that they have updated the training manuals of the flight crew, as well as the rules for the storage of the devices under the new rules.
The FAA said that she had already received plans by some airlines that want to expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes.
Under these airlines were also Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the condition of the plan, we could approve the expanded use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers must turn off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the plane doors are closed.
You can start only once the plane reaches a height of three kilometres and gives the captain the go-ahead.
At the entrance to the runway, the passengers must switch them back and they must not start again until the plane landed.
Under the new guidelines could airlines whose aircraft are secured against electronic interference, the devices also allow its passengers to start, landing and use on the tarmac, the FAA said.
Most new airliners and other planes that were adapted for the use of Wi-Fi in larger amounts, should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the professional association of professional flight attendants, welcomed the changes.
"If the new regulation is implemented, and we are working closely with the airline about this together - will benefit both sides," commented Glading.
Frankly, we are sorry to have to feel on this subject as watchdogs.
Nevertheless, Internet connections for surfing, exchanging emails, text messages or downloading data at three kilometers, the agency explained.
Passengers will be asked to smartphones, tablets and other devices in flight mode.
"Words With Friends," is still not online, the Scrabble game that played the actor Alec Baldwin in 2011 on his smartphone when he is an American Airlines jet had to leave because he refused to switch the device, while the plane was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices like laptops should continue to be stored, because there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin.
In-flight cell phone conversations are also banned.
The regulatory authority for phone calls is the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not at the FAA.

Last month, said Mark Rosen of the Transportation Security Administration, National Transportation Safety Board, an expert on national transportation issues at CBS News, cellphones would still be considered as a risk.
"Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could potentially cause problems in navigation equipment, but because we know from the FCC that can disrupt the transfer stations," said Rosen, also from the air.
An advisory committee of the industry, which was created by the FAA to investigate this issue, suggested last month that the government will permit a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years has increased the pressure on the FAA to loosen restrictions on its use.
Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri, as critics represented the view that there is no valid security reasons for the ban.
The restrictions are more difficult to enforce because the use of the devices has become ubiquitous.
In some studies say that up to a third of the passengers are missing or ignored the closure of the unit.
The FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic devices by air travelers had become, after reports of disruptions to navigation and communication equipment brought in by passengers VHF radios that were then the latest technology trend.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA that comprise them electronic interference.
Airlines offer passengers for several years, Wi-Fi, if the flight is reached.
The Wi-Fi systems, pilots are also less susceptible to interference.
The vast majority of passenger planes should be suitable for the greater use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices are generally much less radio radiation than previous generations.
E-mail reader, for example, give only minimal radiation, if umblaettert.
But when it comes to downloading or sending data transmission values are stronger.
Among the supporters of an easing of restrictions on the devices used by passengers is Amazon.com.
2011 firm employees invited an airliner full of Kindle e-book reader and made a test flight to identify problems, but could find none.
Members of the FAA advisory committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk in the use of devices.
Douglas Kidd said the passenger association, National Association of Airline Passengers that he believes that the distraction of the devices is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other committee members said that there are only isolated reports of pilots who did speak for a malfunction of aircraft systems by the devices, and most of them are very old.
However, the committee recommended the FAA to allow pilots to land in poor visibility conditions instruments in the closure of the devices by the passengers.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes, describing them as a proper adjustment for travelers who extensively today would be equipped with technology.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that there is not a pleasant experience at odds with the safety of passengers," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
