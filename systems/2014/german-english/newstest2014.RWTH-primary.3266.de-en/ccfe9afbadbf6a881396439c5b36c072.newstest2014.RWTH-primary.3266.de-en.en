The throw-away society does not think
The night was long, the music loud and the mood is good, but at some point home.
A: In the bellies of people on the passenger and back seat, the hunger.
Clearly, this may be one or more cocktail or champagne responsible!
What is more natural than to go to the next Drive-In chilled for a snack?
I admit that I am quite happy with it, if it is late or early in the morning to fast food.
A few chips, a Coke and a burger and depending upon home and plugs.
But on the way home the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco Gaeng designers.
What must be one that raises with constant regularity its fast-food bags out of the car window?!
Especially on the weekends are discarded paper bags around streets and parking lots.
"Why?," I ask.
The people are too stupid to make the bags to take home and until the next dustbin?
It is not only that the paper Zeugs disfigured the landscape.
Bags also have been triggered by accidents and traffic facilities, including barriers hidden.
So what does the "throwaway society" but not, presumably, they do not even know what that word means.
If you are travelling more often at night, particularly with several people in the car, you know, a back seat after all nights: Clothes, bottles and other garbage are piling up.
That would represent a few bags but also nothing more or less - in contrast to the street, where no one wants to rumtrampeln on swill.
I see the day when we will already come to the cities and communities need to demand the removal of dopey and fast-food chains for their bags.
