Even if the SG Achim / Baden since four game days without victory, there is still a league football - the good mood.
This leaves coach Tomasz Malmon is no doubt.
Everyone is fully motivated.
Nevertheless, I hope that we will win again.
"Because I do not know anymore how tastes as a victory," Malmon expects a success of his team at VfL Freden Beck II.
Even if it has uprooted the third league reserve from Freden Beck currently no trees, Malmon warning before the finger.
Many players have trained myself in the best places.
So they will be motivated against their former coach particularly safe.
"Moreover, it is important whether it is stepping up from the First," the SG coach.
Back in the road to success, we must increase the Malmon team compared to previous performances.
Especially in the financial work and the very last Umsch old game it suffered.
The chances of recovery must be definitely better.
I therefore hope that my players during the short break finally got his head.
