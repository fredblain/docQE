Tourism: Descent to the Romans
At around 120 metres in length is kept below a sewage channel from Cologne from the Roman era.
Visiting the cathedral of Cologne, is not over.
About 157 meters of the two towers in the sky and make him the second highest church building of Europe.
But few visitors who visit the two slender spires, guessed that locals are under the cathedral, a lot.
Rainer Schulze is an expert on the underworld.
Meeting place for its leaders, the service center of Cologne - tourism directly on the cathedral.
The tour has very unspectacular beginnings: "We are in the garage," says Schulze.
In the seventies, the city fathers wanted an autogerechte city, and therefore stopped by the remnants of the old city wall, which was not too big.
Most users of the Park House today therefore come to the Roman ruins and put their car.
But if you look more closely, discovered in the parking deck, separated by metal Gitter Staebe archaeological site.
About five meters high are unfortunately ruins of stones.
"There are remains of the Roman town wall, which was built in the second half of the first century A.D.," says Schulze.
Before going back to the surface, Schulze participants on the upper level is a glimpse into a dark, 15 meters deep shaft.
This is the fountain of the old cathedral, which unfortunately is perceived.
Next stop of the tour is the Pretorian, and here the participant back down into the depths.
We are seeing here once the office of the most powerful man in the north of the Alps, the Praetor of the CCAA.
What does CCAA, wants to know a visitor.
"The acronym stands for" Colonia Claudia Ara Aggripinensium, "which in English means" city of Roman law and city of Agrippinenser, founded by Emperor Claudius in the place of the altar for the imperial cult "means."
And the Pretorian is the former governor's palace, the power center of the Roman empire at the Rhine.
From the entrance hall of the exhibition, a tunnel entrance to the Roman sewer channel, which is here given to around 120 metres.
"You can walk quietly along the so-called Cloaca Maxima, if you like," encouraging Schulze guests.
Schulze has a surprise.
After he took office the key, he leads the group with a 16 meters deep, walk-in shaft.
"We are now in a mikvah, a ritual Jewish bath," he says.
The Jewish community built its dip deep into the ground to get water, which was the reason for the ritual washing.
To date, at the lower end of the mikvah, whose origins date back to the eighth century, different water levels by changing levels of the Rhine.
The mikvah is part of an archaeological zone on Town Hall Square, for which construction is to begin shortly.
But it will take some years to complete.
