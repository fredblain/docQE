The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important for the decision of whether to delete or reduce the carbon and mining taxes.
But Palmer claimed that could only have ministerial conflicts of interest and would benefit the daughters of Abbott personally by the laws.
"He is a great conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because if one of his daughters is pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether or not they will leave," said Palmer.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission declared Palmer by 53 votes after the recount, the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax.
Palmer called for a revision of the process of counting to go faster.
