Obama's climb-down in health policy
After intense criticism, President Obama yesterday backed down on his often repeated, clear promise: "If you like your health insurance, you can keep it."
After receiving hundreds of thousands of their insurers a letter of resignation, the president threw the Republicans in recent days that he had deceived the American public.
Yesterday, Obama watered down his original promise.
"The vast majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance, can keep them," he said in a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports on the dismissals, Obama called for those Americans who receive such communications, to look for a new insurance on the open market.
Most citizens might be a better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than received.
"You get a better offer," he said.
The government called it a little surprising that the five percent of the population who have completed their own insurance, would have to look around for another collective contract, because it does not comply with the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
"I want to tell the Americans very directly: They deserve better," Sebelius said in testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, explained that the launch of the online platform since October "abysmal."
"I am as frustrated and angry as everyone else," she said.
I am determined to regain your confidence.
This is a disgruntled Sebelius to sit behind her advisers during yesterday's hearing in the House of Representatives was taken after a dispute with the Republican legislators Billy Long from Missouri. The concern was whether it should be obliged to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Sebelius repeatedly with the question of why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act have not renounced voluntarily to a state-sponsored insurance to complete itself a tariff to HealthCare.gov, she now wants to sell millions of Americans.
