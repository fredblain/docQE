Scientists have been able to throw more light on what the relationship is with the capable of creatively organizing his mood.
Previous research had shown that lucky dogs with the tail stretched out to the right (from the perspective of the dog), while it was in nervous dogs the left side.
But now scientists say that other dogs these subtle differences can perceive and respond to it.
Professor Giorgio Vall Orti Gara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: "In humans, is well known that the left and right brain hemisphere respond differently to stimuli that generate positive or negative emotions."
Here we have tried to look at this in other species.
He also pointed out that in dogs as in humans, the right brain hemisphere is responsible for the movement of the left and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings.
To learn more about how dogs respond to the side of their tail, the researchers monitored the animals, while others saw these movies.
They measured heart rate of dogs and analyzed the behavior.
Soon we are likely to understand why the tail in the first, in the other direction
Professor Vall Orti said: "We have shown the Gara dogs films with dogs - either a lifelike version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, and we were able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or right."
If the animals saw how an otherwise ausdrucksloser dog has moved the tail to the right (seen from the perspective of the wedelnden dog), they are able to relax completely.
But it was left to the tail of the dog that wags perspective (again), increased their heart rate and they saw restless.
According to Professor Vall Orti Gara deliberately the dogs do not communicate with each other by these movements.
Instead, he is convinced that the dogs would have learned from experience, what movements they should not be worried, and when.
He said: "When it comes to encounters with other dogs and is the perfect place with the tail in a direction more with friendly behavior and produces the right-hand page is a less friendly behavior, then you react on the basis of this experience."
The researchers say that the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers to a better understanding of the emotions of their animal.
John Bradshaw, an expert on dog behavior and Visiting Fellow at the Faculty of veterinary medicine at the University of Bristol, this was not the first study to examine whether the left and right for dogs.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn your head to the left, if they see an aggressive dog, and to the right, if it is a happy dog.
In another research at the University of Victoria in Canada was as follows: "Dogs are more likely to go to a robot dog that wags his tail" of left and right, rather than in the Italian study to be restless - precisely the other way around. "
According to his testimony could stir the differences so that interpretations of the dogs in the various studies of animals in films or the robot dogs and dogs.
A study of how dogs respond to real dogs, could help, he said.
"Although there is considerable evidence of many different mammals that both halves of the brain are used for different purposes, but many of the details still must be determined and dogs are no exception," said Bradshaw.
Because of their behavior, but simply record will probably not be long before we understand why the tail sometimes in one direction, sometimes the other.
