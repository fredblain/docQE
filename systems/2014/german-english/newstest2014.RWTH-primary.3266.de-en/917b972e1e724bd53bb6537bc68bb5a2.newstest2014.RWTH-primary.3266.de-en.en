George Kere Van: European unbundling gives the Scots the election
A new day, a new Schreckens history of independence.
This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This is the key word for stories of passport controls in Berwick and a secure border with barbed wire along the Hadrian's Walls.
Indeed, it was pointed out in the template forming on the possible economic benefits that would bring more freedom to travel in the rest of Europe, but this was - as expected - in the headlines.
No one even mentioned that the EU member states often bent their strict rules, if it is more advantageous to them.
Since Scotland currently does not belong to the Schengen area, would be the continued disregard for Brussels, only a small concession in exchange for what it really wants from the Scots.
That is not really a story.
And one that has occurred in the years that it already looks like a fossil: The first time I used the "independence means passport controls at least 40 years ago," duck heard.
This is an interesting point in the continuous replay of this ancient history.
Why should you expect from an independent Scotland that it is at the European pipe?
Why the London exchange against the yoke of Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: The large, adopted after the war plan for the unification of Europe is stalled.
With the euro crisis the European project is dead.
Parties are gaining ground everywhere in the EU, are hostile to the EU - or want to have the euro as their common currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic party, Alternative for Germany - until this year - almost five million votes in the federal election in September, and thus effectively for the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) out of the Bundestag.
There have always been local opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
The current economic crisis, as a turning point.
Because of the strict austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the straitjacket into which is forced the national economy by adhering to the common currency, many people believe that the European project has gone too far.
The crisis of the euro has little to do with the fact that national governments will cause excessive budget deficits - this was only the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has pinned down its members on exchange rates, which are beneficial to German exporters and the German politicians would want to leave.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the local currency is southern Europe with a built-in productivity disadvantage vis-Ã -vis Germany.
The only way is to cut public spending and wages - spurred by Berlin.
Behind the current budget and monetary problems, a deeper European productivity problem.
As a result of the "green" energy policies imposed by Brussels - a code for subsidising French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer - pays the European industry compared with the United States twice for electricity and gas fourfold.
This is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All the world does not reward hard Schreibungen protect European petrochemical industry from being pushed into a corner by cheap American shale gas.
As a result of a revolt, especially in France, the former cheerleader of the EU.
After the war, the EU saw France's political elite as a vehicle to keep Germany in check and could keep Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Paris and Berlin does not need more than gateway to political legitimacy, and Europe has put its own economic policy, which the struggling French economy.
The result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing National Front, hostile to the EU has just won a crucial by-election and the ruling Socialists in three.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote - a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it can expect a split in the right-wing spectrum would automatically mean advantages for the left.
What makes Le Pen with their newly won popularity among the white working-class French?
They want to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti- common currency bloc in the European Parliament.
If anti-EU parties do well in these elections - and that is very possible - then for the first time such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point I want to: In the not-so-distant future, the growing resentment against the EU and the common currency, to the abolition of the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it is more like the "Europe of the (sovereign) nations, the General de Gaulle preferred.
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may keep the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect that Great Britain distanced itself from this project in the hope of cosying up to the United States.
Nevertheless, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic.
Where does Scotland in all this?
We can determine a region by (ultimately) to be small - England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests - including Brussels, Berlin and say what they want to hinstecken.
I suspect that Scotland could run a looser European union quite well, as long as we keep our own currency.
The cooperation with other like-minded countries, is not in a federal Europe of the Nations.
Otherwise, we should consider that Norway do well and maintain our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland - remarkably - the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and has 2011 spectacular majority due to the rejection of the proposed (and) cuts made by the Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory Lib Dem coalition.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence, only to impose an austerity policy in Berlin and Brussels.
