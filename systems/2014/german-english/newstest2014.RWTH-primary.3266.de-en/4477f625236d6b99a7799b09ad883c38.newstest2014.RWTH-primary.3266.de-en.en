A court decision to stop - and blocked - Demotika directive of NYPD
A federal appeals court in the United States on Thursday blocked the arrangement of a judge, the changes to the BMW Demotika Program ("stop and search") had demanded of the New York Police Departments, and the judge absolving them from the case.
The 2th U.S. Court of Appeals declared that the decisions of Judge Shira's license would be suspended Dlin until an appeal is decided.
The judge had ruled in August that the city would offend the Constitution with the way the programme will be implemented for stopping and questioning people.
The city appealed against their judgment and ordered corrective measures, including the decision to set up a supervisory body that should support the police in changing the directive and the corresponding training program.
The Court of Appeal on Tuesday heard the arguments of the suspension.
The report, the judge declared appeal should be relieved from the case because they have violated the code of conduct for U.S. judges by is that a judge should avoid the appearance of partiality; this was partly due to a series of media interviews and public statements, in which she had publicly responded to the criticism of the court.
The judge ruled that police officers had violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, because they were unduly targeted black and Latin American men with the BMW Demotika program.
It has appointed an outside agency to monitor the implementation of key changes, including reforms to policies, training and supervision, and ordered a pilot program at the body cameras in neighborhoods where most checks were carried out.
In August, the city of New York, ready to end the practice of storing names and addresses of people who were sacked after checks by the police.
A consideration of the appeal of the city is planned after 14 March 2014.
The BMW Demotika - tactic has been criticized by a number of civil rights advocates.
Such controls are there for decades in various forms, but the number of recorded controls rose during the term of the independent elected mayor Michael Bloomberg to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
2004 out of four men who were all minorities, taken the case, which became a class action.
Supporters say the changes in the BMW Demotika - program of the NYPD, the changes are unfair practices and create a more reliable and more effective police force and influence the way the scheme to use other police chiefs.
Opponents argue that the changes would dampen the morale of the police, but not the crime; it would waste money and not solve the broader problem of a police force that is after the disappearance of thousands of jobs in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that the BMW Demotika - practice concludes that is constitutional, reformiere but only the type of application of controls by the NYPD.
