UN announces new targets to reduce poverty
The United Nations now begin preparing a new set of targets designed to replace the Millennium Development Goals to combat poverty proclaimed twelve years ago.
In the run-up to the U.N. summit on sustainable development that began in the evening in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in the push for "sustainable development goals," which should replace the Millennium Development Goals, which expires in 2015.
They were included in the final draft of the document, the global political leaders, including Mrs Gillard, will be adopted at the summit.
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said in the evening at the summit, the time has come, "think about the national interests."
"I am pleased that member states have agreed to a process which should be agreed with the universal sustainable development goals," he said.
"These goals will build on our progress on the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the framework for the development after 2015.
I will spare no effort to implement the mandate given to me by the member states to realize our vision of sustainable development goals, which build on the success of the Millennium Goals. "
