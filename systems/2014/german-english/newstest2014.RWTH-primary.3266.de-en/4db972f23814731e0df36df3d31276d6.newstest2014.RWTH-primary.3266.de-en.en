Red traffic lights to ensure waiting time.
Sometimes it is simply not a traffic light green.
The contact loop in the street does not react, or the light signal is broken.
What do you do - red?
Some people have waited long enough for a red light and the crossing is free, he can continue, the Stuttgart-based lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "motorcycle."
But the waiting time must be "appropriate" what could be interpreted differently from case to case.
Becker recommends to endure at least five minutes before it can be a disorder of traffic lights.
If the ride continues, despite Rotlichts, must, however, bear in mind that it makes for an accident caused by the full blame.
Those who tolerated less than five minutes, may not wait long enough, warns Becker and refers to a decision of the High Court of Hamm.
In the current case, a driver for about three minutes, the duration of red lights and had to answer for a negligent Rotlicht violation.
The traffic was not broken, but later jumped on Green.
A driving ban was spared because of the special situation - but not the fine.
