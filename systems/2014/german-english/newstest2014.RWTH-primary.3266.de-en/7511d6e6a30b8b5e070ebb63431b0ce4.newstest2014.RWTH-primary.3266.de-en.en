Today it was processed, who works for the law firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, convicted and sentenced at Liverpool Crown Court after a two week trial for obstruction of justice charges.
He gave on a previous survey the cocaine possession.
The lawyer was convicted after the police found in their investigations of Scarborough in February 2011 that it had been in regular telephone contact with disappointment.
Two investigators followed the suspects and saw how he went to Dittas house and put the drug with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf glove in the dustbin of the law.
Shortly after he had delivered the drugs, called Scarborough regularly with disappointment over who was at a dinner in a football stadium in the Blackburn Rovers in Ewood Park.

Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: "A criminal lawyer should know better than anyone that does not break the law."
He is accused of abusing his position as a lawyer, because he has admitted too much with certain clients.
The relationship is not simply that of a drug Haendlers, but a drug Haendlers who supplied his lawyer with drugs.
One of his messages was undoubtedly legitimate, because he was the lawyer of these people.
But that went far beyond the borders of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
It was the police investigation as far as possible, so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
Mr expressed his disappointment over the profession into disrepute.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed that its independence was compromised.

Lawyers must uphold the highest standards of integrity in the public and for trust and confidence.
He has betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind the facade of his career.

This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We will find you and bring you to justice.
