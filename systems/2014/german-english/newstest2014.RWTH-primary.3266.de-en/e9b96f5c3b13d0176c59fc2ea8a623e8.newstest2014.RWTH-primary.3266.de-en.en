Postal hardly emptied on Sundays
"There are many citizens have not yet seen the red dots for the Sunday collection are still on different mailboxes of the core parts of the city and the city, but if you read the small print of the yellow boxes of Post AG, quickly found out that the collection on Sundays and public holidays," shares the FDP.
A question of the FDP have confirmed this.
On Sundays and holidays will only be emptied before the postal buildings in the Ernst Ludwig Strasse 36 - 1 and Jakob Müller in the field.
Whether is emptied in Hofheim and Rosengarten also Sunday, will not be answered in the answer to the question of the FDP.
The social and youth field of the FDP spokesman, Fritz, Beck, wants to come back here.
The Sunday collection is scheduled to post an important post service.
"This duennt this company on January 2013, despite the price increase for letters and unreasonable."
Thomas Bittner, the Liberal group - and Stadtverbandsvorsitzender, supported his colleague: "What annoys me is the fact that the collection times surreptitiously here changed or deleted."
The post is still miles away from citizens.
"At least the ones must be emptied in the quarters Neuschloß and Catinaccio again on Sundays," says Beck, Bittner and tubes.
Also holds true for the core city, not particularly mobile citizens must be able to reach a mailbox with Sunday collection, walking.
Beck asked tubes in the city parliament, whether the city government is planning talks with the Post on this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the Post had not communicated with M100.
But it was his knowledge in Hofheim, a fine collection.
Her party has called for privatization.
"Then decisions will be taken elsewhere," said Maier.
