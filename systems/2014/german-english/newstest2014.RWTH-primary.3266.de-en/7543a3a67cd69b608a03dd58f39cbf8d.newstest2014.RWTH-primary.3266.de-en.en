Until now, the police inspectorate Kempten can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
The officials were only twice to eierwerfenden children who threw them against facades.
Because the homeowners this time, and the egg remains equally remote, appears to have been no material damage.
There were also some Sylvester Boeller probably detonated in the city, but here, too, has suffered no damage.
A trail that wrapped its cars with toilet paper, residents in the bishop - Freundorfer - and its Radzierblenden were stolen.
Until the arrival of the police has found the man but his Radzierblenden close all over again, so the police had to be continued.
