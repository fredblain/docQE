Egypt's first freely elected president sworn in
Mohamed Morsi, the presidential oath, but his day of triumph may not be the end of the political disputes in Egypt.
The Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a "new Egypt," as he was sworn in as the country's first freely elected president, and thus took over from Hosni Mubarak, was driven from office 16 months ago.
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt's fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago.
He put the oath before the 18 judges of the court dressed in black robes, which sits on the Nile, and is modeled on an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We aspire to a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," Morsi said during the ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.
"Today the Egyptian people has laid the foundation for a new life - absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability," said the 60-year-old Morsi, an U.S. educated engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that had been taken since its founding 84 years ago, mostly as a banned organization targeted by the respective government.
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building, when Morsi arrived shortly after eleven pm local time in a small car Konvoi.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered outside the court, shouting for joy about the new president, and unlike the presidential pomp from the Mubarak era, the traffic was halted only temporarily, so that the Konvoi could cross the busy road connecting the city center with the southern suburbs.
The Brotherhood has derided as an uncharismatisches "spare tire" increased his personal prestige in his victory speech and a free day, not only for himself as a candidate of the Islamists, but all those who wanted to bring the aspirations of the 2011 uprising against the autocratic Mubarak.
"Egypt is now a civilian, national, constitutional and modern state," declared in a blue suit with red tie Morsi dressed the judges in the wood-panelled chamber, in which he gave the oath of office.
Morsi later went to the University of Cairo, where he should keep his inaugural speech.
He was officially welcomed by a military band played the national anthem, which he listened in Habachtstellung.
The military ruler Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi, was present.
On his arrival, he was among hundreds of people in the largest university classroom with chants of "the army and the people are one hand" welcomes.
Founded in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, University of Cairo in the 1970s has become a stronghold of Islamist student groups.
On Friday, Morsi presented a symbolic oath on Tahir Square, the birthplace of the uprising, led last year to the end of the authoritarian rule of Mubarak, and he has vowed to reclaim presidential powers that had been accepted by the Military Council hunted out of office by the head of state.
But with the departure of the official oath before the court and not as usual in front of the parliament he prevents the will of the military, which shows that the power struggle will continue.
Morsi's speech at the Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
