Municipal council welcomes sound budget
Whenever it comes to council meetings to the budget, Mayor Ralph Gerster laugh.
The Gemeindesaeckl in Wangen - Schoenberg's stove is well stocked and debt does not know the administration since 2005.
For the financial year 2012 can be made in this sense as an unqualified success.
This was at the launch of the annual accounts for 2012.
As Andrea Roth, the administrative budget is planned with about 7.6 million more than a million higher than that.
The Ueberschuss of the administrative budget of around EUR 1.8 million is about one million euros over the approach.
It was the Ueberschuss especially higher business tax revenues and the county's share of the income tax.
The capital budget was again well above the planned values.
Instead of the EUR 1.5 million last year, it was EUR 2.5 million.
"This is essentially due to the increase in supply from the administrative budget," says Roth.
As planned, made in 2012, has been less investment than the backward areas and higher.
Overall, the general reserve fund could be increased by around EUR 2.1 million to EUR 4.9 million.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked the mouth and her team for their good work.
"This work cannot simply shaking out of the sleeve," Gerster praised overlooking the annual financial statements.
He and the local councils were visibly over the good figures.
It may sound paradoxical, but these very good figures could come at the public soon.
Through the good financial situation could forgo the community in the past to high rates.
But this, in turn, have been reduced several times, according to Gerster, grants from the country.
For these grants from various compensatory sticks, there are conditions.
Among other things, the cities and communities who apply for grants, with some rates.
"We have to look at the issue of lifting rates, because investment in the coming years, for which we would like to support," announced Gerster, in this context.
