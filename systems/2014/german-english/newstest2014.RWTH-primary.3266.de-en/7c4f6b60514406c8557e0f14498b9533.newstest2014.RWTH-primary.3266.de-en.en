Australian sets appeal against a prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney who was sentenced to 15 days in Phuket prison, because she had falsely claimed to have been raped by a taxi driver, has appealed against the sentence and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was the first by a provincial court in Phuket on June 15, found guilty of making a false statement, having entered the Thai police, a local taxi driver took them in the morning on Sunday, 10 June, raped, while two other men grabbed them.
Later, however, the photographs showed a video camera that it became safe in their hotel after they had been separated from her Australian boyfriend.
The police interrogated Bamford for two days in Phuket until they confessed to fabricating the story.
Until the trial is in police custody.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a prison with a low security level in Phuket, instead of in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Rugby League, who has appealed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra with a request for help for his daughter.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney, the whole family is "extremely worried" about the welfare of his daughter and wanted to have them back to Australia.
"We are very concerned, of course, but we hope that she is back home as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford has appealed against the sentence and is free on bail of 50,000 baht.
The Australian reports that it was in the meantime, in the resort of Krabi in southern Thailand.
The court was to hear Bamford will be represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and had been warned that the appointment could lead to the imposition of a higher penalty of up to two years in a prison for adults.
But it is also possible that Thailand could be made after the recent assassination of travel purchase wife Michelle Smith in Phuket to improve its tarnished image, and it is therefore interesting to an acquittal.
