Foreign workers on 457 visas could be "Echtheits Test"
The government is considering additional measures in the framework of a "Echtheits test" for foreign workers with a 457 visa.
The test should be introduced, it would amount to a criterion that is used to prevent the 457 occupation by unskilled jobs or as a back door for the influx of family and friends to Australia.
Today, the government published a proposal for discussion after the former members of the Labor Party, Maxine McKew, who denounced the government's comments on foreign workers, because they could be viewed by the neighbours of Australia as an insult.
"Vocal declarations like, foreigners should stand back" and "first of all, Australians are a very unpalatable fallback in times when unions demanded a protected labor market," she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, it was reported that white workers should be protected - and if some people in the region vernaehmen an echo of this historic artifact, it would not surprise me.
The proposal outlines twelve measures that were once considered by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration minister Brendan O "Connor, who was yesterday to talk about people smuggling in Sri Lanka, has implemented five of the recommended changes, the others are still being considered.
If the "Echtheits criterion" is accepted, it could be someone who applied for a visa to be reviewed to see whether the motion "is really in the cases where the applicant is associated with the owner or relevant person of the sponsoring company, or in person."
Companies could also be obliged to account for the number of 457 visa holders, as in the past, companies that wanted to support only a small number of workers, as hundreds have stopped.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum, presumably of a heart attack after he arrived this week with a refugee boat on Christmas Island.
Nine-year-old unhinged megalomaniacs, the son of the man who came with him to Australia, is maintained since the death of his father on Wednesday by an adult cousin, who was also on the boat.
Australian authorities brought the man into the Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
