New nicotine vaccine could kill the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed a vaccine against nicotine, which could spoil the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice for a lifetime of smoking.
Further tests are needed before tests on humans, which can take some years, said Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, the first results are good.
"We are very hopeful that we can help this kind of vaccination strategy once millions of smokers who have tried to quit and have tried all methods available on the market, but that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches," said Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified so that it contains the genetic information on the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus, the liver cells that produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies in the blood Molekuele hunt the nicotine and neutralize them before they reach the brain, which is a smoker no nicotine.
In experiments, vaccinated mice who were given nicotine, their normal level of activity.
Mice without vaccination would have a "time out" on the other hand, the researchers said, a sign that the nicotine have reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science in translational medicine.
Former tobacco Impfstoffe failed because they contained antibodies.
The vaccinations had to be ordered to maintain the antibodies Pegels so often that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine are likely to be much lower, because it transforms liver cells in antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal, could be a future vaccine for people, if he is sure to be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, and thus prevent nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely that smokers would use to stop him.
"You know: If they are beginning to smoke, they feel because of the nicotine vaccine is no longer enough, and that helps them to overcome the habit," he explained.
British scientists said, the results are interesting, but at the same time warned that further research is necessary.
