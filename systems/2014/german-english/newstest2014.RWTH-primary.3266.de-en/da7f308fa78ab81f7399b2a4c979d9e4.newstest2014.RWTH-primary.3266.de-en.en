Chinese newspaper to call for "reform"
A Chinese newspaper, which had demanded the release on the front page of a reporter who had been charged with defamation, should be reformed, told a press Regula.
The New Express, based in Guangzhou had printed a rare public appeal for the release of the journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen was later on television that he had accepted bribes to falsify reports on a teilstaatliche company.
The New Express will now undergo a "comprehensive Rektifizierung" the regulator said.
The "Rektifizierung arrangement" was issued by the agency for press and publications, radio, film and television in Guangdong.
Preliminary investigations showed that the New Express, which belongs to the Yang Cheng Evening News Group, had published between September 2012 and August 2013 several inaccurate reports of the listed company Zoom Lion.
"The editorial management of the New Express was disorganized," announced the regulator in a statement.
She said, "we have decided to impose an administrative punishment for Chen Yongzhou and his reporter license."
"We have also instructed the Yang Cheng Evening News Group, the New Express, recommended a complete Rektifizierung and to identify the relevant officials at the New Express and the management team of the New Express."
Chen had written several articles for the New Express, where he reported on alleged financial irregularities with a manufacturer of building machinery called Zoom Lion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and stood behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen on state television and admitted that he had published false reports in exchange for payment.
"In this case, I have damaged Zoom Lion as well as the entire news industry and their ability to gain the trust of the public," he declared to the state-run news channel CCTV.
I have done so primarily because I was at money and glory.
It has become clear to me that I have acted wrongly.
Following Chen's apology, the New Express published an apology on the front page, and that they had failed to check the reports.
Various known suspects have filed recently on television confessions.
Experts say that confessions are still routinely enforced, despite a change in the law, which was banned earlier this year the authorities to force someone to blame themselves.
