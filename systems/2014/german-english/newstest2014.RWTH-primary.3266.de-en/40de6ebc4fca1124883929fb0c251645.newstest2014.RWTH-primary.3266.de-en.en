More than 325 million Australian dollar rescue package for tasmanisches health care
The Australian government insists on the tough conditions that are associated with the bailout package of more than 325 million Australian dollars for the Tasmanian health care to ensure that the state government can spend the money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take "immediate measures" to avert a crisis that was caused by an aging population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic disease and system constraints.
The funding for a period of four years, was decided after government consultations with the independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has put together a contingency rescue package that is in our view, the unique challenges facing the state," Plibersek said today.
This includes $325 million emergency aid package of $31 million for electoral services.
Through another 2600 operations, including orthopedic surgery and treatments for eye cataracts, residues should be eliminated.
Moreover, there is money for daily clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better aftercare for inpatient stays, the specialist training, mental health services and the introduction of a system of electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.
"These investments are the ideas that the clinic staff told me that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system," said Tanya Plibersek.
The minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability of the Tasmanian government.
The state must maintain the current level of funding in order to be able to receive money from the Commonwealth, and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent.
A pioneer Commission will set up and is designed to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
Wilkie said today that the $325 million would benefit little, if "they are not accompanied by real reforms that bring Tasmanian health system to a more sustainable rate."
Nevertheless, he praised the government for the fact that they have responded to his request for emergency aid, which he first expressed to the prime minister at the beginning of May.
"I am confident that the federal aid will make a major contribution to the public health system in the state of the list of concerns," said Wilkie.
According to the state government will be able to make up this election provided most of the recent cuts.
But the health spokesman for the opposition at the federal level, Peter Dutton, believes that today's announcement is only a "Band-Aid solution."
"We are in today's situation, because the Labor state government has withdrawn $430 million from the health system," he said on ABC TV.
It cannot be that a state government almost half a billion dollars from the system, and the Commonwealth of 300 million, and then pretend that is the good news.
Dutton Plibersek urged to guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package will be spent for additional bureaucracy.
