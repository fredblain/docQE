United States wants to prosecute Snowden
The U.S. has not changed its attitude to the former U.S. intelligence employee Edward Snowden.
He will continue to be accused of having passed secret information.
Therefore, he must face a trial in the US, said the U.S. State Department spokeswoman, Jennifer Psaki, in Washington.
The recent statements by Snowden would not change this.
He urged the German Green politician Hans-Christian Stroebele after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow on the U.S. to continue to threaten it with sanctions.
Psaki stressed that the Stroebeles statements of a parliamentarian is not a member of the German government.
