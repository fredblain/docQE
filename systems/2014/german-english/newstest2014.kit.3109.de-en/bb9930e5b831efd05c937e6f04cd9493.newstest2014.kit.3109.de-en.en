Esa decides on large space missions: missions for billions
Distant planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that they want to start in the next few years.
30 were proposals to choose from, five are still in the race.
Distant worlds.
More than 1000 planets in other stars, astronomers have already found.
Whether or not there is at least some of them life, nobody knows.
The selection is difficult: you should look for gravitational waves?
Or explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or searching for Earth-like planets and perhaps discovering alien life?
These questions are just the leaders of the European Space Agency (Esa.
They are looking for ideas for its program "cosmic vision" for two major space projects that will contribute enormously to the research.
The budget for such "l missions" each is approximately EUR 1 billion.
The start will be expected to 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, in Paris, the elite of European space research, to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 were ideas for debate, five of them have now been shortlisted.
Many bodies evaluate the proposals, push the researchers.
In the next few days, a final decision by the scientific program committee.
A total of four major issues has chosen the Esa, to which the missions of the 2007 programme initiated "cosmic vision" to find answers.
What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life?
The exact processes for the development of stars from large clouds - and thus the formation of planets that orbit stars - they are still in the dark.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this dark.
And if a star has a planet, under what circumstances can arise?
In order to analyse this issue will start in 2017, the space telescope "Cheops," with the 500 already known planetary systems in our neighbourhood.
The possibilities are limited, Cheops is a small mission, with a budget of EUR 150 million.
With larger instruments could analyze the astronomers erdähnliche planets, and even the composition of their atmospheres and search for "biomarkers": gases, which are regarded as an indicator for biological activity.
How does the solar system?
Ultimately, this question is to say what the conditions for the emergence of life.
Plays an important role in the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field and the particles of radiation emanating from the solar system.
In our solar system, these processes can examine.
With the "solar Orbiter" Esa already has a mission of the M-class (the budget is around half a billion euros) for this question.
The probe will start in 2017 and closely monitor the sun's surface and activity.
Of great interest to the researchers are also Jupiter and its moons.
They want to find out what the role of the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system.
The Esa is the first of the three L-missions of the "cosmic Vision" program.
The probe "juice" (Jupiter Icy moons Explorer) begins its journey expected to 2022.
Eight years later, they explore Jupiter and the atmosphere of the planet and the icy moons Europe Kallisto and Ganymede.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The space offers many opportunities to study the matter under extreme conditions and to investigate whether the known laws of nature are still valid.
Maybe there are deviations, the physicists could point the way to a new theory that all known laws of nature.
How the universe is and what is it?
13.7 billion years ago the universe was created by the Big Bang.
In addition to the usual matter of stars, planets and creatures like us, there is dark matter, whose gravity holds together galaxies and clusters of galaxies, and dark energy, which is accelerating the expansion of the universe.
So far, the researchers do not know what the laws of physics in the first of the ' Big Bang ' split second were valid, nor what is dark matter and dark energy.
"Euclid," the Esa has already granted a mission, whose launch is planned for 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe is to examine the distribution of matter in the universe, for the first time in the whole sky and thus allow conclusions about the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could make the race
Of the 30 proposals are only two left at the end of the selection process.
The best chances of approval as L-mission, according to many experts "e-Lisa", a claim concept for the detection of gravitational waves.
Among physicists understand changes in the structure of space-time that Albert Einstein had predicted almost 100 years ago.
They have been found to date.
Elisa could create the hope, the scientists behind the project.
The mission provides an existing for two or three probes detector, which is stationed in space.
He could, in contrast to plants on Earth gravitational waves, which are in the Big Bang, and provide new insights into the origin of the cosmos.
Four other proposals are competing for the second L-mission: a large X-ray telescope named "Athena", which will explore, among other things, black holes, "icy planets," another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism," a mission to survey the cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder" to detect and investigate the erdähnliche planet.
Already, among other proposals on the sample-return transport from Mars, to the exploration of the moon, Venus and asteroids and the solar physics.
