Rangnick-bashing for referees: no swallows Mane King
So satisfied Ralf Rangnick with the current high form of federal league tables leaders Red Bull Salzburg is also disappointed with the sports director of "cops" by implementing the judges.
"There is currently a dangerous tendency that Mane and Alan are pushed into the category of swallows kings," he took the two Offensivwirbler on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg.
Recent occasion for Rangnicks criticism was yellow for Mane at 3-0 against Gardena last Sunday, in which the Senegalese was an alleged acting fatal - which was not, as the TV images showed.
"A wrong decision," said Rangnick, implementing Harkam judges described as "completely overwhelmed."
Harkam would also have "its part" to the escalation between Salzburg coach Roger Schmidt and Gardena-coach Adi Hütter after the game.
His German country man he defended firmly: "I would behave in every situation, such as Roger Schmidt."
Schmidt wants after skirmishes with Hütter have had no contact with his colleagues.
I do not know why.
"Because I am the one who was insulted," said the 46-year-old.
Given the success run Rangnick agreed but praise anthem.
"There are only two words:" well, he noted.
There is not much.
Above all, the way the team is impressive.
This should continue.
There will be little squad changes during the winter transfer period.
There is no great reasons to make a difference.
"Except for a player with the desire that he wants to leave the club," said Rangnick.
