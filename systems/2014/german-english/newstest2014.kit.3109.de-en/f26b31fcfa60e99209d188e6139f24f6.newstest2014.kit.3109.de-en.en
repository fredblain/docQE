US wants to continue to prosecute Snowden
The US has not changed its position on the former US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden employees.
He will continue to be accused of hacking secret information.
Therefore, it should be a criminal proceedings in the United States, the spokeswoman said the US State Department, Jennifer Psaki, in Washington.
The recent statements by Snowden would not change this.
Previously, the German Green politician Hans-Christian Stroebele, after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow has appealed to the United States, not to threaten him with punishment.
Psaki stressed that this was a parliamentarian for Stroebele statements and not that of a German government member.
