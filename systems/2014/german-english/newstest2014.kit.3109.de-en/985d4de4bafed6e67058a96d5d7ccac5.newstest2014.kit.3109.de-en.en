The newly designed Opschlag shines with a new cafe.
One thing that invites you to relax and come.
One thing that would make the name of the program.
As Déjà Vu is according to a psychological phenomenon, which leads to the feeling of having already experienced or a new situation.
In the case of the visit of the cafés in Opschlag in Kleve district town within sight of the Rhine-Waal university must not simply remain a déjà vu.
After all, the cafe with the beautiful name exactly the target: a stay not only mental, but always hand repeatedly.
Because it is fun and easy.
A look into the inner workings of the Opschlag 8 gives the viewer to feel good.
The ultra-modern, but not cool cafe atmosphere looks like a place to feel good.
Here, the team with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Buettner at the top of the guest with a variety of coffee or a cocktail.
There are delicious cakes or individually fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, even before the opening of the charming cafés in Opschlag as restaurateurs made a name: in Kranenburg attributed the "art lounge."
The move to Kleve in Opschlag expect the cafe-lovers more audience.
Last but not least, by the university.
"We do not have a specific target group," said Daniel Buettner.
Instead, the two would raise young students as well as seniors and all age categories.
Speaking of coffee lovers.
A few owners behind the coffee.
The fragrant hot brew itself in different variations.
Expressofan
Daniel Buettner is rather the Expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt cappuccino-drinking.
"A baguette - that is my thing," she tells the NRZ.
Two events were already in the bright cafe.
Rather one.
Because the port was more out there - the cafe Déjà Vu benefited from it.
But there were also Ringelnatzabend.
"Beautiful, successful and funny," the two 33-year-olds.
But not everyone's thing.
Perhaps it is Daniel Buettner is decidedly not a fan of event evenings: "it is not all right."
And with an event, I am only interested in, even for the special event.
Events will be the exception rather than the rule.
"We want to disrupt the normal operation of as little as possible."
Should read: Déjà Vu also stands for reliability.
In terms of the quality of the products offered, as well as on the team and the beautiful surroundings of the Opschlag in Kleve.
The road that is increasingly becoming a mile gastronomy.
To the delight of many Klever, guests from near and far, and the students who discover the gastro-mile and the Café Déjà Vu.
