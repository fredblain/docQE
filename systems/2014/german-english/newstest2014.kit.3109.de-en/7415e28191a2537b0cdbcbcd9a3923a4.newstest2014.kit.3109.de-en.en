The TSV Morsum after six days of game still without any point in the handball league.
It is now for the team by Ingo Ehlers tomorrow for the derby against TSV Daverden, who celebrated his first victory last weekend.
With this game begins the new season for us.
"I hope that we will finally have the head," Ehlers is optimistic.
He has a long time, with the exception of the injured Hendrik Blohm, its complete squad available.
We also Daverden sets as speed game.
Therefore, we must keep our error rate low.
In the first place, to increase the coverage, the last anything other than a safe impression.
Clearly relaxed, Daverdens coach Thomas Panitz after the first season victory against Nordhorn.
The game was of course a number.
But that is why we are far from being the favorite, because in the Derby, anything can happen at any time.
However, Panitz now wants to concentrate on Morsum to start a series.
Absence is Jan-Malte iodate.
The A-youth celebrates Joost Windßuß having double game right at the A-youth squad under HC Bremen, his debut season.
Who is hot in a game, not to stay at home.
