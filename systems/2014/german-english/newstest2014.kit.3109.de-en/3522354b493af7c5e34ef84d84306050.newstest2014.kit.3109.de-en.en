The sale was agreed by the council in its most recent meeting in the non-public part.
The building's owners switched to a "reasonable" price.
"The community is happy," says Maier.
In the budget of EUR 100000.
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former nursery.
The mayor, it is right that Winterlingen responsibility for the building before the winter handed over to someone else, and thus no longer have to pay for the maintenance of the house, how to look after the garden and the sidewalk.
"This effort is now gone," says Maier.
