Coulson, phone-hacking for checking a tips
The former News of the Word-editor Andy Coulson was supposedly "phone-hacking, surveillance and confrontation" in an attempt to confirm a false tip about an affair of the then Home Secretary Charles Clarke.
State prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the court at the Old Bailey, the News of the World in May 2005 have heard a false rumor that Clarke had a relationship with his "attractive special adviser" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper commissioned the private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlbys voicemails and pursued, but Coulson called them and left messages, such as the court was told.
"According to the prosecutor's office is Coulson, who is now editor of the NotW, no one stands in front of the apartment by people hoping to catch them in flagrante delicto, but one that people are faced with a story, to see their reaction," said Edis.
He said that NotW use three methods to investigate citizen stories: phone-hacking, monitoring and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he is aware of the second, monitoring, otherwise it cannot be.
What about the first?
He knows about the phone-hacking?
He denies that, but we say, "and whether he knew about it."
Rumors of an affair Clarke's first of the feature editors of NotW, as a source that was sexually interested in Pawlby, said: "you do not waste your time with Charles."
A band with voice mails from her phone at least three occasions in Mulcaires apartment in August 2006.
The investigators also found entries on the computer of a detective on the Pawlby and her sister were stored as "projects".
At the time the searches were the grandparents of Pawlby anonymous phone calls in which they were asked for information about them, said Edis.
Meanwhile, the former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw the monitoring of the movements of Pawlby.
On June 18, 2005, leaving behind Coulson a voicemail with the following content: "I have a story, we want to get out tomorrow, I would like to speak with Charles."
Edis said Coulsons activities in this story followed the same pattern as with other important personalities, the former Home Secretary David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett was due to an affair with a married woman, when he was with the co-Rebekah Brooks liiert, who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks argue to have conspired with others to hack between 3 October 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted the phone-hacking.
