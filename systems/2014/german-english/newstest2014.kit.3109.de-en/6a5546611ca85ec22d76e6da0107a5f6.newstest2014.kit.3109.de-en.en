With future prospects
Actually, Waltraud Ries lives.
Her house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart, with a lot of green, an old trees, nice neighbors and not too much traffic.
In the city, there are only a few minutes by public transport.
"I hope they are not afraid of spiders?" Asks Waltraud Ries, pointing at the door of a big spider.
I am looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for some time.
But you know how difficult it is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not a spider phobia, but the concern, at the age of the many steps to the house and no longer in the apartment, she explains.
Moreover, since a meniscus tears operation, the Mittfünfzigerin experienced what it means to move with handicap from floor to floor.
Recently published a book of her on ' Lucky live in old age - Which living form is the best for me? '.
' Our apartment is the best example of what is not in old age, ' she says.
When she moved more than 20 years ago with her husband in the duplex apartment, it was just a beautiful apartment.
Now in his mid-fifties Waltraud Ries feel that way.
But she also knows that she is one of the few people who deal with the issue of ' living in old age.
Most of it, as long as possible.
They are old, the other ', says chuckle.
Only if the suffering is great pressure, you are thinking.
' Then it may be too late, " Ries.
In her book, the interior designer 17 residential models for a self-determined living in old age.
' What living form but one chooses, is an individual decision, " she explained.
The leading solution, it is not for the ages.
Even those who can afford the Altersruhesitz in Tuscany or Brittany, should always bear in mind that he could be ill.
And: ' Without lonely good knowledge of the country's language in the Dolce Vita ' specialist book author to consider relocation.
Among their models are classic models of care, alternative forms of housing, or the oft-quoted pensioners-WG.
At the age of each has his tics and quirks
" For me it would be a residential community, but nothing, ' she says with a wink.
Certainly not as a student WG with a shared bathroom and kitchen.
' In the age you just need his withdrawal rooms ' Ries.
A senior living community can still work, the author does not want to exclude.
It must then work differently than in the classical student WG.
And sometimes you want to simply his rest, she believes.
With this view, it is not, at least in the capital alone.
' The majority of old people in Stuttgart want to stay as long as it is in their own home, is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of the civil service life at the age of the country's capital.
The department advises people around ' ageing '.
That is why older people would often just inconvenience and restrictions, only to be able to remain in that environment, that is the experience of the Stiftung Warentest.
There are many ways to make the house or apartment, barrier-free.
Ries recommends all dealing with the age just remodeling their house or apartment, once thoroughly, and not just the best craftsmen.
Today, there is also the age just reconstruction specialists.
Even in the apartment for rent is one or the other, and if it is only the Toilettensitzerhöhung, clarifies the interior designer.
But it is not always the existing apartment age and thus accessible, even if it is so beautiful.
This experience has had to make Waltraud Ries.
Although we could install a stair lift inside the apartment, but the road paved with stairs to the street would be a far greater obstacle.
It will continue until it has found the ideal property for herself and her husband.
Before the move dread it more than before the spider on her front door.
