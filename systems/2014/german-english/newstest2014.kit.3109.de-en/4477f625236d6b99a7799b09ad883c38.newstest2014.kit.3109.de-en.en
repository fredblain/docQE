Blocked court decision to stop-and-Frisket directive of NYPD
A federal appeal court blocked in the US on Thursday the formation of a judge, the changes to the stop-and-Frisket program ("stop and search" of the New York Police Department, and the judge absolving them of the case.
The 2 US appeal court stated that the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin would be suspended until an appeal of the city.
The judge had ruled in August, the city was in breach of the Constitution with the way the programme will be implemented for stopping and questioning of people.
The city appealed against their assessment and the corrective measures, including the decision to set up a monitoring body, which should support the police in amending its directive and the corresponding training programme.
The appeal court heard on Tuesday's arguments on the requested suspension.
The nomination report stated that the judge had to be discharged from the case because it had breached the code of conduct for US judge, is that a judge is to avoid the appearance of partiality; this was partly justified by a series of media interviews and public statements, in which she had publicly responded to the criticism of the court.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, because they were inappropriately targeted black and Latin American men with the stop-and-Frisket programme.
It has appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of significant changes, including reforms in directives, training and supervision, and ordered a pilot programme with the body cameras in neighborhoods, where most of the checks were carried out.
In August, the city of New York, ready to end the practice of storing names and addresses of people who were dismissed after checks by the police.
One of the appeal of the city is planned after the March 14, 2014.
The stop-and-Frisket-tactic has been criticised by a number of civil rights advocates.
There are checks of this kind for decades in various forms, but the number of recorded controls rose during the term of the partyless Mayor Michael Bloomberg to an all-time high of 684330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
In 2004, was submitted by four men, all minorities, legal action, which developed into a class action.
Supporters of changes to the stop-and-Frisket programme of the NYPD say the changes will stop unfair practices and create a trust worthier and more effective police and influence the way in which the rules of other police chiefs.
Opponents argue that the changes would dampen the morale of the police, but not the crime; the money is being wasted and would not solve the wider problem of police, who after the loss of thousands of jobs in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that they do not finish the stop-and-practice Frisket is constitutional, but only the kind of reform of the implementation of controls by the NYPD.
