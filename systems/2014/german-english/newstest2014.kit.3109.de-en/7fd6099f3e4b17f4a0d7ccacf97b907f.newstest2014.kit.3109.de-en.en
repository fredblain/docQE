Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120000 people have been killed since the beginning of the civil war, nearly three years.
The announcement by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came one day before the deadline on
November 1, the organisation of Damascus, based in The Hague, to destroy all facilities for the production of chemical weapons, or "inoperabel" poison gas, including all machines for mixing chemicals and the filling of ammunition.
The conclusion of this process, which is basically the first stage of the destruction is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable, which is aimed at the destruction of all chemical weapons in Syria by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can produce more new chemical weapons.
Damascus, however, has yet to begin to destroy the existing weapons and supplies.
According to estimates there are about 1000 tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and sarin nerve gas.
The announcement came at a time when, on Thursday in the town of Safira, the experts say that there is a production facility for chemical weapons and storage sites, such as the UK-based Syrian observatory for human rights.

On Thursday, the OPWC, the two sites have been abandoned, "according to the Syrian statement... and the objects of the chemical weapons programme have been relocated to other ' facilities have been inspected."
It was not immediately clear whether the Safira was one of the two institutions that have not been able to visit the OPCW inspectors.
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, the next month, must be approved by the executive committee of the OPWC.
"I salute the bravery and the courage that you all have the fulfillment of the most challenging mission, which has been running ever of this organisation," said Ahmed Uzumcu, the Director-General of the monitoring organization in a commentary published by OPCW.
