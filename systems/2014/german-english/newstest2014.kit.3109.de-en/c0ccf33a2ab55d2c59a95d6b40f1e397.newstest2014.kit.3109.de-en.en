Fancy ice cream that glows in the dark?
A British businessman has developed the first in the dark luminous ice – with the help of jellyfish.
Charlie Francis, the fluorescent properties of marine animals and created a luminous bounties.
The idea came to him after he had read a research work on jellyfish and was able to convince Chinese researchers artificially bright protein.
The ice cream in the consumption of the tongue, making the pH value is raised in the protein and the lights.
Chris explains the ice cream in response to the heat in the mouth and may shine unto – the more you licks, the lighter.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I am Delicious", says: "the product is unbelievable, but still at a very early stage of production, and so you get two grams of 200 pounds."
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue with a neutral pH.
When the mouth warms up the protein, the pH and the ice.
We have tested it in the last few months, and it seemed to us to bring it to Halloween in the market, because it has this wonderful Leuchteffekt.
It is probably the most expensive ice cream I have ever made, because the Quallenleuchtstoff is four times more expensive than gold.
Each ball costs about 140 pounds.
But it tastes delicious.
Char read experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual taste, including beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his latest creation is to be more ambitious.
He says: "I would like to develop an invisible ice cream."
It is impossible because of the refraction, which is caused by the ice crystals that form ice cream, but I suspect that we will find a way to do it.
