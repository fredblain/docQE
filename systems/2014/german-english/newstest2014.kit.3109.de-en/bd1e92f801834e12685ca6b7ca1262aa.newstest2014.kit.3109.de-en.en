I could not believe that she was really up there.
It was wonderful to keep them back to the poor.
The vet said that if the exhaustion has become too big and it would have collapsed, it would probably have crashed.
The firefighters have done an outstanding job.
It was really brave, what they have done.
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added: "we were afraid that they would fall off, but they remained above."
The firefighters were great.
I can hardly believe, where she was.
