Supreme Court confirms Obama's health care law
It is a great victory for the Obama administration: the US Supreme Court ruled today that the closely associated with Barack Obama health care law is constitutional.
With five to four votes, the judges ruled that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is constitutional, it forces US citizens, a health insurance by 2014 or pay a penalty â€“ within the framework of the tax authority of the state.
The chief judge John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the chamber, while the judges born, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy decided against it.
The court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700-page law and also took the view that the imposition of the health law, according to federal states either access conditions to expand Medicaid or otherwise all state Medicaid subsidies would be removed, was not in violation of constitutional restrictive.
The lawsuit was against the law by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The bill was rejected by all the leading Republican presidential candidates, including the eventual challenger Mitt Romney, the 2012.
