Mick Jagger explained that he had never dressed Katy Perry, when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said she worked as a singer of Jagger song "old Habits Die Hard" from 2004.
Perry said that she had eaten dinner with the old rocker, and that "he has me molesters, when I was 18."
She added: "that is a long time ago and he was very nice to me."
In a statement, said a representative of Jagger, 70, on Thursday that he "categorically denied that he ever approach attempts to Katy Perry did."
The representative added: "maybe it confused with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers, who had a guest appearance at the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album "Prism" landed at first number 1 this week.
