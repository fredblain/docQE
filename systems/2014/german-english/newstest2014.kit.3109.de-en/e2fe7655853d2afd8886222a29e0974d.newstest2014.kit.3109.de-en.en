Children should get myths and legends as "role models for life", says the author.
The stories of Thor showed that "brutal power has no chance against clever tricks," and the Arthur legend demonstrate how important it is to have a dream.
Many of the myths, however, are too dirty "far too wild, offensive and, in some cases, to be taught in schools", which is why Crossley-Holland for a "careful selection" just age works.
"I think it is wonderful that myths and folklore in America are already part of education," he said.
I have proposed for 20 years.
He added, authors and teachers who are "overly didactic," children were "completely off," because in entertaining stories "subliminal messages."
Crossley-Holland, Beowulf translated from the Saxon, and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said: "you can pursue certain intentions, but you should keep them in the background."
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author who writes for adults, and an author who writes for children, is the need to give hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or lead to a happy ending, but there is an inherent sense of good and evil.
This must be subliminal, revealed by history and not be explained.
That is the old story of showing rather than telling.
