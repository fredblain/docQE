Vienna airport causes passenger calls
Mr Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
Announcements like this in the future at Vienna's Schwechat airport, no longer exist.
A large part of the Lautsprecherdurchsagen are eliminated, the noise level should be significantly reduced.
To create a more relaxed atmosphere, is the aim of this change.
As Radio Vienna announced Airport spokesman Peter Kleemann, follows the Vienna International Airport with the recruitment of announcements concerning individuals, an international trend.
So do, among other things, the airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai in the noisy calls.
The disappearance of these announcements are on average - in one day - around 200 personal appeals by the speakers, there is going to calm at the airport.
"It has also been shown in the knowledge that these individual announcements were relatively little, but at the same time, all the other information changed flight or departure times a little sink," says Kleemann in conversation with the radio stations.
