Obama's climbdown in health policy
After intense criticism of President Obama yesterday backed down on his oft-repeated, clear promise: "if you like your health insurance, then you can keep it."
After hundreds of thousands of their insurers have received a letter of resignation, Republicans cast the president in the last few days, he had misled the American public.
Yesterday, Obama watered down its original promise.
"The vast majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance, they can," he said in a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports on the dismissals, Obama called for those Americans who have received such messages, to look on the free market for a new insurance.
Most citizens could get a better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or lower than predicted.
"They come up with a better offer," he said.
The government called it a little surprising that the five per cent of the population who have completed an insurance would have to look for another tariff, as their contract does not meet the new standards after the Affordable Care Act.
"I would like to say that Americans directly: they deserve," Sebelius said at a hearing before the energy and commerce committee of the House of Representatives in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said that the launch of the online platform was "miserable" since October.
"I am as frustrated and angry, like everyone else," she said.
I am determined to regain your confidence.
This quote a Sebelius to a seated behind her advisor at yesterday's hearing in the House of Representatives was recorded after a dispute with the Republican legislators Billy Long of Missouri, it was a question of whether it should be obliged to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing Long Sebelius repeatedly pressed on the question of why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily to a state-sponsored insurance, in order to conclude a collective at HealthCare.gov, which it now wishes to sell millions of Americans.
