Frontier Airlines charges for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to require up to 100 U.S. dollars from passengers on their flight hand luggage.
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $100 for a piece of hand luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, even though, in the announcement on Wednesday that passengers are likely to keep the whole box.
The new fee applies to hand luggage in the baggage compartment of the seat, small bags under the seat remain free of charge.
Frontier said it charged $25, when the fee will be paid in advance and $100 for travelers who paid only on the flight.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O 'Malley said, the fee of $100 is introducing travelers to move in advance of the payment.
"We do not want to charge this amount," she said.
Airlines began in 2008, for the first and second to checked baggage fees.
Passengers who tried to circumvent this, therefore, as much as possible, plugged in your hand luggage, which means that the baggage compartments are often overcrowded on the seat.
Fees are a way to encourage passengers to take less on board.
O 'Malley said, the new fee, it is not really about money.
It is about the most loyal customers of Frontier, which would have clearly stated that it will be increasingly difficult to find space in the seat.
Passengers who buy tickets on the website of the airline, do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger on the flight of Frontier may charge a baggage may have to pay for the next person but $100 for a comparable piece of luggage.
O 'Malley said, the website of Frontier and check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers are informed about the fee before they come to the flight.
The new hand baggage fee of Frontier is only in the summer, we do not yet have an exact date.
Passengers often grumble at baggage charges and other fees, airlines like to fall back on.
They argue that the transportation of the baggage cost money and passengers should pay for this service if they wanted it.
Many on Wall Street, the new baggage fees as a sign that the airlines are taking enough money to cover the cost of air travel, after years of losses.
Most so far, however, the fingers of charges for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded three years ago, the first to charge for hand luggage, and later, Allegiant Air, a low-cost carriers.
The only other airline with such a fee is closely followed the Hungarian Wizz Air, the airline consultant Jay Sorensen, the additional charges.
He estimated in a report in December 2011 that the hand baggage fee Spirit $50 million a year equals.
Sorensen, who previously held a leadership position in Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Spirit and was curious what would happen to him on the flight, when passengers were faced with the unusual hand baggage fee of the company.
"The boarding process was one of the smoothly I have experienced in my career in aviation," he said.
I expected to see gnashing and palpable discussions on the flight.
"The plane was full," he said, "and the boarding as lubricated."
Frontier spirit is also $2 for coffee, tea, soda or juice.
The company said that passengers who bought lemonade or juice, are likely to keep the whole box and free coffee will be added.
Water is still free of charge.
US Airways had briefly tried in 2008 to demand for soft drinks money, but that was seven months later, after passengers complained and had no other large company adjusted.
Frontiers step to charge for hand luggage when passengers do not buy directly from the airline, is the latest initiative to customers on its own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies like Orbitz 10 to 25 U.S. dollars per ticket sold.
It provides all companies an incentive to get passengers to the direct purchase with them via an online travel agency.
Frontier, however, is the most in this area.
In September, the company started, when booking through an online travel agency only half as many frequent flyer miles.
On Wednesday the miles were again cut to 25 percent of the flight.
A flight booked with a third party with Frontier over 1000 miles customers therefore only 250 miles.
Passengers can also book exclusively to the direct purchase on the website of Frontier.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in Denver, but the business is shrinking and the company is losing money.
The revenue fell by 9 percent and passenger capacity fell nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, as reported in the financial report, which was published on Wednesday by the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.,.
Republic has tried to get under the sale of the company's finances of Frontier.
