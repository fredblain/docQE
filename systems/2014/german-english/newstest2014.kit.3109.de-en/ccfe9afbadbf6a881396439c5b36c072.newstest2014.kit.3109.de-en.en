The disposable society
The night was a long, loud music and the mood, but at some point, it is home.
Only in the bellies of people on the front and rear seat of hunger.
Clearly, a cocktail or champagne may be responsible for it.
What could be more obvious than gechillt next Drive-In to drive to take a bite?
I admit that I am happy with it, if it is late at night or early in the morning to the fast-food fetching.
A few fries, a Coke and a burger - and then as the home and go to bed!
But on the way home the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco-course.
What must be a missing that constant regularity of its fast-food bags from the car window?!
Especially at the weekends are discarded paper bags at the periphery and parking lots.
"Why?", I wonder.
The people are too stupid to take the bags home or until the next trash?
It is not just that the paper disfigured the landscape.
Bags have concealed transport facilities such as crash barriers and triggered accidents.
So what does this "disposable society" but not, presumably, they do not even know what the word means.
If it is more often, especially with several people in the car, you know how a bank can look after celebrating nights: clothing, bottles and other rubbish are there.
There were a few bags more or less, but nothing, in contrast to the street, where nobody wants to eat the remains of other rumtrampeln.
I can already see the day when the cities and towns to dopey removal - and the fast-food chains must pledge for their bags.
