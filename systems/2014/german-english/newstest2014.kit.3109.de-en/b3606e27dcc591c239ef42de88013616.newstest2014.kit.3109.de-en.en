John Kerry declared in an unprecedented admission that US spying was "inappropriate gone too far"
John Kerry indicated with an unexpected admission softening the defensive attitude of the US in terms of its surveillance programs, he said that the espionage was "inappropriate gone too far in some cases."
The foreign minister also admitted that he bore responsibility for the fact that we have on "autopilot" with Barack Obama, as the explosive revelations of the whistleblower, but Edward Snowden about the NSA spying activities were publicly.
The leaked information is the U.S. government from its allies in a diplomatic uproar.
In a speech transmitted by video link on the Open Government conference in London, Kerry said: "there is no question, the President and I and others in the government of some of the things that happened almost by autopilot, simply because the ability to do so, even in the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and, of course, goes back to 9/11."
Then he confessed to the first high-ranking member of the US government that the US spying have crossed a line, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said: "in some cases, it is unreasonable to have gone too far."
The President is determined to create clarity and, therefore, a thorough investigation so that no one should feel that the abuse.
I can assure you that the rights of innocent people in this process will not be affected.
Kerry, however, insisted that the NSA was a force for good and saved many lives through its surveillance operations.
He added: "we are dealing with a new world in which people are willing to blow up."
There is a radical extremism in the world, the intent is to kill people to attack to blow up and governments.
So what if they would be able to intercept and stop it before it happens?
We have actually plane crashes, attacks on buildings and the murder of people, because we have learned in advance of such plans.
Meanwhile, US lawmakers to travel to Europe, in order to dispel the doubts about the alleged American espionage and to convince Europeans of the need for the anti-terror efforts continue to cooperate with the US, as the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, said that he had spoken this week with representatives of the European Parliament and other people and be concerned about their threats to participate because of frustration with the monitoring by the National Security Agency to anti-terrorist organisations.
"It is very important for the national security interests of the United States that the Europeans in terms of our joint efforts against terrorism remain on board," said Murphy, who is the first time in the Senate, as a democrat and as chairman of the Senate Subcommittee for external relations and European affairs, in an interview in Washington.
Moreover, I am going to Europe, in order to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their anger about the NSA programs.
Media reports that the NSA collected millions of phone data in Europe, have strained relations with some US allies, although the head of the secret service announced this week that the reports were untrue and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and with the United States.
Other revelations from cited passed on documents from Snowden that the NSA monitored phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel and 34 other state leaders around the world.
The director of national intelligence, James Clapper, defended the spying on allies as necessary and said that this was normal on both sides.
In all the tumult, said Murphy, his authority is preparing a tour of the Congress, which is due to take place this year, and hoped that the delegation will include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other Members are to be published in the coming days.
He said the exact itinerary will be worked out.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip is the improvement of relations, he also said that there would be some "serious words."
He said that the European governments should their people to be honest about the type of spying programs that they themselves for years.
"We can change our surveillance programmes and better protect the rights of Europeans, but they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones to spy," says Murphy.
Meanwhile, stands for John Kerry over the weekend, a trip to the Middle East and to Poland, to deal with the resentment over the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as the US surveillance activities.
