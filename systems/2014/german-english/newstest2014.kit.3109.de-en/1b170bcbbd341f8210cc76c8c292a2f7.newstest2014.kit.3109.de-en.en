Instead of learning unemployed: pilot project for the unskilled in tourism
The "Mecklenburgischen Seenplatte" today is the start of a pilot project for the tourism sector.
Under the leadership of the Federal Employment Agency to 49 men and women who work in the industry as unskilled, across three winter professionals qualified for hotels and restaurants.
"What is new is that the six-month courses with qualifications," said Carmen Wiechert of Neubrandenburg labor agency.
The benefit is varied: the participants were not unemployed, the companies would have trained professionals who are increasingly missing in hotels and restaurants, and the agency should not finance unemployment.
The project is also the Industry and Trade Chamber in Neubrandenburg, as well as the German hotel and restaurant association (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
