Driver, who was building with 210 km/h, and hot drinks between the legs, a £ 1000 fine
A car driver was imposed a fine of £ 1000, because he was between his legs with up to 210 km/h and a hot drink.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on May 27, with his Mercedes-Benz on the A120 in Braintree.
After the police had stopped, they discovered the drinks cup between his legs.
Before the District Court Colchester Howie pled guilty, without the necessary care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month ban.
Howie was also sentenced to pay costs of £ 90 and a victim surcharge of £ 100.
