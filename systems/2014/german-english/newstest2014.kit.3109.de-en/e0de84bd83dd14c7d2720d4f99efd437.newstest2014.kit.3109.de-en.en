NSA declared that an "internal error" and not hackers are to blame for the crash of the website
The shadow National Security Agency said late on Friday, a mistake have crippled its public website a few hours and not hackers, as has been claimed.
"NSA.gov was tonight some unavailable for hours, because an internal error occurred during a planned updates", explained the spy agency in a message sent by e-mail.
The problem will be fixed on this evening.
The claim that the outage was caused by a carried out distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack that was not true.
In the early evening hours online server sites had noticed that the NSA's website for at least six hours, was not available and will continue to for some users.
Previously, a spokesman for the NSA told ABC News, the sensitive internal network of the authority was "in no way compromised."
Secret information were not in danger, according to the spokesman.
At least one group of hacktivism took claims the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target site with pages flooded until the servers are overloaded and the website collapses.
The cyber tactic is relatively simple and attacks do not serve to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
In the past was super-secret NSA, whose nickname was once No search Agency (No such authority) is now in the bright light of the public and, after the sharp criticism in recent months reported revelations about their extensive surveillance program at home and abroad â€“ a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by the disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy over the secret service modifying initial speculation about today's incident was the result of a targeted Cyperoperation.
