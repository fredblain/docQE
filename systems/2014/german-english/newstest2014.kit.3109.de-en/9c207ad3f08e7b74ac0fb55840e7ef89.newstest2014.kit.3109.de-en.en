Jumbo manufacturers argue about seat width in the face of large orders
Between leading aircraft manufacturers, it is a debate about the width of seats in economy class on long-haul flights, which set the tone for a bitter clash at the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute revolves around the seat width, passengers on long flights in economy class is not always the most airlines, but the designated area is the key to the effectiveness of claims in the latest aircraft from Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for an industry standard, which requires a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in economy class, but the US archrival Boeing says that this should be decided by the airlines.
The controversy comes at a time when the aircraft are competing to sell even more versions of its twin-engine long-range aircraft, and at the event from 17 to 21 November expect record orders.
As the rear of the aircraft, in particular whether there are rows of nine or ten seats, is crucial to the specified economic results, which is to deliver the new "mini-jumbo" design.
Boeing claims its modernized "777X" take 406 people in seats in economy class, which are about 17 inches wide and ten per line.
Airbus said that the competing version of the A350 carrying 350 people in 18-inch wide seats in economy class, there are nine per line.
Share aircraft giants often blows over technical details through advertisements in the press.
Now Airbus appealed before the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X with over 100 orders is expected to make the race, directly to the public.
Recently, the company has an ad that could be the start of a new ad war and donors showed a picture, in which three people squeezed in a restaurant, and the title: "would you accept that?"
"Boeing long-haul flights in seats that are more than regional turbo-prop aircraft," said Airbus sales chief John Leahy.
In light of changed eating habits are thicker, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747, the modern long-distance travel, and the end of the century, has increased the weight of the male average American between 40 and 49 years by 10%, the data from the US Department of Health.
The Taillenumfang male average American is in the 21 century, according to US health statistics 100.8 cm.
Airbus says that his rival is a seat concept from the 1950s, when the average body size of the newly christened "jet Set" was narrow.
It was, Airbus, conducted research that showed that an extra inch (2.54 cm) per seat raises the sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing has disputed the figures from Airbus to the seat and says it is not to decide at the discretion of the manufacturer, as airlines make the balance between air fares and furnishings.
The company also said, according to research the experience in the aircraft from more than the seat width.
"It really boils down to give airlines flexibility, so that they can do what they think they need to be successful," explains the Flugkabinenexperte Kent Craven of Boeing.
They do not want us to dictate to them, which makes them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, there is more freedom of elbows, but for manufacturers, it is increasingly an issue that can affect sales.
Behind the dispute is a race for plane orders with an estimated volume of at least $700 billion at list prices in the coming decades, which could have a substantial impact on the export performance of the US or Europe.
As Reuters reported for the first time in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the debate about the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficient per seat than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seater Boeing 77-300ER in their latest twin-engine long-haul designs.
Boeing's statements on the results partly depend on the 777X with its ten seats per row is compared with the original design of the nine seats in the 777.
The increased costs per unit are still lower than currently used machines with ten seats per row.
"Boeing therefore squeezes more seats on his plane to make it more competitive for our products," says Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort in the European Airbus.
On the other hand, say analysts, full cabins with ten seats per row with existing 777 indicated that many passengers opted for closer alignment, which could go hand in hand with cheaper air fares.
"Eighteen inches wide seat would be great for the passengers, but the reality is that from an economic face from the Airbus is controlled by the threat of the 777," says Mary Kirby, an expert on cabin furnishing, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing offer no seats, but a catalogue of suppliers, from which the airlines.
The world travelers jet sellers even tape measure, the establishment of gherkins in the competition.
Even if they offer comfort to all manufacturers also jets with highly condensed form for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers a A350 with zehnsitzigen ranks, but has not yet been sold, according to its own statement.
Until recently, Airbus has stressed the importance of more customization of the cabin and offered for some jets wide seats in the corridors.
Without the support of the only other major manufacturer of modern jets, experts say that the call for a new industry standard will probably fizzle, but it could distract from the wave of 777X-sales.
