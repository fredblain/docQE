Parents of inter-sex children can choose "sex" undetermined
Germany is the first European nation, in which a third sex is recognised for children who were born with ambiguous genitalia.
Newborn will no longer rigidly assigned male or female.
Under the new law, parents do not have more sex for such children, but can "undecided" or "not" on the birth certificate.
The law aims to take the pressure from parents, so they have to make any hasty decisions regarding operations for a gender-assignment in newborns, and to combat discrimination against inter-sexual people.
A sexual person said, according to BBC years later: "I am neither man nor woman."
I remain a patchwork quilt, which was created by doctors, mutilated and full of scars.
Estimated is one of 2000 children each year, either as a boy or a girl.
They belong to the sexual, a group that fall under the diagnosis "Sexualdifferenzierungsstörung" (DSD), an umbrella term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testicles) or unusually developed genitals.
Wallis Simpson was perhaps more sexually.
Understanding the gender identification is still not very well, but most experts in the U.S., you should use the best available information on the gender assignment, if a provision is not possible, and not wait for the psychological and physical development of the child, before you decide, if any, for an operation.
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the issue of gender identification, said that the new German law "sound" for a good cause.
Sexual interaction children an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgical intervention, but that does not apply to most children," he said.
It could be a gender assignment without surgery and then wait to see how the developing identity.
The scientific data on how a child develops its gender identity, are not very accurate.
No one knows why it happens.
It is like the mystery of why people are gay.
In a report to the European Commission in 2011, it says, sexual people are defined by Trans sexual or trans-gender people, because their status is not gender-related, but by their biological constitution, neither exclusively male or female, it is typically both at the same time, or not clear as one of them.
These characteristics were bailed in sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, primary sexual characteristics such as reproduction organs and genitals or chromosome structure and hormones.
The report also gives an overview of the discrimination that inter-sexual and trans-gender people in professional life and about the extent of harassment, violence and crime prejudice.
Not consistent with the image of gender boys now have a special camp.
In the meantime, it is possible in Australia and Nepal for adults, male or female "third sex on official documents."
In June, Australians Norris May-Welby (52) as the world's first "sex" person, after a court had granted the life-long maintenance of a "not" gender status.
German identity cards, in addition to M and W, in future, a third allocation, X for sexually, the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France gender issues are still controversial, as a news story on France 24.
In 2011, signed dozens of French members of the country's strict Catholic a petition that the ' gender ' theory should be removed from school textbooks.
The US website Catholic Online has also spoke out against the German law on the grounds that "if the world is being dragged into a new state, where the sex is a decision, but not sexual activity, then we twist another two pillars of civilization."
The mother of a newborn in Maryland told baby zone, it would be better if babies at birth is assigned a gender.
"The parents ' existence is stressful enough without further restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of your child," she said of the parents ' website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, were children who were born with both male and female parts, called a hermaphrodite after the attractive Greek god who had both sexes.
Ten years ago, the medicine regarded sex as something that can be erased and then rebuild.
But in the meantime, questioned the ethical foundations of an operation now know how complex is the gender identity, and that doctors can be wrong, because they do not know how the child at the turn of the sex of their allocation.
" The middle of the 20th century, we called this a " psychiatric emergency ', " said Drescher.
If such a child was born, then called the psychiatrist, but the surgeons.
The prevailing theory about the treatment of children with ambiguous genitalia goes back to Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who took the view that sex is malleable.
He coined the term "gender identity" and argued that social and environmental initiatives, such as the parents of a child-rearing – beings interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and coined as to whether a person is a male or female.
But in a known under the title "John/Joan" case from 1966 his theories have been controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis was severed in a botched circumcision, castrated the child and to remove his testicles and then bring up as a girl.
"Money presented this case as a successful example of a conversion, but he did not," says Drescher.
When the boy was about 15, he moved back to the male sex and married to a woman.
With 38 but he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who practice this model.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, the survivors of this sex operations to the public, who are not happy with the result. "
For example, Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes, but ambiguous genitals.
The doctors were not clear about whether he had a large clitoris, or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a satisfying life " as a man.
So external body and testicles shortly after birth were surgically removed in 1976, and he was brought up as a girl.
He received female hormones at the age of 12.
"I knew that I am not a girl," he told ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he should Vaginalplastik.
But, because he was depressed and knew that something was wrong, he asked for his medical records.
What he found was shocking.
I was at my birth – and no one has ever said.
Bruce was born with a DSD, the body does not produce enough testosterone to the development of the genitals.
After he had learned the truth, he moved back to the male identity, received testosterone injections and had to remove his breasts.
The operation has become infertile.
Today he is fighting for others in an organisation called Interface Project for more sexual people are perceived as normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, leader of the law in California-based group Advocates for Informed Choice, worries that the German law could encourage "for stamping and stigma."
"Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and to give the child a ' not '," she explained.
We are afraid that favours intervention.
We think it would be better to wait for the male or female sex and then.
But we still do not know how the law will have an impact, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supported the Australian law because "it allows adults recognition as a third sex."
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex," she said.
The German law is about the allocation of childbirth.
This is not a fight, which should be small children at this time.
When they grow up, they can decide on their bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Brustradiologin from Pitts Burg, who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and hundreds of others in a self-help group, says that the German law "authorize" both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete Androgenresistenz.
Because of the Rezeptordefektes target cells for testosterone Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but not a uterus and no ovaries.
Today, Katie 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as a co-worker in the child psychiatry.
She is infertile, but hopes to get a child through adoption or a surrogate mother.
"The law gives parents room, so they do not have to make decisions in haste," said Baratz.
It gives them the time to make various tests and to clarify things and gives them time before they write "male" or "female".
In this way, everything is in order, the child is large and loves it.
It has a wonderful baby and the parents of happiness.
And we should not rush to make an operation that will not undo.
"This includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that reconciles the parents, because they believe that they would not do the right thing," she explained.
Ultimately, the child decides on the sex, which is more suited to him – and it is wonderful.
Children will be able to make the decision.
