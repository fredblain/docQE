New anti-nicotine vaccine could make the pleasure of smoking warfare
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice a lifetime of nicotine addiction.
Before tests on humans will be needed before tests, which can take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, said the first results are good.
"We are very hopeful that this kind of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried and tried to stop all methods available on the market, but saw that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches," said Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been changed so that it contains the genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus infected selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies to the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, which is a smoker no nicotine.
In experiments vaccinated mice that nicotine was administered retained their normal level of activity.
Mice without vaccination against a "break" would have taken, the researchers said, a sign that the nicotine have achieved their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science in translational medicine.
Former tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The vaccines had to be given to maintain the Antik√∂rperpegels so often that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine are likely to be significantly lower, because it transforms liver cells in antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, could be a future vaccine for people, if he is sure to be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, and thus prevent nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely that smokers would use him to stop.
"They know that if they begin to smoke, they feel because of the nicotine vaccine is no more, and that helps them to give up the habit," he explained.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that it is still a need for further research.
