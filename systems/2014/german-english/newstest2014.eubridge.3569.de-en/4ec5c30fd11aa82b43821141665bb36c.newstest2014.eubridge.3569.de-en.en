Profits at Bombardier to decline in supply figures and contracts
The Canadian aerospace and rail manufacturer Bombardier Inc on Thursday reported a 15% drop in net profit, after he was caught by declining orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and contract problems in the rail sector under pressure.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, a flight test data for his brand-new CSeries aircraft and gave no new information on whether the plane could go under the ambitious timetable next September in commercial use.
On the maiden flight test aircraft followed one and a half months, so far, only three more starts, which the question of whether the testing phase is proceeding as planned.
The results were back behind the forecasts and led to a drop of more than eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, on Thursday lowered its rating of "outperform" from "sector perform" in view of the fact that the stock in the next one to two quarters of a limited course potential.
"Although weaker delivery figures were expected to aircraft, but the margins of development in the transport sector, we are clearly disappointed," Doerksen said in a client.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries, if the test program is progressing on the plane.
If, however, no new orders will be announced in the coming months, we expect that the market is more skeptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the aircraft series of CSeries can catapult the company into the market segment that is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test plane was presented to the public in March, after months of delays and flew for the first time in September.
But so far are binding orders for the CSeries with 177 moderate, as potential buyers want to wait and see the results of the flight tests whether the claims of the company in terms of fuel efficiency and cost-saving potential of the new commercial jet aircraft.
Currently, there are a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
CEO Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will achieve its goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the jets.
The company said on Thursday with analysts and media in addition, the program is in the schedule.
"The test aircraft is no longer than expected, on the ground," said Beaudoin during a telephone conference and added that during the lifetime of the aircraft were ground tests and software updates.
Each manufacturer is planning.
We have decided to take a first flight and then add a review period, what we have done.
This is happening throughout the flight programme.
The second of five test planes will probably start in the next few weeks, the remaining shortly afterwards, it said.
However, analysts remain sceptical as to whether 12 months after the maiden flight of the first customer can take a CSeries aircraft in operation.
Bombardier said it checked the planning for the commissioning (EIS) and will update this in the next few months.
"The slow progress of the flight test - even if they are obviously Bombardiers internal planning - reinforces our view that the commissioning of the first quarter of 2015," Doerksen said.
In the third quarter with the end on 30 September Bombardiers net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share of $172 million, or 9 cents per share a year earlier.
The adjusted earnings per share is unchanged 9 cents.
Sales slipped slightly, and fell from 4.2 to 4.1 billion dollars.
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and sales of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.
The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer indicates that he had delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter, a decrease of 57 last year.
Net orders fell from 83 to 26.
The order book in the aerospace division amounted to 32.9 billion dollars on 30 September, and was unchanged compared with December 31.
"In the field of aerospace, the results were in the framework of our targets, but the low order intake and the overall market conditions were disappointing," said Beaudoin.
Sales in the aerospace division fell by 13 percent to two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, announced that sales in this area has increased by nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The order book in the transport sector, on September 30, $32.6 billion dollars and was slightly increased to 31 December.
The profit margin in the field of transport has been hampered by handling problems in some big contracts.
According to corporate governance, there will be new requirements for the fourth quarter.
