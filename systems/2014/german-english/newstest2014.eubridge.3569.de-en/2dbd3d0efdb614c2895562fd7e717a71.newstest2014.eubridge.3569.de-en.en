Gutach: More safety for pedestrians
They are not 100 metres apart: on Tuesday, the new B 33-pedestrian traffic on the village park in Gutach commissioned - within sight of the old town hall.
Two plants so close together: Intention or folly?
This question is answered Gutachs mayor yesterday.
"The town hall lights have been installed at the time, because the school," said Eckert yesterday.
The Kluser-lights safe both cyclists and and.
The official yesterday officially in operation is important for the crossing area Sulzbachweg / Kirch street.
We have the museum, two churches, park, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank, and the traffic flow from the residential area.
"The high volume of traffic and pedestrians had another traffic lights to their safety," said Eckert.
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold of Offenburg decisions.
"According to the latest measurements on the B 33 approximately 12000 vehicles a day, the municipality of Gutach, about ten percent are heavy traffic," said Arnold.
Therefore, the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary: "Security is simple," says Arnold.
A total of four road shows had been carried out, including a roundabout was considered, but discarded because of the narrowness of the Kreuzungs area Sulzbachweg / Kirch street.
It was tested everything according to Arnold in the choice of the traffic light poles, "an extra for us with extra-long trunks loaded trucks, we have ausgestestet whether these vehicles from the Sulzbachweg onto B 33, without the traffic light poles umzuknicken."
The traffic light system itself is the most modern, which is currently on the market, "explained Arnold.
The plant is equipped with coloured LEDs that shine so strongly that the lights of drivers, for example, are in the sun.
And it is economical: The older lighting systems consume about 100 watts, the new just eight watts.
In each direction, there are three light installations.
Arnold said the technique of the new plant: This is equipped with two radar sensors.
The pedestrian is the traffic light button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation.
The road is free, comes directly green for pedestrians, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be stopped for pedestrians.
"If a group or disabled people on the street, the green phase, everyone has a safe on the road," said Arnold.
Of course, the driver must think here as a partner and watch the road.
This was not the case yesterday: Hardly showed the green light for pedestrians, a luxury car - in bright red.
