ESA decides on large space missions: Missions for billions
Distant planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that they want to start in the next few years.
30 proposals were available, five are still in the race.
Distant worlds.
More than 1000 planets around other stars, astronomers have already found.
Whether there is at least some of them, no one knows.
The selection is difficult: One is to look for gravitational waves?
Or prefer to explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or searching for Earth-like planets and perhaps discovering alien life?
These questions are the leaders of the European Space Agency ESA.
For its program "Cosmic Vision" they are looking for ideas for two major space projects to advance the research.
The budget for such missions "l" is about a billion euros.
The launch is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, met in Paris, the elite of European space research, to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas were discussed, five of which are now in the final round.
Many bodies examine the proposals, according to the researchers.
In the next few days, a final decision by the scientific program committee.
A total of four major issues has chosen the Esa, to which the missions of the 2007 programme initiated "cosmic vision" to find answers.
What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life?
The exact processes for the formation of stars from large clouds - and thus the formation of planets that orbit stars - they are still in the proverbial dark.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has a planet, under what circumstances can arise?
In order to investigate this issue will start in 2017, the space telescope "," with the 500 already known planetary systems in our neighbourhood.
The possibilities are limited, however, is a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million.
With larger instruments astronomers erdähnliche planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres and search for "biomarkers": Gases, which are seen as an indicator for biological activity.
How does the solar system?
Ultimately, this question is to say what conditions for the emergence of life.
Plays an important role in the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field and the particle radiation emanating from the system.
In our solar system, these processes can.
With the "solar Orbiter" Esa already has a mission of the M-class (the budget is around half a billion euros) for this question.
The probe will start in 2017 and observe surface and activity of the sun.
Of great interest to the researchers are also Jupiter and its moons.
You want to find out what role the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system.
The Esa sees the first of the three L-missions of the "Cosmic Vision" programme.
The probe "juice" (Jupiter Icy moons Explorer) begins its journey to 2022.
Eight years later they reached Jupiter and the atmosphere of the planet and the icy moons Europa, Ganymede and.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The space offers many opportunities to study the matter under extreme conditions and to investigate whether the known laws of nature are still valid.
Maybe there are deviations, the physicists could point the way to a new theory that all known laws of nature.
How the universe was created and what is it?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos was created by the Big Bang.
In addition to the usual from the stars, planets and life as we are, there is dark matter, whose gravity holds galaxies and clusters of galaxies, and dark energy, which is the expansion of the.
So far, the researchers do not know what physical laws of physics in the first of the Big Bang 'split second were valid, is dark matter and dark energy.
"Euclid" the Esa has already been approved by a mission, whose launch is scheduled for 2020.
With a special telescope to probe the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the whole sky, and thus allow conclusions on the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could make the race
Of the 30 proposals will remain at the end of the selection process only two.
The best chances of approval as a mission, according to many experts "E-Lisa," a sophisticated concept for the detection of gravitational waves.
Among physicists understand changes in the structure of space-time that Albert Einstein had predicted almost 100 years ago.
They were not detected.
Elisa could create the, the scientists hope behind the project.
The mission provides two or three probes existing detector, which is stationed in space.
He could, in contrast to plants on Earth's gravitational waves, which are in the Big Bang, and thus provide new insights into the origins of the cosmos.
Four other proposals are competing for the second L-mission: A large X-ray telescope called "Athena," which, among other things, is to explore black holes, "icy planets," another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism," a mission to survey the cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder" to detect and investigate the erdähnliche planet.
Already retired include proposals on the sample-return transport from Mars, the exploration of the moon, Venus and asteroids and, as well as to the solar physics.
