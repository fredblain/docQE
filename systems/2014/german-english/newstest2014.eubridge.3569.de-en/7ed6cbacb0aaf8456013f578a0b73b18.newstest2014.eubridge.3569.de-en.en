The painted fence on the Bechtle-plot
A group of the citizens' initiative "Swiss meadow" has embellished the fence on the promenade in Bad balconies.
They also looted and broadened the footpath, it says in a press release.
The planned covering the decaying house at the rear of the property was not allowed for security reasons, because the terrain.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, had denied the window-dressing with his colleague Reinhard Domke of the BI.
Before the action of the BI was a banner with the message "we are in favour of it."
The administrator's approximately 20 members of the citizens' initiative, however, little in their action.
Their motto was on the big poster "we are against Bauruinen."
They wanted to draw attention to the danger of even greater ruins on the Swiss meadow - the giant project should fail one day.
In conversation with many passers-by before the "construction site," it was clear that some people believe that it will go with the completion of the project in the city of many better, although a few have the same questions to the dimension of the project was presented as the BI.
But they are beginning to resign, because the city is delaying these answers, the BI.
As we heard, the public statements made by the mayor.
In May, said the City Council meeting that he feared the end for the thermal baths, the population should vote in the citizens against the plans for a spa and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow.
Some appear so downright scared, others see it as a "crude blackmail attempt" to the population, according to the press release of the BI.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all volunteers.
