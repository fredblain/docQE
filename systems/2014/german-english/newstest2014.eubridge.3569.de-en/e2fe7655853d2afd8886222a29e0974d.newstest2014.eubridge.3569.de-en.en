Children should be myths and legends as "role models for life," says the author.
The stories of Thor showed that "brutal force has no chance against clever tricks," and the Arthur legend demonstrate how important it is to have a dream.
However, many of the myths are "far too wild, too offensive and, in some cases, too dirty to be taught in schools,", which is why Crossley-Holland for a "careful selection" age just works.
"I think it is wonderful that myths and folklore in America are already part of education," he said.
I have already proposed a plan for twenty years.
He added that authors and teachers who were "overly didactic," children "shut down completely," because in entertaining stories, the "subliminal messages."
Crossley-Holland, Beowulf translated from the Anglo-Saxon and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, said: "You can pursue certain intentions, but we should keep them in the background."
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author who writes for adults, and an author who writes for children, is the need to give hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or lead to a happy ending, but there is an inherent sense of good and evil.
This must be presented subliminally, be revealed by the history and not explained.
This is the old story of showing rather than telling.
