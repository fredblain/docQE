Security concerns in Mozambique grow in the face of clashes between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered in the centre Maputos under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder and first president of Mozambique, in a rare public demonstration of peace.
"We want peace, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, managing director of an investment company.
Out of fear for the future of the country, their business attire for a T-shirt with the inscription "We want security" in Portuguese and joined the crowd on the Independence Square in the capital on Thursday.
For two weeks, there are almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, which are among the worst battles since the peace agreement, more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, which was initially supported by the white-ruled Rhodesia and later the apartheid government of South Africa in a bid to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the peace treaty of 1992, she became an opposition party.
Analysts consider it unlikely that zurueckfalle the country back into a full-scale conflict, but recent events have alarmed foreign investors and locals.
For the fast-growing economy is a lot at stake, because the discovery of huge gas reserves off the coast and coal camps in the northwest could in the next few years investments of more than $50 billion from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the United States.
The ruling FRELIMO Party, the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo are blaming each other for the tensions.
RENAMO claimed that the government had provoked the recent clashes, it could have on October 17, its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold Renamos attacked.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated, when government troops attacked bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the group, said Renamos spokesman told the Financial Times.
The government is Renamo the blame for the clashes and accused the organization to have attacked soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to downplay concerns about instability.
He told AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama regard themselves as "losers" who "wants to use all its remaining forces to prove that the government can impose its decisions."
Both FRELIMO and Renamo stress that they want to avoid a war.
But the concerns have grown since Mazanga was quoted as saying that Renamo was the 1992 peace agreement in.
He told the FT, he said that he had meant that FRELIMO no longer respect the agreement.
"Our vision is to resume negotiations and seriously," said Mazanga.
Previous talks between the parties have contributed little to resolving the tensions that have been fueled by a series of clashes this year.
"We have two adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who heads collide," says Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique expert.
None of them is good in bargaining and no one is willing to make the necessary concessions.
RENAMO, which is pressing for electoral reforms, has already declared that it will boycott the local elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt to ailing movement, concessions and financial incentives from the government.
Renamos electoral success since 1992, while a new party, headed by a former Renamo member Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM), is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claimed that Guebuza, whose resignation comes when his second term ends next year, wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He does not want a multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace, because he does not want to give up the presidency," said.
It is unclear what capacity Renamo, but it has made disruptive attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south routes.
Most of the fighting took place in the province of Sofala, which is located a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, Beira, but the port, mining companies like Rio Tinto and Vale for the export of coal.
In June, Rio interrupted a month for the use of the railways, after Renamo had announced an attack on the track.
Mazanga responded cautiously to the question of whether Renamo will repeat that threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique," said Mazanga.
The instability has increased the frustration with the government, says Fernando Lima, Head of Media Coop, an independent media company, because many people already worried about the corruption, the slow progress in development and a recent kidnapping wave of abduction.
"People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and he should be the one to find solutions to the problems," he says.
Omar sultans, a demonstrator, said that people simply wanted stability.
"Not FRELIMO and Renamo, they just want to restore peace and usable roads," he said.
