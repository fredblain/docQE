With future prospects
Actually, Waltraud Ries lives.
Their house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with greenery, an old trees, nice neighbors and not too much traffic.
In the city, there are only a few minutes by public transport.
"I hope that you have no fear of spiders?" Asks Waltraud Ries, and shows a big spider on the door frame.
I am looking for a new home for my husband and me for some time now,.
But you know how difficult it is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not a spider phobia, but the concern, at the age of the many steps to the house and no longer in the apartment, she says.
Moreover, since a meniscus tears operation, the Mittfünfzigerin experienced what it means to move with a handicap from floor to floor.
Recently published a book of her on 'living in old age - What home form is the best for me?'. "
"Our apartment is the best example of what is not in old age," she begins to tell.
When they moved more than 20 years ago with her husband in the duplex apartment, it was just a beautiful apartment.
in his mid-fifties Waltraud Ries.
They also know that it is one of the few people who actually deal with the issue of 'living in old age.
Most of it, as long as possible.
They are, 'she says humorous.
Only when the suffering is really great, you think.
Then it may be too late, "said Ries.
In her book, the interior designer 17 residential models for a self-determined living in old age.
"What chooses living form, however, is always an individual decision," she explained.
D i e solution, it is not for the ages.
Even those who can afford the residency in Tuscany or Brittany, should always consider that he could also be ill.
And: "Without a good knowledge of the language vereinsame in Dolce Vita," the book author Aussiedlungs willing to consider.
Among their models are classic models of care, alternative forms of housing, or the oft-quoted pensioners - WG.
At the age, everyone has his tics and quirks
"For me it would be a residential community, but nothing," she says with a wink.
Certainly not as a student house with a shared bathroom and kitchen.
"In the age you need his retreat," Ries.
A senior living community can still work, the author does not want to.
It must then differently than in the classic students WG.
And sometimes you just want to his rest, "she believes.
With this view, at least, it is not alone in the capital.
"The majority of old people in Stuttgart want to stay as long as it is in their own home, is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of the civil service life at the age of the country's capital.
The department advises people around the theme 'ageing'.
That is why older people would often just inconvenience and restrictions, only to be able to remain in that environment, it is the experience of the Stiftung Warentest.
Today, there are many ways to make the house or apartment barrier-free.
Ries recommends all dealing with the age of their house or apartment to check, and not just the best craftsmen.
Today, there is also the age just reconstruction specialists.
Even in the apartment for one or the other, and if it is only the toilet seat increase, clarifies the interior designer.
But it is not always the existing apartment age and thus accessible, even if it is still so beautiful.
This experience has had to make Waltraud Ries.
While you could install a stair lift inside the apartment, but the road paved with stairs to the, would be a far greater obstacle.
It will continue to search until it has found the ideal property for herself and her husband.
Before the move dread it more than before the spider on their front door.
