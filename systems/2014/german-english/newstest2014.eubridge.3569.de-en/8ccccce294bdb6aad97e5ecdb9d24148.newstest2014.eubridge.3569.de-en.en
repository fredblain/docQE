Hearing before the Royal Commission, charged with two YMCA staff before accusations against Jonathan Lord accused of sex offences
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) had been accused of sexual offences in connection with children before 2011 accusations against child carers Jonathan Lord from Caringbah, such as the Royal Commission for sexual abuse of children.
But the opening statement before the Commission had declared the YMCA, "in the organization never had to do with an incident of sexual child abuse."
Managing director Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which a YMCA employee for offences had been charged with child pornography, and another in which a sports teacher of the YMCA Caringbah Hall in 1991 because of the abuse of children entrusted to him had been convicted.
Hare said Gail Furness, one of the Commission assistierenden lawyer that he had known of the first case, but the second was not known.
He acknowledged that the YMCA opening statement to the Commission was also vague on the assertion that "there was external reviews of the YMCA, in which the YMCA was recognised as at the forefront of child safety."
Evidence before the Commission show that the YMCA was informed that he is the second-lowest rating of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities (Department of Education) has received in August of this year.
Hare, who started with 21 at the YMCA, admitted that the management "from me downwards" in the recruitment of Lord and to ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report violations of the directives on child safety.
Lord was sentenced earlier this year for sexual offences in twelve boys during his two years of work for the YMCA at the beginning of the.
He was sentenced to a minimum of six years in prison.
Hare denied, however, that the YMCA had a cultural problem that employees have to report violations in relation to the Lords regarding the safety of children.
The employees said that they had observed violations, among other things, that Lord was alone with children, she worked as a babysitter, they sit on his lap, said that he had loved it, and children play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose leader was Lord, who had asked for a training course on child protection, because she was concerned about his behavior, said that the Kinderdienstleiterin Jacqui Barnat, who was at the YMCA Caringbah the supervisors Lords daunting, "and most of the time was very remote."
The CEO said that he would not accept statements from employees that they would not have dared to report to their superiors.
Instead, he said, have affected their friendship with Lord their judgment, which is why they had not reported it.
Hare said that he had informed the board of the YMCA NSW his view that the lesson that the organisation from the Jonathan Lord incident ", not" affects reporting "by staff, and the board voted to approve him.
Hare said that the decision to push the employees to sign confidentiality obligations shortly after the accusations, the managing director of children's services of the YMCA, Liam Whitley.
He said that the contamination of the evidence should be prevented, but it was "overzealous" and poorly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was at a time when Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011, no safe for children, said Professor Stephen Small Bone of Griffith University, an expert on child sexual abuse, of the Commission.
He explained that it had been "serious problems" in the recruitment, screening, training, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing was postponed until 20 December.
