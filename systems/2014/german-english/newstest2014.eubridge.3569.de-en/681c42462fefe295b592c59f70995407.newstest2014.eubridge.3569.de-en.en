Rangnick States-bashing for Schiris: no swallows King
Ralf Rangnick is satisfied with the current high form of Bundesliga leaders Red Bull Salzburg, disappointed with the sporting director of the "bulls" by the umpires.
"There is currently a dangerous tendency that Mane and Alan are pushed into the category of swallows kings," he took the two Offensivwirbler on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg.
for Rangnicks criticism was yellow for at 3-0 against Grödig last Sunday, in which the Senegalese was an alleged acting fatal - which was not, however, as the TV pictures showed.
"A gross error," said Rangnick, the referee Harkam described as "completely overwhelmed."
Harkam would also have "its part" to the escalation between Salzburg coach Roger Schmidt and Groedig coach Adi Hütter after the game.
He defended his German compatriot: "I would do the same in every single situation as Roger Schmidt."
Schmidt wants after skirmishes with Hütter have had no contact with his colleagues.
I do not know why.
"Because I am the one who has been insulted," said the 46-year-old.
Given the success.
"There are only two words: well," he stated.
There is not much.
Above all, the way the team plays, is impressive.
This should continue.
There will be little squad changes in the winter transfer period.
There is no great reason to make a difference.
"Except for a player with the desire that he wants to leave the club," said Rangnick.
