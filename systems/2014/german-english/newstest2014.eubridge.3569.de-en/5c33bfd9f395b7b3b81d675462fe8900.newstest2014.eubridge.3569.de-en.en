Scientists were able to throw more light on the context in which the of a dog with his mood.
Previous research had shown that lucky dogs with the tail stretched more to the right (from the perspective of the dog), while it was the left side in nervous dogs.
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive these subtle differences and respond to it.
Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: "In humans is well known that the left and right brain hemisphere react differently to stimuli, positive or negative emotions."
Here, we have tried to look at this in other species.
He also noted that in dogs as in humans, the right brain hemisphere for the movement of the left side is responsible and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings.
To learn more about how dogs on the side of their, the researchers monitored the animals, while saw these films of other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of four-legged and analyzed the behavior.
We will soon understand why the tail in the first, in the other direction
Professor Vallortigara said: "We have shown the dogs films with dogs - either a lifelike version or a silhouette to eliminate ablenkende other aspects, and we were able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or right."
If the animals looked like an otherwise ausdrucksloser dog has moved the tail to the right (seen from the perspective of the wedelnden dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But it was the tail to the left (again from the perspective of the dog wag), their increased heart rate and they looked restless.
According to Professor Vallortigara the dogs do not communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he is convinced that the dogs would have learned from experience that movements they should worry or not.
He said: "If you have several encounters with other dogs and a swish with the tail in one direction is associated with friendly behavior and the right side, a less friendly behavior, then you respond on the basis of this experience."
The researchers say that the findings of dog owners, veterinarians and trainers could lead to a better understanding of the emotions of their animal.
John Bradshaw, an expert on dog behavior and Visiting Fellow at the Faculty of veterinary medicine at the University of Bristol, this was not the first study to examine whether left and right is important for dogs.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn your head to the left, if they see an aggressive dog, and to the right, if it is a happy dog.
In another research at the University of Victoria in Canada: "Dogs are more likely to go to a robot dog, if his tail wag on the left and the right not to be restless, rather than the other way around, as in the Italian study."
According to his testimony, the differences could stir, therefore, that the dogs in the various studies the animals in the movies or the robot dogs not interpreted as dogs.
A study of how dogs respond to real dogs, could help, he said.
"Although there is considerable evidence of many different mammals that both halves of the brain are used for different purposes, but many of the details still need to be determined, and dogs are no exception," said Bradshaw.
Since their behavior record, but simply put, it will probably not be long before we understand why the tail sometimes moves in one, sometimes in the opposite direction.
