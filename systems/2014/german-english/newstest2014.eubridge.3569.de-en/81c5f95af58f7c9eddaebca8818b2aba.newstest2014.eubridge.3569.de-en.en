RBS suspended two currency traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from their foreign exchange department, two people who are familiar with the situation; this is another indication that the global regulatory investigation into the alleged manipulation in the currency market sharply.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they are cooperating with the authorities in the investigation into the world's largest financial market, the $5.3 trillion to the owner.
The two dealers would be the first RBS staff who have been suspended in the widening investigation of the scandal surrounding the Libor interbank business.
The bank made no comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from authorities.
"Our investigations are continuing on this issue and we are cooperating fully with the FCA and other regulatory authorities," said the bank two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to the situation said that the RBS the records of e-mails and instant messages, and were sent to a former trader at the British regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, have passed.
The trader, Richard Usher, had left the RBS in 2010 and is now leave from his current position as a European head of forex spot trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of the European spot trading at Citi, was this week and Matt Gardiner, formerly a senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week at Standard Chartered.
None of these traders has been accused of any wrongdoing.
The instant message group of Usher were bankers at Barclays and Citigroup, said people close to the situation.
UBS announced this week that it had taken steps against some of their employees, after the Swiss regulator Finma had declared that they will examine the alleged manipulation of the foreign exchange market in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities around the world - the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - currently dealing with allegations that bankers should have denied transactions in the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or receive information requests from authorities, said people familiar with the situation.
Banks comb instant messages and e-mails from several years in search of cases of misconduct.
The news of these investigations, the dealers in a field, which is one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks in recent years, but this year was under pressure because of low volatility in currencies restricts the opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair and said that it was almost impossible to manipulate the extensive and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true.
A senior trader said that despite the enormous daily volume in foreign exchange trading the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the growing use of internal platforms by banks that "one with very low ticket prices can affect the market."
The news came on the same day, when Credit Suisse announced this week that it had terminated a distributor of London Exchange Traded Funds offices, after he had caused a loss of nearly six million dollars at the end of last year.
The bank promptly informed the relevant authorities and is cooperating with them.
"We are sure that the trader acted alone and that the matter is under control," said Credit Suisse.
