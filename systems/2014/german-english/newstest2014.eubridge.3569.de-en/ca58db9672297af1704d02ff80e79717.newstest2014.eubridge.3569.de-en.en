Frankfurt parking fees to rise strongly
Parking in Frankfurt could soon be sensitive more expensive.
The magistrate advises the city this morning on a template of Verkehrsdezernent Stefan Majer (Green).
The parking fees should be increased by 50 percent.
But it should not raise the prices, but will be the time interval of parking watches and parking ticket machines from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December, the city must then decide.
The retail committee of the Chamber of Commerce holds the Frankfurt "is not a good idea."
The parking directly in front of the business was "a significant advantage for smaller retailers."
The Transport Club Germany believes that an increase in two decades "entirely appropriate and long overdue."
Public transport will also be more expensive.
