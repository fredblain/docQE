Instead of learning unemployed: Pilot project for unskilled in tourism
On the lakes of Mecklenburg Seenplatte today launches a pilot project for the tourism industry.
Under the leadership of the Federal Employment Agency to 49 women and men who are already working as unskilled workers in the industry, across three winter professionals for hotels and restaurants.
"What is new is that the six-month courses with qualifications," said Carmen Wiechert of Neubrandenburg labor agency.
The benefit is diverse: The participants would not unemployed, the companies would have trained professionals who are increasingly missing in hotels and restaurants, and the agency should not finance unemployment.
The project is also the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Neubrandenburg, as well as the German hotel and restaurant association (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
