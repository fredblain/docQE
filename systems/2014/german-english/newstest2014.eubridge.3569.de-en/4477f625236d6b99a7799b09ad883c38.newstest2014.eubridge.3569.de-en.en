Blocked court decision to stop-and-Frisk directive of the NYPD
A federal appeals court in the United States on Thursday blocked the formation of a judge, the changes to the stop-and-Frisk Program ("stop and search") of the New York Police Department, and the judge absolving them from the case.
The stated that the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin would be suspended until an appeal of the city.
The judge had ruled in August, the city was in the Constitution with the way the programme will be implemented for stopping and questioning of people.
The city appealed against their assessment and ordered remedial measures, including the decision to set up a monitoring body, which should support the police in changing its directive and the corresponding training programme.
The appeal court heard the arguments on Tuesday the suspension.
The report said that the judge had to be released from the case because they have violated the code of conduct for American judge, is determined that a judge is to avoid the appearance of partiality; this was partly justified by a series of media interviews and public statements, in which she had publicly responded to the criticism of the court.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, because they were inappropriately targeted black and Latin American men with the BMW Demotika program.
It has appointed an outside agency to monitor the implementation of significant changes, including reforms in directives, training and supervision, and ordered a pilot program with the body cameras in areas where most of the checks were carried out.
In August, the city of New York agreed to end the practice of storing names and addresses of people who were sacked after an inspection by the police.
One of the appeal of the city is planned after 14 March 2014.
The stop-and-Frisk-tactic has been criticized by a number of civil rights advocates.
Such controls are there for decades in various forms, but the number of recorded controls during the term of the partyless Mayor Michael Bloomberg to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
In 2004, was submitted by four men, all minorities,, which developed into a class action.
Advocates of changes to the stop-and-Frisk Program of the NYPD say the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police and influence the way, like other police chiefs use the scheme.
Opponents argue that the changes would dampen the morale of the police, but not the crime; wasted money and would not solve the broader problem of a police force that is after the loss of thousands of jobs in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that they do not finish the stop-and-Frisk practice was constitutional, but only the kind of the implementation of controls by the NYPD reformiere.
