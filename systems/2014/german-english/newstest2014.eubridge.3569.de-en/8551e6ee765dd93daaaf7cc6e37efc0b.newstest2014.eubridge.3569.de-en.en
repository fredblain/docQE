Early puberty: Grow up faster
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty than their white age, as studies show.
Physical changes mean not directly puberty
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that the epidemic of obesity is a trigger early puberty
The trend toward early puberty is less pronounced in boys
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family issues.
A mother should be worried if her daughter grow at the age of seven or eight years of breasts and pubic hair?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics paediatricians Association this week in Orlando, Florida, said the paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz that these early physical changes are relatively normal among American girls and a new standard.
"I spend a lot of time to reassure parents - normally, this is not a sign that is now fast puberty," explained Kaplowitz.
Obvious indicators of development, such as growing breasts, Scham- and Achselhaare and body odor, with girls.
However, there was only a slight shift in the age of the Menarche (first menstruation) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age at 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
"If the development of breasts, it takes at least two to three years to the," said Kaplowitz, author of the book "early puberty in girls: The essential guide to deal with this problem frequently occurring."
Time is the most accurate test, which is progressing puberty.
It is controversial, which is actually the onset of puberty, but it is "precocious," if the breast augmentation is accompanied by a growth spurt before the age of eight years.
In most cases, the process slowed down or stalled â€“ something that can monitor a pediatrician.
For faster progress could be by a Endikronologen so serious problems such as tumors and cysts.
There are treatments to delay an early menstruation and the defense of another consequence: The premature aging of the bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and small stature in adults.
The recommendations for a medical or hormonal therapy based on the age of the child, the speed of development, the growth rate and the emotional maturity.
Psycho-social aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious about drugs, but he admits: "The suppression of puberty can mitigate behavioral problems and the feelings of girls, unlike their age."
The other major problem is understandable: Parents simply do not want their very young daughters have the period.
"They are concerned about the risk of pregnancy or about how they handle the hygienic side," Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter has received with ten days.
Even if there were signs and we had talked about menstruation, they were not prepared emotionally.
She was scared and excited by the school home because it was the first in her group of friends.
There are many fully published theories about the causes of early puberty.
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media.
Young are similar girls before puberty.
Kaplowitz believes that the most compelling premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported girls on the implementation of a study in 2001 at the age of six to nine years, which establishes a connection between body fat and entering puberty.
Other studies support that conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls reach puberty tend to be rather than their white age.
There are different reasons for this.
Globally, an early puberty seems to be influenced by all sorts of things, economic conditions on the climate to the genes.
Another mystery: Although boys grow facial and pubic hairs earlier, the trend towards a full earlier puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors on the AAP conference underscored the complexity of the issue.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is widespread even babies and young children.
"We have to be careful how we identify the true beginning of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to take advice from their doctor, how they should talk to their child.
"This may mean that you have a conversation earlier than expected," advised Kaplowitz.
If you stay calm, the child is usually good.
Girls who early bloom, need the insurance, the process is a normal part of life, even if it happens sooner than expected.
