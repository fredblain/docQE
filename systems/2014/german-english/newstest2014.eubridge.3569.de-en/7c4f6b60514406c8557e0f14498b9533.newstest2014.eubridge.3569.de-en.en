Australierin sets appeal against a prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney who was sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket, because she had falsely claimed to have been raped by a taxi driver, has appealed against the sentence and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially by a provincial court in Phuket on June 15, was found guilty of having made a false statement, after she had indicated to the Thai police, she was raped in the early hours on Sunday, 10 June, a local taxi driver, while two other men, she said.
Later, however, the photographs showed a video camera that they had arrived safely in their hotel after they had been separated from her Australian boyfriend.
The police in Phuket Bamford interrogated for two days until they confessed to have invented the story.
Until the trial is on the ground in police custody.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day sentence in a prison with a low security level on the edge of Phuket, rather than in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Rubgy League, which has appealed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra with a request for help for his daughter.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney, the whole family was "extremely concerned" about the welfare of his daughter and wanted to have back in Australia.
"We are very concerned, of course, but we hope that it is as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford has appealed against the ruling and is against a deposit of 50,000 baht at large.
In Australian reports that it makes in the meantime, in the resort of Krabi in southern Thailand.
The court was to hear Bamford will be represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and had been warned that the appointment could also lead to the imposition of a higher penalty of up to two years in a prison for adults.
However, it is also possible that Thailand could be made after the recent assassination of travel clerk Michelle Smith in Phuket, to improve its tarnished image, and it is therefore an acquittal.
