21 years, Georges Bwelle of his sick father repeatedly lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals that did not have the resources to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in 1981 in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
First, he had a broken arm, but it was an inflammation, which to his brain and caused a haematoma that should affect him for the rest of his life.
"There was no neuro-surgeon in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
We have released him from Cameroon, if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years to accompany his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment that they had to offer.
"It is not easy," Bwelle said.
You can leave the house at five o "clock in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first one, and it is not first.
There are very many patients.
Indeed, some people die because they have to wait.
The situation has changed little since Bwelles father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
In contrast, the ratio is in the United States with a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there was a doctor for them, could not afford most Cameroonians the visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of health spending in the country are private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," says Bwelle.
And the poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
His father, and so many of his countrymen to see suffer ripened in Bwelle decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers carried out 700 free operations last year.
He was a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a nonprofit organization called ASCOVIME travels on weekends in rural areas and free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday and up to 30 people in minibuses and continue with the helpless medical equipment on the roof of unbefestigtes terrain in the villages, need help.
Not everything runs smoothly.
More than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they are welcomed as heroes: A feast, singing and dancing and the best accommodation, the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a cause for celebration and Bwelle - with his broad smile and his boundless energy - the joyful celebration.
The next morning, the team begins with the investigation of hundreds of patients.
"We treat 500 people per trip," Bwelle.
You come from a radius of 60 kilometers around the village and on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offering medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are being treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crutches, donated glasses or free birth certificates, a document that is required for the school, but many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team simple operations with local anaesthetic.
The operations are normally held in a school, the City Hall or an apartment; after the procedure, the patient and go in the recreation area, in order to make room for the next person.
The lighting for the surgery and disinfection equipment is powered by a generator of the group and Bwelle and his volunteers until the early morning hours on Sunday.
It is an arduous work, but the village musicians usually help to keep the team.
"They drum all night, so that we can stay awake and continue our work," says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team goes back to the city, tired but proud of the work.
The group - a mixture of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students - has carried out last year, 700 free operations and know that it makes an enormous difference to the people with their work, which helps them.
A man explained that the free operation of that he had received enabled him to return to work.
"The changes the future of my family," the man said.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon at the hospital Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job he finanziere 60% of its charitable activities, Bwelle; the rest come from private donations.
"I really do not know when he is asleep," says Katie O "Malley, who for the second year at Drexel University in Philadelphia studied medicine and voluntarily participates in Bwelles group.
He is always either in hospital or trying to raise money for the organization, so that he can go to these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students such as O "Malley, who come from the United States and Europe and support Bwelle, this is an opportunity to gain practical experience they would never get at home.
"We can be in operations, where we help blood abzutupfen or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwelle," explains O 'Malley.
That would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
The students pay for their trip to Cameroon normally themselves and often donated medical equipment.
But they are in Yaoundé, Bwelle accommodation, transport and guide.
"He is undoubtedly a hero," says O "Malley.
He devotes his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people, knows no boundaries.
For Bwelle the almost constant work is not a burden.
Others to give to a happier life, and thus to fulfill a promise he made to his father, he has a great deal of pleasure.
"I am so happy when I make this work," says Bwelle.
And I am thinking of my father.
I hope he sees what I do.
I do it to get people to laugh and to alleviate the pain.
