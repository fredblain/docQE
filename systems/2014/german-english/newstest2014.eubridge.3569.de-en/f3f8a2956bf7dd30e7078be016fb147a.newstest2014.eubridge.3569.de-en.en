Report: Obama's campaign considered to replace Biden by Hillary Clinton
The closest advisers of President Barack Obama have considered in secret to replace Vice President Joe Biden in the 2012 campaign by Hillary Clinton, the New York Times.
The revelation is the surprise of the long-awaited work by Mark Stan and John competition on the 2012 campaign, "double Down: Game Change 2012."
The Times is a copy of the forthcoming book, and they reported on Thursday evening that the president Topberater "extensive group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011" had carried out to find out whether the appearance of Obama's dwindling hopes of re-election, if he let fall Biden.
According to Jonathan Martin, national political correspondent for the Times, the book traces the history of the efforts of leading staff of the campaign and the White House, notably former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley to measure what effect it had on the poll numbers to replace the former Secretary of State Clinton against the vice president.
The potential change was a closely guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and in the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the closest advisers of the president, including Daley, Obama's former campaign manager, Jim Messina, and the former senior White House adviser David Axelrod and David Plouffe, knew about the planned change.
In "double Down" is said, Daley had stood at the forefront of efforts to Biden, despite their "close, personal relationship" before eventually decided against such a move, after the data showed that Clinton's candidacy "would not significantly improve the chances of Obama's."
In an interview with Martin Daley, confirmed that the government was considering to replace Biden by Clinton.
"I made a whole series of things that you should consider, and that was one of them," Daley told the magazine.
We must remember that the President had terrible poll numbers, so we thought: "For God's sake, what do we do?"
While Daley described the investigation as "due diligence,", said Martin to Anderson Cooper of CNN that had been operated during the campaign for the re-election of considerable effort to find out whether such a move to the ballot box auszahle.
"In campaigns is not spent so much money on surveys and focus groups, if you don't think seriously about something," said Martin on AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team thought about an exchange.
Martin said on CNN, he asked Daley whether his former boss had known about the potential change.
Although Daley said that he does not believe that the President of the possible change was "aware" the former chief of staff, admitted that it was "possible" that Obama did not know about it.
Martin added that "double Down" deliver a definitive answer to the question of whether the political soundings have reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously think that Obama did not know of the inquiries about whether to drop Biden in the elections.
"Possible," said Martin.
