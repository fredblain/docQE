The Supreme Court confirmed Obama's health law
It is a great victory for the Obama administration: The US Supreme Court ruled today that the closely associated with Barack Obama health care law is constitutional.
With five votes to four, the judges ruled that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act - it forces US citizens to conclude a health insurance by 2014 or pay a penalty - within the framework of the tax authority of the state is constitutional.
The chief judge John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the chamber, while the judges Warren, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy decided against it.
The court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700 -page law and also took the view that the imposition of the health law, according to federal states either access conditions to expand Medicaid or otherwise all state Medicaid funding would be removed, was not unconstitutional restrictive.
The lawsuit against the law had been brought by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was rejected by all the leading Republican presidential candidates, including the eventual challenger Mitt Romney, in the pre-election campaign in 2012.
