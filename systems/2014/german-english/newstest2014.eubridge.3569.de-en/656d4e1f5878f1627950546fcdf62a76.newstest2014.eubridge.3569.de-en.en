UN announces new breakthroughs in the fight against poverty
The United Nations begin preparing a new set of goals, with which the Millennium Development Goals announced 12 years ago to combat poverty should be replaced.
In the run-up to the UN summit on sustainable development, which began the evening in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in the push for "sustainable development goals" to replace the Millennium Development Goals, which expires in 2015.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Ms Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in the evening at the summit, the time has come, "thinking about the national interests."
"I am pleased that the member states have agreed to take a process that was agreed with the universal sustainable development goals," he said.
"These goals will build on our progress in the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the framework for the development after 2015.
I will spare no effort to implement the mandate given to me by the member states to achieve our vision of sustainable development goals, which build on the success of the Millennium Development Goals. "
