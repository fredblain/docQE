Verzweiflungs cry of an Obama voter
I have twice elected President Obama in the hope that change is possible
He says that Obama has made commendable efforts that have been thwarted by the blocking tactics by Republicans
The blockade policy does not apologize the website problems of Obamacare, the drone strikes
Obama's memoir about the 2008 campaign are a sad reminder of what would have been possible.
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student at Harvard Medical School in the second year.
I read a terribly sad book.
It is a book that I thought it would be sad during the second year medical student cheering up and give me hope.
It is called "the Audacity to Win" (courage to win) and describes the memoirs of Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election.
In the evening, I am finished with my patients transcripts and go to bed, then the book brings me back to a time when the policy inspired millions and.
The election was a landslide victory and the to lead the historical significance of this hour.
My classmates wept with joy and my parents collected all the newspapers that they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on the way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
Obama into office in 2008, he had approval voting values of 82%.
And then I close the book.
Switch back to the present is a rude awakening, as if it is from a dream.
It is hard to remember these optimistic times - they seem to be a faint memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I made my voice for the first time, something has changed.
But there is simply nothing that I could have imagined.
I acknowledge the great and versatile things that Obama has achieved by the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for health insurance until the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced concealment of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I also believe that the partisan blockade tactics have too many efforts, with whom our nation should be brought forward: Immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closing of Guantanamo Bay, to name a few.
But after countless times, I have defended the Obama administration to colleagues and friends, I am with my point at the end.
I have reached a point of political desperation.
The Republican obstructionism cannot explain why it allows the interception of foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data about the private lives of Americans and why whistleblowers should be punished, the government misconduct.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki was an American citizen, was killed without trial, nor why the public financing and spending limits during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report, which says that the efforts of the White House to restrain the media are the "most aggressive... since the Nixon administration."
And the most recent cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.
I do not know if that is what I should have expected.
If I have to understand that the government could contradict the previous political campaigns.
Apparently, the is not a predictable course Abgeordnetenamt, as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre shape the public debate.
But when I look at the above examples, they seem to be largely elected by the government itself.
And that bothers me the most.
I was re-elected in 2012, Obama, not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and half-baked alternative, he seemed not its direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfil the hopes that we had heard for so long.
But with the drop in approval ratings for Obama to below 45% this week to return to 2008 through this book.
It makes me the desire for the many promises that have vanished into thin air.
This week I read a section in the book, which describes how Obama has had a heavy loss against Clinton in the primaries in Pennsylvania.
In a meeting with election officials after the decision, he told his staff, they would have to come back on track and follow the purpose of their cause.
"I want us to find our magic," he said.
We need to remember who we are.
There are five years later, Mr. President, and I could not agree with you more.
