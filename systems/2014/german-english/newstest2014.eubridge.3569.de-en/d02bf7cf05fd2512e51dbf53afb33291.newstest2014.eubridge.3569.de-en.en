A black box in the car?
American road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying highway system, and believe the solution to be found in a small black box, the space in the dashboard of each car.
The devices, which record and report the information to the authorities, the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the planning offices of the federal states to review the outdated system of financing American roads.
The normally rather boring area of road planning has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Libertarian have allied themselves with environmental groups and that the government of the small boxes to record mileage - and, possibly, where they were driven and then use the information for the calculation of modest tax.
The Tea Party is appalled.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a series of data protection concerns.
But while Congress cannot agree on a course of action, several states wait no longer.
They are looking at how they can switch to a system over the next ten years, in which drivers pay per mile driven.
Thousands of drivers have the tachograph, some of which are equipped with GPS tracking, already tested.
This really is a must for our country.
"There is nothing that we will only use may be," said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Assn. of government, which is planning a record of driven miles in all California motorists in the federal state in 2025.
The way we pay these taxes, will change.
The technology is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is funded from the taxes that Americans pay at the pump is broke.
But in America is no longer as much fuel as before.
Cars use less gasoline.
The state petroleum tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 euro cents per liter) has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians do not dare to high fuel prices, raising the tax by a penny.
"The gas tax is simply not sustainable," says Lee Munnich, an expert on traffic law at the University of Minnesota.
The federal government has recently 500 cars with black boxes, which are tested a mileage-based payment system.
"This is the most sensible alternative, in the long term," he said.
Bureaucrats call it as a mileage-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea of urban liberals, because the tax could be used, for example, to influence the behaviour that congestion and climate-damaging emissions to be reduced.
The Californian planners rely on the system in formulating policies that the ambitious, statutory objectives of the federal state on climate change.
But the Republican Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also declared that he is the most viable long-term alternative.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are taken with the idea to drivers pay zur√ºckgelegter route.
"This is not a tax that disappears into a black hole," said Adrian Moore, vice president for policy at the Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former American transport ministers who had urged in a report to Congress in 2011 to move in the direction of mileage-based billing.
The US Senate last year approved a $90 million expensive pilot project, which includes 10,000 cars.
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the thrust and responding to the concerns of MPs from rural areas, the people who in everyday life, often many miles on the way to work or in the city.
Several states and cities move on their own in this direction.
The most active is Oregon, which is currently enlists 5,000 drivers for the biggest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of the mineral oil tax to the federal government.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City also is considering.
Illinois is testing it in a limited way with trucks.
And the I- 95 Coalition, which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently studying how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where recently 50 volunteers were equipped with the devices, motorists were skeptical of the idea that the government could pursue its every move.
"Concerns about Big Brother and such things were a big problem," said Alauddin Khan, director of strategy and product management at the Transport Ministry of Nevada.
The people did not want it.
As the trial started, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: "It would be relatively easy to transform the tachograph in mature monitoring devices."
There was no need to build a huge, bulky technological infrastructure, which would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology, with which the state can collect the mileage, but not exactly when and where.
Thus, Khan, the public would be some.
The hunt for this technology has some authorities to a small start-up company called True Mileage in California.
The company is not originally started to help states in the taxation of drivers.
Rather, it was their goal to gain a foothold in an emerging market for car insurance, in which drivers based on the basis of miles.
But the devices are also tested for road planners, because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information, which are regularly uploaded via modem.
"People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded," said Ryan Morrison, managing director of True Mileage.
In some of these public pilot programs big mistakes have been made.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this.
In Oregon, the planners are experimenting with to give drivers a number of choices.
You can opt for a device with or without GPS.
Or they can choose any device and instead pay a flat fee based on the average of all the inhabitants of the federal state driven miles.
Others hope to be able to sell the concept of a suspicious public by the devices with more features than with little.
In New York City traffic officials want to develop a device for taxation, which is also pay parking fees, insurance must be paid only for driving distances and speed data are collected by other vehicles in real time, thanks to which drivers can avoid traffic jams.
"Motorists would be the added value of the benefits of the system, motivated to participate," says a planning document of the city.
Some traffic planners, however, are wondering whether all this talk about paying per mile is not only a huge distraction.
The Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the area of the San Francisco Bay officials declared that Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by simply increasing the fuel tax.
An additional one-time fee or an annual levy could motorists with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that use little gasoline, will be imposed, so that they also pay a fair share.
"There is no need for an operation, if an aspirin is enough," said Randy Rentschler, director of legislation and public affairs of the Commission.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists are concerned about their privacy and many other things.
