FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices on planes (but no phone calls)
Passengers can now hear from departure to landing their electronic devices for reading, activities, games, music and use the prestige of films, but not with the mobile phone, according to the new guidelines, which were issued on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States.
But passengers should not expect that these changes will be implemented immediately.
How quickly they would be implemented, would depend on the respective airline, said FAA employee Michael Huerta at a press conference.
The airlines need to prove that the FAA aircraft to meet the new guidelines and that they have updated the training manuals of the flight crew and the arrangements for the storage of the devices, according to the new rules.
The FAA said that she had already received by some airlines plans to expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes.
Under these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the condition of the plan, we could approve the expanded use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA announced in a statement.
Currently, passengers must switch smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
You may not start again when the plane reached an altitude of three kilometers, and the captain gives the green light.
At the entrance to the, the passengers must switch them back and they must not start again, before the plane landed.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose planes are secured against electronic malfunctions could allow its passengers to use the devices, landing on the tarmac, the FAA said.
Most of the new commercial aircraft and other planes for the use of Wi-Fi in, should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of professional flight attendants, welcomed the changes.
"If the new regulation is implemented, and we are working closely with the airline, both sides will benefit from it," said Glading.
We are to be honest, we feel like watchdogs on this issue.
Nevertheless, Internet connections for surfing, exchange of e-mails, text messages or downloading data at three kilometers, the agency explained.
Passengers are urged to smartphones, tablets and other devices in flight mode.
So there is still no "words With Friends," the scrabble classified online game that the actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011, when he had to leave a jet of American Airlines, because he refused to shut down the device, while the plane was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices such as laptops must continue to be stored, because there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile phone calls during the flight will also remain banned.
The regulatory authority for telephone conversations at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not with the FAA.
FAA lifts may ban on certain electronic devices during takeoff and landing on
Last month, said Mark Rosenker of the Transportation Security Administration National Transportation Safety Board, security expert for national transport issues at CBS News, mobile phones are still seen as a risk.
"Mobile is really a problem, not only because they could potentially cause problems in navigation equipment, but because we know from the FCC that can disrupt the transfer from the air," said Rosenker.
An advisory committee of the industry, which was created by the FAA to investigate this issue, recommended last month that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years has increased the pressure on the FAA to loosen restrictions on its use.
Critics such as the Democratic Senator Claire McCas kill from Missouri are of the opinion that there is no valid security reasons for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce, because the use of the devices has become ubiquitous.
In some studies, up to one-third of the passengers, the closure of the device or ignored.
The FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic devices by passengers, after reports of disturbances of navigation and communications equipment of passengers bears FM radios were, the latest technology trend.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA that electronic interference.
Airlines offer passengers for several years, Wi-Fi, if the altitude is reached.
The Wi-Fi systems adapted planes are also less susceptible to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the greater use of electronic devices, according to the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices are generally much less radio radiation than previous generations.
E-mail reader, for example, give only minimal radiation, if you umbl√§ttert.
But when downloading or sending data transmission values are stronger.
Among the supporters of an easing of restrictions on the devices use by passengers is Amazon.com.
In 2011, invited an airliner full of Kindle e-reader and made a test flight in order to identify problems, but could not.
Members of the FAA advisory committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk in the use of devices.
Douglas Kidd from the National Association of Airline Passengers Association passenger said he was of the opinion that the disruption of the device is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other committee members said that there were only scattered reports of pilots who did speak for a disruption of aircraft systems by the devices, and most of them are very old.
The committee recommended the FAA to allow pilots to mandate in instrument landing under poor visibility conditions of the closure of the devices by the passengers.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes, describing it as a sensible adjustment for travelers who today would be equipped with technology.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that it is not a pleasant passenger experience is to safety," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
