British police is a Assange to an extradition decision
The British police has today an extradition decision on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has taken refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, and has applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said that it was "the 40-year-old Australian" a call to the call on him to appear at a police station, and added that he would not do that, he would face arrest.
Assange threatened with extradition to Sweden because of the charges in a sexual offence, after having exhausted its possibilities under UK law, since the Supreme Court rejected his appeal against extradition at the beginning of the month.
Because he feared, Stockholm will extradite him to the United States, he had sought in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on June 19 and the South American country, asked for political asylum.
Scotland Yard was "a 40-year-old man sent an invitation to a time chosen by us at a police station," said a spokesman.
He continues to violate the conditions of his release on bail.
The message gave no comment on the delivery of police call.
Assange fears that he would be extradited from Sweden to the United States and there for possible espionage charges after he had published more than 250,000 diplomatic messages on the investigative website WikiLeaks.
