This year will be celebrated at the day of St. Hubertus in the parish church of St. Mary's in the a.
St. Hubertus was a rather ruthless hunter, who was appointed by a vision and later converted to the bishop of Liège.
The Jagdhornbläsergruppe hunting horn blowers group of hunting runner Westphalia headed by Brigitte Kluth musiziert on Parforcehörnern (natural horns in the mood) to old, originally French melodies.
The horns are riding clothes because they mainly riders, horses and dogs pack to trawl hunts musically.
The solemn mass will be held on Sunday, November 3, at 11.30 pm.
