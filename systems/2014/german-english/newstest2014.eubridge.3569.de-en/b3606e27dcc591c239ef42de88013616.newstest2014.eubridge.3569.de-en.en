John Kerry declared in an unprecedented admission that the US spying was "inappropriate gone too far."
John Kerry indicated with an unexpected admission softening the defensive attitude of the United States in terms of their surveillance programs, saying that the espionage is inappropriate in certain cases, "gone too far."
The foreign minister also admitted that he bore responsibility for the fact that we have switched on "autopilot" with Barack Obama, when the explosive revelations of the whistleblower, Edward Snowden about the NSA's spying activities.
The leaked information is the U.S. government in a diplomatic storm of indignation on the part of its allies.
In a speech transmitted by video link on the Open Government conference in London, Kerry said: "there is no question, the President and I and others in the government of some of the things that happened almost by autopilot, simply because the ability to do so, even in the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and, of course, goes back to 9 / 11."
Then he became the first high-ranking member of the US government that the US spying have crossed a line, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said: "In some cases, the inappropriate has gone too far."
The president is determined to create clarity, and therefore a thorough investigation so that no one must have the feeling that abuse.
I can assure you that the rights of innocent people in this process will not be affected.
Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force for good and have been saved many lives through its surveillance operations.
He added: "We are dealing with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves up in the air."
There is a radical extremism in the world, which is keen to kill people to blow up in the air and attacking governments.
So what if we would be able to intercept and stop it before it happens?
We have actually prevented attacks on buildings, plane crashes and the killing of people, because we have learned in advance of such plans.
Meanwhile, US lawmakers will travel to Europe, in order to dispel the doubts about the alleged American espionage and to convince Europeans of the need for the anti-terror efforts continue to cooperate with the United States, as the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, said that he had spoken this week with representatives of the European Parliament and other persons and is concerned about their threats not to participate because of frustration over the surveillance by the National Security Agency to anti-terror organizations.
"It is very important for the national security interests of the United States that the Europeans in terms of our joint efforts against terrorism remain on board," said Murphy, who is in the Senate for the first time as a democrat and as chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European affairs, and, in an interview in Washington.
Moreover, I go to Europe, in order to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their anger about the NSA programs.
Media reports that the NSA has collected millions of phone data in Europe, have strained relations with some US allies, although the head of the secret service said this week that the reports were incorrect and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and with the United States.
Other revelations quoted from documents provided by Snowden further that the NSA had monitored the cellphone of Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state leaders around the world.
The director of national intelligence, James Clapper, defended the spying on allies as necessary and said that this was customary on both sides.
In all the uproar, Murphy said that his agency is preparing the journey of the Congress, which is due to take place this year, and hoped the delegation will include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other MPs are to be published in the coming days.
He said that the exact itinerary will be worked out.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip is to improve the improvement of relations, he also said that there would be some "serious words."
He said that the European governments would have to be honest with their people about the kind of espionage programs that they themselves for years.
"We can change our surveillance programs and better protect the rights of Europeans, but they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones to spy," said Murphy.
Meanwhile, stands for John Kerry over the weekend, a trip to the Middle East and to Poland, to deal with the resentment over the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as the US surveillance activities.
