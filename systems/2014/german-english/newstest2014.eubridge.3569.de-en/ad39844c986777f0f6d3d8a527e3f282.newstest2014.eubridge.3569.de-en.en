Frontier Airlines charges for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to require up to 100 U.S. dollars to demand from passengers on their flight hand luggage.
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $100 for a piece of hand luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, even though, in the announcement on Wednesday that passengers are likely to keep the whole box.
The new fee applies to hand luggage in the overhead baggage compartment above the seat, small bags under the seat remain free of charge.
Frontier said it charged 25 if the fee will be paid in advance, and $100 for travelers who paid only at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O 'Malley said, the fee of $100 is introducing travelers to move in the payment.
"We do not want to charge this amount," she said.
Airlines began in 2008, for the first and second checked baggage fees.
Passengers who tried to circumvent this, therefore, plugged into the cabin baggage as much as possible, with the result that the baggage compartments are often overcrowded on the seat.
Fees are a way to encourage passengers to take less on board.
O 'Malley said, the new fee, it is not really trying to make money.
It is about the most loyal customers of Frontier, which would have clearly expressed that it will be increasingly difficult to find space in the seat.
Passengers who buy your tickets on the website of the airline, do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger at the gate of Frontier, a bag for free, but the next person must pay $100 for a comparable piece of luggage.
O 'Malley said, the website of Frontier and check-in procedures would be changed so that the passengers were informed about the fee before they come to the gate.
The new hand baggage fee of Frontier will only come into force in the summer, an exact date is not yet.
Passengers often grumbled about baggage surcharges and other fees, but airlines are happy to fall back on.
They argue that the transportation of the baggage cost money and passengers should pay for this service if they wanted it.
Many on Wall Street consider the new baggage fees as a sign that the airlines have enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
But so far, however, the fingers of charges for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded three years ago, the first charges for hand luggage and later, Allegiant Air, a low-cost carriers.
The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, said the airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely followed the additional charges.
He estimated in a report in December 2011 that bring the hand baggage fee Spirit $50 million a year.
Sorensen, who previously held a leadership position in Midwest Airlines, recently flown with spirit and was curious about what he would expect at the gate, when passengers were faced with the unusual hand baggage fee of the company.
"The boarding process was one of the smoothly I have seen in my career in aviation," he said.
I expected to see gnashing of teeth and physical discussions at the gate.
"The plane was full," he said, "and the boarding as lubricated."
Frontier spirit is also the $2 for coffee, tea, soda or juice.
The company said that passengers who bought lemonade or juice, would keep the whole box and will be free coffee.
Water is still free of charge.
In 2008, U.S. Airways had tried to demand for soft drinks, but seven months later, after passengers complained and was opposed to any other big company.
Frontiers step to charge for hand luggage, passengers do not buy directly from the airline, is the latest initiative to customers on its own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies like Orbitz 10 to 25 U.S. dollars per ticket sold.
It provides all companies an incentive to get passengers to the direct purchase with them on an online travel agency.
Frontier has gone, however, is the most in this area.
In September, the company began, when booking through an online travel agency only half as many frequent flyer miles.
On Wednesday the miles have been cut to 25 percent of the flight.
A third-party booked a flight with Frontier over 1000 miles brings customers therefore only 250 miles.
Passengers can also book exclusively to the direct purchase on the website of Frontier.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in Denver, but the business is shrinking and the company is losing money.
The revenue fell by 9 percent and the flight capacity fell almost 13 percent in the first quarter, as reported in the financial report, which was released on Wednesday by the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.,.
Republic has tried to get under the sale of the company's finances of Frontier.
