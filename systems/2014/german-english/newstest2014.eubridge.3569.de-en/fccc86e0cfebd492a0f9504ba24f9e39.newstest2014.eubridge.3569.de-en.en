The electricity is more expensive in Pfullendorf
The citizens Pfullendorfs must adapt to higher electricity costs.
As the director of the municipal works, Jörg-Arne bias, confirmed to the SUEDKURIER, on a four-member Pfullendorfer family costs 70 to 90 euros per year.
The main reason of the forthcoming price increase is the rise in the so-called EEG levy of 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This levy is fixed every year in October by the four operators of the major electricity lines.
They put them out of the Energiewende extra costs incurred in energy policy, which they can collect through a levy on the price of electricity.
The Stadtwerke Pfullendorf works are the last link in the chain.
The Supervisory Board of the energy company was in its forecasts of a higher levy, like Jörg-Arne bias.
Now the specific pay should be calculated before next week, the Stadtwerke could inform their customers about the exact price increase.
"We expect an increase of 1 cent plus x," bias, with the number will be in the vicinity of 2 cents.
