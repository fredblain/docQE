Foreign workers on 457 visas could be subjected to "authenticity test"
The government is considering additional measures in the framework of a "test" for foreign workers on 457 visa.
The test should be introduced, he came across a criterion that is designed to prevent the 457 occupation by unskilled jobs or used as a back door for the migration of family and friends to Australia.
Today, the government published a proposal after the former members of the Labor Party, Maxine McKew, had condemned the comments of the government in terms of foreign workers, because that could be viewed by the neighbours of Australia as an insult.
"Vocal statements such as foreigners should stand, and that Australians" are a very unpleasant throwback at a time when unions demanded a protected labor market, "she said of the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, it was meant that white workers should be protected, and if some people in the region vernaehmen an echo of this historical artifact, it would not surprise me.
The debate proposal outlines 12 measures that were once considered by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O "Connor, who was yesterday to talk about human trafficking in Sri Lanka, has implemented five of the recommended changes, the others are still being considered.

Companies could also be obliged to account for the number of 457 visa holders, as in the past, companies who wanted to support only a small number of workers, and hundreds have stopped.
