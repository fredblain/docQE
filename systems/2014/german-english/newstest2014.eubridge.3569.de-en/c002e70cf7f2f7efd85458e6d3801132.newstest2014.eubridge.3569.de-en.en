Parents can choose children ""
Germany is the first European nation, in which a third sex is recognised for children who were born with ambiguous genitalia.
Newborn will no longer rigidly assigned male or female.
Under the new law, parents must be no more sex for such children, but "vague" or "not" on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to take the pressure from parents, so that they do not have to make hasty decisions on operations for a gender assignment in newborns, and to combat discrimination against the people.
A intersexuelle person, according to BBC years later said: "I am neither man nor woman."
I remain a patchwork quilt, which was created by doctors, mutilated and full of scars.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children each year, either as a boy or a girl.
They belong to the, a group that fall under the diagnosis "sexual differentiation disorder" (DSD), an umbrella term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testicles) or unusually developed genitals.
Wallis Simpson was perhaps more.
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the United States, you should use the best available information on gender assignment if a provision is not possible, and not wait for the psychological and physical development of the child, before you decide - if any - for an operation.
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the issue of gender identification, said that the new German law "blade for a good cause."
Sexual interaction children represent an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgical procedure, but for most children are not," he said.
It could be a gender assignment without surgery and then wait to see how the developing identity.
The scientific data about how a child develops at all his gender identity, are not very accurate.
No one knows why it happens.
It is like the mystery of why people are gay.
In a report to the European Commission in 2011, it says, sexual people are transsexual and transgender people, because their status is not gender-related, but by their biological constitution, which is neither male nor female exclusively, but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them.
These properties were in sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitalia or chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also gives an overview of the discrimination faced intersexuelle and transgender people in professional life and about the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice crime.
Not consistent with the image of gender boys now have a special camp.
In the meantime, it is possible in Australia and Nepal for adults on official documents, male, female or "third sex" reported.
In June, Australians Norrie May-Welby (52) as the world's first "gender-free" person, after a court had granted the maintenance of a "unspecified" gender status.
German identity cards besides M and W, in a third allocation, in addition to the future, X for sexually, the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, as a news story on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French members of the strict Catholic country signed a petition that the "gender theory" should be removed from school textbooks.
The US Catholic Online website has also spoken out against the German law, saying: "If the world is being dragged into a new state, where the sex is a decision, but not sexual activity, then we twist two other pillars of civilization."
The mother of a newborn from Maryland told baby zone, it would be better if babies will be assigned to a sex at birth.
"The parents existence is already stressful enough without further restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of your child," she said of the parents' website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children who were born with both male and female parts, called Hermaphroditen, after the Greek god who had both sexes.
Ten years ago, the medicine regarded sex as something that you can wipe out and then rebuild.
But in the meantime, questioned the ethical foundations of an operation now is the gender identity, and that doctors can be wrong, because they do not know how the child at the turn of the sex of their allocation.
"In the middle of the 20th century, we called this a" psychiatric emergency, "said Drescher.
If such a child was born, then called the psychiatrist, but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory about the treatment of children with ambiguous genitals goes back to Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who took the view that sex is malleable.
He coined the term "gender identity" and argued that social and environmental initiatives, such as the parents educate a child - interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and characterized as to whether a person is male or female.
But in one under the title "John / Joan" case from 1966 his theories have been controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis was severed in a botched circumcision to neuter the child and to remove his testicles and keep him as a girl.
"Money presented this case as a successful example of a conversion, but he did not," says Drescher.
When the boy was about 15, he moved back to the male sex and married a woman.
With 38 but he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who practice this model.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of this sex operations to the public, who are "not happy with the result."
For example, Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes, but ambiguous genitals.
The doctors were not clear about whether he had a large clitoris, or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a satisfying life "as a man.
So external body and testicles were removed shortly after birth in 1976, and he was brought up as a girl.
At the age of 12, he received female hormones.
"I knew that I am not a girl," he said on ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he should receive a vaginoplasty.
But because he was depressed and knew that something was amiss, he asked for his medical records.
What he found was shocking.
I was sterilised am birth - and no one has ever told me.
Bruce was born with a DSD, through his body could not produce enough testosterone to the development of the genitals.
After he had told the truth, he moved back to the male identity, received testosterone injections and had to remove his breasts.
The operation, he has become infertile.
Today he is fighting for others in an organization called Interface Project for sexual people are perceived as normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, managing director of the California-based rights group Advocates for Informed Choice, worries that the German law "could" encourage stamping and.
"Many activists are worried that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and the child, not to", "she explained.
We fear that favours intervention.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
But we still do not know how the law will impact, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supported the Australian law because "it allows adult recognition as a third sex."
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex," she said.
The German law is about the allocation at birth.
This is not a fight, which should be small children at this time.
When they grow up, they can decide on their bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast radio login from Pitt, who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and hundreds of others in a self-help group, says that the German law "authorize" both parents and children.
Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete Androgenresistenz.
Because of the target cells for testosterone Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and ovaries.
Today, Katie 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as a co-worker in the child psychiatry.
Although she is infertile, but hopes to get a child through adoption or a surrogate mother.
"The law gives parents room, so they do not have to make hasty decisions," said Baratz.
It gives them the time to make various tests and to clarify things and gives them more time before they write "male" or "female".
In this way, everything is in order, the child and loves it.
It was a wonderful baby and enjoys the parental happiness.
And we must not rush to make an operation that will not.
"This includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that the parents, because they believe that they would not do the right thing," she explained.
Ultimately, the child decides on the sex, which is more suited to him - and it is wonderful.
This will be able to make the decision themselves.
