Tripodi denies to have been influenced by Obeid
Against the former Minister of Labor Party, Joe Tripodi from New South Wales launched an investigation by the state corruption supervision.
The former NSW Minister denies to have changed the rules on at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, the hidden stakes in three properties on state-controlled land.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC Â­ Independent Commission against Corruption) has extended its investigations on Friday on the question of whether Obeid influenced several government ministers to leases at Circular Quay, where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a cafe, without tender after their expiration in August 2005.
Now is the accusation, Tripodi knew from Obeids concealed interest in the land after the Tripodis former deputy chief of staff, Lynne Ashpole on Thursday.
In years of talks, which began in 2005, the government had pushed for public tenders for the leases.
The tenants were against it, and also wanted longer maturities.
In 2009, the leases for the company at the Circular Quay, which provided the Obeids $2.5 million a year, without a public tender.
Tripodi, who was from February 2006 to November 2009 port minister, had previously argued for public tenders.
But he denied that the changes made at the request of Obeid, who had been as Tripodi confirmed on a review of the lease arrangements of the government.
One of the ICAC's telephone transcript showed talks from the August and September 2007 between Obeid and Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had moved into the port ministry, after he had worked under Obeid in the fisheries authority.
"The discussion in these telephone conversations, the development of the commercial leasing arrangements?" Asked the deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
"No," Tripodi said.
I do not remember what was discussed, but it was definitely not.
Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid.
