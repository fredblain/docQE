The officials
I was asked to write to you about your investigation to mass surveillance.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and used by contract or a direct employment as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
In the course of my employment in these facilities, I witnessed systematic violations of the law of my government that led me from a moral duty to act.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I saw I was exposed to a serious and persistent campaign that forced me to leave my family and my home.
I currently live in exile and enjoy temporary asylum, which gives me the Russian Federation in accordance with international law.
I am encouraged by the response to my political action, both in the United States and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world and high officials - including the United States - have the revelations to a system of mass surveillance, which is accountable to nobody, as a service to the public.
The spying revelations attracted many proposals for new laws and directives aimed at the previously concealed abuse of public trust.
The benefits to society from these findings is becoming clearer; at the same time, the risks visibly reduced.
Although the result of my efforts demonstrably positive, my government treated dissent as a breach of loyalty and seeks to criminalize political expression and put on trial.
However, the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the government of the United States, with the support of the international community that prejudicial attitudes.
I hope that I, if the problems are resolved this humanitarian situation, will be able to take part of the facts about the statements made in the media, particularly with regard to truth and authenticity of the reports, appropriately and in accordance with law.
I am looking forward to a conversation with you in your country, once the situation is clarified, and I thank you for your efforts to uphold international law that protects us all.
