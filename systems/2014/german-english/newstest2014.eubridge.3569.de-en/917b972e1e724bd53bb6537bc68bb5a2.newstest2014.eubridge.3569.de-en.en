George Kerevan: European unbundling gives the Scots the choice
A new day, a new horror story to independence.
This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland is necessary to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the cue for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a secure border with barbed wire along the.
In fact, it was in the Strathclyde template pointed to the possible economic benefits that would bring more freedom to travel in the rest of Europe, but this was - as expected - played no role in the headlines.
No one has also mentioned that the EU member states often bent their strict rules, if it is convenient for them.
As Scotland currently does not belong to the Schengen area, would be the continued disregard for Brussels, only a small concession in exchange for what it really wants from the Scots.
That is not really a story.
And one that is already happened in the years that it already looks like a fossil: The, the first time I have heard the "independence means passport controls" duck at least 40 years.
This is an interesting point in the constant refrain of this ancient history.
Why should we expect from an independent Scotland that dances to the tune of Europe?
Why the London yoke against the trade from Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: The large, taken after the war plan to the unification of Europe is stalled.
With the euro crisis, the European project is officially dead.
Throughout the EU parties are gaining ground, the EU or the euro as a common currency to throw overboard.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic party founded Alternative for Germany - until this year - nearly five million votes in the federal election in September, and distribute effectively, the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There have always been local opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
The current economic crisis, it is a turning point.
Because of the strict austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, in connection with the straitjacket, forced into the national economy by adhering to the common currency, many people believe that the European project has gone too far.
The crisis of the euro has little to do with the fact that national governments create excessive budget deficits - that was the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has pinned down its members on exchange rates, which are beneficial for German exporters - and the German politicians would like to.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the local currency will take place in southern Europe with a built-in productivity disadvantage against Germany.
The only way is to cut wages and public spending - spurred on by Berlin.
Behind the current budget and monetary problems lies a deeper European productivity problem.
As a result of the imposed by Brussels "green" energy policy - a code for subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer pays the European industry compared with the United States twice for electricity and four times for gas.
This is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All the world protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner of cheap American shale gas.
As a result of a revolt, especially in France, the former cheerleader of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check and Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
However, Berlin, Paris does not need more than a gateway to the political legitimacy and Europe has imposed its own economic policy, which the ailing French economy.
The result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, EU anti-National Front has just won a key by-election and the ruling Socialists in three.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France, with 24 percent of the vote - a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a split in the right spectrum would automatically mean benefits for the left.
What makes Le Pen, with their newly gained popularity among the white working-class French?
She would like to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti-EU currency bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections - and it is very possible for the first time such a block could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point I want to make: In the not too distant future, the growing resentment of the EU and the single currency will come to the abolition of the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it is something like the "Europe" (sovereign) nations favored General de Gaulle.
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may keep the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect that Great Britain distanced itself from the project, hoping to curry favour with the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where is Scotland in all this?
We can decide to be a region of (ultimately).
Or we can defend our own economic interests - including Berlin and Brussels to say what they are where hinstecken.
I suspect that Scotland could go in a looser European Grouping quite well, as long as we keep our own currency.
The cooperation with other like-minded countries, is not in a federal Europe of the Nations easier.
Otherwise, we should consider it emulate Norway and keep our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland - remarkably - the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and has 2011 spectacular majority due to the rejection of the proposed (and) cuts made by the Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence, only to be imposed by Berlin and Brussels austerity.
