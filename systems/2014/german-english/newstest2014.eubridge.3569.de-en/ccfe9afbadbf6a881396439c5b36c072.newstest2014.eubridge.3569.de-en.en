The disposable society does not think
The night was long, loud music and the mood is good, but at some point, it is home.
In the bellies of the people on the passenger and back seat of hunger.
Clearly, a cocktail or champagne may be responsible for it.
What is more natural than chilled to drive to the next Drive-In to take a bite?
I admit that I am happy with it, if it is late at night or early in the morning to fast food-fetching.
A few fries, a Coke and a burger - and then as the home and go to bed.
But on the way home the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco GÃ¤ngern.
What must be missing that constant regularity of its fast-food bags from the car window?!
Especially at the weekends discarded paper bags around streets and parking lots.
"Why?," I wonder.
The people are too stupid to take the bags home or until the next dustbin?
It is not just that the landscape disfigured the paper.
Bags have also been concealed transport facilities such as crash barriers and triggered accidents.
So what does this "disposable society" but not, presumably, they do not even know what that word means.
If it is more often, especially with several people in the car, you know how to take a back seat after all nights: Clothes, bottles and other garbage are there.
There were a few bags more or less, but nothing - in contrast to the street, where no one wants to eat the remains of other rumtrampeln.
I can already see the day when the cities and communities to dopey removal - and the fast-food chains for their bags.
