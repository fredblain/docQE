Fancy ice cream that glows in the dark?
A British businessman has developed the first in the dark luminous ice â€“ with the help of jellyfish.
Charlie Francis, the fluorescent properties of marine animals and created a luminous bounties.
The idea came to him after he had read a research work on jellyfish and was able to convince Chinese researchers artificially bright protein.
The ice cream responds to eat with the tongue, making the pH value in the protein and the lights.
Chris says that the response to the heat in the mouth and the more you licks, the lighter it.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I'm Delicious," says: "The product is unbelievable, but still at a very early stage of production, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds."
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue with a neutral pH value.
If the mouth warms the protein, the pH and the ice.
We have tested it in recent months, and it seemed ideal to bring it to Halloween on the market, because it has this wonderful Leuchteffekt.
It is probably the most expensive ice cream, which I have ever made, because the fluorescent jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
Every ball costs me about 140 pounds.
But it tastes delicious.
His experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavors, including beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his latest creation is to be more ambitious.
He says: "I would like to develop an invisible ice cream."
That in itself is impossible because of the refraction, which is caused by the ice crystals of ice cream, but I suspect that we will find a way to do it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish, which are produced by Chinese scientists artificially
