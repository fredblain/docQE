Anger over sentence for Bali bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died in 2002 at the bombing in Bali, reacted angrily at the verdict for the last of the instigators, who was brought to, as Umar Patek should be shot in their opinion.
Patek, who was nearly ten years as one of the most wanted persons in Southeast Asia on the run, was sentenced yesterday for his role in the construction of explosives for the bombing to a sentence of 20 years.
With punitive suspension, he could be released after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, in which 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many more were injured.
A guilty verdict in a series of terrorism-related charges, including a wave of bomb attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecution had demanded a life sentence, even if they can apply for the man who, because of its reputation as a wordless bomb maker known as "Demolition Man," could have requested the death penalty.
The decision has aroused painful memories in June Corteen, a mother from Perth, the 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Patek and his Mitverschw√∂rern almost ten years ago.
Fighting back tears, she said, Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I mean, he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
"We should put him in front of a firing squad," said Corteen to AAP.
I have to live with every day that I will get no further grandchildren and I will never see my daughters.
The Sari Club was razed to the ground, on 12 October 2002, shortly after 11 p.m., a powerful bomb exploded in a small truck that was parked in front of the nightclub.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar, where only 20 seconds earlier, a suicide bombers explode a backpack filled with explosives.
He fell into a coma after the attack for a month and "died" three times while he was on a life support system.
Hughes said Patek deserves the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah, Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra, who were responsible for the massacre and were executed four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty before anyone else.
To keep him alive - no, there is no reason to keep him alive.
To get 20 years after he killed 202 people and injured hundreds, is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers, who was in court.
He cheated nearly a decade of arrest, but was finally picked up in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US forces less than four months later, the former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden killed.
During the trial, with an FBI agent said that intelligence reports had provided the reference that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of the connection between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and to rebuild.
"He has not arisen," said Corteen.
Until recently, he has shown no remorse for how much pain he has caused to other people.
The verdict came before the tenth anniversary of the attack this year, which is celebrated with commemorations in Bali and Australia.
"This year, there will be many tears," said Corteen.
Patek can still appeal against his sentence.
