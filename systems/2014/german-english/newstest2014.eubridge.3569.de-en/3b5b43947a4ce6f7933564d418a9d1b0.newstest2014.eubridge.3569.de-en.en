When the horse experts in droves in Cardiff met to select the horse of the year, they knew that a rat race.
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The kid, who is not even in kindergarten, and only a few months ago, made his first steps, and his Shetland pony toffee trotted only loosely through three rounds and got the first prize - 30 adult opponents.
The inseparable pair, both of the same size, were praised for their appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition, which is organized by the Sunny Bank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
When he appeared in competition against men and women with elegant melons, he had his plate cap in a cheeky angle and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the judges for his natural abilities in dealing with the pony, which would be far beyond his age.
And toffee received top marks for his appearance and his personality.
Fenton had toffee last March as a gift for his third birthday and practiced every day with the Shetland pony.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: "Fenton and toffee are a great team."
They had to compete against the entire field of competitors and went with gold trophy and rosette.
It was only the second time that he had taken part in a competition with toffee, and we were all excited when he won.
Perfect strangers in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who for more than ten years.
Howells said: "The whole audience was hooked and all have cheered and applauded him."
He ran on sand the entire length of the arena, and although he looked so tiny, he has done a fantastic job.
Fenton is crazy about animals - he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens that he cares.
As it is launched, it will not be long until he is on the "horse of the Year" - and I am sure he will do well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show said: "Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony."
Together, they are a great team.
The jury considered Fenton and toffee how well they fared and in the Vorf√ºhrring.
They pay attention to good cooperation between pony and leader - and Fenton and toffee were the best in the ring.
I am sure that Fentons sweet clothing has played its part, the truly fit perfectly.
