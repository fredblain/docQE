Jumbo manufacturers argue in the face of large orders on seat width
Between leading aircraft manufacturers, it is a debate about the width of seats in economy class on long-haul flights, which set the tone for a bitter clash at the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute revolves around the seat width, passengers on long flights in economy class - not always the most airlines, but the designated area is the key to the effectiveness of claims in the latest aircraft from Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for an industry standard, which requires a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in economy class, but the US Erzrivale Boeing says that the airlines should be decided by.
The controversy comes at a time when the aircraft manufacturers are competing to sell even larger versions of its twin-engine long-haul planes, and at the event from 17 to 21 November expect record orders.
As the rear part of the aircraft, in particular whether there are rows of nine or ten seats - is crucial to the economic results indicated that, which is to deliver the new "mini-jumbo" design.
Boeing claims its modernized "777X" take 406 people in seats in economy class, which are about 17 inches wide and ten per line.
Airbus said that the competing version of the A350 bef√∂rdere 350 people in 18-inch wide seats in economy class, there are nine per series.
Aircraft giants often share blows over technical details through advertisements in the press.
Airbus now calls before the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X with over 100 orders is expected to make the race, directly to the public.
Recently, the company has an ad that could be the beginning of a new ad war and donors showed a picture, in which three people are squeezed in a restaurant, and the title: "Would you accept that?"
"Boeing is proposing long-haul flights in seats that are more than regional turbo-prop aircraft," says Airbus sales chief John Leahy.
In the light of changed eating habits are thicker, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined the modern long-distance travel, and the end of the century, has the weight of the average American male between 40 and 49 years increased by 10 percent, the data from the US Health Ministry.
The Taillenumfang male average American is in the 21st century, according to US health statistics 100.8 cm.
Airbus says that his rival is a seat concept from the 1950s, when the average body size of the newly baptized "jet Set" was narrow.
It was, as Airbus, that showed that an extra inch (2.54 cm) per seat, the quality of sleep by 53 percent.
Boeing disputes the figures Airbus to the seat and says it is not to decide at the discretion of the manufacturer, as airlines make the balance between air fares and furnishings.
The company also explains, according to the experience in the aircraft of more than the seat width.
"It is really boils down to give airlines flexibility, so that they can do what they think they need to be successful," explains the flight cabin expert Kent Craver of Boeing.
You do not want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, there is more elbow, but for manufacturers, it is increasingly an issue that can affect sales.
Behind the dispute is a race for plane orders with an estimated volume of at least $700 billion at list prices in the coming decades, which could have a major impact on the export performance of the US or Europe.
As Reuters reported in July for the first time, the seat layout is the driving force behind the debate about the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing say 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest twin-engine long-haul designs as the market leader in this segment, the 365-seater Boeing 77-300ER.
Boeing's statements on the results depend in part on the the 777X with its ten seats per row is compared with the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased costs per unit are still lower than currently used machines with ten seats per row.
"Boeing therefore squeezes more seats on his plane to make it more competitive for our products," says Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort in the European Airbus.
On the other hand, say analysts, full cabins with ten seats per row with existing feature indicated that many passengers opted for closer alignment, which could go hand in hand with cheaper air fares.
"Eighteen inches of legroom would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from an economic point of view from the Airbus is controlled by the threat of the 777," said Mary Kirby, an expert on cabin no direction, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing offer no seats, but a catalogue of suppliers, from which the airlines can choose.
The world-travelling jet sellers even tape measure, the establishment of the competition.
Even if they extol the convenience, but all manufacturers also offer jets with hochverdichteter design for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with zehnsitzigen ranks, but has not yet been sold, according to its own account.
Until recently, Airbus has stressed the importance of greater adaptability of the cabin and offered for some jets wide seats in the corridors.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the call for a new industry standard will probably fizzle, but it could distract from the wave of 777X-sales.
