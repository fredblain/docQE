Traffic lights on Dauerrot:
Sometimes it is simply not a traffic light green.
The contact loop in the street does not respond, or the light signal is broken.
What do you do - red?
The affected has waited long enough at a red light and the crossing is free, can he continue, the Stuttgart-based lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "motorcycle."
The waiting time must be "appropriate", which could be interpreted differently from case to case.
Becker advised to stay at least five minutes before a malfunction of the traffic lights.
Those who with the trip despite Rotlichts continues, however, should be aware that the full blame for an accident caused by.
Those who are tolerated less than five minutes, may not wait long enough, warns Becker and points to a decision of the High Court of Hamm.
In the case, had negotiated a driver after about three minutes Dauerrot ignored the traffic lights and had to answer for a negligent breach of red light.
The traffic light was not broken, but later jumped on.
A driving ban was spared because of the particular situation - but not the fine.
