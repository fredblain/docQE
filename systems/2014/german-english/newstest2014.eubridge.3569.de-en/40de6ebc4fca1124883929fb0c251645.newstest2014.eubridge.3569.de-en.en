Rescue package of 325 million Australian dollars for Tasman organic health
The Australian government insists on the harsh conditions that are linked to the rescue package of 325 million Australian dollars for the Tasmanian health care to ensure that the government can not waste the money of the state.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take "immediate measures" to avert a crisis that has been caused by an aging population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic disease and system constraints.
The funding for a period of four years, it was decided after government consultations with Tasmanian Independent MP Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has put together an emergency rescue package that we believe that the unique challenges faced by the federal government," Plibersek said today.
The 325-million-dollar package includes $31 million in emergency aid for election.
Further 2600 operations, including orthopedic surgery and treatments for grey Star, residues are to be eliminated.
In addition, there is money for daily clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better aftercare for inpatient stays, the specialist training, mental health services and the introduction of a system of electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.
"These investments are in line with the ideas that affected clinic staff told me that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system," said Tanya Plibersek.
The minister insisted on strict reporting and accountability of the Tasmanian government.
The state must maintain the current level of funding in order to be able to receive money from the Commonwealth, and monthly report on where the extra money has been spent.
A three-member commission will be set up and is designed to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie said today, the $325 million dollars of little use if "they are not accompanied by real reforms that bring the Tasmanian public health system on a more sustainable course."
Nevertheless, he praised the government for the fact that they have responded to his request for urgent aid, which he first expressed to the prime minister at the beginning of May.
"I am confident that the federal aid will make a major contribution to the public health system in the state of the list of concerns," said Wilkie.
According to the federal government, the state electoral services are largely offset the recent cuts.
But the health spokesman for the opposition at the federal level, Peter Dutton, believes that today's announcement is only a "Band-Aid solution."
"We are in today's situation, because the Labor state government $430 million from the health system," he said on ABC TV.
It is not that a state government almost half a billion dollars from the system and the Commonwealth 300 million and then pretend that the good news.
Dutton called Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package will be spent on additional bureaucracy.
