Veganism is the vegetarianism, differs from this, but in a very significant way.
While vegetarians allow the consumption of cream cake, ice cream or a strong Edam, these feasts are not on the menu of a Veganers.
Milk, cheese, eggs, in addition to the renunciation of meat and fish, the vegan from all consumption of animal products, including honey is denied.
What remains, one might wonder, but on closer inspection, the vegan food world through a considerable ingenuity.
"Sandwich spreads are very popular," said Ute Henkel Mann, the owner of the local reform House, which provides a variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also visited the store in the Domgasse.
For 13 years, the native New Zealanders vegan, he finds in (almost) everything he needs to live. "In 1997, I asked my diet and became a vegetarian."
At the turn of the century, then the next step and I was vegan.
"The conviction came not only because of the diet, but because of the shoe choice," says Proctor, who prefers artificial leather.
He acknowledged that there is no animal products in other everyday concerns.
First and foremost is his vegan ethics.
"I do not want to see animals must die for me," says Proctor, the maxim of vegans, which covers the entire consumer behaviour.
Instead of burgers, hinterherzutrauern scrambled eggs or rubber bears, I have discovered a new products, the enthusiasm.
"It is a double bonus," says Proctor today, "in fact, vegan no surrender, no asceticism, but it is an asset." The assumption that the man with the selection of dining options, Proctor leads on the power of habit.
And it is precisely these conditions could also fail some well-intentioned attempt.
"The addiction is a crucial factor, which leaves many give up quickly, similar to smoking," Proctor is a comparison.
And: "Certain tastes are not on the animal."
It is often the spices or the type of preparation, which make up the taste.
"But you can also produce the same effect in other ways," the vegan.
At a barbecue Proctor, for example, eggplant, mushrooms and a few Vegan sausages.
He is supposed to a balanced and varied diet, the taste.
Of course, you want to have something between the teeth, which is legitimate.
"It should taste, but it is not only to reduce animal food," says Proctor.
Health damage to eating disorders, another widespread assumption that, he had not suffered.
For me, the change has had a positive aspect.
I am no stranger to cholesterol and have a higher vitamin.
There are high-performance athletes who eat vegan exclusively.
"My blood values are well, I am often check," says Proctor.
In particular, the lack of vitamin B12 warn many Vegansimus critics.
"Because animals are fed with feed, rather than graze on pasture, it is questionable whether the meat you buy in the freezer, the vitamin B12 share is high," Proctor.
For vegans, there is also the possibility to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets.
"My B12 values are in order," he says.
Proctor must not go for food procurement.
Finally, there are basic foodstuffs everywhere and every supermarket has soy milk and other products.
Everything I need, I find on the ground.
And I buy something special.
"Many people overlook the fact that it is only the finished products are expensive, but that is the" ordinary "finished products."
In any case, the preparation of our dishes is much cheaper and less time-consuming than is commonly believed.
"In the home kitchen, there is a lot to discover, with a few small tips can be good, if not better results," says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbon dioxide instead of egg, with its vegan cheesecake Proctor could also bring his in-laws.
Family firm of the vegan gives a new condiment.
This dynamic, when you cook together, has a new significance.
"The situations that can arise are as diverse as the people themselves," says Proctor.
He was, of course, but also scepticism.
You enjoy my food?
"I feel bad because I drank milk?" - of this kind must be as vegans with tact.
"I do not reject people, yes, I am part of this society," Proctor would not enclaves.
And the everyday world seems to be not so vegan as - and not the in everyday life, as is commonly believed.
Even fast food is allowed.
There are everywhere!
"Many Döner offer falafel, or a vegetarian Yufka," says Proctor.
In a pizzeria he differs on pasta dishes, or a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit.
The restaurants are so slow.
"When I started 13 years ago, vegan to feed me, everything was much more difficult," the New Zealanders can find a development: "You must talk to the people, they."
"If enough, they may be inclined to supplement the menu," he hopes.
Vegan restaurants develop, such as the galley in Mannheim or café bird free.
Proctor has the desire that other restaurants have at least one vegan dish on the menu.
Basically, vegan dishes for everyone.
Everyone can eat them, so they are exactly the opposite of.
"Meat dishes are exclusive, and in the truest sense of the word, because they are different from," says Proctor.
"If you want to avoid food scandals, veganism is a safe way, from the outset," says Proctor.
But the shopping veganer products can be a little difficult at the beginning.
Especially when you learn to understand that the additives in animal peanuts as color donors can leave seems to comply with the ethics with so many hurdles and traps quickly.
Not only have Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen wrote a book: "Veganissimo - animal ingredients and their alternatives," explains the many ingredients, but the food is also.
"Gradually developed a scanner and knows the signs and logos," it is sometimes better to do than small steps to stop or to stumble, "says Proctor.
The vegan, he is an important moral signal, to raise awareness.
Perhaps he can't quite that playing his habits, but at least he can teach consumers to question his habits.
