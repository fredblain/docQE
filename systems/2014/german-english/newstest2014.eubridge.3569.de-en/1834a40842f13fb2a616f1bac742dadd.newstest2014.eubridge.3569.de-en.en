Pope Francis appoints first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will be for the first time on 22 February appointed new cardinals of the Catholic Church, the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the most senior cleric in the Catholic church after the Pope and they are also to elect a pope, Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the choice of his successor.
Currently, there are 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached the age of 80 years, no longer take part in the papal election - which is a group of 120 "".
In a statement, in which the news was announced, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman said, there will be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony will be held on the appointment of the new cardinals, which is also known as a consistory.
"Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision on the convening of the in February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from around the world can be planned," said Lombardi.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices, said that the number of voting cardinals will probably be dropped until February.
He explained that a pope usually take so many cardinals as necessary, so that the number of voting cardinals 120, and so many cardinals over 80, as he would like.
The consistory next year is so important because it was the first since the election of Francis in March of this year, Valero.
Currently, there is some overhang on the part of Europe, and especially in Italy.
"It will be interesting to see whether the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world, in order to restore the balance," he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
The Cardinals will also be the first to be appointed since the formation of the Council of Cardinals founded by Francis, a group of eight cardinals from around the world who have the mandate to find ways to reform the church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.
"Francis has selected eight cardinals who will help him," said Valero.
He explained that it was "quite possible" that the Cardinals Francis ask for advice.
But so far we have not been in this situation - that is all very new.
Valero said that typically the bishops from great places to Cardinals, but Francis was "full of surprises, so we do not know whom he appoints."
