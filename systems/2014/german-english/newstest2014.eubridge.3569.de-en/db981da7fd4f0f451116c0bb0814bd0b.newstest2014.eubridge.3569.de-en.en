Löffingen: Köpfler still single candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the Baar town Löffingen with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a pioneering school, children, youth and senior policy, can be described as well as its own city works as an attractive city, has not yet a second mayoral candidate.
As the only candidate for the succession of for reasons of age no longer ran mayor Norbert Brugger is so far the 46-year-old bank clerk and business manager Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen.
The application deadline expires on Monday, November 11, at 18 pm.
