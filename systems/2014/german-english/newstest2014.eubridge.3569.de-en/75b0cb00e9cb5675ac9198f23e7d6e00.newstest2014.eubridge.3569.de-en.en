Council takes tracks targeted
The railway crossing "Hirschen" to improve road safety?
Yes, the local councils have decided.
Schiltach must take for 220 000 euros.
Deutsche Bahn wants to improve in the coming year, the Kinzigtal-rail route.
In particular, to increase the safety at railway crossings - it is regularly nationwide to collisions of trains with other vehicles.
The communities, they need to be involved with one third of the cost, the rest divided and.
Schiltachs city architect Roland Grießhaber explained to the specifics of the council Bahübergangs "."
There, the city plans to build the tunnel mouth west of the railway tracks a bulge.
There could also carry bigger cars, for example, those carrying logs, oncoming traffic, without blocking the tracks.
Grießhaber therefore proposed to construct a necessary supporting wall so that the city could widen the subsequent street at the time, in order to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This has been controversial in the municipal council, as some councils, the need for road expansion in doubt: Thomas Kipp, saying the mood of the critics: "We have to because so few vehicles so much money?"
Mayor Thomas Haas disagreed: The railway crossing "Hirschen will regularly used for.
Even wood from the area "Kuhbach" will be transported via this route, because up to 20 metres long vehicles could not use the route to the Häberlesbrücke there, because they could not turn on the main street.
In addition, the route serves as a diversion for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is blocked, Haas argued.

The investigation concluded that it is that the tendency of the road conditions could lead to longer vehicles.
Responsibility for this, in turn, the city as a.
The reconstruction could take liability disputes.
Since both the wood collection and turning in the current state of development, we should not support the reconstruction of the railway crossing, Haas argued.
It is also the risk of a collision of with a vehicle on the transition of significantly lower than the other railroad crossings, because the in the middle, which is a good view.
Even trains from the main railway station should be slowed down at this point as far as that no collision.
The approval was the reconstruction of the railway crossing refused because the city Schiltach "the problem with aufsitzenden vehicles" would have to pay, the councils, as, as the train after the construction of the responsibility.
As the panel considers the conversions at railway crossings "Heubach" and "Kuhbach," have already been made for the arrangements with the.
