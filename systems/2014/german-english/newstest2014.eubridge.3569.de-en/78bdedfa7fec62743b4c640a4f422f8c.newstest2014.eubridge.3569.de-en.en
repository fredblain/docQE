Vienna International Airport creates passenger calls
Mr Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
Announcements like this in the future it will be at Vienna's Schwechat airport, no longer exist.
A large part of the speakers are eliminated - the noise level should be significantly reduced.
To create a more relaxed atmosphere, is the aim of this change.
As Airport spokesman Peter Kleemann towards Radio Vienna, follows the Vienna International Airport with the recruitment of announcements concerning individuals, an international trend.
So, among other things, the airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai already in the noisy calls.
The disappearance of these announcements by, on average, around 200 personal calls through the speakers - there is going to be a day at the airport.
"It has also been shown in the experience that these individual announcements were perceived relatively little, but at the same time, all the other information to change flight or departure times here a little bit," said Kleemann in conversation with the radio station.
