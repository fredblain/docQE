Ben Greenman: Ten years New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
You could say that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: Nearly a hundred years ago began the artist Frank Fay, who worked as a Starboys at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, so that, to tell the crowd jokes in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, the Fays innovation, as most recently at the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and directed by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the stand-up institution Caro Lines, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year with more than sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters.
"Most of these headliner began at Caroline's and were always successful, until they were known to act in a club," said Hirsch.
We have designed this festival, so that we can continue to work with them.
This year's event, there are appearances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as of "Stand Up for Heroes," an annual music and comedy fundraising event for army veterans at Madison Square Garden, among other things, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
With the festival is also the world of comedy.
A number of comedians who participate in the festival this year, have become more unconventional ways, such as broadcasts on smaller television channels like Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll was known as a sitcom in the cable TV (ironically schl√ºpfrige fantasy football series "the League" on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was both "Saturday Night Live" and "parks and Recreation" part of the occupation, although she is best known for their viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On."
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, ironic, focused on racial issues W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
The largest visitor attraction of the festival is an interview: David Steinberg speaks with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but has developed into a prestigious television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a television programme entitled "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" in TV land.
The meeting will take place in the middle of the Town Hall in Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry's entire work," said Steinberg.
He told me that if he is here, he sometimes through the alley between two buildings and thinks: Hey, if I lose all my money, then maybe I live here.
