Coulson, phone-hacking for checking a tips
The former News of the Word-editor Andy Coulson was supposedly "phone-hacking, monitoring and confrontation" in an attempt to confirm a false tip about an affair of the then Home Secretary Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the court at the Old Bailey, the News of the World heard in May 2005 a false rumor that Clarke had a relationship with his "attractive special adviser" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper commissioned the private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlbys voice mails, and pursued them, but Coulson called and left messages, such as the court was told.
"According to the public prosecutor's office is Coulson, who is now editor of the NotW, no one who stands in front of the apartment of people and hopes to catch them red-handed, but one that people are faced with a history to see their reaction," said Edis.
He said that NotW use three methods to investigate stories citizen investigators: Phone hacking, monitoring and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows of the second, the, it cannot be.
What about the first?
He knows about the phone-hacking?
He denies that, but we say: "And whether he knew about it."
Rumors of an affair Clarke's first feature of the editors of NotW, as a source that was sexually interested in Pawlby, said: "Do not waste your time, it is with Charles."
A band with voice mail from their phone at least three occasions in Mulcaires apartment in August 2006.
The investigators also found entries on the computer of the detective on the Pawlby and her sister were stored as "projects".
At the time the searches were the grandparents of Pawlby anonymous calls in which they were asked for information about them, said Edis.
Meanwhile, the former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup monitoring the movements of Pawlby.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left a voicemail with the following content: "I have a story that we want to bring out tomorrow, I would like to talk with Charles."
Edis said Coulsons activities in this story followed the same pattern as with other important personalities, the former Home Secretary David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett was due to an affair with a married woman, when he was with the co-accused Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks argue to have conspired with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted the phone-hacking.
