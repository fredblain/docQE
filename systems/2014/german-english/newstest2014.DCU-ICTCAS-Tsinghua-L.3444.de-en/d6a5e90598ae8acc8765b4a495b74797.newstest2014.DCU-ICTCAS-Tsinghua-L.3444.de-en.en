Security concerns grow in Mozambique because of clashes between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputos under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder and first president of Mozambique, in a rare public demonstration commemorating the call for peace.
"We want peace, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, managing director of an investment company.
Fear for the future of the country, it has its business attire for a T-shirt with the inscription "We demand security" traded in Portuguese, and on Thursday the crowd in Independence Square in the capital.
For two weeks, there are almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and RENAMO, which is one of the worst battles since the peace agreement, over 20 years ago.
It was once a notorious rebel movement RENAMO, which was initially ruled from White Rhodesia, and later the apartheid government of South Africa, in an effort to support the independent government to destabilise the country.
After the peace agreement of 1992, it has become an opposition party.
Analysts consider it unlikely that the country back into a full-scale conflict back the case, but recent events have alarmed foreign investors and locals.
For the rapidly growing economy is a lot at stake, since the discovery of huge gas reserves off the coast and coal camps in the northwest over the next few years, could investment of over 50 billion dollars from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the US into the country.
The ruling Frelimo-Partei, the dominant force since 1975, and RENAMO are blaming each other for the tensions.
RENAMO claims that the Government had provoked the recent clashes, on October 17, by its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold of Renamos, attacked.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated when government forces attacked Renamo-Stützpunkte and tried to kill, Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the group, said Renamos spokesman to the Financial Times.
The government is RENAMO blamed for the clashes and accuses the organization, soldiers attacked.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to downplay concerns about instability.
With AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama regard themselves as "losers" who "all his remaining forces, in order to prove that he can impose on the government's decisions."
Both Frelimo and RENAMO to stress that they want to avoid a war.
But the concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted as saying that the peace agreement of 1992 RENAMO.
Compared to the FT, he said that he had said that the agreement was no longer Frelimo.
"Our vision is to resume negotiations and it seriously," said Mazanga.
Previous talks between the parties have not helped to resolve the tensions caused by a series of clashes this year have been fired.
"Here we have two adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama), who heads collide," says Joseph'Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and Mosambik-Experte.
None of them is good in bargaining and no one is prepared to make the necessary concessions.
RENAMO, which is pushing for electoral reform, has already stated that it will boycott the elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year.
Some commentators have the use of violence as an attempt to ailing movement interpreted, concessions and financial benefits from the government.
Shrink Renamos electoral success since 1992, during a recent party, which was founded by a former Renamo-Mitglied Movimento respectively de Moçambique (MDM), is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga said that Guebuza - whose resignation when his second term ends next year, the democracy of the country.
"He does not want a multi-party democracy, he does not want a transparent elections, he does not want peace, because he does not want to give up the presidency," says Mazanga.
It is unclear what capacity RENAMO, but it has been disruptive attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south links.
Most of the fighting took place in the province of Sofala, a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo, Beira, however, the port, the mining companies like Rio Tinto and Vale for the export of coal.
In June, Rio a month suspended the use of the railways after RENAMO is an attack on the track.
Mazanga responded cautiously to the question of whether RENAMO will repeat that threat.
"RENAMO wanted to warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique," said Mazanga.
The instability have increased frustration with the government, says Fernando Lima, Head of Media Coop, an independent media company, because many people were already due to corruption and the slow progress in the development and a recent kidnapping wave.
"People think that the government and the President for the future of the country and he should be, the solutions to the problems," he says.
Omar sultans, a demonstrator, said, the people just wanted stability.
"No wonder RENAMO and Frelimo, they just want to restore peace and usable roads," he said.
