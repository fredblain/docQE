The TSV Morsum after six matches still without any point in the handball Association League.
Right now, it is for the team of Ingo Ehlers tomorrow for Derby against TSV Dave authorities, who last weekend celebrated his first victory.
With this game starts the season for us.
"I hope that we will finally have the head," Ehlers cautiously optimistic.
He has finally, with the exception of the long-term injured Hendrik Blohme, his full squad available.
Also, Dave would like us to play.
Therefore, we must keep our error rate low.
First and foremost, it is important, however, we need to increase the coverage of the last anything other than a safe.
Clearly relaxed is Daverdens Coach Thomas Panitz after the first win of the season against North Horn.
The game was of course a number.
But we are still a long way from the favorite, because everything can happen in the Derby.
However, now wants to tighten Panitz activities in order to start a series.
Jan-Malte Jodat will be missing.
It celebrates the A-Jugendliche Joost Windßuß, the double game right at the A-Jugend-Bundesligisten HC Bremen in his season debut.
If a game is not hot, should remain at home.
