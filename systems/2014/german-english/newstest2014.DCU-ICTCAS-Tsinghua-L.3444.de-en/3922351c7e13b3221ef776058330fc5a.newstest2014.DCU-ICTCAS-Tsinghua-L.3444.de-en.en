Halloween 2013: In numbers
When I was small, Halloween something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, stay late and for the neighborhood.
Today, I am rather to Halloween-Muffel.
In the last two years, I have not, from my apartment to distribute sweets, and will not do so again this year.
But, according to the statistics, I am a black sheep, and Halloween.
The majority of Americans - 158 million, to be precise - celebrate Halloween this year, and a total of $6.9 billion for candy, costumes and decorations, the American Association of retailers (industry).
One thing on which I am, then every Halloween, the trend values.
The costumes are approximately 1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the industry.
This year, the provocative Kinsey.
Women must no longer remain in sexy clothes, they can now also tempting food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
What men are concerned, I expect a lot of zombies, thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daft-Punk-Weltraumm√§nner will create the Instagram-Feeds this year.
According to Google, the most sought-after costumes zombies, witches and pirates.
I suspect that there is nothing wrong with tradition.
Last year, we had our dogs and to my astonishment is not alone.
In fact, Americans 330 million dollars this year for costumes of their pets, so the industry.
There are a lot of "Hot Dogs."
What candy is concerned, we are not squeamish.
This year, Americans will spend $1.9 billion, according to The Nielsen Company.
About 270 million kilograms of chocolate bars, lollipops, candy and gum.
So, good news for the Department to 41 million people, with the slogan "trick or treating" through the quarter.
In fact, we are more than 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween buy and - let us not deceive ourselves - eat.
The only thing we do not want to consume, the sugar-sweet Candy Corn; nevertheless, 15 million kilograms of them sold for Halloween, according to the National Association of confectionery manufacturer.
About nine billion grains of corn.
It is a mystery that I still could not solve.
Nothing is more on Halloween than houses where there are haunting.
You have great names like "Terror Behind the Walls" (which, incidentally, is in a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock."
There are 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States, the 500 million dollar proceeds, America, and that includes the wonderful photos, on which we are in the Commons and then friends on Facebook, where you do not get rid of them again, and then the guy that, a comment like "nice facial expression."
But, finally, we come to the tariff.
Charlie Brown, familiar with the Great pumpkin, when we were children, and the carving a pumpkin lantern is like decorating the Christmas tree - something that we have made from a very young age.
Fortunately, the "baby in the pumpkin" -Trend only last year, thanks to a tavern and rest, so that most of us grew up, the pumpkin zurechtzuschnitzen and not to sit in it.
This year, Americans will be approximately 106 million dollars for pumpkins, according to the US Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lantern, slowly rotting in the garden probably comes from Illinois, where this year were harvested 245 million kilograms of pumpkins.
If you want to score points right, please call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and carve you convert their 921 kg pumpkin.
