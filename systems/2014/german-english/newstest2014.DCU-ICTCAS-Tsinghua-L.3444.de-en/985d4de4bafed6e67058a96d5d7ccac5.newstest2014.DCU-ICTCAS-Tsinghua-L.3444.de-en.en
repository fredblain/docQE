The newly designed Opschlag shines with a new cafe.
One that invites you to linger and hotel.
One, which is the name of the program.
As Déjà Vu is a psychological phenomenon, according to the dictionary, in a sense, a new situation has already have seen or experienced.
In the case of the visit of the cafés on Opschlag in the district town entirely within sight of the Hochschule Rhine-Waal must not remain simply déjà Vu-Gefühl.
Finally, the café with the wonderful name precisely that: A real vacation, not only mental but always says repeatedly.
Because it's fun and easy.
A look into the inner workings of the Opschlag 8 gives the viewer on a good feeling.
The state-of-the-art, but not cool Café-Ambiente looks like a place to feel good.
Here, the team with the founders Mirjam van der secures and Daniel Büttner, at the top of the guest with a coffee or cocktail.
It's delicious cakes or individually, fresh baguettes.
The owner, both 33 years old, have already before the opening of the pretty cafés on Opschlag made a name as restaurateurs: The Kranenburg, "Art Lounge."
The move in the hope the likeable Café-Liebhaber Opschlag more audience.
Not least by the university.
"We have no specific target," said Dan Buettner.
It would like to raise two young students as well as seniors and all ages in between.
Speaking of Café-Liebhaber.
The friendly owner couple is behind the coffee enjoyment.
Enjoy the fragrant hot brew in different variations.
Expressofan
Dan Buettner is the Expresso fan and Mirjam van der secures the Cappuccino-Trinkerin.
"A baguette - this is my thing," she tells the NRZ.
Two events were already in the bright café.
Rather one.
Because the sea is more took place outside - the Café Déjà Vu benefited not.
But there was also the stripy Natz evening.
"Beautiful, successful and funny," found the two 33 years old.
But not public thing.
Perhaps Daniel Büttner also no great fan of event nights: "You can of course not all right."
And I always speak with an event only, for the special event.
This event will be the exception rather be with us.
"We want the normal operation of as little as possible."
Should read: Déjà Vu also stands for reliability.
In relation to the quality of the products offered here, as well as on the team and the beautiful surroundings on Opschlag in entirely.
The road, which is more and more a gastronomy mile.
To the delight of many Klever, the guests from near and far, and the students, the gastro mile and the café Déjà Vu.
