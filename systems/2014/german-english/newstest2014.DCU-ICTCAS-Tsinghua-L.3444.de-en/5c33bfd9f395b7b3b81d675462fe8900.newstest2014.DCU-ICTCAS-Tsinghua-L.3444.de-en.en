Scientists were able to shed more light on the context in which the tail is wagging the dog with his mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs with the cock stretched more to the right (from the point of view of the dog), while the left side was nervous dogs.
But now, scientists say that other dogs perceive these subtle differences and be able to respond.
Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: "When people are well aware that the left and right brain hemisphere respond differently to stimuli, causing the positive or negative emotions."
Here we have tried to look at this in other species.
He also noticed that dogs, like humans, the speech for the movement of the left side was responsible and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings.
To learn more about how dogs on the side of the tail is wagging their brethren, the researchers monitored the animals, while these films of other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the dog and analysed the behaviour.
Probably we will soon understand why the tail in one, in the other direction.
Professor Vallortigara said: "We have shown the dogs movies with dogs - either a lifelike version or a silhouette, in order to eliminate distracting other aspects, and we were able to make the movement of the tail more control to the left or to the right."
When they saw how an otherwise expression of loose dog the tail has moved to the right (from the perspective of the fronds of dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But was the tail tilt to the left (again, from the perspective of the dog, the wags), your heart rate rose and they saw restless.
In the opinion of Professor Vallortigara, the dogs were not deliberately communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he is convinced that the dogs had learnt from experience, in which movements they worry if and when they are not.
He said: "If you have several encounters with other dogs and the Wedeln with the cock in one direction rather with friendly behaviour and the right side is a less friendly behaviour, then it is on the basis of this experience."
The researchers say that the findings of dog owners, veterinarians and trainers to a better understanding of the emotions of their animal could help.
John Bradshaw, an expert on dog behavior and Visiting Fellow at the Faculty of animal husbandry at the University of Bristol, said that this is not the first study, which has been investigated, whether on the left and right is important for dogs.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln that dogs turn your head to the left, if they see an aggressive dog, and to the right, if it is a happy dog.
In another research at the University of Victoria in Canada, said the following: "Dogs tend to go on, if a robot dog, tail wag" on the left and the right, rather than the other way around years - than in the Italian study. "
According to his statement could stir the differences so that the dogs in the various studies the animals in the films or the robot dogs are not as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs, could help, he said.
"Although there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that both halves to be used for different purposes, but many of the details still need to be determined - and dogs are no exception," said Bradshaw.
But simply because their behaviour record, it will probably not be long before we understand why the tail sometimes in one, sometimes in the other direction.
