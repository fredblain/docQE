Pope Francis appoints first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will for the first time on February 22 new cardinals of the Catholic Church, the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the most senior clerics in the Catholic Church after Pope and they are the ones who choose a pope, Francis to appoint the first group of men, which will ultimately participate in the choice of his successor.
Currently there are 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who reached the age of 80 years ago, is no longer take part in the papal election - this is a group of 120 "eligible cardinals."
In a statement, in which the news was announced, said Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, there will be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony on the appointment of the new cardinals will be held, also known as a consistory.
"Pope Francis has decided that its decision to convene the children in February to announce in advance, so that other meetings, the participation of the cardinals from around the world, can be planned," said Lombardi.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices, said that the number of eligible cardinals will probably be dropped until February.
He said that a pope those normally so many cardinals as necessary, so that the number of eligible cardinals 120 measured again, and so many cardinals over 80, as he would like.
The consistory next year is significant because it is the first since the election of Francis in March this year, Valero.
There are currently some overhang on the part of Europe, especially Italy.
"It will be interesting to see whether the new pope cardinals from the rest of the world will appoint to restore the balance," he said.
Forty per cent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
The Cardinals will also be the first since the formation of the Council of Cardinals, founded by Francis, a group of eight cardinals from around the world, responsible ways to reform the church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.
"Now that Francis has selected eight cardinals to help him," said Valero.
He said that it was "quite possible" that the Cardinals Francis for advice.
But so far we have not been in this situation - this is all very new.
Valero said that typically the bishops from great places to cardinals were appointed, but Francis is "full of surprises, so we do not know who he appoints."
