Fancy ice cream, which glows in the dark?
A British businessman has the first glow in the dark ice - with the help of jellyfish.
Charlie Francis, the fluorescent properties of marine life and created a luminous infinity.
The idea came to him after he had read a research study on jellyfish and Chinese scientists could convince the protein artificially.
The ice cream eating reacts with the tongue, thus raising the pH of the protein and the lights.
Chris said, the ice cream would agree to the heat in the mouth and lights - the more you licks, the brighter it will.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I'm Delicious," says: "The product is unbelievable, but it is still at a very early stage of production, and so you get two grams for 200 pounds."
The ice cream protein reacts with the tongue in a neutral pH.
If the mouth of the protein, the pH and the ice.
We have tested it in the last few months, and it seemed to us to be perfect, on Halloween, because it has this wonderful Leuchteffekt.
It is probably the most expensive ice cream, which I have ever produced, because the jellyfish fluorescent is four times more expensive than gold.
Every ball cost me about 140 pounds.
But it tastes delicious.
Char read experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavors, including beer, cheese, beef and gold.
But his latest creation should be more ambitious.
He says: "I would like to develop an invisible ice cream."
This is impossible because of the atmosphere, which is caused by the ice crystals of ice cream, but I suspect that we will find a way to create it.
The ice cream uses fluorescent properties of a jellyfish, which are manufactured by Chinese scientists artificially
