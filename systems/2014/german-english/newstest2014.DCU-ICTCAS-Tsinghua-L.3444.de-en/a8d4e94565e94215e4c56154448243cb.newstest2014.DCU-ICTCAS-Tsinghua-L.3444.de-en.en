Egypt's first freely elected president sworn in
Mohamed Morsi will be sworn in, but the triumph of the day may not be the end of political disputes in Egypt.
The Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a "new Egypt" as he became the first freely elected president of the country has been sworn in and the succession of Latvian, the 16 months earlier had been driven out of office.
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi was also the first freely elected Islamist president in the Arab world, and Egypt's fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He presented the oath before the 18 dressed in black robes, the judges of the court, which has its headquarters on the Nile and an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We aspire to a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic," Morsi said at the ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.
"Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundations for a new life - absolute freedom, a genuine democracy and stability," said Morsi, 60 years in the United States, a trained engineer and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that, since its founding in 84 years mostly as a banned organisation of the respective government sharply had been targeted.
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building, as Morsi shortly after 11 a.m. local time in a small car convoy arrived.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered in front of the court, the new president zuzujubeln, and unlike the presidential pomp from the Mubarak era, the traffic was stopped for a short time, so that the car convoy was able to cross the busy street in the city centre, with the southern suburbs.
As uncharismatisches "spare" the Brotherhood derided his personal prestige since his victory and a Friday speech, in which he not only as a candidate of the Islamists, but all those who presented the aspirations of the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubarak to your destination.
"Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," said in a blue suit with a red tie Morsi dressed the judges in the wood-panelled chamber, in which he was sworn in.
Later, Morsi went to the University of Cairo, where he should keep his inaugural speech.
He was officially welcomed by an army band played the national anthem, which he listened in Habachtstellung.
The military's Field was present.
On his arrival, he was of hundreds of people in the main auditorium of the university with a chant of "The army and the people are one hand."
In 1908 as a bastion of secular education, University of Cairo, built in the 1970s, has become a stronghold of Islamist groups of students.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in the Tahir-Platz, the birthplace of the uprising last year to the end of the authoritarian rule of Mubarak, and vowed to reclaim presidential powers, by the turn of the head of state.
But with the passing of the official oath before the court and not, rather than before Parliament as is customary, he is bowing to the wishes of the military, which shows that the power struggle will continue.
The speech at the Tahir-Platz was full of dramatic populist gestures.
