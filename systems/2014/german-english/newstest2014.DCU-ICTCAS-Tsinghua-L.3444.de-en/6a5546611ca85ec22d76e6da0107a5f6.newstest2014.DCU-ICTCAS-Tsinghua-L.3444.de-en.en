Live with good prospects
Waltraud Ries is fantastic.
Her house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with a lot of green, an old trees, nice neighbours, and not too much traffic.
In the city, there are only a few minutes by public transportation.
"I hope you have no fear of spiders?" Asks Waltraud Ries and shows a big spider at the door.
I'm looking for some time, a new apartment for my husband and me.
But you know how difficult it is in Stuttgart.
The reason is, however, no spider phobia, but the concern, at the age of the many steps to the house and in the apartment is no longer able to cope, she says.
In addition, since one of the fifty Erin Meniskus-Operation has experienced what it means to deal with a handicap from floor to floor.
Recently she published a book on the subject of 'the tender age - What living form is the best for me?'.
"Our apartment is the best example of what the age is not the issue, it begins to tell.
As more than 20 years ago with her husband in the duplex apartment, it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green.
Today, with the middle 50 Waltraud Ries thinks otherwise.
You also know that it is one of the few people who could, with the theme 'living in old age'.
Most of the crowd out there, as long as it is.
Old only the other ', says she humorous.
Only when the suffering is really great, we will do.
"Then it may be too late," '.
In her book, the interior designer 17 living models for a self-determined housing in old age.
'What living form you choose, however, is always an individual decision, "she explains.
D i e solution, it does not give the age.
Even if the residency in Tuscany or Brittany could afford should always consider that he could be ill.
And: 'Without a good knowledge of the language of the club is also playing in the Dolce Vita, "the specialist book author relocation candidates in mind.
Under their models are classic care models, alternative forms of housing, or the often quoted Rentner-WG.
In old age, everyone has his tics and quirks
'For me would be nothing but a residents', says with a wink.
Certainly not like in a student house with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
"At the age you just need his retreat," says Ries.
A senior living community can still work, the author, however, cannot be ruled out.
But then it differently than in the classic Studenten-WG.
And sometimes you just want to only his rest ', she believes.
With this view, at least in the capital, it is not alone.
"Most old people want in Stuttgart, as long as it is in their own home, is also the experience of Theresa RÃ¼tten, the head of the civil service life in the age of the provincial capital.
The department advises people around the theme of 'age'.
Therefore, especially elderly people would often inconveniences and restrictions, just to stay in their familiar surroundings, this is also the experience of the Stiftung Warentest.
There are many possibilities, the house or apartment buildings.
Ries recommends all who deal with age appropriate rebuilding their house or apartment, only to be properly informed and not the best craftsmen.
Today, there is also the age appropriate restructuring specialists.
Even in the apartment is one or the other, and if it is only increasing the toilet seat, clarifies the interior designer.
But not always, the existing apartment age and thus transform accessible, even if they are so beautiful.
This experience was Waltraud Ries.
Although we could install a chair inside the apartment, with stairs paved path to the front door but it would be a much bigger obstacle.
It will proceed to the ideal property for herself and her husband.
Before the move horrified her more than before the spider on her front door.
