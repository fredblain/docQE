A black box in the car?
American road planners are looking for a source of money to the decaying highway system repair, and believe the solution in a small black box to the dashboard of the car.
The devices, which each mileage record and report the information to the authorities, are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the agencies of the federal states, the outdated system for financing American roads.
The normally rather boring field of road planning suddenly has an intense debate with colourful alliances.
Libertarian have allied with environmental groups and support for the government of the small boxes for recording the mileage - and possibly even where they were driven - and then use the information for the calculation of tax modest.
The Tea Party is horrified.
The American Civil Liberties Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and a series of data protection issues.
But while in Congress could not agree on an approach, several states wait no longer.
You are currently examining how it over the next ten years to move to a system in which drivers pay per mile travelled.
Thousands of drivers have a tachograph, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring, have already been tested.
This really is a must for our country.
"There is nothing that we may use only," said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Assn. of governments, which is a record of driving miles on all California motorists in the state in 2025.
The way in which we pay these taxes will change.
The technology is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is financed from taxation, the Americans pay at the pump, broke.
But in America will no longer needs as much as before.
Cars that consume less fuel.
The state fuel tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 euro cents per litre) has not increased in 20 years.
Politicians do not dare to high fuel prices, the tax by a penny.
"The economy is simply not sustainable," says Lee Munnich, an expert on transport legislation at the University of Minnesota.
His state has recently 500 cars equipped with a black box, with which a miles based payment system to be tested.
"This is the best option in the long term," he said.
Bureaucrats call it miles based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea of urban liberals, because the tax could be used, for example, the way to reduce congestion and greenhouse gases.
The Californian designers rely on the system for the preparation of strategies with which the ambitious, legally binding objectives of the state of climate change are to be achieved.
But the Republican Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also stated that he is the most viable long-term alternative.
The free marketer of the Reason Foundation are fond of the idea, drivers pay according to a pre-arranged route.
"This is not a tax, which disappear into a black hole," said Adrian Moore, vice president for policy at the Reason.
The people directly pay for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former American ministers who, in a report in 2011 had urged Congress to move towards miles based billing.
Last year, the Senate approved a $90 million expensive pilot project, which includes 10,000 cars.
But the majority in the House of Representatives hindered the thrust and thereby responded to the concerns of Members from rural areas represent the people who, on a daily basis, often many miles on the way to work or have to travel into the city.
Several states and cities move nonetheless, on his own initiative in this direction.
The most active forum is Oregon, which currently 5,000 driver for the country's largest experiment being recruited.
This will soon be the mileage fees instead of paying tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City also is considering such a.
It is testing ziibi limited with trucks.
And the I-95-Koalition, the departments of 17 states on the East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently examining how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where recently 50 volunteers were fitted with the devices, motorists were sceptical of the idea that the government could track their movements.
"Concerns about Big Brother and such things were a big problem," explains Alauddin Khan, head of strategy and product management at the Department of Transportation of Nevada.
People wanted to do it.
When the trial started, warned the ACLU of Nevada on their website: "It would be relatively easy, the tachograph to turn adult monitoring devices."
There is no need for a huge, bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used, data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of states, which are now looking for affordable technology, with which the state can collect the mileage, but not exactly when and where.
So, as Khan, would also be confident the public.
The pursuit of this technology has some authorities to a small start-up company called True Mileage in California.
The company is not originally for states in the field of taxation on motorists to help.
Rather, it was their aim, in an emerging market for car insurance, in which drivers pay based on miles driven.
But the devices are tested for the road planners are interesting because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information regularly via modem.
"People are more willing to participate if their speed and location not be recorded," said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
In some of these public pilot programmes were made big mistakes.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement it.
In Oregon, the planners that motorists are experimenting with a number of choices.
You can opt for a device with or without GPS.
Or they take absolutely no device and instead pay a flat rate based on the average of all the inhabitants of the state driven miles.
Others hope to sell the concept of a suspicious public to equip devices with more functions than with little.
In New York City, transport officials want to develop a device for taxation, which is also pay parking, insurance only for driving distances must be paid and speed data from other vehicles in real time, thanks to which drivers can avoid traffic jams.
"Motorists with the added value of the benefits the system offers, motivated to participate," says a planning document of the city.
Some traffic planners wonder, however, whether all the talk about the pay per mile is not just a huge red herring.
The Metropolitan Transportation Commission on the territory of the San Francisco Bay, officials said, Congress, the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by increasing the tax on fuel.
An additional fee or an annual tax could motorists with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume less fuel, so that they pay a fair share.
"There is no reason for an operation, but is also an aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, the head of the Commission's legislative and public affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists worry about their privacy, and many other things.
