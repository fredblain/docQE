A cry of despair Obama-WÃ¤hlers
I have twice elected President Obama in the hope that change is possible
He says that Obama has the laudable efforts of the blocking tactics by Republicans had been thwarted
The policy does not apologise Website-Probleme of blood, the drone attacks
Obama's memoir on the election campaign of 2008 are a sad reminder of what might have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student in the second year at Harvard Medical School.
I read a terribly sad book.
It is a book of which I have believed that it would be sad to me during the second year of my medical degree wit and give me hope.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" (courage) and depicts the memoirs of Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election.
In the evening, when I finished with my patients record and go to bed, then this book brings me back to a time when the policy inspired millions and speeches will take your breath away.
The election was a landslide and for adults, spokesman for the historic importance of this moment.
My classmates wept with joy and my parents collected all the newspapers.
A young team of visionaries was on her way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama went into office in 2008, he had approval values of 82%.
And then I close the book.
Switch back to the present is a rude awakening, as if from a dream.
It is hard to remember these optimistic times - they seem to be a faint memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I made my voice for the first time, really has changed.
But it's just not what I imagined.
I recognise the great and versatile things that Obama has achieved by the adoption of the burden for health insurance until the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced concealment of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I, too, am of the opinion that the political block too many efforts have overturned, with which our nation forward: Immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closing of Guantanamo Bay, to name just a few.
But after countless times the Obama administration to colleagues and friends, I am trying my statement at the end.
I have reached a point of political desperation.
The Republican blocking tactics cannot explain why it allows the interception of foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas.
It does not explain why the National Security Agency data about the private lives of Americans collect and why whistleblowers should be punished, disclose wrongdoing.
It does not explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, was killed without trial, nor why the public financing and spending limits during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the findings of a report, which states that the efforts of the White House to keep the media are the "most aggressive... since the Nixon administration."
And did it cannot excuse the failure, in the more than three years since the passage of the Affordable Care Act to create a simple Web site.
I do not know whether this is what I would have expected.
If I had to understand that the government of the previous political campaigns could disagree.
Obviously, the Abgeordnetenamt no predictable course, as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown-Massaker shape the public debate.
But when I look at the above examples, then they seem largely by the government itself to be elected.
And that bothers me the most.
I have chosen Obama again in 2012, not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and half-baked alternative, he seemed to define its direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfil the hope that we have heard for so long.
But with a decline in the ratings for Obama to below 45% this week is a return to 2008 through this book to become even harder.
It makes me the longing for the many promises that have vanished into thin air.
This week I read a section in the book, which describes how Obama a heavy loss against Clinton in the primaries in Pennsylvania.
In a meeting with the electoral agents after the decision, he told his staff, they have to come back on track and the purpose of their cause.
"I want us to find the magic," he said.
We have to remember who we are.
There are five years later, Mr. President, and I could not agree with you more.
