Europe's elite is prepared to do business with the UK?
Business for Britain was launched in April, with the intention of the economy, to bring to the table and to define what those in Britain for prosperity and work, in our relations with the EU.
To this end, we have the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders and asked them what they are about Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov interviewed over 1,000 business leaders, the British companies, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exported outside Europe and focused on countries to modernise and grow, while states in the EU will stagnate.
They want the government to new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil are promoted, instead of dealing with the long and arduous process, to reform the obscure institutions.
Asked for their opinion on certain legal issues - from fair trading legislation to product legislation - the majority of business leaders think that control over the key competences should be returned to Westminster.
There was a general dissatisfaction with the internal market, since according to the company, the cost of the Brussels rules now would outweigh the advantages to be part of Europe's trade - even 40 percent of large companies, which have traditionally voted the most Europhile.
Finally, and this is probably the most, our survey of business leaders that a clear majority of Britain a course in the direction of change in the agreement and wants a relationship with the EU based on trade, not on politics.
This recognition for companies of all sizes and leading corporations, shows that the economy is on a "meaningful change" which the tiller will bring back to the UK.
There is a lot of - a change in the agreement and better conditions for the UK would be a change at 16 per cent in favour of remaining in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: This survey shows that the British economy behind his plan for the renegotiation of the UK's terms of EU membership.
It also shows that the company from a renegotiation of a significant shift in the balance of power back to Britain.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary after the euro zone is now in the direction of closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority should be jobs and growth in Britain, as the result of our survey shows what companies greater emphasis on trade and a fundamental change in approach to regulation.
