When the horse show experts in droves in Cardiff critical writings, in order to determine the horse of the year, they were aware that a rivalry was imminent.
But none was three years old Fenton Kirkland.
The kid, not even in the kindergarten and just a few months ago, made his first steps, and his Shetland-Pony toffee trotted off through the three rounds and lifted the first prize - and 30 adult opponents behind.
The inseparable pair, both, because of their appearance, behaviour and style at the annual competition, praised the Sunny Bank Equestrian Centre in Rudry, near Cardiff.
During his appearance in competition against men and women with elegant melons, he had his plate cap in a cheeky angle and introduced the two years old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was made by the jury for its natural skills in dealing with the pony hailed far beyond his age.
And toffee received top marks for his appearance and his personality.
Fenton had toffee last March as a gift for his third birthday and every day since then with the Shetland-Pony.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: "Fenton and toffee are a great team."
They had to compete against the entire race and Gold Cup and rose from the square.
It was only the second time that he took part in a competition with toffee, and we were all excited when he won.
Perfect strangers in the Arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, the horses for over ten years.
Howells said: "The whole audience was hooked and everyone cheered and applauded him."
He was running on sand, the entire length of the arena, and although he looked so tiny, he has done a fantastic job.
Fenton is crazy about animals - he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens, which he cares.
As it is launched, it will not be long before he is on the "horse of the year" -Schau - and I am sure he will do well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show said: "Fenton is only three, but he knows how he has to deal with his pony."
Together, they are a great team.
The jury considered Fenton and toffee according to how well they are beaten and in Vorf√ºhrring presents.
You look for good cooperation between pony and leaders - and Fenton and toffee are the best in the ring.
I am sure that Fentons sweet clothing has played its part, the perfect fit for the occasion.
