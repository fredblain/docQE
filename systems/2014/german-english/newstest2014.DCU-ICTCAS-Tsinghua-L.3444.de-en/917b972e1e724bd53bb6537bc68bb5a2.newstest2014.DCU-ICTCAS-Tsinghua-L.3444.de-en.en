George Kerevan: European unbundling gives the Scots the choice
It's a new day, a new horror story to independence.
This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the cue for stories about passport controls in Berwick and secured with barbed wire along the border of Hadrian's Wall.
In fact, in the Strathclyde-Vorlage pointed to the potential economic benefits, the greater freedom of movement in the rest of Europe, but it was - as expected - in the headlines.
Also, nobody has mentioned that the EU Member States often bent their strict rules, if it is cheaper for them.
As Scotland is currently not in the Schengen area, would be the continued disregard for Brussels only a small concession in return for what you really want from the Scots.
So, in fact, no story.
And one that has been so in the years to come is that it is already a fossil like: The first time I have the "independence means" -Ente passport controls at least 40 years.
This is an interesting point in the constant repetition of this ancient history.
Why should we expect from an independent Scotland that after the European pipe dances?
Why the London's yoke, against the trade from Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: The large, taken after the war plan for the unification of Europe is faltering.
With the euro crisis, the European project is officially dead.
Throughout the EU parties gaining ground, the EU-feindlich or the euro as a common currency would like to throw.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic party, Alternative for Germany, founded this year - nearly five million votes in the general election in September and effectively for the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has been local opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis is a turning point.
Because of the Berlin and the European Central Bank has imposed strict austerity measures in connection with the straitjacket in which the national economy by adhering to the single currency will be obliged, many people are of the opinion that the European project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with the fact that national governments can cause excessive budget deficits - this was only the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has pinned down its members on exchange rates, which are beneficial for German exporters - and the German politicians would like.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the local currency, southern Europe with a built-in productivity in part to Germany.
The only way is to cut wages and public spending - spurred on by Berlin.
Behind the current Etat- and currency problems lies a more profound European productivity problem.
As a result of the imposed by Brussels "green" energy directives - a code for the subsidy of French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer pays the European industry compared with the United States twice for electricity and four for gas.
This is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we have seen already in Grangemouth.
All wage system in the world to protect the European petrochemical industry, of cheap US shale gas to be pushed into a corner.
As a result, a revolt, especially in France, the former cheerleader of the EU.
After the war, the political elite of France saw the EU as a vehicle to Germany and Paris could stand on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin and Paris is no longer as a gateway to the political legitimacy and Europe has imposed its own economic policy, which the ailing French economy.
The result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, EU-feindlicher Front National has just won a decisive choice and the ruling Socialists at number three.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the votes - a timely warning for the British Labour Party, that they should not assume that a split on the right wing would automatically mean benefits for the left.
What makes Le Pen with their newly won popularity among the white working class people?
You would like to use the European elections next year, a Anti-EU-, Community currency bloc in the European Parliament.
If the opposition parties do well in these elections - and it is very possible, then, for the first time, the European Parliament is such a block.
This is the point I want to make: In the not too distant future, the growing resentment against the EU and the single currency is the abolition of the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will be something like the "Europe of sovereign nations," the General de Gaulle.
Germany and its satellite economies may keep the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect that Britain distanced himself from this project in the hope to curry favour with the US.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific that Britain alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where is Scotland in all this?
We can decide, a region of (ultimately) small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests - including, Berlin and Brussels to say what they are where hinstecken.
I suspect that Scotland could be a looser Europe go quite well, as long as we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries, is not in a federal Europe of Nations easier.
Otherwise, we should consider it Norway and keep our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is - remarkably - the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and has a spectacular majority in 2011 because of the rejection of the proposed (and won) cuts made to the Labour-Finanzminister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem-Koalition had to answer for.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland, is now to decide on independence, only to then from Berlin and Brussels imposed austerity.
