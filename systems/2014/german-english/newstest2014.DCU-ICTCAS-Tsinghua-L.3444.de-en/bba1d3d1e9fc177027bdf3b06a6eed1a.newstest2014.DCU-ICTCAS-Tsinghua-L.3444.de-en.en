CDC allergic to publish guidelines for schools
Published on Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is a set of guidelines for dealing with food allergies among children in schools.
These are the first such directives issued by the US Government, as the number of school-age children with food allergies is increasing.
One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy.
The prevalence of food allergies among children, according to the CDC, between 1997 and 2007 increased by 18 percent.
The guidelines include information for schools, the faculty and staff to raise awareness about food allergies and how to deal with children who are allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have Epinephrin stock - the injection of the brand EpiPen is most commonly used - a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
The legislators in the states have recently changed the rules, so that schools can keep stock Epinephrin easier.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms of children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say: "It feels as if something is on my tongue," "My tongue feels as if a hair is better," or "My tongue."
