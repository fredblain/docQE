The disposable society does not think
The night was long, the music was loud and the mood is good, but at some point, it is home.
Only: In the bellies of the people on the front and back, the hunger.
Clearly, this may be the one or other cocktail or champagne to be responsible.
What is more, when chilled to the nearest drive-in, in order to take a bite?
I admit that I am happy with it, if it is late at night or early in the morning to get fast food.
A couple of French fries and a Coke, Burger - and by home and go to bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry Disco-GÃ¤ngern.
Because what must be a constant regularity that its fast-food bags out of the car window?!
Especially at the weekends are discarded paper in urban areas and parking lots.
"Why?," I wonder.
The people are too stupid to the bags home or until the next bin?
It is not only that the paper stuff disfigured the landscape.
Bags have already covered transport facilities such as crash barriers and caused by accidents.
So what does the "disposable society" but not, presumably, they do not even know what the word means.
If you travel more often in the evenings, especially with several people in the car, you know, as a back seat after celebrating nights: Clothes, bottles and other rubbish are there.
There are a couple of bags, more or less, but nothing - in contrast to the street, where none of the other rumtrampeln pigswill.
I can see the day will come when the removal of the cities and municipalities to stupid - and the fast food chains for their bags must demand deposit.
