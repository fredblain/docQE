Post is hardly Sunday
"Many people will not have seen the red dots for Sunday Lee storage boxes are still in the suburbs and the city, but if you read the small print of the yellow containers of Post AG, it quickly became apparent that the collection on Sundays and public holidays, no longer takes place," shares the FDP.
A request from the German Free Democratic Party have confirmed this.
On Sundays and public holidays will just before the post office building in the Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and emptied Jakob-Müller-Straße 1 in huts field.
Whether in Hofheim and Rosengarten also emptied Sunday, will be the answer to the question of the FDP.
The social and political spokesman for the FDP, Fritz tubes Beck, wants to tackle them.
The Sunday Lee is an important post just in time delivery.
"These dünnt this enterprise, despite the price of letters on January 2013 radical and unreasonable."
Thomas Bittner, group and chairman of the Liberal Association, supports his colleague: "What annoys me is the fact that the Leerungszeiten surreptitiously changed or deleted."
The post is by people miles away.
"At least the ones in the districts of Neuschloß and rose again on Sunday to be emptied," Bittner and Beck unison.
But also for the suburbs, especially mobile citizens need a mailbox with Sunday Lee also within walking distance.
Tube Beck asked whether the council is also in talks with the post on this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the Post did not communicate with water.
However, there is also a Sunday in Hofheim Lee.
Her party has argued for privatisation.
"Then decisions will be taken elsewhere," said Maier.
