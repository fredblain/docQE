Vienna International Airport, passenger calls
Mr Max Maier, please come to gate.
Announcements like this in future, it will no longer be the perfect gift.
Most of the speakers are eliminated - the noise level should be significantly reduced.
To create a more relaxed atmosphere, the aim of this change.
As Airport-Sprecher Peter Kleemann announced on Radio Vienna, follows the Vienna International Airport with the recruitment of announcements that affect individuals, an international trend.
Already do so, among other things, the airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai on the raucous calls.
The removal of these announcements-sound in a day, on average, around 200 personal calls through the speakers - to quiet at the airport.
"It has also shown in the experience that these individual announcements were relatively little notice, but also all the other information on revised flight departure times rise or sink a bit here," says Kleemann in conversation with the radio station.
