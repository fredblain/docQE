Clive Palmer claims, Prime Minister Tony Abbott have conflict with parental leave
The billionaire and MP Clive Palmer says, Prime Minister Tony Abbott would be a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave, because his daughters pregnant and therefore could benefit from it.
The mining magnate, who is in a legal dispute over the payment of $6 million in carbon tax, challenged the assertion, as he was brushed aside questions about whether he is in conflict.
The Palmer United Party could be up to four votes in the Senate, which are important for the decision as to whether the carbon and mining taxes will be cut or eliminated.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers may have conflicts of interest and the daughters of Abbott personally would benefit from the legislation.
"It is located in a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because if one of his daughters pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether or not they will stay," said Palmer.
Two months after the election, the electoral commission said Palmer ahead with 53 votes after the recount the winner of the Sunshine-Coast-Sitzes of Fairfax.
Palmer called for a review of the process of counting to go faster.
Tony Abbotts daughters Frances and Bridget.
If these elections two months after the end of the vote?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why should we have a system in which you enter, the data into a computer, and then immediately is at 6: 30 p.m. the result?
Palmer also criticised the use of pencils with marking the ballot.
They are used, because then you can wipe out the results, if they do not?
With pencils to vote today is incredible.
The Electoral Commission has examined options for electronic voting and recently published a joint proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, explained that his policy of an international airport for the Sunshine Coast was one of his new office and that he "will take very seriously."
In a public post to the service to the public.
"We strive for no reward out of the story, which is that we are at a critical time for this community," he said.
