Court decision to block the NYPD Stop-and-Frisk-Richtlinie
A federal appeals court in the United States on Thursday blocked the formation of a judge, the changes to the Stop-and-Frisk-Programm ("stop and search") of the New York Police Department had demanded, and for the judge of the case.
The 2nd repercussions said that the decisions by Judge Shira Scheindlin would be suspended until an appeal is decided in the city.
The judge had ruled in August that the city goes against the Constitution with the way in which the programme for stopping and questioning people will be implemented.
The city appealed against their assessment and ordered remedial measures, including the decision to set up an observatory, which the police with the amendment of the directive and the corresponding training programme should support.
The Court of Appeal on Tuesday heard the arguments for the suspension.
The appeal report stated that the judge should be relieved of the case, because it violates the Code of Conduct for U.S. Judges, specifying that a judge should avoid the appearance of partisanship; this was, in part, with a series of media interviews and public statements, in which they publicly responded to the criticism of the Court.
The judge ruled that police officers had violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, because they were inappropriately targeted black and Latin American men with the Stop and Frisk program were targeted.
It has appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of key changes, including reforms to policies, training and supervision, and ordered a pilot programme with the body worn cameras in areas in which most of the checks were carried out.
In August, the city of New York, the practice of storing the names and addresses of people to quit, following an inspection by the police.
An oral hearing on the appeal is scheduled for March 14, 2014.
The Stop-and-Frisk-Taktik was made by a number of civil rights advocates criticized.
It is this type of inspection for decades in various forms, but increased the number of recorded controls during the term of the other independents Mayor Michael Bloomberg at an all-time high of 684.330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
In 2004 by four men, who were all minorities have complained that developed into a class action lawsuit.
Supporters of the changes say the NYPD Stop-and-Frisk-Programm, the changes will put an end to unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police and influence the way as other police chiefs of the ruling.
Opponents argue that the changes would dampen the morale of the police, but not the crime; it would also waste money and the wider problem of a police force is not resolved, after the loss of thousands of jobs in the last decade under pressure.
The judge pointed out that they do not finish the Stop-and-Frisk-Praxis, constitutional, but only the kind of implementation of controls by the NYPD reformiere.
