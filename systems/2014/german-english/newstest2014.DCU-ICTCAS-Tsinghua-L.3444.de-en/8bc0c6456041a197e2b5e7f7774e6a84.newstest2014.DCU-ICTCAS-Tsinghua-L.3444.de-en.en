Germany's biggest Church has launched an offensive to the profession of the pastor.
The background is a possible priest shortage: The Evangelisch-lutherische Church Hanover expects that the number of its roughly 1,800 Pastor and pastors current situation will halve by 2030.
For young people today is the profession is very attractive and offer good prospects, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in conversation with the press.
It is attractive, health and life itself.
With Burfien has the will, for the first time, a pastor at a full point, young people for the bookseller.
Currently, fewer and fewer young people decide after graduating from high school, to study theology.
Burfien leads back to the process of secularisation: "God's voice is quiet, the world is loud."
This is the work of great freedom and diversity.
I am Mr my calendar and my priorities, where it is important to me.
Pastors pastors may be close to the people.
They deserved as much as teachers and could live well.
In the free economy will certainly pay more, but for a secure employer theologians.
This brings the young people of today, which it is not just a career, but a meaningful work.
According to the Church, which includes three quarters of Lower Saxony, currently around 60 pastors per year in retirement.
At the same time, about 40 students begin studying theology of their God.
In sparsely populated and peripheral regions such as the resin, the Emsland or the Wendland could find it difficult to future openings.
Among other things, Burfien wants to hold study days for young people and also invite celebrities who have studied theology.
The bookseller offers a broad education.
You can even be president.
