A well-known criminal defender, a drugs baron with a major police investigation, because he was afraid his secret addiction could be revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat form, 42, disappeared under the world size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information on investigations into its activities in the drug trade, after looking through his own cocaine had been compromised.
The Kriminalisten as "first class" vaunted lawyer with the nickname "Bash" was arrested in his house in 2011, after the police had monitored Scarborough, which he represented in a previous drug procedures.
Officials observed how Scarborough (32) three bags of cocaine at the house of the lawyer in Blackburn, Lancashire, parenting, while this with colleagues during a meal at the Bar.
The investigation brought to light that form of class A drugs regularly consumed after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, his wallet and credit cards were found.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he attempted unauthorized information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of its partners.
All four suspects were from the police as part of a major corporation to Heroin- and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Along with 32 other people were later arrested after the police during a series of raids heroin and cocaine worth £1.5 million and £200,000 in cash.
Legally, 42, gave information to criminals, because he feared that his drug addiction cannot be known.
Today, filling in for the firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, at Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial on two counts of obstruction of justice found guilty and sentenced.
He admitted at an earlier hearing to cocaine possession.
The lawyer was convicted after the police in their investigations against Scarborough found that this in February 2011 in regular telephone contact with Turkey.
Two investigators followed the suspects and saw how he went to Dittas House and the drugs with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf glove in the dustbin of the lawyer.
Shortly after he had delivered the drugs, called Scarborough regularly with Turkey, at dinner in the football stadium of Blackburn Rovers in Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, took drugs and then nine messages exchanged between the two.
In court, it became known that form a regular consumer of cocaine, after tests of Class A drugs in his hair, his wallet and credit cards were discovered.
L was later arrested but denied to take cocaine, and said that he had spoken with the alleged dealer, because this was his client, and claimed that their discussion is governed by the "lawyer secret."
During his arrest form took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they have been secured and he was taken from a hair sample.
He was in the police interrogation, both in his home and in the workplace, an office and clients it at home because of legal issues.
In court, it was announced that the major players in the drug trade, some of which he had earlier called for significant arrests and had informed about what the investigators knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: "A criminal law should know better than anyone else that breaking the law."
Is this form of abuse of his position as defence lawyers accused, because he is too much with certain clients.
The relationship is not simply a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who supplied his lawyer with drugs.
Part of his communications was undoubtedly legitimate, because he was the lawyer for these people.
But that went far beyond the bounds of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He was the police investigations as far as possible, so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
Mr form brought his profession into disrepute.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he caused that his independence was compromised.
Wrote, any wrongdoing, and said: "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, then I would not wait for 15 hours, but do it right away."
But after the hearing, said superintendent Lee Halstead of the police in Lancashire: "Mr wrote, the step from a criminal to a criminal in the moment when he started to buy drugs from organised criminals."
His cocaine addiction led to a desperate compromise and made him susceptible to the motives of leading members of organised crime, which hired him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must uphold the highest standards of integrity and public trust and confidence.
L has betrayed that trust and tries to get behind the façade of his profession.
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigation against Turkey, in three cases to a conviction for possession of cocaine and obstructing justice, which underlines our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should serve as a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We will find you and bring you to justice.
Scarborough was sentenced to 14 years in prison on the conspiracy to heroin, cocaine and cannabis trade declared guilty.
Thirty-five others' people were involved in the drug trade to total penalties of 153 years sentence for drug offences.
Published on its website a collecting area with questions and answers about where he is, his dream job, as a lawyer for clients on death row in America, his ultimate guest at the dinner was Mohammed Ali and inequality is the motivation for his work.
