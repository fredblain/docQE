Has a valid long enough and waited at a red light at the intersection is free, he said, the lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "motorcycle."
But the wait must be "reasonable" from case to case, which could be interpreted in different ways.
Becker advised endure for at least five minutes before a malfunction of the traffic lights.
The trip continues despite Rotlichts, must be aware, however, that he is in favour of an accident caused by the full blame.
Those who are less than five minutes, may not be tolerated for long enough, warns Becker and refers to a decision of the Higher Regional Court of Hamm.
