Profit at Bombardier after decline in deliveries and orders to pay
The Canadian aircraft and train maker Bombardier Inc reported on Thursday a 15-prozentigen fall in net profit, after declining orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter, as well as contract problems in the railway sector was under pressure.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, no flight test data for its new CSeries aircraft and gave no new information about whether the plane, according to the ambitious timetable next September could go into commercial use.
On the maiden flight of the test aircraft from one and a half months followed so far, only three more launches what it seems questionable whether the trial as planned.
The results were behind the forecasts and led to a drop of more than eight percent of the Stock Exchange of Toronto.
Cameron Doerksen, analyst at National Bank Financial, on Thursday lowered its rating from "outperform" to "sector perform" in view of the fact that the stock in the next one or two quarters of a limited course potential.
"The weaker suppliers have been charged with aircraft as expected, but the margin development in the transport sector, we are clearly disappointed," Doerksen said in a client.
We believe that new orders for Bombardier CSeries, if the testing program for the plane.
However, if in the coming months will be announced no new orders, then we expect that the market will be sceptical about the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft the company can catapult into the lower segment, which is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test plane was presented to the public in March, after months of delays and flew for the first time in September.
But so far, binding orders for the CSeries with 177 moderate, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the test flights and want to see whether the claims of the company in terms of fuel efficiency and cost saving potential of the new jet transport aircraft is correct.
Currently, there are a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
CEO Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier his goal of 300 firm orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the jets will achieve.
The company said on Thursday with analysts and the media, the program is on schedule.
"The test aircraft remained on the ground is no longer than expected," said Beaudoin during a conference call and added, while the service life of the aircraft had been scheduled ground testing and software updates.
Each manufacturer is planning.
We have decided to take a first flight and then add a review period, which is what we have done.
This is happening during the entire flight programme.
The second of five test planes will be expected to start in the next few weeks, the remaining shortly afterwards, it was said by the company.
However, analysts remain sceptical about whether 12 months after the maiden flight of the first customer for the CSeries aircraft in operation.
Bombardier said that it check the planning for the operation (EIS) and will update this in the next few months.
"The slow progress of the flight test - even if they are obviously Bombardiers internal planning - reinforces our view that the commissioning of the first quarter of 2015 is shifting," Doerksen said.
