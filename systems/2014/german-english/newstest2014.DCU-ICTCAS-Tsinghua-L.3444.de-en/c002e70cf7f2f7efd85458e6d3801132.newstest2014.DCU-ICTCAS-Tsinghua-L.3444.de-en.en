Parents of sexual children can choose "gender undetermined."
Germany is the first European nation, in which a third gender is recognised for children who were born with ambiguous genitalia.
Newborn will no longer rigidly male or female.
Under the new law, parents have no sex more for those children, but "undecided" or "not fixed" on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to take the pressure from parents, so that they do not make any hasty decisions relating to operations for a gender assignment in newborns, and the people of sexual discrimination.
A internationell sexual person said, according to BBC years later: "I am neither man nor woman."
I remain the mess that has been created by doctors, mutilated and full of scars.
An estimated one in 2,000 children each year, either as a boy or a girl.
They belong to the sexual, a group that fall under the diagnosis "sexual differentiation disorder" (DSD), an umbrella term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testes) or unusually developed genital mutilation.
Wallis Simpson was perhaps the sexually.
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but the majority of experts in the United States, we should have the best available information on gender assignment if a provision is not possible, and not on the psychological and physical development of children wait before you - if at all - for an operation to decide.
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, on the issue of gender identification, said that the new German law "sounds like a good thing."
Inter sexual children are an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgical intervention, but for most children, this is not true," he said.
You can make a sex allocation without surgery and then wait and see how the identity of morality.
The scientific data on how a child's gender identity at all, are not very closely.
No one knows why it happens.
It is like the mystery of why people are gay.
In a report to the European Commission in 2011, it says, sexual people are transsexual or transgender people, because their status is not sex, but by their biological constitution, which is neither male nor female exclusively, but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them.
These properties were subordinate sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitalia or chromosome structure and hormones.
The report also gives an overview of the discrimination which inter sexual and transgender people face in the workplace and on the level of harassment, violence and prejudice crime.
Not with the Equality image matching boys now have a special camp.
It is now in Australia and Nepal for adults, on official documents male, female or "third gender."
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby (52), the world's first "loose" person after a court recognised the lifelong maintaining a "fixed" gender status was granted.
German cards alongside M and W will have a third assignment, X for sexually, the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France gender issues are still controversial, as a news story on France 24.
2011 signed dozens of French Members of the strict Catholic country a petition that the 'gender theory "should be removed from textbooks.
The Web site Catholic Online has also spoken against the German law, saying: "If the world is being dragged into a new state, where sex is a decision, but not sexual activity, then we twist two other pillars of civilisation."
The mother of a newborn in Maryland told baby zone, they think it would be better if babies at birth is assigned to one gender.
"The parents existence is already stressful enough without further restrictions, especially if you are not the sex of your child knows," she said of the parents.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, the children were with both male and female sex parts were born, known as Hermaphroditen, after the Greek god of both sexes.
Ten years ago, the medicine was the sex as something you could wipe out and then rebuild.
But in the meantime, the ethical foundations of an operation in doubt, now that we know how complex the gender identity, and that doctors can also be wrong, because they do not know how the child growing up with their assigned gender.
"In the middle of the twentieth century, called this a" psychiatric emergency, "said Drescher.
If such a child was born, then they called the psychiatrist, but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory about the treatment of children with ambiguous genitals is Dr. John Money from the Johns Hopkins University, which is considered the sex.
He coined the term "gender identity" and argued that social and environmental initiatives - such as the parents of a child educate-interacted with the genes and hormones and a child so as to whether a person is male or female.
But in the "John / Joan" case from 1966 his theories have been controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis was severed in a botched circumcision, to neuter the child and also to remove his testicles and then bring up as a girl.
"Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation, but he was not," said Drescher.
When the boy was about 15, he moved back to the male sex and married to a woman.
With 38 but he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who practice this model.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, are survivors of those sex operations to the public, "not happy with the result."
Such as Jim Bruce, a 36 year-old author from Montana, who was born with XY-m√§nnlichen chromosomes, but ambiguous genitalia.
The doctors were not made clear whether he has a large clitoris or had a small penis and were convinced that he could never be a "satisfactory life" as a man.
So its external body and shortly after birth the testicles surgically removed in 1976, and he was brought up as a girl.
At the age of 12, he was awarded female hormones.
"I knew that I am not a girl," he said on ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he should receive a vaginoplasty.
But because he was depressed and knew that something was wrong, he demanded his medical records.
What he found was shocking.
I was at my birth sterile - and nobody has ever said to me.
Bruce was born with a DSD, through his body not enough testosterone to the development of the genitals could produce.
After he had learned the truth, he moved back to the male identity, received Testosteron-Injektionen and was to remove his breasts.
The operation, he has become infertile.
Today, he is fighting for others in an organisation called Interface Project that inter sexual people perceived as normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, director of rights group based in California Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law "for stamping and encourage Basque."
"Many activists are worried that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and the child, not to" set, "she said.
We fear that favours intervention.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait and see.
But we still do not know how the law will impact, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that their organisation to support the Australian law, because "it allows adults recognition as a third sex."
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex to meet," she said.
The German law relates to the allocation of childbirth.
This is not a fight that small children should force at this time.
When they grow up, they themselves can decide on their bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast Radio login from Pitt, a daughter with a sexual differentiation disruption, and hundreds of others in a support group, says that the German law "authorize" both parents and children.
Baratz's daughter Katie, who was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete Androgenresistenz.
Because of the faulty receptor cells for testosterone Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and ovaries.
This is Katie 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as a researcher in child psychiatry.
While it is barren, hopes, however, through the adoption of a child or a surrogate mother.
"The law gives parents room, where they don't have to make decisions in haste," Baratz said.
It gives them the time, various tests and to clarify things and gives them time, before they "male" or "female" writing.
In this way, everything is in order, the child and loves it.
We have a wonderful baby and the parents.
And we must not rush to carry out an operation that can no longer be undone.
"That includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents are concerned, because they believe that they would not do the right thing," she explained.
Finally, the child decides on the sex, the more suitable for him - and this is wonderful.
This will enable children to take the decision itself.
