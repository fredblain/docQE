Obama's climbdown in health policy
After intense criticism, President Obama yesterday backed down in his oft-repeated, clear promises: "If you like your insurance, you can keep it."
After hundreds of thousands of their insurers have received a letter of resignation, Republicans cast the president in recent days that he had misled the American public.
Yesterday, Obama watered down his original promise.
"The vast majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance can keep it," he said in a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports about the dismissals Obama called for those Americans who have received such messages, on the open market for a new insurance.
The majority of citizens could be a better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than anticipated.
"You get a better offer," he said.
The government called it a little surprising that the five percent of the population, who themselves have an insurance, should look for another rate, since the Treaty does not meet the new standards after the Affordable Care Act.
"I would like to say directly to these Americans: You deserve better," Sebelius said at a hearing before the energy and Commerce Committee of the House of Representatives in Washington.
Sebelius, the burden for the implementation of the Act is responsible, said that the launch of the online platform since October "abysmal" pariah.
"I am as frustrated and angry as anyone else," she said.
I am determined to regain your trust.
This statement by an angry Sebelius to sit behind her counselor at yesterday's hearing in the House of Representatives after a dispute with the Republican legislators included Billy Long of Missouri, whether they be obliged to participate in blood.
After more than three hours hearing hassled Long Sebelius repeatedly with the question of why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act will not voluntarily renounced a state-sponsored insurance in order to have a tariff at HealthCare.gov, which it now wants to sell millions of Americans.
