New anti-nicotine vaccine could kill the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed a vaccine against nicotine, which could spoil the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine in mice could protect against a lifetime of smoking.
In tests on humans are still needed further trials, which can last for a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal from Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first results are good.
"We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to stop all methods available in the market have tried, but had discovered that their smoking is stronger than these approaches," said Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that was changed so that the genetic information on the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selective the liver cells, which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies hunting the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, causing a smoker no nicotine High.
In experiments were vaccinated mice that nicotine was administered to their normal level of activity.
Mice without vaccination, on the other hand, would have taken a break, "the researchers said, a sign that the nicotine their brains.
The experiments, described in the journal Science in translational medicine.
Former tobacco out of vaccines, because it contained antibodies.
The vaccinations for maintaining the Antik√∂rperpegels had to be given so often that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine are likely to be much lower because it transforms liver cells in antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, could be a future vaccine for people when he was quite sure children before they enter into temptation, to try a cigarette and tobacco addiction.
More likely, however, is that smokers would use it to stop.
"You know, if they start smoking again, they feel because of the nicotine vaccine, no fun anymore, and this helps them to the habit," he explained.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that further research is necessary.
