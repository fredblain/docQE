Promised land Rover Rally Series
The interior is race seats and six point belts and hands-free.
The options range from enhanced brakes, a service with care of Bowler-Works-Mechanikern and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, said: "The Rally customers who come to Bowler, have changed."
They are not all experienced cyclists, but people in search of excitement and adventure, as well as an achievable way to world class events.
We are pleased to take this path, in partnership with Land Rover and opening the MSA and believe that the format opens up new possibilities, the various Rally-Disziplinen in Britain and abroad and newcomers to the hardships and the reality of Rally Raid.
We had a really fun to develop the Defender Challenge car - it will be an entertaining game.
In addition, there are the Defender Challenge a training and test in February, as well as the option to desert race in North Africa and the Middle East.
