ESA decides on major space missions: Missions for billions
Distant planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that they want to start in the next few years.
30 proposals were available, five are still in the race.
Distant worlds.
More than 1,000 planets in other stars, astronomers have already been found.
Whether there is life on at least some of them, nobody knows.
The selection is difficult: Should we search for gravitational waves?
Or do you prefer to explore the origins of the cosmos?
Or search for Earth-like planets and perhaps discovering alien life?
These questions are the leaders of the European Space Agency (Esa.
For its program "Cosmic Vision" looking for ideas for two major space projects, the research is crucial.
The budget for such "L-Missionen" is about a billion euros.
The launch is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, met in Paris, the elite of the European space research, in order to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas were on the table, five of them are now in the final round.
Many bodies to examine the proposals, tick the researchers.
In the next few days, a final decision by the scientific program committee.
A total of four major issues has selected the Esa, to which the missions of the 2007 programme initiated "Cosmic Vision" to find answers.
What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life?
The exact processes in the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the formation of planets that orbit stars - are still in the proverbial dark.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star planet, under what circumstances can create life?
To investigate this question, the space telescope in 2017, "unlike" to start, with the 500 already known planetary systems in our area to be examined in detail.
But the opportunities are limited, Khufu is a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million.
With larger instruments astronomers could step planet and analyse the composition of their atmospheres and search for "biomarkers": Gases, as an indicator for biological activity.
How does the solar system?
This question is, ultimately, what conditions for the emergence of life.
Plays an important role in the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field and the particle radiation emanating from him with the star.
In our solar system are examples of these events.
The Solar Orbiter "the Esa is already a mission of the series (this is where the budget at around half a billion euros) for this question.
The probe is going to start in 2017 and finish and activity of the sun.
Of great interest to researchers are also Jupiter and its moons.
You want to find out what the role of the giant planet in the development of the solar system.
This is the Esa is the first of the three L-Missionen of "cosmic vision" programme.
The probe "juice" (Jupiter Icy moons Explorer) begins its journey to 2022.
Eight years later, she reached Jupiter and the atmosphere of the planet and the icy moons Europa and Ganymede, wiser.
What are the fundamental physical laws of the universe?
The space offers many opportunities to study the matter under extreme conditions and to investigate whether the laws we know there are still valid.
Perhaps the physicists, the path to a new theory could indicate that comprises all known laws of nature.
What is the universe and what is it?
In our universe 13.7 billion years from the Big Bang.
In addition to the daily material from which stars, planets and life as we are, there are dark matter, whose gravity holds galaxies and galaxy clusters, and dark energy, which is speeding up the expansion of the universe.
So far, the researchers do not know what physical laws in the first fractions of a valid from the Big Bang, nor what dark matter, dark energy.
With "Euclid," the Esa also has already approved a M-Mission, whose launch is scheduled for 2020.
With a special telescope to probe the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the whole sky, investigate and provide information on the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could make this race
Of the 30 proposals at the end of the selection process, only two remain.
The best chance of a Bewilligung as L-mission, according to many experts "E-Lisa," an ambitious concept for the detection of gravitational waves.
Physicists understand changes in the structure of space-time, the Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago.
It has not been proven.
Elisa could hope to achieve this, the scientists behind the project.
The mission is one of two or three probes existing detector, which is deployed in space.
It could, in contrast to sites around the world, evidence of gravitational waves, which are the Big Bang, and new insights into the origin of the cosmos.
Four other proposals still compete for the second L-mission: A large X-ray telescope named "Athena," which will explore, among other things, would investigate black holes, "Icy Planets," another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism," a mission to survey the cosmic radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder," the first step is to identify and investigate the planet.
Among other proposals are already resigned to Proben-RÃ¼cktransport from Mars, for the study of the moon, Venus and Earth and the solar physics.
