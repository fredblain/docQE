Anger over judgement for Bali bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people in the bombing in Bali in 2002 killed, were angry about the verdict for the last of the plotters, who was put on trial, because Umar Patek they believe state law should be shot.
Patek, nearly ten years as one of the most wanted people in South-East Asia, was yesterday for his role in the building of explosives for the bombing to a sentence of 20 years.
With suspended, he could be released after 15 years.
The 45 year old was found guilty of mass murder for the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, in which 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many more were injured.
There has also been a guilty verdict in a number of terrorism related charges, including a wave of bomb attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecution had asked for a life sentence, even if it is for the man who, because of his reputation as a master bomb maker - also known as "Demolition Man" to apply the death penalty.
The decision has sparked painful memories in June Corteen, a mother from Perth, the 39 year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in Patek and his Mitverschw√∂rern devastation caused nearly ten years ago.
Fighting back tears, she said, Patek could be sentenced to death.
I mean, he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
"It should be put before a firing squad," said Corteen to AAP.
I have to live with it every day, that I will have no further grandchildren and I will never see my daughters.
The Sari Club was razed to the ground, on 12 October 2002, shortly after 11 p.m., a powerful bomb exploded in a light truck, which was parked in front of the nightclub.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar, where only 20 seconds before a suicide bombers detonate a backpack filled with explosives.
After the attack, he fell into a coma for a month and "died" three times while he was on a life support system.
Hughes said that Patek, deserves the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell of Jemaah Islamiah-Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra, who were responsible for the massacre and executed four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty.
Let him alive - no, there is no reason to keep it alive.
20 years on, after he 202 people were killed and hundreds injured, is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali-Bomber, who was in court.
He is almost a decade of detention, but was finally in January 2011 in the Pakistani town of Abbottabad, where US forces nearly four months later, the former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden killed.
During the trial, an FBI agent said that intelligence reports had made the point that Patek was in Pakistan, in order to meet bin Laden with the aim of making the link between the Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
"He has not been asked," said Corteen.
Until recently, he has shown no remorse for it, how much pain he has caused to other people.
The ruling came before the 10th anniversary of the attack in this year, with commemorations in Bali and Australia.
"This year there will be many tears," said Corteen.
Patek can still appeal against his sentence.
