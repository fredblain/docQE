Ben Greenman: Ten years of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
You could say that New York City, the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: A hundred years ago began the weekend artist Frank Fay, as it was promoted at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, so that the amount directly jokes in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, the very innovation, as most recently at the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and directed by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the Stand-up-Institution Carol Ines, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year with over sixty shows in small clubs and theatres.
"Most of these headliner began with Carol Ines and were always successful, until they were known to be at some point, to act in a club," said Hirsch.
We have designed this festival, so that we can continue to work with them.
At this year's event, there are performances of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as of "Stand Up for Heroes," the annual music and Comedy-Benefizveranstaltung for army veterans at Madison Square Garden, among others, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
The festival is also the world of comedy.
A number of comedians who participate in the festival this year, with more unconventional ways, such as, for example, broadcasts on smaller television channels like Comedy Central and Spike, FX.
Nick Kroll was announced with a sitcom on cable TV (the ironisch-schl√ºpfrige fantasy football series "The League" on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny slate was both "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation" part of the occupation, even though they are best known for their viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On."
Both Kroll and slate and other young comedian with distinctive voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, ironic, focused on racial issues W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralised world of American comedy.
The visitors of the festival include an interview: David Steinberg speaks with Larry David.
Steinberg started as a stand-up comedian, but has become a respected television and film director, as well as an unofficial Comedy-Historiker develops.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a television program called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg, TV land."
The meeting will take place at Town Hall in Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the Comedy-DNA of Larry's entire work," said Steinberg.
He told me if he is here, he sometimes go through the alley between two buildings and think: Hey, if I lose all my money, then perhaps I live here.
