Gutach: More safety for pedestrians
You are not 100 yards apart: Tuesday is the new B 33-Fußgängerampel in Gutach at the village car park in operation - within sight of the old town hall.
Two installations so close to each other: Intention or folly?
This question has been answered clearly Gutachs mayor yesterday.
"The traffic lights have been installed at the time, because it makes the school," said Eckert yesterday.
The Kluser-Ampel secure both cyclists as well as account holders and the Bergle-Bewohner.
The official yesterday in plant is important for the intersection area Sulzbachweg / Kirch street.
We have the museum, two churches, the spa, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank and the flow from the residential area "Grub."
"During the high traffic and pedestrian safety had to come up with another set of traffic lights," says Eckert.
This is confirmed by Peter Arnold roll from Germany.
"According to current measurements through the B 33 around 12 000 vehicles in the municipality of Gutach, about ten percent of heavy traffic," said Arnold.
So is the construction of a new traffic light is more than necessary: "Security is simply," says Arnold.
A total of four traffic had been carried out at a roundabout was under consideration, but because of the narrowness of the intersection area Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße ignored.
It was, according to Arnold in the siting of the traffic light poles previously tested everything: "Using a specially for us with extra long Holzstämmen loaded trucks we have ever engaged in, whether these vehicles from the Sulzbachweg exit onto B 33 without the traffic light poles umzuknicken."
The approximately EUR 15 000 expensive traffic light itself is the "state of the art, which is currently on the market," explained Arnold.
The plant is equipped with coloured LEDs that shine so strongly that the lights of the car drivers, for example, when the sun is good.
And economically, it is also: The older lighting systems consume about 100 watts, the new just eight watts.
There are three lights per direction.
Arnold said the technology of the new facility is equipped with two radar sensors.
The traffic light pushes the button, tests the upper radar sensor the traffic.
The street is free, just green for pedestrians, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase for pedestrians.
"Should be a group or disabled people on the streets, the green phase, it is everyone safe on the road," said Arnold.
Of course, the drivers should be here as a partner and the road.
This was not the case yesterday: Hardly showed the green light for pedestrians, a kid doesn't get through - in bright red.
