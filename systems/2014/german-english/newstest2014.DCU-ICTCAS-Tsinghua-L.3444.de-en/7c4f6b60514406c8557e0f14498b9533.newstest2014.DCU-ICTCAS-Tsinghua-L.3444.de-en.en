She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Rubgy-Liga at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra with a request for assistance for his daughter.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney, the whole family is "extremely concerned" about the welfare of his daughter and wanted to have them back in Australia.
