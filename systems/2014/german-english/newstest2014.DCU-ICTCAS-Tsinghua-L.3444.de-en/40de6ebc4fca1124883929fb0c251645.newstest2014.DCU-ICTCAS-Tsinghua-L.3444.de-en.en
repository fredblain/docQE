Rescue package over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasman, health care
The Australian government insists on the harsh conditions of the rescue package over 325 million Australian dollars for the Tasmanian health, in order to ensure that the government of the state of the money is not wasted.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take "immediate measures" to avert a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic disease and system constraints had been caused.
The financing for a period of four years, after government consultations with Tasmanian independent MP Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has an emergency rescue package, which, in our view, the unique challenges faced by the state," said Plibersek today.
The 325-Millionen-Dollar-Paket covers 31 million dollars in emergency aid for services.
Another 2,600 operations, including orthopedic surgery and treatments for grey Star, residues should be eliminated.
In addition, there is money for days clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better follow-up care after inpatient stays, specialist in the field of mental health services, and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health information in local hospitals.
"These investments are in line with the ideas, the clinic staff have said that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system," said Tanya Plibersek.
The minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability of the Tasmanian government.
The state needs to maintain the current level of funding in order to obtain money from the Commonwealth, and monthly report on where the extra money has been spent.
A three-man commission will be set up and to ensure that the state of health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie said today the 325 million dollars would only make little difference if they are not accompanied by genuine reforms that the public Tasmanian health system on a more sustainable course. "
Nevertheless, he praised the government for having its request for urgent aid, which he first reacted to the Prime Minister expressed at the beginning of May.
"I am confident that the federal aid will make a major contribution to the public health care system of the state to the list," said Wilkie.

But the federal opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton, believes that today's announcement was just a "Band-Aid solution."
"We are in the current situation, because the laboratory-Staatsregierung 430 million dollars has withdrawn from the health care system," he said on ABC TV.
It is not acceptable that a state government almost half a billion dollars away from the system and the Commonwealth 300 million hinein and then act as if the good news.
Dutton Plibersek urged to ensure that not a single dollar of the rescue package will be spent on additional bureaucracy.
