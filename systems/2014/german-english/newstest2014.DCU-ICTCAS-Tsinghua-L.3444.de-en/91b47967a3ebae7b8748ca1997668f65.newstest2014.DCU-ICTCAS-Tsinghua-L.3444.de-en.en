FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices on planes (but no phone conversations) 
Passengers can now from departure to arrival their electronic devices to read, work, games, listening to music and watching movies, but not with the mobile phones, so the new directives on Thursday from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States.
But passengers should not expect that these changes will be implemented immediately.
How quickly they were implemented, the respective airline, FAA-Mitarbeiter Michael Huerta said at a press conference.
The airlines must demonstrate to the FAA that aircraft meet the new guidelines and training manuals for pilots and as well as the rules for the settling of the devices have updated according to the new rules.
The FAA said it had already received from some airlines plans, the use of portable electronic devices on planes to develop.
Under these airlines, including Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the state of the plan, we could have the expanded use of electronic devices allow very soon," the FAA in a statement.
Currently, passengers need to smartphones, tablets and other devices, when the doors are closed.
You may then start again, when the plane reaches a height of three kilometres and the captain has given the green light.
When entering the final approach, passengers need to disable them and they are not allowed to start again, before the plane landed.
According to the new guidelines could airlines whose aircraft against electronic malfunctions were secured to allow their passengers, the devices during take-off, landing and on the tarmac, the FAA said.
Most of the new commercial aircraft and other planes for the use of Wi-Fi in greater heights have been converted, should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of professional cabin crew, welcomed the changes.
"If the new regulation will be implemented - and in this regard, we are working closely together with the airline, will benefit both sides," said Glading.
We are tired of it, to be honest, we feel on this issue as a watchdog.
However, Internet surfing, exchange of e-mails, text messages or downloading data at three kilometres, explained the authority.
Passengers are asked to smartphones, tablets and other devices in flight mode.
Still no "Words With Friends," which recalls the Scrabble online game, the actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when he was a high profile of American Airlines jet had to leave because he refused to turn off the device, while the plane was parked at the gate.
And heavier equipment such as laptops must continue to be stowed, because there is a risk of injury if they are flying through the cabin.
Mobile phone calls during the flight is also still remain banned.
The regulatory competence for calls for the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not with the FAA.
FAA sets may ban on certain electronic devices during takeoff and landing on
Last month, said Mark Rosenker of the Transportation Security Administration National Transportation Safety Board, security expert for national transport on CBS News, mobile phones are still regarded as a risk.
"Mobile is really a problem, not only because they potentially could cause disruptions in GPS system, but because we know from the FCC that the transfer from the air also can interfere with radio masts," Rosenker.
The industry an Advisory Committee, which the FAA to investigate this issue was launched last month, recommended that the government to allow wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years has increased the pressure on the FAA, restrictions on its use.
Critics such as the Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri, take the view that there is no valid reasons for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult because the use of the devices has become ubiquitous.
In some studies, says that up to a third of the passengers of the closure of the unit forgotten or ignored.
The FAA began in 1966, the use of electronic devices by passengers, after reports of disturbances of navigation and communication devices of passengers UKW-Radios agencies had become known, at the time, the latest technology trends.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA that they represent anything electronic interference.
Airlines offer passengers for a number of years ago, when the ground is achieved.
The Wi-Fi systems adapted planes are also less susceptible to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft for the greater use of electronic devices will be suitable for the new directives, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices, in general, much less phone radiation than previous generations.
For example, only minimal radiation if umbl√§ttert.
However, when downloading or sending data transfer values.
Among the supporters of a loosening of restrictions on the use by passengers is Amazon.com.
2011 invited employee airliner full of Kindle rumours and made a test flight in order to identify problems, but could not say.
Members of the FAA-Beratungskomitees expressed mixed feelings about what the risk involved in the use of devices.
Douglas Kidd from the passenger Association National Association of Airline Passengers said he was of the view that the disruption of the equipment is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other committee members said that there were only scattered reports of pilots for a disruption of aircraft systems by the devices, and most of them are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA, the pilots to land in poor visibility conditions for instruments of the closure of units by the passengers.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes, describing it as a reasonable accommodation for travellers who extensively with technology today.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a passenger experience is not in contradiction with the security," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
