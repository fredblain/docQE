21 years, Georges Bwelle watched as his sick father repeatedly lost consciousness and went to hospitals that do not have the means at their disposal to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon, injured.
First, he had a broken arm, but then formed an inflammation, expanding on his brain and caused a hematoma, the impact for the rest of his life.
"There were no Neurochirurgen in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
We would have released him from Cameroon, if we had had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals, in order to get the treatment that they had to offer.
"It is not easy," said Bwelle.
At five o'clock in the morning, you can leave the house and run the hospital, in order to be the first, and it is not the first.
There are very many patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has scarcely changed since Bwelles father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organisation.
In contrast, the ratio in the United States with a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there were a doctor for them, most Cameroonians visiting.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three quarters of health spending in the country are private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," says Bwelle.
And the poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
His father, and so many of his countrymen are allowed to ripen Bwelle decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team last year 700 free operations carried out.
He was himself a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon in the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
In addition, he founded a nonprofit organization called ASCO Vime who travels on weekends in rural areas and free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers helped nearly 32,000 people.
He squeezed almost every Friday and up to 30 people in minibuses and proceed with the verschnürten medical equipment on the roof over unbefestigtes terrain in the villages that need help.
Everything is not always smooth.
More than once they had the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they will be welcomed as heroes: A banquet, singing and dancing and the best accommodation, the place has to offer.
In these villages is free medical care is really a cause for celebration and Bwelle - with its broad smile and his boundless energy - is the joyful celebration.
The next morning, the team starts with the investigation of hundreds of patients.
"We are dealing with 500 people per ride," Bwelle.
You come from a 60-kilometre radius around the village - and on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are due to malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crutches, donated glasses or free birth certificates - a document that is required for the school, but many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team simple operations with local anesthesia.
The operations are normally in a school, the town hall or an apartment; after the surgery, the patient and go in the relaxation area, in order to make room for the next.
The illumination of the OP and disinfection equipment is powered by the generator of the group and so Bwelle and its volunteers work until the early hours on Sunday.
It is a demanding job, but the village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated.
"They drum all night to stay awake and so that we can continue our work," says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team goes back into the city, tired, but proud of the work that has been done.
The group - a mix of Cameroonian doctors and medical students - in the past year has 700 free operations carried out and know that their work is an enormous difference for the people, which helps.
A man explained that the free operation of a ', which he received now allows him to return to work.
"The change the future of my family," said the man.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital at night Bwelle works in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job, he financed 60% of its charitable activities, Bwelle; the rest come from private donations.
"I really do not know when he sleeps," says Katie O'Malley, in the second year at Drexel University in Philadelphia studied medicine and voluntarily in Bwelles group.
He is always either in hospital or trying to raise money for the organization, so that he can go to these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students such as O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe and support Bwelle, this is an opportunity to gather practical experience that they would never get at home.
"We can be in operations, where we help blood abzutupfen or keep the tools for Dr. Bwelle," says O'Malley.
This would be in America as a medical student in the second year never possible.
The students typically pay for their trip to Cameroon and often donated medical material.
But they are only once in Yaoundé, Bwelle accommodation, transport and guide.
"He is without doubt a hero," says O'Malley.
He devotes his life to this organization and his desire to help the people of Cameroon, knows no bounds.
For Bwelle is the almost constant work, not a burden.
The other to a happier life, and in order to fulfil a promise that he has given to his father gives him great joy.
"I'm so happy if I make this work," says Bwelle.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I do.
I do it in order to bring people back to laugh and to relieve pain.
