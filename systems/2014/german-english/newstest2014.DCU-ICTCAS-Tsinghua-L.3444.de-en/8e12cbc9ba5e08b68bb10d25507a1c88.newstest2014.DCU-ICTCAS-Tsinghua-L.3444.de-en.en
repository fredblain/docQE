Tourism: Descent to the Romans
Around 120 metres from a sewer below is from the Roman era.
Cologne, who visited the cathedral is not over.
Some 157 metres, the two towers in the sky and make him the second highest building in Europe.
But only a few visitors who visit the two ornate church spires, knowing that it was also under the cathedral is a lot of things to discover.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in Cologne underworld.
Meeting point for his tours is the service Centre of Köln-Tourismus directly at the Cathedral.
The tour starts quite unspectacular: "We are in the garage," says Schulze.
In the 1970s, the city fathers wanted a car fair city, and therefore of the remains of the ancient city walls only, which is not too large.
Most users of the multi-storey car park today, therefore, come to the Roman ruins and represent only their car.
But if you take a closer look, discovered in the parking deck D2 separated by metal iron bars archeological site.
To see about five metres high ruins from simple stones.
"There are remains of Roman wall in the second half of the first century after Christ was built," says Schulze.
Before it goes back to light, Schulze participants on the upper level is still a glimpse into a dark, 15 metres deep shaft.
This is the fountain of the old cathedral, which unfortunately is scarcely noticed.
Next stop of the tour is the Prätorium, and here the participants get back down into the depths.
What we have here is the office of the once powerful man north of the Alps, of the CCAA Prätors.
What CCAA means a visitor would like to know.
"The acronym stands for" Colonia Claudia Ara Aggripinensium ', which in plain English as much as "town of Roman law and city of Agrippinenser, founded under Emperor Claudius in the place of the altar for the Emperor's cult" means. "
And the Prätorium is the former governors Palace, the power of the Roman empire on the Rhine.
From the foyer of the exhibition, a tunnel entrance to the Roman sewer, here at around 120 metres.
"You can calmly along the so-called Cloaca Maxima, if you want," encouraging Schulze guests.
A surprise, Schulze.
After he left the keys at the box office, the group he leads to a 16 meters deep, walk-in shaft.
"We are now in the mikvah, the ritual Jewish bath," he says.
The Jewish community built their bath deep in the soil, groundwater, which was essential for the ritual washing.
Up to now, the lower end of the mikvah, whose origins date back to the eighth century, different water levels by changing levels of the Rhine.
The mikvah is part of an archaeological zone on the Town Hall Square, for which the construction work would begin soon.
But until a few years.
