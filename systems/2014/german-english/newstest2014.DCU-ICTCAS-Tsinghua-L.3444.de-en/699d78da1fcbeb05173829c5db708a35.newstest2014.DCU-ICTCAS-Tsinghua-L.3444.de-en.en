The British government has announced a study that the benefits of increasing HS2-Eisenbahnprojekts for Scotland.
In the work of hs2 Ltd is proposed, with the start of Phase 1 in 2026 high-speed links between Scotland and the north of England.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said that the project "will be Great Britain closer together."
The Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown explained that he was very pleased with the British government to work on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands.
After the completion of Phase 2 will have connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of the construction of the high-speed road between London and the north of £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The British government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has commissioned hs2 Ltd, after further routes capacity and journey time improvements for northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of cash at the end of three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our aim for hs2 is a truly national network, the United Kingdom and its cities closer together."
We are proceeding with hs2, because there are huge advantages.
Without it, we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it is also about the link between 18 UK cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, thanks to hs2.
The Scottish Secretary Alistair Pepsi commented: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish Government asked Keith Brown Pepsi, "unequivocally" for the Scottish involvement in the HS2-Netzwerk.
Brown said: "The high speed rail link has the potential of enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but also the strength of Scotland an argument for fast rail links across the UK."
We are therefore pleased to be a partner of the British government to work and the options for a high speed rail link in Scotland to investigate the benefits for all and the Glasgow-Edinburgh added, which the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to the report with the British ministers in the next year to study and work together to decide on the next steps.
