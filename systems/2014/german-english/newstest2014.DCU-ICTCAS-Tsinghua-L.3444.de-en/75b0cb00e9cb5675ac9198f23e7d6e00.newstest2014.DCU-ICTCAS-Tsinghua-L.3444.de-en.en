The Council is targeting tracks
The railway crossing "Am Hirschen" expenditure, in order to improve road safety?
Yes, the local councillors have decided.
Schiltach must EUR 220 000.
Deutsche Bahn wants to improve the Kinzigtal-Bahnstrecke in the coming year.
In particular the safety at level crossings be increased - it is regularly nationwide to collisions between trains with other vehicles.
The transformed into communities, they have to deal with a third of the cost, and the rest are divided.
Schiltachs city architect Roland Grießhaber explained to the council the peculiarities of the Bahübergangs "Am Hirschen."
There is the city, in the amount of the tunnel mouth, west of the railway tracks to build a bulge.
There could also be more vehicles, for example, those who transported long timber at oncoming traffic, without having to block the tracks.
Grießhaber proposed, to construct a retaining wall so that the city of the subsequent street could expand at the appropriate time, in order to ensure a smooth traffic flow.
This was discussed in the council is controversial, since some councils need roads were spreading in doubt: Thomas tilt, saying the mood of the critics: "Because we have so few cars so much money?"
Mayor Thomas Haas disagreed: The railway crossing Hirschen will regularly used for long wood shipments.
Even wood from the area "Kuhbach" will be transported via this route, in part because the vehicles of up to 20 metres long the route could use the Häberlesbrücke not because they could not turn in the road.
In addition, the track served as a diversion for those vehicles which are not allowed to use the tunnel, if the road is blocked, Haas.
As expected, that church and castle mountain tunnel rebuilt and refurbished, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the railway crossing "Am Hirschen for a longer period is an important traffic significance.
The Council agreed to investigate the costs of the proposed expansion of the street.
Despite this, the reconstruction of the railway crossing largely agreed with the proviso that the retaining wall will be built in such a way that the city of the subsequent road "Bahnhofstrasse" possibly for meeting traffic at around 5.5 m building.
The railway crossing in the tanning Trautwein, on the other hand, could be a quite different problem, which the access in the rising "Geroltzhäuser way '.
The administration had the restructuring plans of the railway from the engineering study Breinlinger, because they had doubts about whether the planned end of Geroltzhäuser route will still be possible without further ado.
The study concluded that cannot be ruled out that the conditions of the road could lead to longer vehicles.
The responsibility for carrying the city as a road last winner.
Therefore, could the restructuring liability disputes.
Since both the collection and the turning in the current state of development should be worked, the reconstruction of the railway crossing, Henman argued.
Also at this point is the risk of a collision with a car on the transition are significantly lower than in the other rail crossings, because the next stop in the middle, a good sight.
Even trains from the main railway station, this would have to be slowed down so far that there is no danger of a collision.
Mostly, the reconstruction of this railway crossing denied the agreement, since the city Schiltach, the problem with aufsitzenden vehicles "should suffer the consequences," according to the councils, as the train after the completion of the construction could withdraw from the responsibility.
The body is seen as the changes on the level crossings "Before running" and "Before Kuhbach," for the intersection of agreements with the train.
